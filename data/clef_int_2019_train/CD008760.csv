CD008760,0,21274889,0,Noninvasive assessment of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis.,"Severe portal hypertension is responsible for complications and death. Although measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient is the most accurate method for evaluating the presence and severity of portal hypertension, this technique is considered invasive and is not routinely performed in all centers. Several noninvasive techniques have been proposed to measure portal hypertension. Certain methods evaluate elements related to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension through the measurement of hyperkinetic syndrome, for example, or they investigate the development of hepatic fibrosis through the measurement of increased intrahepatic vascular resistance. Other methods evaluate the clinical consequences of portal hypertension, such as the presence of esophageal varices or the development of portosystemic shunts. Methods evaluating increased hepatic vascular resistance are fairly accurate and mainly involve the detection of hepatic fibrosis by serum markers and transient elastography. The radiological assessment of hyperkinetic syndrome probably has value but is still under investigation. The assessment of severe portal hypertension by the presence of varices may be performed with simple tools such as biological assays, computed tomography, and esophageal capsules. More sophisticated procedures seem promising but are still under development. Screening tools for large populations must be simple, whereas more complicated procedures could help in the follow-up of already diagnosed patients. Although most of these noninvasive methods effectively identify severe portal hypertension, methods for diagnosing moderate portal hypertension need to be developed; this shows that further investigation is needed in this field."

CD008760,0,18636658,0,The future of wireless capsule endoscopy.,"We outline probable and possible developments with wireless capsule endoscopy. It seems likely that capsule endoscopy will become increasingly effective in diagnostic gastrointestinal endoscopy. This will be attractive to patients especially for cancer or varices detection because capsule endoscopy is painless and is likely to have a higher take up rate compared to conventional colonoscopy and gastroscopy. Double imager capsules with increased frame rates have been used to image the esophagus for Barrett's and esophageal varices. The image quality is not bad but needs to be improved if it is to become a realistic substitute for flexible upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. An increase in the frame rate, angle of view, depth of field, image numbers, duration of the procedure and improvements in illumination seem likely. Colonic, esophageal and gastric capsules will improve in quality, eroding the supremacy of flexible endoscopy, and become embedded into screening programs. Therapeutic capsules will emerge with brushing, cytology, fluid aspiration, biopsy and drug delivery capabilities. Electrocautery may also become possible. Diagnostic capsules will integrate physiological measurements with imaging and optical biopsy, and immunologic cancer recognition. Remote control movement will improve with the use of magnets and/or electrostimulation and perhaps electromechanical methods. External wireless commands will influence capsule diagnosis and therapy and will increasingly entail the use of real-time imaging. However, it should be noted that speculations about the future of technology in any detail are almost always wrong."
CD008760,0,18790438,0,Endoscopic haemostasis.,"Endoscopic haemostasis should be attempted as the initial approach in most cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, although cross-disciplinary collaboration is a prerequisite. For variceal bleeding, band ligation is the method of choice in the elective setting, although injection therapy still has a role in acute bleeding. Histoacryl remains preferable for fundic varices in most parts of the world. For peptic ulcer bleeds, injection therapy should be combined with at least one 'mechanical' modality, thermal treatment or clipping. In rebleeding, a single endoscopic retreatment can be attempted, but alternative approaches must be considered. Acute lower GI bleeding is primarily a diagnostic challenge but, if the focus is found, the regular techniques for haemostasis can usually be applied. If small bowel haemorrhage is suspected after upper and lower endoscopy, capsule endoscopy and balloon enteroscopy offer make it possible to address even small bowel foci."
CD008760,0,18082473,1,Study comparing oesophageal capsule endoscopy versus EGD in the detection of varices.,Endoscopic screening and surveillance of cirrhotic patients for oesophageal varices is advocated before initiation of prophylactic therapy for prevention of the first variceal haemorrhage.
CD008760,0,18058656,1,Esophageal capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected esophageal disease: double blinded comparison with esophagogastroduodenoscopy and assessment of interobserver variability.,The study aim was to compare the diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in patients with suspected esophageal disease. Secondary aims were to assess interobserver variability of capsule endoscopy readings and safety.

CD008760,0,18478132,0,Capsule endoscopy in the investigation of patients with portal hypertension and anemia.,"Data on small bowel abnormalities in patients with portal hypertension (PHT) are limited. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract and anemia are common complications in these patients. Capsule endoscopy (CE) was used to evaluate small bowel (SB) pathology in patients with PHT and anemia, and possible associations with various parameters were examined."

The objective of the study is to better define the mucosal abnormalities of portal hypertensive enteropathy (PHE) and to determine whether these findings are associated with the severity of liver disease, esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, portal colonopathy, or other clinical characteristics."
CD008760,0,18227890,0,[New applications of capsule endoscopy: PILLCAMTM ESO].,"Capsule endoscopy has opened a new era in small bowel examination. Its indications are now well-defined and currently, wireless capsule endoscopy is considered as the first-line imaging tool for the diagnosis of small bowel diseases. ECE has been shown to be feasible, safe and a good alternative technique in patients refusing conventional endoscopy. Although results reported in both GERD and cirrhotic patients are encouraging, great differences in terms of accuracy (particularly in GERD patients) have been found in published studies. These differences have been attributed to study designs, the lack of adequate experience and inconvenience of ingestion protocols. In summary, more large-scale studies evaluating the new 14-fps capsule, adequate ECE-experience and new modified ingestion protocols are still needed."
CD008760,0,18790434,0,Capsule endoscopy: technique and indications.,"Since it was introduced in 2000, capsule endoscopy has become the gold standard for endoscopic examination of the small bowel in several clinical situations such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, suspicion of Crohn's disease, and surveillance of polyposis syndromes. In this technique a miniaturised endoscope, embedded in a swallowable capsule, is propelled through the gut by peristalsis and reaches the right colon in 5-8h. Images captured by the capsule are recorded on a hard drive in a belt worn by the patient. In addition to the extensive literature currently available on small bowel CE, new capsule devices are currently under evaluation for the examination of the colon with the purpose of screening for colorectal cancer, and of the oesophagus for screening for oesophageal varices and Barrett's oesophagus. These latter indications currently remain under evaluation. This review considers the technical aspects of capsule endoscopy and discusses the indications. Issues of safety and tolerance are also discussed."
CD008760,0,22346246,0,Update of endoscopy in liver disease: more than just treating varices.,"The management of complications in liver disease is often complex and challenging. Endoscopy has undergone a period of rapid expansion with numerous novel and specialized endoscopic modalities that are of increasing value in the investigation and management of the patient with liver disease. In this review, relevant literature search and expert opinions have been used to provide a brief overview and update of the current endoscopic management of patients with liver disease and portal hypertension. The main areas covered are safety of endoscopy in patients with liver disease, the use of standard endoscopy for the treatment of varices and the role of new endoscopic modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound, esophageal capsule, argon plasma coagulation, spyglass and endomicroscopy in the investigation and treatment of liver-related gastrointestinal and biliary pathology. It is clear that the role of the endoscopy in liver disease is well beyond that of just treating varices. As the technology in endoscopy expands, so does the role of the endoscopist in liver disease."

CD008760,0,18785275,0,Esophageal capsule endoscopy.,"Capsule endoscopy is now considered as the first imaging tool for small bowel examination. Recently, new capsule endoscopy applications have been developed, such as esophageal capsule endoscopy and colon capsule endoscopy. Esophageal capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected esophageal disorders is feasible and safe, and could be also an alternative procedure in those patients refusing upper endoscopy. Although large-scale studies are needed to confirm its utility in GERD and cirrhotic patients, current results are encouraging and open a new era in esophageal examination."
CD008760,0,22379346,0,Jejunal variceal bleeding successfully treated with percutaneous coil embolization.,"A 52-yr-old male with alcoholic liver cirrhosis was hospitalized for hematochezia. He had undergone small-bowel resection due to trauma 15 yr previously. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed grade 1 esophageal varices without bleeding. No bleeding lesion was seen on colonoscopy, but capsule endoscopy showed suspicious bleeding from angiodysplasia in the small bowel. After 2 weeks of conservative treatment, the hematochezia stopped. However, 1 week later, the patient was re-admitted with hematochezia and a hemoglobin level of 5.5 g/dL. Capsule endoscopy was performed again and showed active bleeding in the mid-jejunum. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a varix in the jejunal branch of the superior mesenteric vein. A direct portogram performed via the transhepatic route showed portosystemic collaterals at the distal jejunum. The patient underwent coil embolization of the superior mesenteric vein just above the portosystemic collaterals and was subsequently discharged without re-bleeding. At 8 months after discharge, his condition has remained stable, without further bleeding episodes."
CD008760,0,18706733,0,Non-invasive (and minimally invasive) diagnosis of oesophageal varices.,"Current guidelines recommend screening all cirrhotic patients by endoscopy, to identify patients at risk of bleeding who should undergo prophylactic treatment. However, since the prevalence of varices in cirrhotic patients is variable, universal screening would imply a large number of unnecessary endoscopies and a heavy burden for endoscopy units. In addition, compliance to screening programs may be hampered by the perceived unpleasantness of endoscopy. Predicting the presence of oesophageal varices by non-invasive means might increase compliance and would permit to restrict the performance of endoscopy to those patients with a high probability of having varices. Over the years, several studies have addressed this issue by assessing the potential of biochemical, clinical and ultrasound parameters, transient elastography, CT scanning and video capsule endoscopy. The platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, CT scanning and video capsule endoscopy have shown promising performance characteristics, although none of them is equivalent to EGD. These methods are perceived by patients as preferable to endoscopy and thus might increase adherence to screening programs. Whether this will compensate for the lower sensitivity of these alternative techniques, and ultimately improve the outcomes if more patients undergo screening, is the crucial question that will have to be answered in the future."
CD008760,0,17912188,0,Capsule endoscopy: a comprehensive review.,"The development of wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) has been a significant technologic advancement for the non-invasive visual evaluation of the entire small bowel and esophagus. The capsule endoscope is disposable and measures 11 x 26 mm. There are two capsule endoscopes currently available: PillCam ESO and PillCam SB for the evaluation of the esophagus and the small bowel, respectively. The PillCam ESO has two cameras on each end and captures images 7 frames per second per each camera, while the PillCam SB has one camera and captures images at a rate of 2 frames per second. Both capsule endoscopes transmit the image data using a radiofrequency signal to a recording device worn on the patient's waist. Once image acquisition is completed, the data from the recording device is downloaded to a computer workstation and analyzed by a gastroenterologist. Common indications for the small bowel CE include obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), suspected Crohn disease (CD), as well as other suspected small bowel pathologies, while indications for the esophageal CE include screening of Barrett esophagus and esophageal varices. Small bowel CE appears to be more sensitive in the evaluation of OGIB and small bowel CD compared with other conventional radiological and endoscopic modalities. Preliminary results for the esophageal CE reveal good accuracy for screening of both Barrett and esophageal varices. CE is well tolerated by most patients, requires no sedation, and carries few side effects. One of the complications of CE is capsule retention; however, a patency capsule system has been developed, which can indicate whether an obstructing lesion is present before CE is performed. Finally, there are preliminary data suggesting that a new capsule endoscope for the colon may be useful in the evaluation of patients for colon polyps and possibly, screening for colon cancer."
CD008760,0,16053016,0,[Octreotide in the treatment of angiodysplasia in patients with advanced chronic renal failure].,"Angiodysplasia is an important cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with chronic renal failure. Octreotide, a long-acting synthetic somatostatin analogue that reduces splachnic blood flow have been used to treat esophageal varicose hemorrhage, but its efficacy for bleeding vascular ecstasies is awaiting support. We present three patients with chronic renal failure (two with diabetic nephropaty and the third with mesangiocapilar glomerulonephritis and hepatic cirrosis), seric creatinine 3-4,5 mg/dl, and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to diffuse angiodysplasia and vascular ecstasies, diagnosed by oral endoscopy, colonoscopy and video capsule. They all were treated with octreotide, administered subcutanesly 0.1 mg twice a day for six months, with significantly decreased blood requirements in all of them, as well as the occurrence of bleeding episodes. It was well tolerated and none side-effects occurred in any subject. In our experience, octreotide is an effective and safe drug in bleeding angiodysplasia and ecstasies vascular of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with chronic renal failure, and it may be a good option especially in patients who are not candidates for surgery or endoscopic treatment due to inaccessible sites, spread of the lesion, old age and/or concomitant disorders."
CD008760,0,20490679,1,Defining the threshold: new data on the ability of capsule endoscopy to discriminate the size of esophageal varices.,"Endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD) to screen for esophageal varices (EV) is recommended in patients with portal hypertension. Reports indicate that capsule endoscopy (CE) is capable of identifying large/medium varices (L/MV) when the varix comprises more than 25% of the circumference of the field of view."
CD008760,0,20135731,0,Meta-analysis of capsule endoscopy in patients diagnosed or suspected with esophageal varices.,"The PillCam ESO (Given Imaging, Israel) or esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) is a novel technique used in the diagnostic evaluation of esophagus. Many studies have been performed to compare the accuracy of ECE against the current gold standard esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and a meta-analysis recently published by Lu et al suggests that ECE may have an acceptable sensitivity and specificity in detecting esophageal varices. We would like to discuss the importance and implication of publication bias in this meta-analysis."
CD008760,0,23593613,0,A case of variceal bleeding from the jejunum in liver cirrhosis.,"While esophagogastric varices are common manifestations of portal hypertension, variceal bleeding from the jejunum is a rare complication of liver cirrhosis. In addition, ectopic variceal bleeding occurs in the duodenum and at sites of previous bowel surgery in most cases, including of stomas. We report a case of obscure overt gastrointestinal bleeding from jejunal varices in a 55-year-old woman who had not previously undergone abdominal surgery, who had liver cirrhosis induced by the hepatitis C virus. Emergency endoscopy revealed the presence of esophageal varices without stigmata of recent bleeding, and no bleeding focus was found at colonoscopy. She continued to produce recurrent melena with hematochezia and received up to 21 units of packed red blood cells. CT angiography revealed the presence of jejunal varices, but no active bleeding was found. Capsule endoscopy revealed fresh blood in the jejunum. The patient submitted to embolization of the jejunal varices via the portal vein, after which she had a stable hemoglobin level and no recurrence of the melena. This is a case of variceal bleeding from the jejunum in a liver cirrhosis patient without a prior history of abdominal surgery."
CD008760,0,21372764,0,Capsule endoscopy with PILLCAM ESO for detecting esophageal varices: a meta-analysis.,The aim of the present study was to perform meta-analysis of studies that compare diagnostic capabilities of esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) against conventional esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) in detecting esophageal varices.
CD008760,0,18360329,0,Capsule endoscopy: a review.,"Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a novel technology that allows direct noninvasive visualization of the entire small intestine. CE permits a detailed examination in the ambulatory setting, allowing identification of clinically relevant lesions, and it is appealing to both patients and providers. There are two types of capsules that are currently commercially available: one specifically designed to view the small bowel and the other for the esophagus. Common indications for small bowel CE include obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, initial diagnosis of suspected Crohn's disease, and other small bowel pathology. The esophageal capsule is currently used to evaluate Barrett esophagus and esophageal varices. It is a well-tolerated procedure with relatively few complications. Although CE performance may be superior to existing technologies, its impact on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes are of even greater importance. Herein lies a review of the latest information on CE, its indications, complications, future utilities, and developing technology."
CD008760,0,16894311,0,Esophageal capsule endoscopy in patients refusing conventional endoscopy for the study of suspected esophageal pathology.,"Esophageal capsule endoscopy is a well tolerated procedure that does not require sedation and has proved its value for the study of the esophagus. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility, accuracy, safety and acceptability of esophageal capsule endoscopy for the study of gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal varices in patients who refused conventional upper gastrointestinal endoscopy."
CD008760,0,19661814,0,PillCam ESO versus esophagogastroduodenoscopy in esophageal variceal screening: A decision analysis.,"PillCam ESO has been evaluated as a possible strategy to screen patients with cirrhosis for esophageal varices, but current guidelines recommend patients undergo screening with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), as it is currently the gold standard. Although recent data have suggested that PillCam ESO may be an acceptable alternative for screening, there is limited data on its cost-effectiveness compared with other screening modalities. This study was performed to compare the cost-effectiveness of PillCam ESO versus EGD for esophageal variceal screening."
CD008760,0,19191853,0,"A study comparing tolerability, satisfaction and acceptance of three different techniques for esophageal endoscopy: sedated conventional, unsedated peroral ultra thin, and esophageal capsule.","Three methods of esophagoscopy are available until now: sedated conventional endoscopy, unsedated ultrathin endoscopy, and esophageal capsule endoscopy. The three methods carry comparable diagnostic accuracy and different complication rates. Although all of them have been found well accepted from patients, no comparative study comprising the three techniques has been published. The aim of this study was to compare the three methods of esophagoscopy regarding tolerability, satisfaction, and acceptance. Twenty patients with large esophageal varices and 10 with gastroesophageal reflux disease were prospectively included. All patients underwent consecutively sedated conventional endoscopy, unsedated ultrathin endoscopy, and esophageal capsule endoscopy. After each procedure, patients completed a seven-item questionnaire. The total positive attitude of patients toward all methods was high. However, statistical analysis revealed the following differences in favor of esophageal capsule endoscopy: (i) total positive attitude has been found higher (chi(2)= 18.2, df = 2, P= 0.00), (ii) less patients felt pain (chi(2)= 6.9, df = 2, P= 0.03) and discomfort (chi(2)= 22.1, df = 2, P= 0.00), (iii) less patients experienced difficulty (chi(2)= 13.7, df = 2, P= 0.01), and (iv) more patients were willing to undergo esophageal capsule endoscopy in the future (chi(2)= 12.1, df = 2, P= 0.002). Esophageal capsule endoscopy was characterized by a more positive general attitude and caused less pain and discomfort. Sedated conventional endoscopy has been found more difficult. More patients would repeat esophageal capsule endoscopy in the future. Patients' total position for all three available techniques for esophageal endoscopy was excellent and renders the observed advantage of esophageal capsule endoscopy over both sedated conventional and unsedated ultrathin endoscopy a statistical finding without a real clinical benefit."
CD008760,0,19568182,0,Capsule endoscopy of the esophagus.,"Video capsule endoscopy has acquired wide clinical acceptance since its the US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2001. Recently, the technology of video capsule endoscopy has been adapted to other organs in the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus and colon. In this review, we discuss esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE)-the procedure, its indications, contraindications, safety, and future applications. ECE is a minimally invasive procedure that uses special video capsules with ability to acquire images from 2 cameras with high image storing speed of 14 to 18 frames per second. A special ingestion procedure allows for prolonged esophageal transit time and an optimized view of the gastroesophageal junction. ECE has been shown to have moderately high sensitivity and accuracy in the diagnosis and surveillance of Barrett esophagus in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease but has not demonstrated superiority to esogastroduodenoscopy in cost-effectiveness models. In patients with portal hypertension, ECE has a sensitivity of 63% to 100% for screening of esophageal varices, but does not seem to be superior to esogastroduodenoscopy in its cost-effectiveness. No serious complications have been reported after ECE although a low rate of esophageal capsule retention (0.7% to 2.2%) has been reported, usually because of unsuspected esophageal strictures. Contraindications to capsule endoscopy include known or suspected gastrointestinal and esophageal obstruction, strictures, or fistulas, intestinal pseudoobstruction, and children under 10 years of age. It is expected that improvements in imaging technology will improve the accuracy of ECE with the development of immunological-based and chemical-based diagnostic capabilities."
CD008760,0,17827950,0,Capsule endoscopy--state of the art.,"Capsule endoscopy is a new technology that was recently introduced into clinical practice for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. As of today, three different capsule types have been produced, designed for the exploration of the small bowel (PillCam SB), the esophagus (PillCam ESO) and the colon (PillCam Colon). The PillCam SB has gained widespread acceptance as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of bleeding from the small bowel as well as for other indications. The PillCam ESO has been used to study patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, for the screening of Barrett's esophagus, and for the screening and surveillance of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. The results of the pilot studies carried out with this capsule have been encouraging. Large-scale studies are ongoing. The evaluation of the potential of the PillCam Colon capsule is still in its infancy: the two pilot studies published showed that this capsule can produce high-quality images of the colon. The potential of this capsule for clinical purposes, such as colon cancer screening, needs to be evaluated."
CD008760,0,19646642,0,Gastrointestinal bleeding in the cancer patient.,Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common occurrence in patients with cancer and is a frequent indicator of a gastrointestinal malignancy. Rapid evaluation and treatment is key for the hemodynamically unstable patient. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone of diagnosis and management for cancer patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. The emergency physician should also be aware of other diagnostic and treatment modalities that may be needed to take care of these patients.
CD008760,0,22155754,1,Capsule endoscopy is not as accurate as esophagogastroduodenoscopy in screening cirrhotic patients for varices.,Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the standard technique for screening cirrhotic patients for high-risk varices and other significant upper gastrointestinal lesions (HRVLs). We investigated whether esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) is as convenient and accurate as EGD for the detection of HRVLs.
CD008760,0,16644462,0,The economics of PillCam.,"Evaluation of the economics of PillCam technology is in its infancy. Most studies of the use of the PillCam, both small bowel and esophageal, have focused only on the capsules' diagnostic characteristics. Although the results have compared favorably with other more invasive and sometimes less accurate modalities, the true cost effectiveness of PillCam is not yet fully known. The few cost-effectiveness assessments performed suggest that PillCam compares favorably with traditional diagnostic methods in Crohn's disease and in screening for complications of GERD and for esophageal varices. The data included in these models are quite limited, however. Sensitivity analyses can permit assessment of a wide range of possibilities regarding cost and diagnostic efficacy. Still, these models need to be anchored by robust and reproducible data input. Large-scale studies with long-term follow-up are needed. Capture of both direct and indirect medical costs accrued by using PillCam or other diagnostic tests in these studies will permit more robust economic analyses. As data accrue,they may give clinicians more confidence that PillCam use will realize economic savings and improve patient outcomes."
CD008760,0,18294933,0,Diagnosis and monitoring of portal hypertension.,"Currently, oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy is the standard method to diagnose the presence of oesophago-gastric varices and to estimate the risk of bleeding. It is recommended that all patients undergo endoscopic screening for varices at the time when cirrhosis is diagnosed. After screening endoscopy, patients with medium or large varices should be treated to prevent bleeding, while all other patients should undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy. However, at a given point in time a variable proportion of patients will not have varices, since the prevalence of varices is variable. Thus, screening all cirrhotic patients with endoscopy to detect the presence of varices implies a number of unnecessary endoscopies. In recent years a wealth of new methods have been proposed as alternatives to conventional oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy for the non-invasive or minimally invasive diagnosis of oesophageal varices. Three of these methods (the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, Fibrotest and Fibroscan) are truly non-invasive. Of these, the former is promising and needs a proper validation, Fibrotest appears to be insufficiently precise, while Fibroscan needs further evaluation. Multidetector CT oesophagography and capsule endoscopy are not entirely ""non-invasive"", since the first requires air insufflation into the oesophagus via an orally passed tube, and the latter requires swallowing the capsule. Multidetector CT oesophagography is promising, but needs further evaluation; capsule endoscopy is safe and reliable and might be proposed as an alternative to oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy in patients unable or unwilling to undergo oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy."
CD008760,0,20363433,1,Small-bowel lesions caused by portal hypertension of schistosomal origin: a capsule endoscopy pilot study.,Schistosomiasis is a highly prevalent disease. It can evolve to its hepatosplenic form in up to 10% of the cases. The small-bowel lesions developed during the hepatosplenic stage of the disease have not been described in vivo.
CD008760,0,16429352,1,The accuracy of PillCam ESO capsule endoscopy versus conventional upper endoscopy for the diagnosis of esophageal varices: a prospective three-center pilot study.,"Variceal bleeding is a major complication of cirrhosis, and is associated with a 20 % mortality at 6 weeks. Current international guidelines recommend that patients with cirrhosis are screened by conventional upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD) in order to detect esophageal varices. The recently developed PillCam ESO esophageal capsule endoscope has been shown to be an accurate diagnostic tool in the investigation of patients with gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett's esophagus. We compared the PillCam ESO capsule endoscope with EGD for the detection of esophagogastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with cirrhosis."
CD008760,0,16435503,0,[Non-invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Application to the primary prevention of varices].,"One of the major complications of cirrhosis is the occurrence of portal hypertension and esophageal varices. At present, universal endoscopic screening of esophageal varices is recommended in association to primary prophylaxis in patients at high risk of variceal bleeding. But this screening is invasive and could be not cost-effective. Besides, pre-primary phrophylaxis is not effective and hampared by side effects. So, non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension might be useful. This one could depend on non invasive measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient, but its application to screening is not well-documented and its use in treatment monitoring is debated. A second way could be non invasive diagnosis of large esophageal varices because of prognostic and economic issues. Indirect echographic markers of portal hypertension and esophageal varices (ascites, portal vein diameter > or = 13 mm, spleen length, maximal and mean velocimetry of portal vein flow, respectively < 20 cm/s and < 12 cm/s) could be useful. Among this parameters, spleen length is an independent predictive marker of esophageal varices. Besides, several direct or indirect blood markers of fibrosis have been tested. Platelet count is repeatedly a predictive marker of esophageal varices in multivariate analysis. The other predictive factors of esophageal varices could be: prothrombin time, splenomegaly, spider naevi, Child-Pugh class, bilirubinemia, platelet count/spleen diameter ratio and Fibrotest, but these data require validation. In summary, in regard to actual results, non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension might be useful in esophageal varices screening, but the substitutes to endoscopy have limited place actually in clinical practice, and exclusive non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension is not applicable; the only test that seems to be useful in clinical practice is conventional endoscopy awaiting the results of videocapsule."
CD008760,0,20684186,0,Capsule endoscopy: no longer limited to the small bowel.,"Capsule endoscopy is the latest evolution in gastrointestinal endoscopy and the first to enable complete investigation of the small bowel. Recent new developments in the field of capsule endoscopy include the esophageal capsule (Pilcam ESO) and the colonic capsule (PillCam Colon). esophageal and colonic capsules have two heads with two lenses and cameras. The new capsules have the capability of taking more frames from both sides. The indications for the esophageal capsule examination are diagnosis and follow-up of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal varices.

CD008760,0,19679416,0,[Future prospects in digestive endoscopy: wireless capsule endoscopy].,"Since the beginning of the millennium, the development of wireless capsule endoscopy has represented a major technological advance. The capsule is ingested by the patient and images are transmitted via several sensors positioned on the skin of the patient and downloaded in a computer system. The first applications were focused on the exploration of the small bowel which was previously considered as an obscure area for conventional endoscopy. Wireless capsule endoscopy of the small bowel is now an established technique with many acknowledged indications for the diagnosis of obscure bleeding, anemia of presumed digestive origin, Crohn's disease and small bowel tumors. Recently, thanks to technological progresses, novel capsules have been developed for specific segments of the gut namely the oesophagus and the colon. Recent data suggest that these new capsules could have potential applications for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices, Barrett's oesophagus and for the screening and/or surveillance of polyps of the colon. However, further studies are required before such strategies could be approved for clinical use or even replace conventional endoscopic modalities. In the long-term, progresses in signal processing as well as in the miniaturisation of sensors or markers may lead to a new generation of endoscopic robots. This technological breakthrough may ultimately result in new concepts and change current practice of digestive endoscopy."

CD008760,0,17415347,0,Endoscopic frontiers in the field of hepatology.,"Hepatology is considered a cognitive specialty, but it will not be surprising if a subgroup of future hepatologists (''invasive hepatologists'') performed a variety of advanced endoscopic, laparoscopic, vascular or ablative procedures just like interventional gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists or minimally invasive surgeons. The increase in the prevalence of liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma, and effective treatment of end-stage liver disease with liver transplantation has expanded the subspecialty of hepatology into a major specialty. Therefore, it is only natural that some of the trainees in hepatology, familiar with invasive procedures just like their counterparts in gastroenterology, may become subspecialized in invasive aspects of this specialty, traditionally performed by interventional endoscopists, radiologists and surgeons. Moreover, there will be major developments in the management of the complications of liver disease. Endoscopic screening with esophageal capsule endoscopy and, to a lesser extent, ultrathin upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may replace conventional endoscopy. In addition to standard treatments for esophageal varices, removable esophageal stents with expansile pressure may be utilized in refractory variceal hemorrhage. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be performed by hepatologists. Advances in argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy may result in novel treatment options for portal hypertensive gastropathy. Single-fiber cholangioscopy will allow for directed endoscopic screening for cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis in high-risk individuals. Minilaparoscopy will allow a macroscopic assessment of the liver surface as well as the ability to target specific regions for histopathology, and treatment including radiofrequency ablation of liver cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may provide the potential to directly measure portal vein pressure and this may have a future role in titration and optimization of pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension. EUS and fine needle aspiration may be used for staging hepatocellular and bile duct cancer. Finally, natural orifice transluminal surgery and endoscopic ultrasound-guided angiography may allow for targeted therapies traditionally outside the realm of the hepatologists."

Current guidelines recommend screening patients with cirrhosis with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to detect varices. However, the unpleasantness and need for sedation of EGD may limit adherence to screening programs. Pilot studies have shown good performance of esophageal capsule endoscopy in detecting varices. This multicenter trial was designed to assess the diagnostic performance of capsule endoscopy in comparison with EGD. Patients undergoing EGD for screening or surveillance of EV underwent a capsule study previously. The study was designed as an equivalence study, assuming that a difference of <or=10% between capsule endoscopy and EGD in diagnosing EV would demonstrate equivalence. Two hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled. Endoscopy was for screening in 195 patients and for surveillance of known EV in 93. Overall agreement for detecting EV between EGD and capsule endoscopy was 85.8%; the kappa score was 0.73. Capsule endoscopy had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 84%, 88%, 92%, and 77%, respectively. The difference in diagnosing EV was 15.6% in favor of EGD. There was complete agreement on variceal grade in 227 of 288 cases (79%). In differentiating between medium/large varices requiring treatment and small/absent varices requiring surveillance, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for capsule endoscopy were 78%, 96%, 87%, and 92%, respectively.

He continued to have hematochezia and anemia despite blood transfusions. Colonoscopy was normal. Repeat EGD did not reveal any source of recent bleed. Twelve days after admission, his hematochezia ceased. He refused further investigation and was discharged two days later. He presented one week after discharge with hematochezia. EGD showed non-bleeding Grade 1 esophageal varices and a clean-based duodenal ulcer. Colonoscopy was normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed liver cirrhosis with mild ascites, paraumbilical varices, and splenomegaly. He had multiple episodes of hematochezia, requiring repeated blood transfusions. Capsule endoscopy identified the bleeding site in the jejunum. Concurrently, CT angiography showed paraumbilical varices inseparable from a loop of small bowel, which had herniated through an umbilical hernia. The lumen of this loop of small bowel opacified in the delayed phase, which suggested variceal bleeding into the small bowel. Portal vein thrombosis was present. As he had severe coagulopathy and extensive paraumbilical varices, surgery was of high risk. He was not suitable for transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt as he had portal vein thrombosis.

No study has examined the influence of operator factors on the accuracy of ECE reporting. The primary aims of this study were, therefore, to examine how operator experience with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and operator reporting times of capsule videos influenced test accuracy. Twelve cirrhotic patients presenting for EGD had same-day ECE performed. The gold standard for variceal grade was determined using a panel of experienced endoscopists. Six novice capsule endoscopists, blinded to results of EGD, subsequently reported capsule videos for each of the 12 patients.Novice capsule endoscopists accurately identified high-risk varices. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for identifying high-risk varices for the six operators was 0.88 ±/-0.14. The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for identifying high-risk varices for the six operators were 83%, 93%, 82%, and 97%, respectively. Years of prior EGD experience were not associated with accuracy of capsule reporting (OR = 0.9, 95% CI [0.74, 1.08]; p = .26). Time spent reporting capsule videos was associated with accuracy of capsule reporting for high-risk varices using British Society of Gastroenterology criteria (OR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.05, 1.08]; p = .018). Novice capsule endoscopists are able to accurately identify high-risk esophageal varices. Time taken to report capsule videos, but not amount of prior EGD experience, influenced capsule report accuracy. These findings may have implications for the design of further trials and the cost-effectiveness of ECE screening of varices."

Although measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient is the most accurate method for evaluating the presence and severity of portal hypertension, this technique is considered invasive and is not routinely performed in all centers. Several noninvasive techniques have been proposed to measure portal hypertension. Certain methods evaluate elements related to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension through the measurement of hyperkinetic syndrome, for example, or they investigate the development of hepatic fibrosis through the measurement of increased intrahepatic vascular resistance. Other methods evaluate the clinical consequences of portal hypertension, such as the presence of esophageal varices or the development of portosystemic shunts. Methods evaluating increased hepatic vascular resistance are fairly accurate and mainly involve the detection of hepatic fibrosis by serum markers and transient elastography. The radiological assessment of hyperkinetic syndrome probably has value but is still under investigation. The assessment of severe portal hypertension by the presence of varices may be performed with simple tools such as biological assays, computed tomography, and esophageal capsules. More sophisticated procedures seem promising but are still under development. Screening tools for large populations must be simple, whereas more complicated procedures could help in the follow-up of already diagnosed patients. Although most of these noninvasive methods effectively identify severe portal hypertension, methods for diagnosing moderate portal hypertension need to be developed; this shows that further investigation is needed in this field."

CD008760,0,18636658,0,The future of wireless capsule endoscopy.,"We outline probable and possible developments with wireless capsule endoscopy. It seems likely that capsule endoscopy will become increasingly effective in diagnostic gastrointestinal endoscopy. This will be attractive to patients especially for cancer or varices detection because capsule endoscopy is painless and is likely to have a higher take up rate compared to conventional colonoscopy and gastroscopy. Double imager capsules with increased frame rates have been used to image the esophagus for Barrett's and esophageal varices. The image quality is not bad but needs to be improved if it is to become a realistic substitute for flexible upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. An increase in the frame rate, angle of view, depth of field, image numbers, duration of the procedure and improvements in illumination seem likely. Colonic, esophageal and gastric capsules will improve in quality, eroding the supremacy of flexible endoscopy, and become embedded into screening programs. Therapeutic capsules will emerge with brushing, cytology, fluid aspiration, biopsy and drug delivery capabilities. Electrocautery may also become possible. Diagnostic capsules will integrate physiological measurements with imaging and optical biopsy, and immunologic cancer recognition. Remote control movement will improve with the use of magnets and/or electrostimulation and perhaps electromechanical methods. External wireless commands will influence capsule diagnosis and therapy and will increasingly entail the use of real-time imaging. However, it should be noted that speculations about the future of technology in any detail are almost always wrong."
CD008760,0,18790438,0,Endoscopic haemostasis.,"Endoscopic haemostasis should be attempted as the initial approach in most cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, although cross-disciplinary collaboration is a prerequisite. For variceal bleeding, band ligation is the method of choice in the elective setting, although injection therapy still has a role in acute bleeding. Histoacryl remains preferable for fundic varices in most parts of the world. For peptic ulcer bleeds, injection therapy should be combined with at least one 'mechanical' modality, thermal treatment or clipping. In rebleeding, a single endoscopic retreatment can be attempted, but alternative approaches must be considered. Acute lower GI bleeding is primarily a diagnostic challenge but, if the focus is found, the regular techniques for haemostasis can usually be applied. If small bowel haemorrhage is suspected after upper and lower endoscopy, capsule endoscopy and balloon enteroscopy offer make it possible to address even small bowel foci."

CD008760,0,18706733,0,Non-invasive (and minimally invasive) diagnosis of oesophageal varices.,"Current guidelines recommend screening all cirrhotic patients by endoscopy, to identify patients at risk of bleeding who should undergo prophylactic treatment. However, since the prevalence of varices in cirrhotic patients is variable, universal screening would imply a large number of unnecessary endoscopies and a heavy burden for endoscopy units. In addition, compliance to screening programs may be hampered by the perceived unpleasantness of endoscopy. Predicting the presence of oesophageal varices by non-invasive means might increase compliance and would permit to restrict the performance of endoscopy to those patients with a high probability of having varices. Over the years, several studies have addressed this issue by assessing the potential of biochemical, clinical and ultrasound parameters, transient elastography, CT scanning and video capsule endoscopy. The platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, CT scanning and video capsule endoscopy have shown promising performance characteristics, although none of them is equivalent to EGD. These methods are perceived by patients as preferable to endoscopy and thus might increase adherence to screening programs. Whether this will compensate for the lower sensitivity of these alternative techniques, and ultimately improve the outcomes if more patients undergo screening, is the crucial question that will have to be answered in the future."
CD008760,0,17912188,0,Capsule endoscopy: a comprehensive review.,"The development of wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) has been a significant technologic advancement for the non-invasive visual evaluation of the entire small bowel and esophagus. The capsule endoscope is disposable and measures 11 x 26 mm. There are two capsule endoscopes currently available: PillCam ESO and PillCam SB for the evaluation of the esophagus and the small bowel, respectively. The PillCam ESO has two cameras on each end and captures images 7 frames per second per each camera, while the PillCam SB has one camera and captures images at a rate of 2 frames per second. Both capsule endoscopes transmit the image data using a radiofrequency signal to a recording device worn on the patient's waist. Once image acquisition is completed, the data from the recording device is downloaded to a computer workstation and analyzed by a gastroenterologist. Common indications for the small bowel CE include obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), suspected Crohn disease (CD), as well as other suspected small bowel pathologies, while indications for the esophageal CE include screening of Barrett esophagus and esophageal varices. Small bowel CE appears to be more sensitive in the evaluation of OGIB and small bowel CD compared with other conventional radiological and endoscopic modalities. Preliminary results for the esophageal CE reveal good accuracy for screening of both Barrett and esophageal varices. CE is well tolerated by most patients, requires no sedation, and carries few side effects. One of the complications of CE is capsule retention; however, a patency capsule system has been developed, which can indicate whether an obstructing lesion is present before CE is performed. Finally, there are preliminary data suggesting that a new capsule endoscope for the colon may be useful in the evaluation of patients for colon polyps and possibly, screening for colon cancer."

CD008760,0,23593613,0,A case of variceal bleeding from the jejunum in liver cirrhosis.,"While esophagogastric varices are common manifestations of portal hypertension, variceal bleeding from the jejunum is a rare complication of liver cirrhosis. In addition, ectopic variceal bleeding occurs in the duodenum and at sites of previous bowel surgery in most cases, including of stomas. We report a case of obscure overt gastrointestinal bleeding from jejunal varices in a 55-year-old woman who had not previously undergone abdominal surgery, who had liver cirrhosis induced by the hepatitis C virus. Emergency endoscopy revealed the presence of esophageal varices without stigmata of recent bleeding, and no bleeding focus was found at colonoscopy. She continued to produce recurrent melena with hematochezia and received up to 21 units of packed red blood cells. CT angiography revealed the presence of jejunal varices, but no active bleeding was found. Capsule endoscopy revealed fresh blood in the jejunum. The patient submitted to embolization of the jejunal varices via the portal vein, after which she had a stable hemoglobin level and no recurrence of the melena. This is a case of variceal bleeding from the jejunum in a liver cirrhosis patient without a prior history of abdominal surgery."

CD008760,0,18360329,0,Capsule endoscopy: a review.,"Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a novel technology that allows direct noninvasive visualization of the entire small intestine. CE permits a detailed examination in the ambulatory setting, allowing identification of clinically relevant lesions, and it is appealing to both patients and providers. There are two types of capsules that are currently commercially available: one specifically designed to view the small bowel and the other for the esophagus. Common indications for small bowel CE include obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, initial diagnosis of suspected Crohn's disease, and other small bowel pathology. The esophageal capsule is currently used to evaluate Barrett esophagus and esophageal varices. It is a well-tolerated procedure with relatively few complications. Although CE performance may be superior to existing technologies, its impact on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes are of even greater importance. Herein lies a review of the latest information on CE, its indications, complications, future utilities, and developing technology."

This study was performed to compare the cost-effectiveness of PillCam ESO versus EGD for esophageal variceal screening."
CD008760,0,19191853,0,"A study comparing tolerability, satisfaction and acceptance of three different techniques for esophageal endoscopy: sedated conventional, unsedated peroral ultra thin, and esophageal capsule.","Three methods of esophagoscopy are available until now: sedated conventional endoscopy, unsedated ultrathin endoscopy, and esophageal capsule endoscopy. The three methods carry comparable diagnostic accuracy and different complication rates. Although all of them have been found well accepted from patients, no comparative study comprising the three techniques has been published. The aim of this study was to compare the three methods of esophagoscopy regarding tolerability, satisfaction, and acceptance. Twenty patients with large esophageal varices and 10 with gastroesophageal reflux disease were prospectively included. All patients underwent consecutively sedated conventional endoscopy, unsedated ultrathin endoscopy, and esophageal capsule endoscopy. After each procedure, patients completed a seven-item questionnaire. The total positive attitude of patients toward all methods was high. However, statistical analysis revealed the following differences in favor of esophageal capsule endoscopy: (i) total positive attitude has been found higher (chi(2)= 18.2, df = 2, P= 0.00), (ii) less patients felt pain (chi(2)= 6.9, df = 2, P= 0.03) and discomfort (chi(2)= 22.1, df = 2, P= 0.00), (iii) less patients experienced difficulty (chi(2)= 13.7, df = 2, P= 0.01), and (iv) more patients were willing to undergo esophageal capsule endoscopy in the future (chi(2)= 12.1, df = 2, P= 0.002). Esophageal capsule endoscopy was characterized by a more positive general attitude and caused less pain and discomfort. Sedated conventional endoscopy has been found more difficult. More patients would repeat esophageal capsule endoscopy in the future. Patients' total position for all three available techniques for esophageal endoscopy was excellent and renders the observed advantage of esophageal capsule endoscopy over both sedated conventional and unsedated ultrathin endoscopy a statistical finding without a real clinical benefit."
CD008760,0,19568182,0,Capsule endoscopy of the esophagus.,"Video capsule endoscopy has acquired wide clinical acceptance since its the US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2001. Recently, the technology of video capsule endoscopy has been adapted to other organs in the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus and colon. In this review, we discuss esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE)-the procedure, its indications, contraindications, safety, and future applications. ECE is a minimally invasive procedure that uses special video capsules with ability to acquire images from 2 cameras with high image storing speed of 14 to 18 frames per second. A special ingestion procedure allows for prolonged esophageal transit time and an optimized view of the gastroesophageal junction. ECE has been shown to have moderately high sensitivity and accuracy in the diagnosis and surveillance of Barrett esophagus in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease but has not demonstrated superiority to esogastroduodenoscopy in cost-effectiveness models. In patients with portal hypertension, ECE has a sensitivity of 63% to 100% for screening of esophageal varices, but does not seem to be superior to esogastroduodenoscopy in its cost-effectiveness. No serious complications have been reported after ECE although a low rate of esophageal capsule retention (0.7% to 2.2%) has been reported, usually because of unsuspected esophageal strictures. Contraindications to capsule endoscopy include known or suspected gastrointestinal and esophageal obstruction, strictures, or fistulas, intestinal pseudoobstruction, and children under 10 years of age. It is expected that improvements in imaging technology will improve the accuracy of ECE with the development of immunological-based and chemical-based diagnostic capabilities."
CD008760,0,17827950,0,Capsule endoscopy--state of the art.,"Capsule endoscopy is a new technology that was recently introduced into clinical practice for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. As of today, three different capsule types have been produced, designed for the exploration of the small bowel (PillCam SB), the esophagus (PillCam ESO) and the colon (PillCam Colon). The PillCam SB has gained widespread acceptance as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of bleeding from the small bowel as well as for other indications. The PillCam ESO has been used to study patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, for the screening of Barrett's esophagus, and for the screening and surveillance of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. The results of the pilot studies carried out with this capsule have been encouraging. Large-scale studies are ongoing. The evaluation of the potential of the PillCam Colon capsule is still in its infancy: the two pilot studies published showed that this capsule can produce high-quality images of the colon. The potential of this capsule for clinical purposes, such as colon cancer screening, needs to be evaluated."
CD008760,0,19646642,0,Gastrointestinal bleeding in the cancer patient.,Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common occurrence in patients with cancer and is a frequent indicator of a gastrointestinal malignancy. Rapid evaluation and treatment is key for the hemodynamically unstable patient. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone of diagnosis and management for cancer patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. The emergency physician should also be aware of other diagnostic and treatment modalities that may be needed to take care of these patients.
CD008760,0,22155754,1,Capsule endoscopy is not as accurate as esophagogastroduodenoscopy in screening cirrhotic patients for varices.,Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the standard technique for screening cirrhotic patients for high-risk varices and other significant upper gastrointestinal lesions (HRVLs). We investigated whether esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) is as convenient and accurate as EGD for the detection of HRVLs.
CD008760,0,16644462,0,The economics of PillCam.,"Evaluation of the economics of PillCam technology is in its infancy. Most studies of the use of the PillCam, both small bowel and esophageal, have focused only on the capsules' diagnostic characteristics. Although the results have compared favorably with other more invasive and sometimes less accurate modalities, the true cost effectiveness of PillCam is not yet fully known. The few cost-effectiveness assessments performed suggest that PillCam compares favorably with traditional diagnostic methods in Crohn's disease and in screening for complications of GERD and for esophageal varices. The data included in these models are quite limited, however. Sensitivity analyses can permit assessment of a wide range of possibilities regarding cost and diagnostic efficacy. Still, these models need to be anchored by robust and reproducible data input. Large-scale studies with long-term follow-up are needed. Capture of both direct and indirect medical costs accrued by using PillCam or other diagnostic tests in these studies will permit more robust economic analyses. As data accrue,they may give clinicians more confidence that PillCam use will realize economic savings and improve patient outcomes."
CD008760,0,18294933,0,Diagnosis and monitoring of portal hypertension.,"Currently, oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy is the standard method to diagnose the presence of oesophago-gastric varices and to estimate the risk of bleeding. It is recommended that all patients undergo endoscopic screening for varices at the time when cirrhosis is diagnosed. After screening endoscopy, patients with medium or large varices should be treated to prevent bleeding, while all other patients should undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy. However, at a given point in time a variable proportion of patients will not have varices, since the prevalence of varices is variable. Thus, screening all cirrhotic patients with endoscopy to detect the presence of varices implies a number of unnecessary endoscopies. In recent years a wealth of new methods have been proposed as alternatives to conventional oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy for the non-invasive or minimally invasive diagnosis of oesophageal varices. Three of these methods (the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, Fibrotest and Fibroscan) are truly non-invasive. Of these, the former is promising and needs a proper validation, Fibrotest appears to be insufficiently precise, while Fibroscan needs further evaluation. Multidetector CT oesophagography and capsule endoscopy are not entirely ""non-invasive"", since the first requires air insufflation into the oesophagus via an orally passed tube, and the latter requires swallowing the capsule. Multidetector CT oesophagography is promising, but needs further evaluation; capsule endoscopy is safe and reliable and might be proposed as an alternative to oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy in patients unable or unwilling to undergo oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy."

Current international guidelines recommend that patients with cirrhosis are screened by conventional upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD) in order to detect esophageal varices. The recently developed PillCam ESO esophageal capsule endoscope has been shown to be an accurate diagnostic tool in the investigation of patients with gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett's esophagus. We compared the PillCam ESO capsule endoscope with EGD for the detection of esophagogastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with cirrhosis."
CD008760,0,16435503,0,[Non-invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Application to the primary prevention of varices].,"One of the major complications of cirrhosis is the occurrence of portal hypertension and esophageal varices. At present, universal endoscopic screening of esophageal varices is recommended in association to primary prophylaxis in patients at high risk of variceal bleeding. But this screening is invasive and could be not cost-effective. Besides, pre-primary phrophylaxis is not effective and hampared by side effects. So, non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension might be useful. This one could depend on non invasive measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient, but its application to screening is not well-documented and its use in treatment monitoring is debated. A second way could be non invasive diagnosis of large esophageal varices because of prognostic and economic issues. Indirect echographic markers of portal hypertension and esophageal varices (ascites, portal vein diameter > or = 13 mm, spleen length, maximal and mean velocimetry of portal vein flow, respectively < 20 cm/s and < 12 cm/s) could be useful. Among this parameters, spleen length is an independent predictive marker of esophageal varices. Besides, several direct or indirect blood markers of fibrosis have been tested. Platelet count is repeatedly a predictive marker of esophageal varices in multivariate analysis. The other predictive factors of esophageal varices could be: prothrombin time, splenomegaly, spider naevi, Child-Pugh class, bilirubinemia, platelet count/spleen diameter ratio and Fibrotest, but these data require validation. In summary, in regard to actual results, non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension might be useful in esophageal varices screening, but the substitutes to endoscopy have limited place actually in clinical practice, and exclusive non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension is not applicable; the only test that seems to be useful in clinical practice is conventional endoscopy awaiting the results of videocapsule."

The capsule is ingested by the patient and images are transmitted via several sensors positioned on the skin of the patient and downloaded in a computer system. The first applications were focused on the exploration of the small bowel which was previously considered as an obscure area for conventional endoscopy. Wireless capsule endoscopy of the small bowel is now an established technique with many acknowledged indications for the diagnosis of obscure bleeding, anemia of presumed digestive origin, Crohn's disease and small bowel tumors. Recently, thanks to technological progresses, novel capsules have been developed for specific segments of the gut namely the oesophagus and the colon. Recent data suggest that these new capsules could have potential applications for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices, Barrett's oesophagus and for the screening and/or surveillance of polyps of the colon. However, further studies are required before such strategies could be approved for clinical use or even replace conventional endoscopic modalities. In the long-term, progresses in signal processing as well as in the miniaturisation of sensors or markers may lead to a new generation of endoscopic robots.

CD008760,0,17415347,0,Endoscopic frontiers in the field of hepatology.,"Hepatology is considered a cognitive specialty, but it will not be surprising if a subgroup of future hepatologists (''invasive hepatologists'') performed a variety of advanced endoscopic, laparoscopic, vascular or ablative procedures just like interventional gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists or minimally invasive surgeons. The increase in the prevalence of liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma, and effective treatment of end-stage liver disease with liver transplantation has expanded the subspecialty of hepatology into a major specialty. Therefore, it is only natural that some of the trainees in hepatology, familiar with invasive procedures just like their counterparts in gastroenterology, may become subspecialized in invasive aspects of this specialty, traditionally performed by interventional endoscopists, radiologists and surgeons. Moreover, there will be major developments in the management of the complications of liver disease. Endoscopic screening with esophageal capsule endoscopy and, to a lesser extent, ultrathin upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may replace conventional endoscopy. In addition to standard treatments for esophageal varices, removable esophageal stents with expansile pressure may be utilized in refractory variceal hemorrhage. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be performed by hepatologists. Advances in argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy may result in novel treatment options for portal hypertensive gastropathy. Single-fiber cholangioscopy will allow for directed endoscopic screening for cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis in high-risk individuals. Minilaparoscopy will allow a macroscopic assessment of the liver surface as well as the ability to target specific regions for histopathology, and treatment including radiofrequency ablation of liver cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may provide the potential to directly measure portal vein pressure and this may have a future role in titration and optimization of pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension. EUS and fine needle aspiration may be used for staging hepatocellular and bile duct cancer. Finally, natural orifice transluminal surgery and endoscopic ultrasound-guided angiography may allow for targeted therapies traditionally outside the realm of the hepatologists."

He was hypotensive and had hematochezia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed small esophageal varices and a clean-based duodenal ulcer. He continued to have hematochezia and anemia despite blood transfusions. Colonoscopy was normal. Repeat EGD did not reveal any source of recent bleed. Twelve days after admission, his hematochezia ceased. He refused further investigation and was discharged two days later. He presented one week after discharge with hematochezia. EGD showed non-bleeding Grade 1 esophageal varices and a clean-based duodenal ulcer. Colonoscopy was normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed liver cirrhosis with mild ascites, paraumbilical varices, and splenomegaly. He had multiple episodes of hematochezia, requiring repeated blood transfusions. Capsule endoscopy identified the bleeding site in the jejunum. Concurrently, CT angiography showed paraumbilical varices inseparable from a loop of small bowel, which had herniated through an umbilical hernia. The lumen of this loop of small bowel opacified in the delayed phase, which suggested variceal bleeding into the small bowel. Portal vein thrombosis was present. As he had severe coagulopathy and extensive paraumbilical varices, surgery was of high risk. He was not suitable for transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt as he had portal vein thrombosis.

No study has examined the influence of operator factors on the accuracy of ECE reporting. The primary aims of this study were, therefore, to examine how operator experience with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and operator reporting times of capsule videos influenced test accuracy. Twelve cirrhotic patients presenting for EGD had same-day ECE performed. The gold standard for variceal grade was determined using a panel of experienced endoscopists. Six novice capsule endoscopists, blinded to results of EGD, subsequently reported capsule videos for each of the 12 patients.Novice capsule endoscopists accurately identified high-risk varices. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for identifying high-risk varices for the six operators was 0.88 ±/-0.14. The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for identifying high-risk varices for the six operators were 83%, 93%, 82%, and 97%, respectively. Years of prior EGD experience were not associated with accuracy of capsule reporting (OR = 0.9, 95% CI [0.74, 1.08]; p = .26). Time spent reporting capsule videos was associated with accuracy of capsule reporting for high-risk varices using British Society of Gastroenterology criteria (OR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.05, 1.08]; p = .018). Novice capsule endoscopists are able to accurately identify high-risk esophageal varices. Time taken to report capsule videos, but not amount of prior EGD experience, influenced capsule report accuracy. These findings may have implications for the design of further trials and the cost-effectiveness of ECE screening of varices."
