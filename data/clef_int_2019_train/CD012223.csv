CD012223,0,22581206,0,Corticosteroid use for diabetic macular edema: old fad or new trend?,"Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working age individuals in developed countries. Most cases of diabetes related vision loss result from breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier with resultant diabetic macular edema (DME). For over 30 years, laser photocoagulation has been the standard therapy for DME, but most eyes do not experience significant improvements in visual acuity. Intravitreal injections of drugs that inhibit the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) lead to gains in vision, but can be expensive and need to be repeated frequently. In addition to VEGF-mediated breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, recent evidence suggests that inflammation plays an important role in the development of DME. Recognizing this, physicians have injected steroids into the vitreous and developers have created sustained release implants. Intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide lead to rapid resolution of macular edema and significant short-term improvements in visual acuity, but unfortunately, visual acuities diminish when treatment is continued through 2 years. However, intravitreal triamcinolone remains an attractive treatment option for eyes that are pseudophakic, scheduled to undergo cataract surgery, resistant to laser photocoagulation, or require urgent panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative retinopathy. In controlled trials, intraocular implants that slowly release dexamethasone and fluocinolone show promise in reducing macular edema and improving visual acuity. The high incidences of drug related cataracts and glaucoma, however, require that corticosteroids be used cautiously and that patients be selected carefully. The increasing number of patients with DME, the burgeoning cost of medical care and the continuing development of intravitreal steroids suggest that the use of these agents will likely increase in coming years."

CD012223,0,27899387,0,Activation of Cytomegalovirus corneal endotheliitis following laser in situ keratomileusis.,"A case of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) corneal endotheliitis following laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is presented. A 32-year-old man presented 3 weeks after uncomplicated myopic LASIK with unilateral LASIK flap oedema, interface fluid accumulation, keratic precipitates, anterior uveitis and raised intraocular pressure. Despite treatment with topical corticosteroids, he had 3 further recurrent episodes. Specular microscopy showed decreased endothelial cell density and aqueous humour. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive for CMV DNA. He was treated with topical ganciclovir and ketorolac, and the inflammation and oedema resolved. Repeat aqueous humour PCR testing was negative for CMV DNA, and he remained well at last follow-up (3 months after stopping all medications). CMV corneal endotheliitis can be reactivated after LASIK, and CMV DNA PCR of aqueous humour samples can help in definitive diagnosis. Early recognition and treatment of this condition is important to prevent permanent endothelial cell loss and corneal decompensation."

Superselective angiography in the right ophthalmic artery was performed to confirm the orifice of the feeding arteries during preoperative embolization.

CD012223,0,2275354,0,Standard and long duration repeat argon laser trabeculoplasty.,"A retrospective survey was performed on 22 patients with chronic simple glaucoma who had undergone a single repetition of argon laser trabeculoplasty. Two groups were identified who had received treatment with either 0.1 or 0.2 sec duration. The 0.2 sec group showed a reduction in the medications used, in addition to a comparable fall in intra-ocular pressure to the 0.1 sec group, and had a lower rate of drainage surgery. These findings may have arisen because of the higher energy delivered as a result of the longer duration employed. However, there are risks of repeating argon laser trabeculoplasty: one patient in the 0.2 sec group developed a rise in intra-ocular pressure of 15 mmHg following the repeat treatment, and required drainage surgery one month later."
CD012223,0,9603290,0,Effects of topical adrenergic agents on tissue circulation in rabbit and human optic nerve head evaluated with laser speckle tissue circulation analyzer.,"The effects of topical adrenergic agents on the tissue circulation of the optic nerve head (ONH) were studied in animal and human eyes with use of a laser speckle tissue circulation analyzer. Drugs studied were nipradilol, a beta1-2-blocker with weak alpha-blocking and nitroglycerinlike activities; bunazosin, a selective alpha1-blocker; carteolol, a beta1-2-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; and betaxolol, a selective beta1-blocker. In the animal experiment, one eye each of nine albino rabbits received 0.25% nipradilol (N = 9) twice daily for 15 days or 0.01% bunazosin (N = 10) twice daily for 20 days; the fellow eye received the vehicle of each drug in a randomized masked design. Normalized blur (NB) in an area of ONH free of visible surface vessels, a quantitative index of peripheral blood velocity in ONH, was measured under general anesthesia before treatment and 2 hours after the last instillation on the 15th or 20th day. At 15 days, intraocular pressure and NB in the nipradilol-treated eyes decreased by 4.3 mm Hg (P < 0.01) and increased by 15.9% (P < 0.01), respectively, while those in the vehicle-treated eyes showed little change. At 20 days NB in both bunazosin- and vehicle-treated eyes showed little change, while intraocular pressure decreased only in the bunazosin-treated eyes (P < 0.01). In the human volunteer experiment NB was averaged over five pulses (mean NB) in both eyes before and 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 hours after a 30 microL instillation of the vehicle of carteolol or betaxolol to serve as a control. Intraocular pressure, blood pressure and pulse rate were also measured. One week later a 30 microL drop of 2.0% carteolol (N = 6) or 0.5% betaxolol (N = 10) was instilled in one randomly chosen eye and the vehicle for each drug in the other eye, and those parameters were measured as above in a double-masked manner. In the carteolol experiment, mean NB in both eyes was significantly higher at 3 hours than it was in the control experiment (P < 0.05), while intraocular pressure was significantly lower in both eyes and blood pressure and pulse rate showed little change. In the betaxolol experiment, intraocular pressure at 1.5 hours and blood pressure at 4.5 hours were significantly lower than those in the control experiment (P < 0.05), while mean NB and pulse rate showed little change. In summary, using the laser speckle method we found that topical nipradilol and carteolol increase ONH blood velocity in rabbits and humans, respectively. This finding suggests that some topical beta-blockers used clinically may influence the ONH tissue circulation in patients and that this method may be used in clinical situations to assess the effect of various drugs on ONH circulation."

CD012223,0,3704353,0,Ultrasonic fragmentation of cataract in uveitis.,"Thirty-nine eyes with uveitis from various causes, and complicated by cataract and vitreous opacification, underwent pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy by ultrasonic fragmentation. Anatomical results were excellent, with clearing of all lens and vitreous opacities in all eyes. Visual results showed that there was no exacerbation and no recurrence of uveitis. Visual results depended mainly on the presence of previous damage of the uveitis to the retina and optic nerve. Visual results did not depend on the presence of uveitis activity at the time of the surgery. Complications that occurred were cystoid macular edema, which was present in 17.94% of the eyes and diagnosed in some eyes at the surgery, retinal detachment in one eye (2.56%), sterile hypopyon in one eye (2.56%), and ultrasonic lesion of the retina in one eye (2.56%). Visions of 20/20 to 20/40 were obtained in 23% of the eyes, 20.5% had vision between 20/50 and 20/80, and 56.4% had vision of 20/100 or less. The good results justify the surgical intervention in cases of cataracts associated with uveitis. Pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy appears to be the procedure of choice in removal of cataracts secondary to uveitis."

CD012223,0,25674761,0,Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy for glaucoma after descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty: three consecutive case reports.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) in 3 consecutive eyes with preexisting and uncontrolled glaucoma after Descemet stripping with automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK).NPDS with intrascleral implant and topical adjunctive intraoperative mitomycin C (0.2 mg/mL 1 minute) was performed.Intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of glaucoma medication were registered before and after NPDS with at least 1-year follow-up. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were also registered.Before NPDS, IOP was 18 mm Hg in 1 patient and 32 mm Hg in the other 2 patients. Four antiglaucoma drugs were used in 2 cases and 3 in the other one. At 1 year after NPDS, all the patients had an IOP ≤18 mm Hg. Two patients required postoperative antiglaucoma medications (1 drug in 1 case and 2 drugs in the other one). Neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser goniopuncture was needed in 2 patients and it had to be repeated in 1 of them. No complications related to NPDS were observed. A corneal graft rejection was observed 5 months after NPDS in 1 case that resolved without sequelae with intensive corticosteroid eye-drop therapy.NPDS could be a safe and successful alternative to conventional filtration surgery after DSAEK in eyes with uncontrolled glaucoma. Larger series and a longer follow-up would be necessary to set the actual role of surgery in DSAEK patients."
CD012223,0,2035342,0,[Implantation of intraocular lenses in patients with diabetes].,"The authors analysed and compared three groups of patients who had undergone surgery. In the first group of 72 patients with diabetes and cataract, intraocular lens implantation was carried out. In the second group of 96 patients with diabetes and cataract, cataract surgery was not followed by intraocular lens implantation. The third group of 100 nondiabetic patients, selected by random choice, had intraocular lens implanted after the cataract surgery. Retinal status, postoperative complications and visual acuity were the parameters analysed in correlation with the intraocular lens implantation. In the authors' opinion, the prognosis following cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation in diabetic patients is good, if diabetic complications do not occur, particularly retinopathy and vitreal hemorrhage which impair the vision considerably. Intraocular lens can be implanted even in cases of maculopathy and preproliferative diabetic retinopathy, provided a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed (echography, fluorescein angiography). Laser photocoagulation procedure should also be carried out before surgery and repeated as long as the transparence of the lens enables it. The treatment should be resumed two weeks after the cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation at the latest. Intraocular lens implantation is contraindicated in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and especially iridal rubeosis, as the risk of neovascular glaucoma development is considerable."

CD012223,0,16400475,0,Trabeculectomy and optic nerve head topography.,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate changes in optic nerve head parameters, measured by confocal laser tomography, before and after trabeculectomy in order to identify outcome measures for the management of glaucoma. The optic nerve head of 22 eyes (22 patients) was analyzed by confocal laser tomography with the Heidelberg retinal tomogram (HRT) before and after trabeculectomy. The median time between the first HRT and surgery was 4.6 months (mean: 7.7 +/- 8.3) and the median time between surgery and the second HRT was 10.8 months (mean: 12.0 +/- 6.8). The patients were divided into two groups, i.e., those with the highest (group A) and lowest (group B) intraocular pressure (IOP) change after surgery. Differences in the 12 standard topographic parameters before and after surgery for each group were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the differences in these parameters between the two groups were compared by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the influence of the change in IOP (DeltaIOP and DeltaIOP%) and the changes in the other parameters. There were significant differences in the HRT measures before and after surgery in group A only for cup volume. In group B, no parameter was statistically different. The changes in group A were not significantly different than those in group B for any parameter (P > 0.004, Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). DeltaIOP and DeltaIOP% had a statistically significant effect on Delta cup disk area, Delta cup volume and Delta mean cup depth. Changes in cup shape size were influenced significantly only by DeltaIOP. Some optic disc parameters measured by HRT presented a significant improvement after filtering surgery, depending on the amount of IOP reduction. Long-term studies are needed to determine the usefulness of these findings as outcome measures in the management of glaucoma."
CD012223,0,3657015,0,[Study of early glaucomatous visual field defects with the automatic perimeter Topcon SBP-1000. Comparative study with the Octopus 201 perimeter].,"The automatic perimeter TOPCON SBP-1000 uses light emitting diodes (LED's) for stimulus generation and thus completely differs from the projection type perimeter OCTOPUS 201. In order to get some first idea about the capabilities of the TOPCON SBP-1000 22 eyes of 18 patients with early glaucomatous visual field defects were examined both with the glaucoma program/TOPCON SBP-1000 and program 31/OCTOPUS 201. Field defects were divided into three groups according to the total loss (program DELTA/OCTOPUS 201): group I with a total loss of 0 dB, group II with a total loss of 1-200 dB, group III with a total loss greater than 200 dB. Evaluation and comparison of visual field results is done after discussing the most important technical parameters and fundamental aspects of methods and strategies using the total percentage of ""normal"" test points, ""small relative defects"", ""deep relative defects"" and ""absolute defects"". We could show that specificity and sensitivity for the detection of earliest field defects are quite equal both in the TOPCON SBP-1000 and in the OCTOPUS 201. Concerning the detection of more pronounced visual field defects the TOPCON-perimeter has a somewhat smaller sensitivity as a result of the different definition of the category ""normal""; at the same time there is a tendency for showing up more ""absolute defects"" instead of ""deep relative defects"". Technical parameters and strategies are discussed critically taking into consideration the practical experience obtained during this first routine testing."

A detailed evaluation under general anesthesia is advisable to establish the diagnosis and plan for management. Medical therapy has a limited role and surgery remains the primary therapeutic modality. While goniotomy or trabeculotomy ab externo is valuable in the management of congenital glaucoma, primary combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy offers the best hope of success in advanced cases. Trabeculectomy with antifibrotic agent and glaucoma drainage devices has a role in the management of refractory cases, and cyclodestructive procedures should be reserved for patients where these procedures have failed. Early diagnosis, prompt therapeutic intervention and proper refractive correction are keys to success. Management of residual vision and visual rehabilitation should be an integral part of the management of children with low vision and lifelong follow-up is a must."

CD012223,0,1348396,0,Prophylactic use of apraclonidine for intraocular pressure increase after Nd:YAG capsulotomies.,"We evaluated the prophylactic effect of 1% apraclonidine HCl in controlling the increase in intraocular pressure after Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy in a large, multicenter double-masked clinical trial. One hundred sixty-four patients were enrolled into the apraclonidine-treated group, and 165 into the vehicle-treated group. The incidence of increase in intraocular pressure (greater than 5 mm Hg) in the apraclonidine-treated group (7%, 11 of 163 patients) was significantly less than that in the vehicle-treated group (39%, 64 of 164 patients). Similarly, the mean maximal change in intraocular pressure in the apraclonidine-treated group (1.3-mm Hg decrease) was significantly different from the increase in the vehicle-treated group (5.3-mm Hg increase). Few adverse reactions were observed. The risk for significant loss of visual function after Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy, combined with the efficacy and relative safety of prophylactic apraclonidine, suggest its addition to the treatment armamentarium."

However, more medications means more bottles and greater complexity for the patient. There are several potential benefits of fixed combination medications compared with using the individual components separately. These include a reduction in the total number of drops and preservative instilled per day, cost savings, improved tolerability and compliance and avoiding the washout effect resulting from rapid-sequence instillation of multiple drops. Attempts to develop effective fixed combinations of glaucoma medications date back several decades. In recent years, fixed combinations of commonly paired drugs have been approved by various regulatory bodies in different countries and have gained wide acceptance. Current commercially available, fixed combination drugs include the topical beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol 0.5% combined with a prostaglandin, a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor or an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist. Although there is no uniformity among registration trial designs, most published literature compares the efficacy of the fixed combination to the individual components and to concomitant use of both components. Various factors inherent to study design such as medication run-in, washout periods and peak and trough effects have to be taken into consideration when analysing the demonstrated efficacy of fixed combinations. Fixed combination treatments offer effective IOP control while reducing the washout effect and exposure to preservatives. They are also convenient. However, fixed combinations also remove the possibility of titrating the individual components both in terms of concentration and timing of administration. In addition, fixed combinations might not always provide the same efficacy as proper use of the individual components. The clinician must make individualised assessments when weighing the convenience of these medications against their limitations for specific patients."

CD012223,0,8246622,0,Current management of posterior uveal melanoma.,"The management of malignant melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid (posterior uvea) is controversial. Authorities have disagreed about whether enucleation or conservative treatment offers the best prognosis. Although retrospective studies have suggested that the method of treatment makes no difference in the systemic prognosis, new studies in which the various therapeutic modalities are being compared are currently under way. The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study is attempting to address some of these issues in a randomized clinical trial. In this report, the currently available methods for managing posterior uveal melanoma are reviewed. Small asymptomatic choroidal melanomas can probably be observed periodically until evidence of growth is documented. Some small choroidal melanomas can be treated with laser photocoagulation. Alternatively, radiotherapy (either episcleral application of a radioactive plaque or charged particle irradiation) can be used. Although the two methods of radiotherapy seem equal relative to the development of systemic metastatic lesions, plaque radiotherapy is associated with fewer and less severe local complications. Selected melanomas of the ciliary body and peripheral choroid can be treated by local resection (partial lamellar sclerouvectomy). Local resection has theoretical advantages, but the surgical procedure is associated with potentially greater immediate complications. Enucleation is generally indicated for advanced melanomas that occupy most of the intraocular structures or have caused severe glaucoma. In addition, it is usually recommended for tumors that have invaded the optic nerve. The value of preenucleation radiotherapy in improving patient survival is unproved, although this technique seems reasonable in selected advanced tumors in which enucleation seems inevitable. Orbital exenteration is justified for advanced uveal melanomas with massive extraocular extension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In the retina and possibly in the optic nerve head, carbogen increases blood flow, whereas pure oxygen or high intraocular pressure (IOP) decrease it. This study addresses whether at the papilla of healthy volunteers, the HRF parameter flow, is modulated by breathing 5% carbogen (5% carbon dioxide + 95% oxygen) for 7 minutes, breathing 100% oxygen for 7 minutes, increasing IOP to 50 mm Hg with a suction cup, or decreasing IOP with a single topical ocular instillation of the beta-blockers 0.5% betaxolol (betoptic) or 0.5% timolol (timoptic). At the papilla (20 degrees x 5 degrees, 256 X 64 pixels), values of HRF parameter, flow (50 X 50) pixels, increased after carbogen (N = 5, P < 0.05), but decreased after oxygen (N = 5, P < 0.05) or IOP increase (N = 5, P < 0.01). Although IOP values were significantly reduced by betaxolol (N = 9, P < 0.05) and timolol (N = 9, P < 0.01), HRF values were only significantly decreased (N = 9, P < 0.05) after timolol. In conclusion, at the papilla of healthy volunteers, a positive correlation exists between changes in values of the HRF-parameter, flow, and stimuli considered to modulate retinal and ONH blood flow. Furthermore, although of unkown clinical relevance, it appears that in contrast to betaxolol, values of the HRF parameter, flow, at the papilla of healthy volunteers are significantly decreased after a single instillation of timolol."

These drugs were chosen to demonstrate a range of beta receptor activity. Propanolol is a non-specific beta blocker, affecting beta 1 and beta 2 receptors, dilevalol has beta 1 antagonist and beta 2 agonist effects and salbutamol has beta 2 agonist effects.

CD012223,0,9352246,0,Ocular and systemic reactivity to isoprenaline in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,"There is experimental evidence of decreased beta-adrenergic myocardial sensitivity in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). In the present study we hypothesized that the ocular response to isoprenaline, as a consequence of increased arterial vessel rigidity, might also be blunted in patients with IDDM. We therefore compared the correlation between systemic pulse pressure amplitude (PPA) and fundus pulsation amplitude (FPA) during intravenous isoprenaline administration in 11 otherwise healthy IDDM patients and 11 healthy control subjects. Ocular fundus pulsations were measured by a recently developed laser interferometric method. Isoprenaline increased PPA in both study groups in a dose-dependent way, but the response was significantly less in IDDM patients (at 0.8 microgram min-1: +38% in control subjects, +27% in IDDM patients, P < 0.05 between groups). Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in FPA was observed, which again was more pronounced in healthy subjects (at 0.8 microgram min-1: +45% in controls, +17% in IDDM patients, P < 0.005 between groups). The regression line between PPA and FPA was very close to the 45 degrees line in healthy subjects, whereas it was significantly flattened in IDDM patients. In conclusion, linear regression between PPA and FPA during isoprenaline suggests arterial stiffening in patients with IDDM. Hence, comparison of systemic PPA and FPA during isoprenaline provocation may be a useful method of estimating changes in arterial capacitance in patients with diabetes mellitus."

CD012223,0,21658300,0,Glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is characterised by progressive optic neuropathy and peripheral visual field loss. It affects 1% to 2% of white people aged over 40 years and accounts for 8% of new blind registrations in the UK. The main risk factor for glaucoma is raised intraocular pressure, but 40% of people with glaucoma have normal intraocular pressure and only 10% of people with raised intraocular pressure are at risk of optic-nerve damage. Glaucoma is more prevalent, presents earlier, and is more difficult to control in black people than in white populations."
CD012223,0,24872835,0,The traditional kampo medicine tokishakuyakusan increases ocular blood flow in healthy subjects.,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of oral administration of kampo medical formulas on ocular blood flow (OBF). A crossover protocol was used to randomly administer five grams of yokukansan, tokishakuyakusan (TSS), keishibukuryogan, or hachimijiogan to 13 healthy blinded subjects (mean age: 37.3 ± 12.3 years). The mean blur rate, a quantitative OBF index obtained with laser speckle flowgraphy, was measured at the optic nerve head before and 30 minutes after administration. Blood pressure (BP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were also recorded. No significant changes were observed in mean BP or IOP after the administration of any of the kampo medical formulas. There was a significant increase in OBF 30 minutes after administration of TSS (100% to 103.6 ± 6.9%, P < 0.01). Next, TSS was administered to 19 healthy subjects (mean age: 32.0 ± 11.0 years) and OBF was measured before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after administration. Plain water was used as a control. OBF increased significantly after TSS administration compared to control (P < 0.01) and also increased from 30 to 60 minutes after administration compared to baseline (P < 0.05). These results suggest that TSS can increase OBF without affecting BP or IOP in healthy subjects."

CD012223,0,15513438,0,Advanced nonpenetrating trabeculectomy (advanced NPT) and combined surgery of advanced NPT and phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation.,"We have devised a new glaucoma surgery combining deep sclerectomy with nonpenetrating trabeculectomy (NPT); we call this surgery advanced NPT. We evaluated intraocular pressure (IOP) control, postoperative complication and visual acuity after combined advanced NPT and phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation (combined surgery), and advanced NPT alone. The mean preoperative IOP for the trabeculectomy only group was 22.4 +/- 6.3 mmHg(bleb+), 23.0 +/- 4.9 mmHg(bleb-), and that of the combined surgery group was 18.1 +/- 4.5 mmHg(bleb+), 18.5 +/- 2.6 mmHg(bleb-). Mean postoperative IOP for the two groups were 13.0 +/- 2.3 mmHg(bleb+), 15.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg(bleb-) and 12.9 +/- 2.7 mmHg(bleb+), 13.3 +/- 2.4 mmHg(bleb-), respectively. After 15 months, the success probability for postoperative IOP control were 63%(bleb+), 23%(bleb-) in the advanced NPT only group (<or=12 mmHg), and 60% in the advanced NPT only group, 70% in the combined surgery group (<or=14 mmHg) (Kaplan-Meier survival rate). In early complication, there were significantly fewer cases of shallow anterior chamber, hypertension, hypotension and anterior chamber inflamation in both groups than that of trabeculectomy. Nd:YAG goniopuncture was performed for purposes of better IOP control; preferred performance being within a month after surgery. Regarding visual acuity after either advanced NPT alone or combined surgery, an earlier recovery can be expected than with trabeculectomy. Advanced NPT and combined procedure is a reliable technique for glaucoma and cataract surgery."
CD012223,0,8404359,0,[Prevention of IOP rise following laser iridectomy with topical timolol and indomethacin].,Double-masked study on 40 eyes (40 patients) of primary angle-closure glaucoma demonstrated that topical timolol and indomethacin prevented the IOP rise following combined argon and Nd:YAG laser iridectomy. A combination of the 2 drugs was especially effective in that the number of patients who would have an IOP increase over 1.33 kPa (1 kPa = 7.5 mmHg) above the baseline was reduced by 80%. The mechanism of IOP rise following iridectomy and its prevention were discussed.
CD012223,0,20177955,0,Combined phacoemulsification and viscogoniosynechialysis in the management of patients with chronic angle closure glaucoma.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of phacoemulsification and viscogoniosynechialysis in the management of patients with chronic angle-closure glaucoma (CACG). Fifty-six eyes of 45 recruited patients were classified into two groups: group 1 had medically controlled CACG (IOP <or= 21 mmHg) comprising 35 eyes and group 2 medically uncontrolled CACG (IOP > 21 mmHg with maximum tolerated medications) including 21 eyes. All of the patients had at least one quadrant without peripheral anterior synechia in gonioscopy. After phacoemulsification, a viscoelastic agent was used for viscogoniasynecialysis. Success was defined as IOP <or= 21 mmHg with (relative success) or without (absolute success) medications. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding age and gender. In group 1, the mean IOP and number of medications declined from 16.7 +/- 2.9 to 14.4 +/- 2.9 (P < 0.0001) and 2.6 +/- 0.8 to 0.82 +/- 0.82 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The absolute success rate at the last follow-up (9 +/- 5.3 months) was 40%. In group 2, the mean IOP and number of medications diminished from 27.95 +/- 8.1 to 15.5 +/- 2.8 (P < 0.0001) and 2.9 +/- 0.62 to 1.2 +/- 1.2 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The absolute success rate was 38.1% at the last follow-up (9.5 +/- 5.3 months). Postoperatively, seven patients developed pupillary fibrin formation that was treated using steroids and ND:YAG laser. In the other two patients, the medically unresponsive cystoid macular edema was treated successfully by intravitreal Bevacizumab. Combined phacoemulsification and viscogoniosynechialysis seem to be an effective surgical procedure in the treatment of patients with CACG and angle restoration whether controlled or uncontrolled by medication."

CD012223,0,23737661,0,Fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) remains one of the leading causes of moderate to severe vision loss. Although laser photocoagulation was the standard of care for several years, few patients achieved significant improvements in visual acuity. As a result, several pharmacotherapies and surgeries have been investigated. The fluocinolone acetonide devices are one of the latest therapies considered for the treatment of DME. Despite bringing significant improvements in visual acuity, fluocinolone devices are associated with cataract formation, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and surgery to lower IOP. Due to the risk of complications, fluocinolone acetonide devices should be considered only in cases refractive to first-line therapies. In this review, we evaluate current and emerging therapies for DME, with special emphasis on fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal devices."
CD012223,0,23370602,0,The potential of annexin-labelling for the diagnosis and follow-up of glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in developed countries and is mainly attributable to the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Although several diagnostic tools have been developed to detect and monitor this disease, none has the requisite sensitivity to identify it at a preclinical stage or to perceive small changes in retinal health over short periods. Specifically, irreversible visual changes occur before neuronal damage is discovered. The most widely accepted in vitro assay for apoptotic cells involves the use of fluorescent annexin A5. The radiolabelling of this marker makes it possible to assess, in vivo and non-invasively, various diseases in which the apoptotic process is pivotal, such as myocardial infarction or tumour response to chemotherapy. Recently, a new technique has been developed to visualise directly individual RGCs undergoing apoptosis in the living eye. This DARC (detection of apoptosing retinal cells) technology uses fluorescently labelled annexin A5 to bind apoptosing retinal neurons and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy to detect the marked dying cells. Based on experimental models, DARC has been suggested to offer a direct and quantitative assessment of the retinal condition of patients. A Phase I clinical trial in glaucoma patients is scheduled to start shortly. This technology has the potential to pre-empt the diagnosis of glaucoma prior to visual deterioration, to provide an accurate numeric evaluation highlighting even small retinal changes and to allow the rapid judgement of the efficacy of both current and new therapeutic strategies."
CD012223,0,18035966,0,Glaucoma: a review of adjunctive therapy and new management strategies.,"Glaucoma is a major cause of vision loss throughout the world. Treatment for glaucoma consists of reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) to an acceptable target range to prevent further optic nerve damage. Typically, this involves the selection of a topical IOP-lowering agent. Five major classes of glaucoma medications are presently available for clinical use. These include alpha-adrenergic agonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs), cholinergics and prostaglandin analogs (PGAs). Although beta-blockers enjoyed great success as first-line glaucoma therapy for many years, recently the PGAs have gained favor as the initial treatment of choice for most patients. Although the PGAs offer robust IOP reduction as monotherapy, a significant number of patients will require an adjunctive agent for adequate IOP control. Recent studies have demonstrated that alpha-agonists, beta-blockers and CAIs can be used safely and effectively as adjunctive therapy for patients being treated with a PGA. Comparison studies are beginning to appear in the literature to help determine which adjunctive agent is the most effective when used in combination with a PGA. Additional IOP-lowering efficacy with adjunctive therapy does have limitations, particularly with the addition of a third or fourth agent. For those patients on maximal tolerated medical therapy who still need additional IOP reduction, other available options include laser trabeculoplasty and filtration surgery."

The laser treatment was carried out in only one eye chosen at random, and the fellow eye was used as a control. In the present study we intended to verify the possibility of using electrofunctional techniques to determine the two distinct and, probably, consecutive glaucomatous alterations occurring in ganglion cells: functional (reversible) and anatomical (irreversible). The results obtained indicate that glaucomatous damage is irreversible. We propose that such alterations differ very slightly and that the current electrofunctional techniques may not be sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish between them."

Twenty-two patients scheduled for bilateral trabeculoplasty were treated with an Argon laser in one eye and with Nd-YAG laser in the controlateral eye. Visual acuity, IOP and anterior chamber inflammation (measured with the laser flare-cell meter) were controlled at 0, 3, 6, 18 hours, 2, 4, 7, 14, 30, 90 and 180 days after trabeculoplasty. Our results showed a similar pressure lowering effect in both groups (-24.5 +/- 23% after YLT versus -32.9 +/- 16.3% after ALT at 90 days post-laser; p = 0.26). The anterior chamber inflammation was delayed and more important in the ALT-group (inflammation peaked at 24.8 hours after YLT versus 44.5 hours after ALT; p = 0.034) (maximal mean flare increase: 19.4 +/- 12 pH/msec. after ALT, versus 16.1 +/- 11.4 ph/msec. after YLT). All eyes with inflammation were successfully treated with topical diclofenac QID (Voltaren Ophtha), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. YLT is a safe and effective alternative technique to perform laser trabeculoplasty, which is especially useful in poorly pigmented angles where ALT is known to be less effective."
CD012223,0,11436940,0,Effect of brimonidine tartrate on ocular hemodynamics in healthy volunteers.,"While alpha2-adrenergic agonists, such as brimonidine tartrate, significantly reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP), the presence of vasoconstrictor postsynaptic alpha2 receptors on vascular smooth muscle raise the possibility that brimonidine could potentially compromise ocular blood flow. Consequently, the ocular hemodynamic effects of brimonidine were studied in normal subjects. Twelve healthy volunteers were included in this prospective, double-masked, placebo controlled, crossover-designed clinical trial. They received either brimonidine tartrate 0.2% or placebo b.i.d. for 2 weeks. Goldmann tonometry and color Doppler imaging (CDI) were performed at baseline, at 2 hr, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the treatment. Fundus angiography using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope was performed at baseline and 2 weeks after treatment to determine retinal arteriovenous passage time. Brimonidine lowered IOP at 2 hr, 1 week, and 2 weeks (p = 0.058, p = 0.031, and p = 0.022, respectively). Brimonidine did not affect the retrobulbar arterial velocities measured by CDI, nor retinal arteriovenous passage time. In conclusion, two-week treatment with brimonidine reduces IOP and does not reduce the bulk retinal or retrobulbar arterial perfusion in young healthy volunteers."

According to the obtained results at the initial stage of using the technique in question (the first study group) there was registered a significant growth of IOP (Po) as compared with the preoperative level; besides, the easy discharge coefficient went down during the early postoperative period. However, Po did not exceed the upper norm limit in 92% of cases. The tonographic parameters recovered during 2 months after surgery. As the developed variant of the surgical technique was made use of (the second study group), the obtained results turned out to be better. Fixation of the working heads in the center of the operative field and as far as possible from the ocular sensitive zones was the most important condition of safe surgery. When the optimal surgical technique was combined with preserving a stable layer of viscoelastic during the whole time period of destruction of the nucleus, then it was possible, in the early postoperative period, to avoid an increase of mean Po values and a decrease of the easy discharge coefficient. The maximum values of IOP (Po) were found to be normal in 91.8% of cases. The conducted study proves that the technique, worked out by us, does not cause any pronounced changes in the hydrodynamics of an operated eye, which suggests a more sparing nature of laser action as compared to that of ultrasound."

To compare the efficacy of subthreshold and conventional selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in the patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods. Fifty-two eyes from fifty-two POAG patients were randomized into two groups, one group treated with subthreshold SLT using two-thirds of the conventional energy and the other one treated with the conventional energy. IOP was measured with the Goldmann tonometer and the anterior chamber inflammation was determined using laser flare meter. Results. The initial energy dosage used in subthreshold SLT group was significantly lower than the amount of the energy used in conventional SLT group (0.4 ± 0.1 mJ versus 0.6 ± 0.1 mJ, P = 0.030). The total energy dosage was also significantly lower in subthreshold SLT group compared to the other group (37.6 ± 3.3 mJ versus 51.8 ± 5.7 mJ, P = 0.036). However, the level of inflammation in aqueous humor, amount of reduction in IOP, and the success rate in controlling IOP was the same in both groups. Conclusion. The efficacy of subthreshold SLT group in reducing IOP in POAG patients is comparable to the efficacy of conventional SLT group."

We retrospectively analyzed the tolerability and efficacy of the dexamethasone intravitreal implant in the management of uveitis. Twenty-five patients with uveitic cystoid macular edema were all treated with the Ozurdex(®) dexamethasone intravitreal implant from January 2012 to August 2014. The main outcome measures were visual acuity recovery, changes in macular thickness and resolution of the vitritis. Thirty-two eyes of 25 patients received 52 injections of Ozurdex(®). Both complete regression of the macular edema and resolution of the vitritis occurred in 100 % patients. Visual acuity improved in 62 % of patients: the mean reduction in macular thickness was 252 (±171μm); the mean time between injections was 6.7 (±3.8) months. Secondary ocular hypertension was seen in 33 % of patients. No patient required secondary surgery although a selective laser trabeculoplasty was required for one patient. The dexamethasone intravitreal implant Ozurdex(®) resulted in continuous and complete regression of uveitic cystoid macular edema. It allows evaluation of the potential visual recovery of treated eyes. The tolerability and duration of action provide a rationale for considering Ozurdex(®) as a first-line therapy for uveitis which remains uncontrolled despite optimal systemic treatment."

CD012223,0,22568103,0,[A challenge to primary open-angle glaucoma including normal-pressure. Clinical problems and their scientific solution].,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), including normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), is reported by the Tajimi Study to afflict 3.9% of the total population, and this represents about 80% of all total glaucoma cases which, in total, afflict 5.0% of the population. We tried to analyze the clinical problems relating to POAG by looking at the pathogenesis, intraocular pressure (IOP), therapy, neuroprotection and surgery of the disease. To elucidate the pathogenesis of glaucoma progression, we measured retinal nerve fiber layer defect (RNFLD) angles', and divided the NTG cases into 2 groups, enlarged RNFLD and stable RNFLD. Disc hemorrhages were found to be significantly more frequent in the enlarged group than in the stable group. RNFLD was enlarged in the direction of disc hemorrhage in over 80% of the eyes. In the majority of the eyes of the enlarged group, the enlargement of RNFLD was toward the fovea. The enlargement of RNFLD in NTG was closely associated with disc hemorrhage and the deterioration of the visual field. We developed a simultaneous structure and function evaluation technique combining spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus-oriented perimeters for the detection of visual field abnormalities in the RNFLD area. We superimposed the ganglion cell complex map obtained by SD-OCT on the fundus-oriented perimeter image. We observed very early or preperimetric normal pressure glaucoma as well as disc hemorrhage adjacent to the borders of the RNFLD. The borderline of the RNFLD seemed to be the thinnest RNFL and had the lowest retinal sensitivity (Active site for RNFLD progression). To clarify the role of the circadian clock genes in the generation of a 24-hour IOP rhythm, we used the microneedle method to measure the IOP at eight time points daily, both in wild type mice and Cry-deficient (Cry 1-/-Cry 2-/-) mice. In the wild-type mice living in light-dark conditions, the pressure measured in the light phase was significantly lower than in the dark phase. This biphasic daily rhythm was maintained under dark-dark conditions. In contrast, the Cry-deficient mice did not show significant circadian changes in their IOP, regardless of the environmental light conditions. These findings demonstrate that clock genes are essential for the generation of the circadian rhythm of IOP. We evaluated the relationship between the genetic polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor (ADR) and the diurnal IOP in untreated NTG patients. For Del 301-303 in α2B-ADR, De1322-325 in α2C-ADR, and S 49G (A/G) in βl-ADR, the major homozygotes and minor carriers had parallel diurnal IOP curves, but significantly different diurnal IOP levels. Polymorphisms of the ADR gene may predict the diurnal IOP level of patients with NTG. Looking toward the future, tailor-made medicine in glaucoma therapy, we evaluated the relationship between the polymorphisms of the prostaglandin F2α, receptor (FP receptor) gene and the effectiveness of topical latanoprost treatment in 100 normal volunteers. One SNP(rs3753380) was located in the promoter region of the FP receptor gene and was significantly correlated with % IOP reduction. Two SNPs, rs3753380 and rs3766355 (an SNP in intron 1), were associated with the degree of response to latanoprost. The genotype of these SNPs may be an important determinant of variability in response to latanoprost. To investigate the predictability of IOP response of the fellow eye in a one-eye trials, we compared the correlation of the fellow-eye's IOP response in one-eye trials performed separately for each eye with that of bilateral treatment in 41 normal subjects. Correlation of mean diurnal IOP reduction between 2 one-eye trials was poor (r2 = 0.102), even after subtracting the nontreated eye IOP fluctuations from the treated eye IOPs (r2 = 0.097), but that between fellow eyes in bilateral treatment was excellent (r2 = 0.849). Therefore, we examined the effects of multiple IOP measurements on the correlation of response to glaucoma medication between fellow eyes. Latanoprost was applied to the first eye and then to both eyes of POAG or ocular hypertension patients. IOP measurements were performed twice on different days at baseline, during treatment of the first eye only and for both eyes. No significant correlations of ΔIOP 1 (IOP at baseline-IOP after treatment) between fellow eyes were found. ΔIOP 2 (ΔIOP 1-IOP fluctuation of the contralateral eye) was significantly correlated between the fellow eyes using two post-treatment IOP measurements. Using multiple IOP measurements may improve the prediction of a fellow eye's response to glaucoma medication in one-eye trials. We used a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) for in vivo imaging and counting of rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGC survival decreased gradually after crushing the optic nerve. RGC counts by SLO were comparable to those in retinal flat mounts. We developed OCT system for rat eyes. The mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses in the circumpapillary OCT scans were unchanged 1 week after crushing the optic nerve, but then decreased significantly and progressively after the second week. RNFL thicknesses in OCT images correlated significantly with thicknesses determined histologically. SLO and OCT will be useful for evaluating the effects of neuroprotective drugs. We developed a new glaucoma filtration surgery system using a thin honeycomb-patterned biodegradable film in rabbits. The film had a honeycomb-patterned surface that faced the subconjunctival Tenon tissue, while the other side was smooth. Postoperative IOPs of the film-treated eyes were significantly lower than those of the control eyes, but were not significantly different from those of the MMC-treated eyes. The thin honeycomb-patterned film that was attached to the inner bleb wall worked as an adhesion barrier in glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits."

Areas covered: The injectable intravitreal implant releases fluocinolone acetonide at an average rate of 0.2 µg/day for at least 36 months. The two pooled pivotal FAME trials showed that, in patients with DME previously treated with laser photocoagulation, fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant was more beneficial than sham injection when looking at the proportion of patients with an improvement from baseline in visual acuity of more than 15 letters at 24 months and at 36 months. Cataract (82%) and intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (37%) were the most common adverse events. Raised IOP was mostly treated with IOP-lowering medications, with <5% of eyes requiring incisional IOP-lowering surgery. FAME trial program results are confirmed by a series of real-world studies in eyes with chronic/recalcitrant DME. Expert opinion: data indicate that fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant is a useful second-line option for the treatment of DME."

The evidence in support of the currently widespread use of topical corticosteroids after PRK, however, is limited. We report the results of a prospective, double-masked trial to determine the effect of dexamethasone 0.1% on refraction and anterior stromal haze following -3.00 and -6.00 dioptre PRK procedures (n = 113; minimum follow-up 1 year). Initially the reduction in myopia was significantly greater in the steroid group compared with the placebo group (p < 0.002). However, on discontinuing the corticosteroids at 3 months this difference became statistically insignificant (p > 0.2). There was no statistically significant effect on anterior stromal haze at any stage. We conclude that, in view of their side effects, it would be unacceptable to use topical corticosteroids in the long term to maintain the initial beneficial effect on refraction. We therefore consider that topical corticosteroids should not be used following PRK."

All patients had intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥24 mm Hg in one eye and >21 mm Hg in the other eye, normal visual fields (VFs) and normal optic disc (OD) appearance in both eyes at baseline. All OHT patients were untreated at baseline with subsequent treatment upon need according to clinical judgement. Only one eye per subject was randomly selected. Patient age, gender, IOP, central corneal thickness (CCT), and ibopamine test results were collected at baseline. All patients underwent standard automated perimetry, short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP), frequency-doubling technology, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO), and scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) at baseline and every 6 months thereafter. Main outcome measure was the conversion to POAG, defined as the development of reproducible VF and/or OD abnormalities attributable to glaucoma. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the baseline factors predictive of POAG conversion.ResultsDuring the 10-year follow-up, 25% of eyes converted to POAG. In multivariate Cox models, baseline factors that were significant predictors of POAG development included: older age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.0, 99% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.0-1.2, per 1 year older); SWAP Glaucoma Hemifield test 'outside normal limits' (HR 4.3, 99% CIs 1.2-17.9); greater SLP 'Inter-eye Symmetry' (HR 1.1, 99% CIs 0.4-3.0, per 1 unit lower); lower CSLO Rim Volume (HR 1.1, 99% CIs 0.3-3.2, per 0.1 mm(3) lower); and greater CSLO cup-to-disc ratio (HR 6.0, 99% CIs 3.6-16.8, per 0.1 unit greater).ConclusionsThe baseline parameters that proved to be useful in assessing the likelihood of an OHT patient to develop POAG included age, functional variables provided by SWAP, and structural variables provided by SLP and CSLO. In this cohort of patients, baseline IOP, CCT, and ibopamine provocative test results were not significant predictors of POAG conversion."

Eighty-four patients were enrolled into the study: 44 eyes of 24 patients with mild to moderate AD (Group 1), 68 eyes of 35 patients with glaucoma (Group 2), and 49 eyes of 25 heathy volunteers as a control (Group 3). A complete ophthalmologic examination as well as a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopic assessment with HRT III were performed on all patients. Mean values of the ONH topographic parameters such as rim area (RA), rim volume (RV), height variation contour, linear cup/disc ratio, cup shape measure, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) were recorded. Mean values of RNFL thickness was 0.23 ± 0.07 in AD, 0.22 ± 0.09 in glaucoma and 0.24 ± 0.07 in the control group (p = 0.323). RA and RV were significantly lower, and linear C/D ratio was significantly higher in the glaucoma group when compared to AD and control (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between AD and control for the optic disc parameters tested (p > 0.05). We observed a negative correlation of the age with RNFL in all of the groups (p < 0.005). Age was the most important parameter affecting RNFL.

CD012223,0,22428185,0,Ranibizumab and diabetic macular oedema: after laser therapy.,"Diabetic retinopathy is sometimes accompanied by macular oedema, leading to a marked decline in visual acuity. The standard treatment, in addition to glycaemic and blood pressure control, is laser photocoagulation, despite its modest efficacy. Ranibizumab (Lucentis, Novartis), a VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitor, was initially authorised for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the European Union. It is now also approved for the treatment of visual loss due to macular oedema in diabetic patients. In this setting, clinical evaluation of ranibizumab is mainly based on two double-blind randomised trials comparing ranibizumab + laser photocoagulation versus placebo + laser photo-coagulation in a total of about 1000 patients. Compared with placebo, addition of ranibizumab to laser therapy led to a marked improvement in visual acuity in approximately 15% of patients after 12 months of treatment. The improvement appeared to persist after 24 months of treatment. In a trial that included a group treated with ranibizumab alone, efficacy did not differ from that of the ranibizumab + laser combination. Uncertainties remain concerning the long-term efficacy of ranibizumab and its benefits in patients with poorly controlled diabetes or proliferative retinopathy. The adverse effect profile of ranibizumab in patients with diabetic macular oedema is similar to that reported in patients with AMD, and mainly includes ocular adverse effects such as pain, bleeding and increased intraocular pressure. A risk of systemic adverse effects, particularly cardiovascular disorders, should be kept in mind in case of long-term treatment.

Although glaucoma drops are proven to work well to lower intraocular pressure, slow the conversion from ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of disease in early open angle glaucoma, adherence to treatment is likely optimum in the randomized clinical trials that support these claims. In real-world scenarios, medical therapy often fails and practitioners are forced to proceed with more invasive treatment modalities to slow the progression of this blinding disease.

Arrival times in retinal vessels were assessed from digitized scanning laser fluorescein angiograms. The arrival times were assessed as a function of position (juxtamural versus axial) in the vessel. This differentiation, based on the measurement position in the vessel, enabled the estimation of AVP times of the posterior pole and of the peripheral retina. The overall, juxtamural and axial AVP times were prolonged in POAG as compared to both N and NPG (P<0.03). The difference in axial AVP times between POAG and normal subjects was considerably larger than the juxtamural values. The distribution of AVP times was considerably larger in POAG patients than in N subjects and NPG patients. Retinal AVP times are prolonged in POAG patients as compared to N and NPG. The wider distribution of AVP times in POAG patients may point to a generalized microvascular alteration. Since the axial AVP times seem to provide the largest differences between NPG and POAG patients, this measurement may be preferred over more general AVP times. The axial AVP times may possibly reflect peripheral vascular changes, e.g. increased vascular resistance. The underlying mechanisms causing these differences are at present unknown."

CD012223,0,20812500,0,[Treatment modalities in central retinal vein occlusion].,"Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) remains one of the most common retinal vascular disorders that may lead to blindness. The etiology is unknown, however, predisposing factors such as hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis and hypercoagulable states have all been described. Local ophthalmic illnesses such as open angle glaucoma, ocular trauma and orbital infections have also been suggested as causative. CRVO can be subdivided into two clinical types, ischemic and non-ischemic. The non-ischemic type comprises the milder form of the disease with partial venous obstruction and good visual outcome. Ischemic CRVO is the severe form and is associated with visual loss, because of nearly total retinal vein obstruction and poor perfusion to retina. In addition, patients with ischemic CRVO may end up with additional complications such as neovascular glaucoma that may lead to blindness. Over 90% of CRVO occurs in patients > 65 years. The presenting symptom is a sudden painless mono-ocular decrease in visual acuity which could result from macular edema, ischemia, or intraocular bleeding. Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals macular edema, retinal bleeding (more peripheral), tortuous vein dilatation and swollen disc. Current treatment modalities include systemic use of anticoagulation drugs, local treatments including laser, intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor and surgery (vitrectomy). This review presents the current therapeutic modalities in CRVO."

CD012223,0,21712182,0,[Diabetic neovascularisation and secondary glaucoma].,"Neovascular glaucoma develops from intraocular neovascularisation in diabetes mellitus. Neovascularisation is a consequence of hypoxia-induced production of vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Neovascular glaucoma is one of the most serious, sight-threatening late complications of diabetes. Several intraocular pressure lowering drugs, surgical and adjunctive laser treatments have been used to treat this disease, but the efficacy of the interventions is limited. The role of vascular endothelial growth factor-A blocking therapy in the treatment of neovascular glaucoma remains to be determined. Development of neovascularisation, however, can be prevented with adequate long-term glycemic and lipid control, effective treatment of arterial hypertension and optimal timing of adequate panretinal photocoagulation, in the majority of the cases. Unfortunately, in clinical practice diabetic neovascular glaucoma is more frequently experienced in Hungary than would be expected based on the variety of available therapeutic possibilities.

CD012223,0,8470979,1,A comparison of two energy levels for noncontact transscleral neodymium-YAG cyclophotocoagulation.,"In a prospective, clinical trial, 89 patients undergoing transscleral neodymium-YAG cyclophotocoagulation for intractable glaucoma were randomized to approximately 4 or 8 J of laser energy per application and followed up for an average of 1 year. The only statistically significant difference between the two groups was early anterior chamber reaction, which was more severe among those receiving 8 J. There was a trend toward better intraocular pressure control in the 8-J group, compared with the 4-J group, with 33 (75%) of 44 patients and 27 (60%) of 45 patients, respectively, requiring no further surgical intervention during the follow-up period. Among those patients not requiring further surgery, there was no significant difference in final visual acuities between the two groups. These findings suggest that within the range of 4 to 8 J, transscleral neodymium-YAG cyclophotocoagulation at the higher energy level may have some advantage with regard to intraocular pressure reduction without an increased risk of visual loss, compared with the same treatment at the lower energy level."

CD012223,0,3222045,0,Role of Nd:YAG peripheral iridectomy in the management of ocular hypertension with a narrow angle.,"One half of 20 patients (40 eyes) with ocular hypertension and occludable angles, some with peripheral anterior synechiae, were randomly assigned for treatment by Nd:YAG laser iridotomy. Pre-randomization patients required pilocarpine to maintain normal intraocular tension. Following laser treatment, all eyes were followed a minimum of 12 months (mean of 24). In the nonlaser-treated group, pilocarpine alone controlled intraocular pressure. In the laser treated group, eyes without peripheral anterior synechiae required fewer medications to maintain normal pressures while eyes with peripheral anterior synechiae required more. Although relief of pupillary block by laser iridotomy can facilitate management of this group of patients, preexisting peripheral anterior synechiae may be associated with greater therapeutic requirements following laser treatment."

Proforma regarding socio-economic status and the patients' reaction to long-term medication were recorded. Though the objective and subjective effects of long term medication were negligible the financial constraints were considerable. More than 70% patient would prefer laser's and surgery because of the cumbersome schedule and financial burden. The visit to the clinic was a time consuming process suggesting a lack of adequate glaucoma follow-up at the peripheral level. The study reflects a need for reorientation of glaucoma management."

The authors reviewed 36 eyes of 30 SWS patients with either early or late-onset glaucoma with a mean follow-up of 122 months (range, 24-253 months). Intervals between required surgical or medical interventions were analyzed. Intervention was attributed to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in 55% of cases and disc change in 45%. Median stable postoperative interval with goniotomy was 12 months; with trabeculotomy, 21 months; with trabeculectomy, 34 months; with argon laser trabeculoplasty, 25 months; and with medications, 57 months. Survival analysis shows statistically significant differences between goniotomy and medications. Intraoperative choroidal expansions developed in 24% of cases receiving a trabeculectomy, and none developed with either goniotomy or trabeculotomy."
CD012223,0,2092166,0,Intraocular pressure following peritomy and wet-field coagulation.,"The changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) following peritomy and wet-field coagulation of 10 rabbit eyes and 7 human cataractous eyes were investigated. The IOP difference before and after 180-degree and 360-degree wet-field coagulation on rabbit eyes showed an average increase of 11.0 +/- 5.8 mmHg and 25.8 +/- 7.1 mmHg(mean +/- SD), respectively (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01). The IOP of both groups in rabbit eyes were elevated for 2 to 3 days postoperatively and then became normal by the 7th postoperative day. The IOP difference before and after 180-degree peritomy and wet-field coagulation in human cataractous eyes showed an average increase of 8.4 +/- 5.8 mmHg(mean +/- SD)(p less than 0.05). The outflow facility was poor immediately following wet-field coagulation but then improved gradually by means of tonography and concentration changes of anterior chamber neutral-red. Histologically, there was endothelial cell damage, congestion, and red blood cell extravasation of the episcleral and intrascleral vessels at one day after wet-field coagulation in the light microscopic findings. Recanalization of the episcleral and intrascleral capillaries was noted 3 days after wet-field coagulation and was completed 3 weeks after wet-field coagulation. There was poor plastic infusion through the trabecular spaces in the one-day postoperative group compared to the control group by scanning electron micrograph. In conclusion, we have to bear in mind the possibility of an IOP rise after wet-field coagulation following peritomy for cataract and retinal surgery."

CD012223,0,24092458,0,Visual and anatomical outcomes after silicone oil removal in patients with complex retinal detachment.,"To evaluate outcomes of temporary silicone oil (SO) tamponade in patients with complex retinal detachment. A retrospective study of 184 eyes of 177 consecutive patients who underwent SO removal (SOR) by one surgeon between 2000 and 2010. Indications for the use of SO were proliferative vitreoretinopathy (56 eyes), difficult rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) (58 eyes), diabetic traction retinal detachment (DTRD) (29 eyes), RRD due to macular hole in highly myopic eyes (16 eyes), giant retinal tears (13 eyes), and RRD after penetrating trauma (12 eyes). All eyes underwent prophylactic 360° laser retinopexy and encircling buckle at the time of primary surgery. The mean duration of SO tamponade was 47 weeks, with a mean follow-up of 66.9 weeks after SOR. Anatomical success after SOR was achieved in 96.73 %. Final visual outcome of ≥20/200 was significantly higher in eyes with RRD compared to eyes with DTRD. Young age (≤16 years), performance of pars plana lensectomy at primary procedure and presence of pseudophakia at last follow-up were factors associated with good visual outcome in eyes with RRD. Factors predicting attached retina at last follow-up were older age (>16 years), normal intraocular pressure (IOP) at initial presentation and no relaxing retinotomy performed during the primary procedure in eyes with RRD. Complications were cataract (100 %) in phakic eyes, increased IOP (15.7 %), keratopathy (3.8 %), and hypotony (2.1 %). The low redetachment rate after SOR in the present study might be due to prophylactic 360° retinopexy and use of encircling buckles at time of primary retinal reattachment."

Double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Fifteen male AMD patients received a dose of 100 mg of sildenafil or matching placebo on two separate days. Laser Doppler flowmetry was performed to assess relative choroidal blood velocity (ChB(Vel)), volume (ChB(Vol)) and flow (ChB(Flow)) in the study eye prior to administration of the drug at baseline and 30, 90, 180, 300 min after dosing. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity (CS), mean arterial blood pressure (BPm), heart rate (HR), intraocular pressure (IOP) and ocular perfusion pressure (PP) were determined. In comparison to placebo, sildenafil did not cause any statistically significant changes in mean ChB(Vel) (ANOVA, P=0.12), ChB(Vol) (ANOVA, P=0.24) or ChB(Flow) (ANOVA, P=0.46). There were no statistically significant changes in CS (ANOVA, P=0.59), BCVA (P=0.58), IOP (P=0.81) or HR (P=0.07) throughout the study. Significant decreases in BPm (P=0.006) and PP (P=0.006) were observed at 30 min after sildenafil.

The photodisruption of iris tissued produced by the Nd YAG produces a quicker more efficient iridectomy than the thermal effect of the argon laser with less tendency to healing and inflammation. We conclude that Neodymium YAG laser iridectomy is a safe effective alternative to argon laser iridectomy with no increase in complications during the follow up period and is preferred by the patients.

Intermediate follow-up.,"Noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG laser thermal mode cyclocoagulation is known to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). Thirty-five eyes were treated at a mean of 2.5 Joules and followed for a mean of 28 months. The mean preoperative IOP of 39.8 mmHg (standard deviation, 11.7) was consistently decreased by 45% to 55% over the follow-up period (standard deviation, 19.9 to 30.8), along with a significant reduction of medical therapy. This effect is comparable with that obtained by investigators using much higher energy levels. Successful control was defined as IOP between 5 and 21 mmHg for eyes with visual acuity of counting fingers or better, between 5 and 25 mmHg for eyes with hand motions to light perception, and as control of ocular pain for eyes with no light perception; 71% to 75% of the eyes were successfully controlled for up to 3 years. The use of lower energy levels appears to be associated with a lower incidence of vision loss and, therefore, merits further controlled investigation."

Anti-VEGF treatment such as ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept improved vision by 13.9-16.2 letters (best-corrected visual acuity) after 12 months versus baseline in patients with macular edema secondary to CRVO. A long-term study showed that reduced follow-up and fewer retreatments resulted in worsening visual acuity. Intravitreal therapy with anti-inflammatory agents stabilized visual acuity in CRVO. However, increased intraocular pressure and cataract progression were frequently observed. Anti-VEGF agents such as ranibizumab or bevacizumab improved visual acuity by 15.5-18.3 letters in patients with macular edema secondary to BRVO after 12 months. The improved vision remained during the long-term follow-up. There was no significant difference between standard care and intravitreal triamcinolone groups in BRVO, and increased intraocular pressure and cataract progression occurred frequently in the triamcinolone group. Anti-VEGF intravitreal administration resulted in good vision in CRVO and BRVO patients and is employed as a primary therapy.

Laser cyclophotocoagulation is able to lower IOP in such refractory glaucoma eyes and may make the surgical event safer. This study assessed diode laser cyclophotocoagulation (DLCP) when used as a temporary measure for lowering IOP prior to performing trabeculectomy. This study is a  retrospective analysis of cases planned for trabeculectomy surgery, uncontrolled on maximally tolerable systemic anti-glaucoma medications. They were analysed for response to DLCP in terms of IOP control, vision-related complications, increased inflammation, post-trabeculectomy hypotony and chances of phthisis and ciliary shutdown. Twelve eyes of ten patients aged 35-65 years were identified and all followed up for at least 2 years. One week following DLCP, the IOP (mean ± SD) declined by 51 % from 46.8 ± 5.4 to 22.8 ± 3.3 mmHg. The IOP was further reduced to 15.4 ± 2.7 mmHg at 4 weeks after trabeculectomy; it remained in the mid-teens for a minimum of 2 years in all cases. The mean (±SD) visual acuity improved from 1.4 ± 0.4 to 0.8 ± 0.4 LogMAR equivalents following trabeculectomy. In four eyes, phacoemulsification was performed 5-7 months after trabeculectomy with improvement in best-corrected visual acuity. One patient developed transient hypotony, post-trabeculectomy, which resolved by 6 days. There were no other complications like increased inflammation, prolonged hypotony or suprachoroidal haemorrhage. DLCP is, thus, effective and safe for temporarily controlling IOP; thereby trabeculectomy can be performed in a quieter ocular milieu."

CD012223,0,27270337,0,Caffeine administration prevents retinal neuroinflammation and loss of retinal ganglion cells in an animal model of glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, being characterized by progressive optic nerve damage and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), accompanied by increased inflammatory response involving retinal microglial cells. The etiology of glaucoma is still unknown, and despite elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) being a major risk factor, the exact mechanisms responsible for RGC degeneration remain unknown. Caffeine, which is an antagonist of adenosine receptors, is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug in the world. Several evidences suggest that caffeine can attenuate the neuroinflammatory responses and afford protection upon central nervous system (CNS) injury. We took advantage of a well characterized animal model of glaucoma to investigate whether caffeine administration controls neuroinflammation and elicits neuroprotection. Caffeine or water were administered ad libitum and ocular hypertension (OHT) was induced by laser photocoagulation of the limbal veins in Sprague Dawley rats. Herein, we show that caffeine is able to partially decrease the IOP in ocular hypertensive animals. More importantly, we found that drinking caffeine prevented retinal microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response and attenuated the loss of RGCs in animals with ocular hypertension (OHT). This study opens the possibility that caffeine or adenosine receptor antagonists might be a therapeutic option to manage RGC loss in glaucoma."

CD012223,0,19920476,0,Influence of treatment protocol on the long-term efficacy of argon laser trabeculoplasty.,"Forty-five phakic eyes of 36 patients with open-angle glaucoma and uncontrolled intraocular pressure despite maximally tolerated medication underwent initial argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) in 1981 and 1982 as part of a prospective, randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment standards. Each eye had been randomly assigned to receive either 100 laser applications over 360 degrees of trabecular meshwork, 50 applications over 180 degrees , or 50 applications over 360 degrees in a single session. Further treatment in each group was based on clinical standards prevailing at the time. The long-term results were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. By 4 years after initial ALT, six of the 15 remaining eyes in group 1 (40%), one of 14 eyes in group 2 (7%), and two of 13 eyes in group 3 (15%) had undergone filtration surgery, and one eye in group 1 (7%), three eyes in group 2 (21%), and three eyes in group 3 (23%) had received further ALT. By 7 years after initial ALT, seven of the nine remaining eyes in group 1 (78%), one of 12 eyes in group 2 (8%), and four of 12 eyes in group 3 (33%) received filtration surgery, and two eyes in group 1 (22%), three eyes in group 2 (25%), and four eyes in group 3 (33%) had received further ALT. Kaplan-Meier survival curves predict the following probabilities of avoiding either repeat ALT or filtration surgery at 4 years after an initial ALT: group 1, 54 +/- 12%; group 2, 76 +/- 12%; and group 3, 62 +/- 11%. Our results suggest that performing 50 rather than 100 burns at initial ALT may significantly delay the need for additional surgical or repeat laser intervention."
CD012223,0,11760033,0,Comparison of 0.1% dexamethasone phosphate eye gel (Dexagel) and 1% prednisolone acetate eye suspension in the treatment of post-operative inflammation after cataract surgery.,"A prospective, multi-centre, clinical parallel group study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of a new 0.1% dexamethasone phosphate eye gel (Group 1, n= 117) compared to 1% prednisolone acetate eye suspension (Group 2I, n=119) in a total of 236 patients (safety population), aged 39-92 years, following cataract surgery. Both drugs were given four times a day for 14 days starting 24+/-4 h after surgery. Criteria for evaluation were the reduction in anterior chamber flare and inflammation severity score (primary efficacy criteria) as well as different secondary efficacy and safety evaluation criteria. Laser photometry (LFM-500, Kowa), slit lamp assessment and the examination of other objective and subjective symptoms of ocular discomfort were performed between the last preoperative and 14th post-operative day. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups concerning primary and secondary efficacy criteria. The mean reduction in anterior chamber flare from day 1 to day 14 post-operatively was 8.34+/-20.80 photons/ms with 0.1% dexamethasone eye gel and 5.72+/-16.70 photons/ms with 1% prednisolone eye suspension.

To compare the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone (IVT) and intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB), both combined with grid laser photocoagulation (GLP) for macular edema (ME) secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Methods. Retrospective, comparative study. The newly diagnosed patients with ME secondary to BRVO who were treated with IVT and GLP or IVB and GLP were included. The main outcome measures were changed in the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) from the baseline to month 24. Results. Ninety-nine eyes of 99 patients were included. The change in BCVA was not statistically different in any time points between the two groups (P > 0.05, for all). The change in CRT was not statistically different in any time points between the two groups (P > 0.05, for all). The mean number of injections at month 24 was 2.38 ± 1.06 in the IVT+GLP group and 4.17 ± 1.30 in the IVB+GLP group (P = 0.0001). The need for cataract surgery (P = 0.01) and secondary glaucoma (P = 0.03) occurrence were more common in IVT group. Conclusion. Both treatment modalities were effective in the treatment of ME secondary to BRVO. The number of injections was significantly lower in the IVT group than in the IVB group; however cataract and secondary glaucoma were more frequent in the IVT+GLP group than in the IVB+GLP group."

CD012223,0,18571958,0,Choroidal effusion after diode laser cyclophotocoagulation in Sturge-Weber syndrome.,"Sturge-Weber syndrome is complicated by glaucoma in 30% of patients; of these, 60% develop glaucoma in infancy and 40%, in childhood. Medical treatment often fails to adequately control IOP in these patients, and surgical intervention is frequently necessary. Filtration surgery may be complicated by expulsive choroidal hemorrhage and massive choroidal effusion, more often in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome compared with other patients presenting with glaucoma, particularly in eyes with choroidal hemangioma, because the rapid decrease in IOP during surgery may induce the transudation of fluid from a fragile vessel in the choroidal hemangioma, leading to the development of choroidal effusion. When the risk of drainage surgery is considered too high, diode laser cyclophotocoagulation may, in theory, be a safer treatment to lower the IOP. Our case illustrates that significant but transient choroidal effusions can still occur after diode laser procedure."

In the first experiment, normalized blur (NB), a quantitative index of peripheral blood velocity, was measured every 0.125 sec in an area located in the temporal site of ONH free of visible surface vessels and averaged over 5 pulses (mean NB) in both eyes before, 1.5, 3, and 4.5 hours after a 30 microliters instillation of placebo to serve as a control. Intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate (PR) were also measured. In the second experiment, a 30 microliters drop of 2% carteolol (n = 6) or 0.1% dipivefrine (n = 7) was instilled in one randomly chosen eye and the placebo for each drug in the other eye, and the above parameters were measured according to the same time schedule as in the first experiment in a double masked manner. After topical carteolol, carteolol concentration in the plasma (CC) was also measured. In the control experiments, none of the parameters showed any significant change. After topical carteolol, the IOP was significantly lower between 1.5 and 4.5 hrs in the carteolol-treated eyes and at 1.5 and 4.5 hrs in the fellow eyes as compared with that obtained in the control experiment. The mean NB was significantly higher at 3 hrs (23.1%) in carteolol-treated eyes, and at 3 hrs (17.2%) in the fellow eyes, as compared with that obtained in the control experiment (p < 0.05). BP and PR showed little change. The maximum CC at 3 hrs averaged 522 pg/ml. Thus a single instillation of carteolol may increase the tissue blood velocity in ONH in the human eye. After topical dipivefrine, the IOP was significantly lower at 4.5 hr in the dipivefrine-treated eyes than that obtained in the control experiment (p < 0.05). Mean NB, BP and PR showed no significant change."

A randomized, prospective study.","Seventy-seven eyes with primary open angle glaucoma and exfoliation glaucoma were subjected to laser trabeculoplasty and followed in a prospective way. The full 360 degrees circumference was treated, but the patients were randomized in two groups: In group 1 the full treatment was given in one session, and in group 2 it was divided into two sessions one month apart. During the follow-up time of 3 to 18 (mean: 12) months both methods of treatment gave the same reduction of IOP. The only three cases with high post-operative transient pressure spike-occurred in group 1. Although this difference of course not is statistically significant it is in agreement with other studies suggesting that a two-session approach might be safer than treating the full circumference in one session. One month after the laser treatment the eyes of group 1, where the full circumference of the trabecular meshwork had been treated, showed only a slightly larger pressure reduction (not statistically significant) than the eyes of group 2 one month after treating 180 degrees of the meshwork."

Forty-eight patients were allocated into treated and control groups by a random procedure 3 months after their first visual symptoms. For the analysis they were subdivided into (1) ischaemic type, and (2) hyperpermeability-response macular-oedema type of central retinal vein occlusion. In neither group did treatment confer benefit as far as visual acuity was concerned. However, iris, disc, and retinal neovascularisation improved after treatment in the ischaemic group. In addition none of the treated patients progressed to neovascular glaucoma. Macular-oedema improved in treated patients with the hyperpermeability response, but the visual field was affected and atrophic changes at the macular precluded visual improvement. It is concluded that photocoagulation should be used only to prevent complications in the ischaemic type of central retinal vein occlusion. It does not appear to be of value in the hyperpermeability group."

Slit-lamp cell evaluation was correlated with LFP-measured flare in a masked fashion in HLA-B27-related uveitis patients receiving standard topical therapy. At the time of 50 and 90% LFP flare reduction, the corresponding reduction of cells was recorded and statistically compared using the sign test. Forty-three episodes (in 43 patients) of acute anterior HLA-B27-related uveitis were included. LFP flare reduction and slit-lamp cell reduction were strongly correlated. LFP was significantly more sensitive for both 50% (P = 0.001) and 90% (P = 0.02) LFP flare reduction in assessing the decrease of anterior chamber inflammation. LFP was superior to slit-lamp cell evaluation in monitoring anterior chamber inflammation in uveitis.

CD012223,0,12535870,0,Propranolol and atropine do not alter choroidal blood flow regulation during isometric exercise in healthy humans.,"Recent studies indicate that the human choroid has a considerable capacity to keep blood flow constant despite exercise-induced increases in perfusion pressure. The mechanisms underlying this vasoconstrictor response remain unclear. We hypothesized that pharmacological modulation of the autonomic nervous system may alter the choroidal pressure/flow relationship during squatting. To test this hypothesis, we performed a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study in 15 healthy male volunteers. Subjects received, on different study days, intravenous infusions of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, or placebo. During these infusions, subjects performed squatting for 6 min. Choroidal blood flow was assessed with laser Doppler flowmetry and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated from mean arterial pressure and intraocular pressure. As expected, propranolol reduced basal pulse rate, whereas atropine increased pulse rate, indicating that the drugs were administered at systemically effective doses. None of the drugs altered the choroidal pressure/flow relationship during isometric exercise. These data indicate that the regulatory vasoconstrictor capacity of the choroid during exercise is not affected by systemic blockade of beta-adrenoceptors or muscarinic receptors."

A retrospective chart review of 6 consecutive cases of NVG was performed. The follow-up period was 3-19 months (average, 9.7 months). All patients received 1.25 mg (0.05 cc) of IVB followed by panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) approximately 1 week later. In all cases, there was a complete regression of iris and anterior chamber angle neovascularization. However, 2 eyes showed a recurrence of neovascularization; in 1 case, it recurred after 3 months, and in the second, after 5 months. These patients received another IVB injection followed by additional PRP, which resulted in the resolution of the recurrent neovascularization. Glaucoma was controlled with topical eye drops alone in patients who had iris and angle neovascularization without peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). However, patients with PAS at the time of presentation needed subsequent glaucoma surgery. Our study suggests that IVB may be a valuable addition in the treatment of NVG by hastening the resolution of anterior segment neovascularization, improving the results of glaucoma surgeries, and appears to give long-term control when used in combination with PRP."
CD012223,0,3404551,0,A review of surgical alternatives to medical therapy for glaucoma.,"Results of four uncontrolled studies, with short-term follow-up, of argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) as initial treatment for various open-angle glaucomas indicate short-term success varies from 65 to 90 percent. The success rates are less impressive when the definition of success, usually intraocular pressure 22 mmHg or less, and the short follow-up, usually limited to months, are considered. The ongoing, multicenter, random-assignment, controlled Glaucoma Laser Trial in the United States will provide additional information about short- and long-term follow-up of primary ALT that will clarify the accuracy of the results of these preliminary trials.Results of another study suggest that initial filtering surgery is as effective at controlling intraocular pressure and preserving visual function as medical treatment for newly diagnosed glaucoma. All these clinical studies are difficult to interpret and suffer from the lack of data analysis using the life-table method. The comparatively low rate of long-term success of ALT for open-angle glaucoma performed after failure of medical management, particularly in blacks, cautions that ALT may not be a good substitute for medications or filtering surgery in newly diagnosed glaucoma."

MMC, a highly toxic drug, is not without drawbacks and complications such as corneal damage. To ascertain a possible relationship between a level of endothelial permeability (Pac) and concentrations of MMC used, we performed, in a prospective study, trabeculectomies in cases of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), younger than 50 years, with either concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml of MMC (group 1: 11 eyes) or 0.2 mg/ml of MMC (group 2: 10 eyes). Group 3 consisted of 8 patients after a typical trabeculectomy without MMC and served as a control group (8 eyes). In all groups, before surgery and again 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery, corneal endothelial permeability (Pac) was determined by using anterior segment fluorophotometry (Fluorotron Master). The thickness of the cornea (CT) was measured with a DGH Technology ultrasonic pachymeter. One month after surgery the mean values of Pac were statistically significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 (group 1: 4.78 x 10(-4) cm/min, group 2: 4.67 x 10(-4) cm/min) in comparison with the control group (group 3: 3.37 x 10(-4) cm/min), but the differences between groups 1 and 2 were not statistically significant (p = 0.05). Six months after operation the mean values of Pac in all groups were normalized. In eyes that underwent trabeculectomy with MMC, higher concentrations of MMC were likely to have a transient adverse effect on corneal endothelial permeability. In light of the resulting toxic intraocular effect of MMC, the damage in the function of the corneal endothelial barrier is greater with greater concentrations of MMC."
CD012223,0,2895782,0,Management of open-angle glaucoma.,"Open-angle glaucoma is a non-curable, blinding disease which has its best prognosis when management begins at its earliest onset. Recent studies, such as those demonstrating axonal loss before functional or physical changes occur, will have an effect on the current standard of management. This includes indications for initiating treatment as well as what constitutes controlled intraocular pressure. Pharmacological management is often difficult due to drug tolerance and compliance problems. Some types of secondary open angle glaucomas respond very poorly to treatment. Hence, an accurate diagnosis is imperative to proper management. Principles underlying pharmacological management are discussed. When pharmacological management fails, laser and/or surgical intervention is required to prevent further vision loss."
CD012223,0,29897635,0,Iridotomy to slow progression of visual field loss in angle-closure glaucoma.,"Primary angle-closure glaucoma is a type of glaucoma associated with a physically obstructed anterior chamber angle. Obstruction of the anterior chamber angle blocks drainage of fluids (aqueous humor) within the eye and may raise intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated IOP is associated with glaucomatous optic nerve damage and visual field loss. Laser peripheral iridotomy (often just called 'iridotomy') is a procedure to eliminate pupillary block by allowing aqueous humor to pass directly from the posterior to anterior chamber through use of a laser to create a hole in the iris. It is commonly used to treat patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma, patients with primary angle closure (narrow angles and no signs of glaucomatous optic neuropathy), and patients who are primary angle-closure suspects (patients with reversible obstruction). The effectiveness of iridotomy on slowing progression of visual field loss, however, is uncertain."

Full thickness sclerostomies, and sclerostomies guarded by a smaller internal ostium can be created. A pilot therapeutic trial was conducted in pseudophakic patients with advanced open angle glaucoma. Six full thickness sclerostomies (200 microns and 400 microns diameter) and three guarded sclerostomies were created in nine patients by 193 nm excimer laser ablation (fluence per pulse 400 mJ/cm2, pulse rate 16 Hz, air jet pressure intraocular pressure +25 mm Hg). After 6 months' follow up, intraocular pressure was controlled (< or = 16 mm Hg) in eight of the nine patients (6/9 without medication). Early postoperative complications included hyphaema (trace--2.5 mm) (6/9), temporary fibrinous sclerostomy occlusion (4/9), profound early hypotony (all patients without fibrinous occlusion), and suprachoroidal haemorrhage in one case. Conjunctival laser wounds were self sealing.

For the past month, he had been prescribed topical steroid and anti-glaucomatous medication. He had undergone LASIK for both eyes 5 years earlier, and had suffered uveitis attacks in his left eye over the last 2 years.Slit-lamp examination revealed stromal haziness with interface fluid accumulation in the left eye. The left eye showed an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 35 mm Hg and visual acuity of 6/20. Anterior segment ocular coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed the diagnosis of PISK. Steroid treatment was tapered, and latanoprost treatment was started. One month later, the patient's symptoms resolved, with IOP reduced to 10 mm Hg and visual acuity increased to 6/6 in the left eye. Latanoprost treatment was discontinued to avoid potential uveitis reactivation, and the patient's visual field defect progressed and IOP rebounded.

CD012223,0,26136215,0,Pharmacotherapy and Adherence Issues in Treating Elderly Patients with Glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of visual morbidity throughout the world and is an age-related condition, the prevalence of which rises significantly with increasing age. Glaucoma, a condition affecting the optic nerve, has a variety of subtypes with multiple aetiological factors, the most important of which are intraocular pressure (IOP) and increasing age. Treatment by lowering of IOP is the only current method, for which there is evidence, by which the rate of progressive visual deterioration can be slowed or halted. Although there are surgical and laser treatments that are efficacious in lowering IOP, the most common manner in which patients with glaucoma control their IOP is with administration of daily topical ocular hypotensive drugs (eye drops). The variety of topical drugs utilised in the management of glaucoma all have the potential to have adverse effects and/or interactions with concomitant medications, many of which may be used for other age-related conditions. Adherence with appropriate medicines has a major effect on the outcome of medical conditions and this aspect applies to the management of glaucoma. There are certain specific issues that relate to the administration of topical agents, with respect to both adverse effects and adherence. Although many suspect poor adherence in elderly patients with glaucoma, relative to younger patients, adequate evidence for this is lacking. Furthermore, the manner by which adherence issues could be improved remains inadequately understood and poorly addressed. The aims of this article were to review, from a clinical perspective, the medical therapies currently used for glaucoma and discuss adherence issues with respect to the population of patients with glaucoma, who tend to be relatively elderly."

CD012223,0,16392816,0,1-((S)-2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol: a potent peripherally acting 5-HT2 receptor agonist with ocular hypotensive activity.,"Serotonin 5-HT(2) receptor agonists have been identified as a potential new class of agents for the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. The initially reported tryptamine analogues displayed either poor solution stability, potent central nervous system activity, or both of these undesirable characteristics and were unacceptable for clinical evaluation. A series of 1-(2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazole analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their suitability for consideration as clinical candidates. 1-((S)-2-Aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol (9) was identified as a peripherally acting potent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist (EC(50) = 42.7 nM, E(max) = 89%) with high selectivity for the 5-HT(2) receptors relative to other serotonergic receptor subtypes and other families of receptors and has significantly greater solution stability than alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. Additionally, 9 potently lowers intraocular pressure in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys (-13 mmHg, 33%); this reduction appears to be through a local rather than a centrally mediated effect. Compound 9 appears to be an excellent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist for conducting further studies directed toward a clinical proof-of-concept study for this class of ocular hypotensive agents."

CD012223,0,15923506,0,Effect of a nifedipine induced reduction in blood pressure on the association between ocular pulse amplitude and ocular fundus pulsation amplitude in systemic hypertension.,"The ocular pressure/volume relation, which is described by the Friedenwald equation, forms the basis of intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement with Schiotz tonometry and measurement of pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) with pneumotonometry. Changes in intraocular volume during the cardiac cycle are caused by arterial inflow and venous outflow and are accompanied by changes in IOP. The relation between volume and pressure changes is dependent on the elastic properties of the eye coats as described by the ocular rigidity coefficient. Previous studies indicate that there is a vascular contribution to ocular rigidity and that the volume/pressure relationship may depend on the mean arterial pressure."

CD012223,0,19298900,0,"Angle-closure glaucoma: the role of the lens in the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment.","Primary angle-closure glaucoma is a major cause of blindness worldwide. It is a disease of ocular anatomy that is related to pupillary-block and angle-crowding mechanisms of filtration angle closure. Eyes at increased risk for primary angle-closure are small with decreased axial length, anterior chamber depth, and filtration angle width, associated with a proportionately large lens. Angle-closure glaucoma afflicts Asian and Eskimo eyes more frequently than eyes in other races with similar predisposing dimensions. The treatment of primary angle closure addresses its causal mechanisms. Laser peripheral iridotomy equalizes the anterior and posterior pressures and widens the filtration angle by reducing the effect of pupillary block. Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty contracts the iris stroma to reduce angle crowding and is helpful for some affected eyes. Lensectomy dramatically widens the angle and eliminates pupillary block. Clinical reports of lensectomy with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in the treatment of acute, chronic, and secondary angle-closure glaucoma describe very favorable results. The appropriate role for lensectomy in the management of primary angle closure, however, remains unproven. Prospective, randomized clinical trials are ongoing to determine the value and comparative risks and efficacy of lensectomy versus medical therapy, laser peripheral iridotomy, laser iridoplasty, and filtration procedures for the treatment of acute and chronic primary angle closure and for the prevention of chronic angle-closure glaucoma, both after and in place of laser peripheral iridotomy."
CD012223,0,15513437,0,Trabeculectomy combined with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation.,"It has recently become popular to use mitomycin C (MMC) with trabeculectomy. MMC helps to maintain effective filtration and long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) control, while the use of laser suture lysis has improved the safety of this procedure. We evaluated the outcome of trabeculectomy alone and of trabeculectomy plus phacoemulsification (PEA) and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, each supplemented with MMC. The mean preoperative IOP for the trabeculectomy alone group was 22.4 +/- 3.2 mmHg(bleb+), 25.3 +/- 2.6 mmHg(bleb-), and that of the combined surgery group was 22.4 +/- 2.8 mmHg(bleb+), 21.0 +/- 3.5 mmHg(bleb-). Mean postoperative IOP for the two groups were 13.3 +/- 2.7 mmHg(bleb+), 17.1 +/- 4.4 mmHg(bleb-) and 11.9 +/- 2.7 mmHg(bleb+), 16.4 +/- 3.4 mmHg(bleb-), respectively. After 4.5 years, the success probability for postoperative IOP control was 38%(bleb+), 3%(bleb-) in the trabeculectomy alone group and 53%(bleb+), 10%(bleb-) in the combined surgery group (<or=12 mmHg) and 65%(bleb+), 3%(bleb-) and 75%(bleb+), 10%(bleb-) (<or=14 mmHg)(Kaplan-Meier survival rate). With early complications, the frequency of shallow anterior chamber and choroidal detachment were significantly fewer in the combined surgery group.

One-off procedures, such as laser or surgery, are recommended in Africa because of lack of or poor adherence to medical treatment. However, acceptance of surgery is usually extremely low. To prevent blindness, adherence to treatment needs to improve, using acceptable, replicable and cost-effective interventions. After reviewing the literature and interviewing patients in Bauchi (Nigeria) motivational interviewing (MI) was selected as the intervention for this trial, with adaptation for glaucoma (MIG). MI is designed to strengthen personal motivation for, and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring a person's reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion. The aim of this study is to assess whether MIG increases the uptake of laser or surgery amongst glaucoma patients where this is the recommended treatment.

On the other hand, medical treatment has robust data supporting its efficacy and has progressed in last decades with the introduction of prostaglandin analogues. To compare these two therapies, we searched Epistemonikos database, which is maintained by screening 30 databases, and identified four systematic reviews including four randomized and one non-randomized clinical trial. We combined the evidence using meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table following the GRADE approach. We concluded that selective laser trabeculoplasty leads to a smaller absolute intraocular pressure reduction than medical treatment. However, it is not clear if there are differences in treatment success rate or need of additional antiglaucomatous interventions, because the quality of the evidence is low."

CD012223,0,7728103,0,Laser sclerostomy ab externo using two different infrared lasers: a clinical comparison.,"This study was designed to compare the clinical results of an ab externo approach to laser sclerostomy using two different laser sources under identical conditions. A pulsed (200 microseconds) erbium-YAG laser (lambda = 2940 nm) and a pulsed (200 microseconds) holmium:YAG laser (lambda = 2120 nm) were used. The energy of each laser was transmitted via a fiber (300 microns in diameter) and applied near the limbus, with the fiber tip remaining in steady contact with the sclera. According to the higher tissue absorption coefficient, a shorter penetration depth and, therefore, fewer complications were expected for the Er:YAG laser. A total of 26 patients with advanced open-angle glaucoma were treated and followed for up to 6 months. In all cases a functioning fistula with a prominent filtering bleb and a marked reduction in the intraocular pressure (from up to 35 mm Hg to < 10 mm Hg) could be achieved primarily. The total energy required was about 4 times lower for erbium:YAG laser was compared with holmium:YAG laser sclerostomies. No complication occurred intraoperatively. Postoperatively, reversible adherence of the iris to the internal ostium was more frequently observed in Ho:YAG laser sclerostomies (60%) and small hyphemas were more often seen in Er:YAG laser sclerostomies (30%). After 6 months of follow-up, about 40% of the fistula remained patent in both groups. In principle, both lasers are suited to serve as energy sources for the described approach. Under the conditions of the present study, different levels of thermal effects did not cause any significant difference in the clinical success rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The aim of the study was to obtain socio-medico-demographic data on glaucoma patients who were treated for a period of one year or more. Fifty per cent of the ophthalmologists in the department of Marne participated in the study by having their patients complete an anonymous questionnaire at home. Eighty-five per cent of the 407 patients replied. This response rate to the investigation did not vary significantly (p > 0.90) with respect to the ophthalmologist. However, forgetting to distribute the questionnaires to the patients was variable from one physician to the other. The prevalence of POAG cases undergoing treatment was between 0.15 and 0.36% for the whole population; between 0.37 and 0.89% for patients over the age of 40 years; 0.67 and 1.67% after the age of 60. The same number of women and men are affected, but the risk is 1.33 times greater for men after the age of 60. The geographical distribution of the patients is identical to that of the general population. Sixty-two per cent of the patients take other drugs as well and this proportion increases with age (p < 0.0001); 24% of the subjects have hypertension and 10.6% are diabetic. Half of the patients have received anti-glaucoma therapy for 6 years or less; 94% take beta-blockers, 18% take miotics and 12% use adrenergic drugs. More women instil their eyedrops on their own (79% vs 57%; p < 0.0001). Ten per cent of patients have had glaucoma operations and this proportion increases with age (p < 0.03). The frequency of laser treatment is 20%. Glaucoma patients seem to be faithful to their ophthalmologist as 65% of them go to the same one for follow-up.

This investigation, now in its fourth year, was prospective, and the information derived was analysed with the aid of a computer. Success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) below baseline (22 mmHg). The mean follow-up time was 24.5 months, when the success rate was 74% compared with 75% at three months. Success declined to 45% at 42 months. No significant difference was noted when (a) first lasered eyes of all patients and those fellow eyes treated were analysed separately, (b) when right and left eyes were analysed separately, nor (c) when patients were divided into two treatment groups, (I) 100 burns at 1 W, and (II) 65 burns at 850 mW.

In this study we evaluated the effect of pre-treatment with anti-prostaglandin eyedrops on the rise in IOP. The IOP in forty pseudophakic patients, undergoing Nd-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy, was measured before capsulotomy and 2 and 4 hours afterwards. The fellow-eye was used as a control. Thirty minutes pre-operatively the patients were given one of the four following combinations of eyedrops: 1 drop timolol 0.5% and 1 drop placebo, 1 drop indomethacin 1% and 1 drop placebo, 1 drop timolol 0.5% and 1 drop indomethacin 1%, 1 drop placebo and 1 drop placebo.

CD012223,0,20939799,0,Fluocinolone acetonide implantable device for diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy remains a major worldwide cause of preventable visual loss. Although photocoagulation and improved metabolic control are effective for patients with diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, some patients continue to lose vision despite treatment. Various classes of pharmacotherapy have shown promise in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, including corticosteroids, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, and others. Off-label intravitreal corticosteroids are associated with short-term anatomic and visual improvement in some patients, but these patients may require repeated intravitreal injections with cumulative risks of cataract formation, intraocular pressure elevation, and endophthalmitis. Various sustained-release corticosteroid delivery systems have been investigated for this purpose. The first to become widely available is the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (Retisert, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY), which received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to treat chronic, noninfectious posterior segment uveitis in 2005. This device also has been investigated as a treatment for diabetic macular edema. Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated medium-term anatomic and visual improvement, but the device is associated with high risks of cataract formation and intraocular pressure elevation. At this time, the device is not widely used in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. A smaller device, designed to be injected in a clinic setting (Iluvien, Alimera Sciences, Alpharetta, GA) is currently being investigated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Results from a phase 3 randomized controlled trial have recently reported medium-term efficacy and safety in the treatment of diabetic macular edema.

CD012223,0,10168356,0,The role of alpha-agonists in glaucoma therapy.,"alpha-Agonists are a relatively old class of medications, the topical use of which lowers eye pressure. Clonidine was introduced for this use in 1966, brimonidine in 1974, and apraclonidine in 1978. Initial short-term attempts to use clonidine were complicated by problems with systemic hypotension. Apraclonidine is more polar and less lipophilic than clonidine. This probably allows less penetration into both the posterior segment of the eye and systemic circulation, allowing for an excellent therapeutic index. The prophylactic use of apraclonidine (1% and 0.5%) has dramatically changed the safety profile for many anterior segment laser procedures, cataract surgery, and vitrectomy. The role of alpha-agonists in the chronic treatment of glaucoma is still uncertain. Potential benefits of additional lowering of intraocular pressure must be weighed against the following potential disadvantages: tachyphalaxsis, posterior segment vasoconstriction, psychologic depression and fatigue, syncope and systemic hypotension, and a topical allergy-like syndrome."

Accurate assessment of the anatomy of the optic disc is therefore necessary to document change. The measurement of optic disc topography with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy has been shown to be accurate, reproducible, diagnostically valid, and an accurate reflection of the underlying anatomic status of the optic disc and retinal nerve fibre layer. Validated techniques have been developed to detect change over time in the surface topography of the optic disc. Ultimately, real-time in vivo analysis of the health of retinal ganglion cells should provide the best method of assessing the advisability and adequacy of treatment and the potential value of neuroprotective therapies."

Thirty-six eyes were treated with topical .03% sodium flurbiprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent; 34 eyes received placebo. Eighteen eyes received ALT to 360 degrees of the meshwork; nine of these eyes were treated with topical 1% indomethacin and nine eyes received placebo. Eyes treated with flurbiprofen and indomethacin showed significantly less conjunctival injection following ALT. However, these agents did not significantly alter the anterior chamber reaction after laser therapy compared to placebo. Flurbiprofen-treated eyes showed a significantly smaller percent (32.6%) decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) one day after ALT as compared to eyes receiving placebo (43.8%).

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the retinal vascular reactivity after LPS infusion. In a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study, 18 healthy male volunteers received 20 IU/kg LPS or placebo as an intravenous bolus infusion. Outcome parameters were measured at baseline and 4h after LPS/placebo administration. At baseline and at 4h after administration a short period of 100% oxygen inhalation was used to assess retinal vasoreactivity to this stimulus. Perimacular white blood cell velocity, density and flux were assessed with the blue-field entoptic technique, retinal branch arterial and venous diameters were measured with a retinal vessel analyzer and red blood cell velocity in retinal branch veins was measured with laser Doppler velocimetry. LPS is associated with peripheral blood leukocytosis and increased white blood cell density in ocular microvessels (p<0.001). In addition, retinal arterial (p=0.02) and venous (p<0.01) diameters were increased. All retinal hemodynamic parameters showed a decrease during 100% oxygen breathing. This decrease was significantly blunted by LPS for all retinal outcome parameters except venous diameter (p=0.04 for white blood cell velocity, p=0.0002 for white blood cell density, p<0.0001 for white blood cell flux, p=0.01 for arterial diameter, p=0.02 for red blood cell velocity and p=0.006 for red blood cell flux). These data indicate that LPS-induced inflammation induces vascular dysregulation in the retina. This may provide a link between inflammation and vascular dysregulation. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether this model may be suitable to study inflammation induced vascular dysregulation in the eye."

To assess the intraoperative results comparing two non-mechanical laser assisted penetrating keratoplasty approaches in keratoconus and Fuchs dystrophy. Patients and Methods. 68 patients (age 18 to 87 years) with keratoconus or Fuchs dystrophy were randomly distributed to 4 groups. 35 eyes with keratoconus and 33 eyes with Fuchs dystrophy were treated with either excimer laser ([Exc] groups I and II) or femtosecond laser-assisted ([FLAK] groups III and IV) penetrating keratoplasty. Main intraoperative outcome measures included intraoperative decentration, need for additional interrupted sutures, alignment of orientation markers, and intraocular positive pressure (vis a tergo). Results. Intraoperative recipient decentration occurred in 4 eyes of groups III/IV but in none of groups I/II. Additional interrupted sutures were not necessary in groups I/II but in 5 eyes of groups III/IV. Orientation markers were all aligned in groups I/II but were partly misaligned in 8 eyes of groups III/IV. Intraocular positive pressure grade was recognized in 12 eyes of groups I/II and in 19 eyes of groups III/IV. In particular, in group III, severe vis a tergo occurred in 8 eyes. Conclusions. Intraoperative decentration, misalignment of the donor in the recipient bed, and need for additional interrupted sutures as well as high percentage of severe intraocular positive pressure were predominantly present in the femtosecond laser in keratoconus eyes."

The mean IOP-value was calculated from 3 readings of the daytime IOP curve, and the mean eye pressure of the right and left eye in the respective individual was used. The medical therapy was carried out with our ranking order of drugs of choice: timolol, timolol combined with adjunctive drug therapy, laser trabeculoplasty and/or filtering surgery. Intraocular pressure was controlled with timolol alone in 98 of 155 patients (63.2%, Group 1). In 36 patients, timolol plus adjunctive medication was required to control IOP (23.2%, Group 2). Twenty-one (13.6%, Group 3) required either laser trabeculoplasty or filtering surgery in addition to timolol. Sufficient IOP-lowering effect was more frequently maintained in patients with ocular hypertension than those with glaucoma simplex or capsular glaucoma. Failures in timolol treatment occurred mostly within 6 months from the start of the therapy and correlated well with higher initial IOP. Transient adverse effects were observed in 11.2% of cases. In three cases (1.9%) local and systemic side effects were serious enough to require discontinuation of the drug therapy. One patient (0.7%) was a non-responder and was withdrawn from the study for that reason. Sixteen patients (10.3%) were lost to follow-up during the 4 year study."

CD012223,0,8970866,0,The normalised rim/disc area ratio line.,"The assessment of the cup of the optic disc depends, among other criteria, on the disc area. A small cup in a small optic disc can indicate an advanced glaucomatous lesion, on the other hand a large cup in a large optic disc can be normal. Therefore, an individual normalised rim/disc area ratio line together with the curves of 50th percentile and the 95th percentile of normal could help to better distinguish between glaucomatous and normal optic cups. The aim of our study was to calculate and to evaluate such a normalised rim/disc area ratio line. Heidelberg Retina Tomograph examinations of the optic nerve head of 100 randomly selected eyes of 100 normal subjects were evaluated. We calculated the disc area adjusted rim/disc area ratio in sectors of 10 degrees. The 95th percentile and the 50th percentile of each of the 36 sectors were calculated. Based on these normal percentile lines it was possible to display an individual normalised rim/disc area ratio line in the topographic images of an individual optic disc examination. Here we demonstrated examples of a normal optic disc, optic nerve heads with moderate and advanced lesions and a small optic disc with glaucomatous damage. We present a new display mode of the results of Heidelberg Retina Tomograph optic nerve head examination, which may be helpful for an easy and reliable assessment of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage only looking at topographic images."

CD012223,0,3855337,0,Argon laser trabeculoplasty or trabeculectomy a prospective randomised block study.,A prospective randomised block study of treatment by either argon laser trabeculoplasty or trabeculectomy was undertaken in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma not controlled by medication. The study was undertaken in two centres in the United Kingdom where the regimes of medical treatment prior to interference were different. Regression analysis showed that in both populations laser trabeculoplasty was effective in reducing the intraocular pressure but it was less effective than trabeculectomy in permanently reducing the intraocular pressure to within normal limits. Laser trabeculoplasty was most effective in those patients whose intraocular pressure was initially high but many of these required post-operative medication or surgery. Laser trabeculoplasty is a useful adjunct to the therapy of open angle glaucoma but it is not a substitute for trabeculectomy as a method of permanently reducing the intraocular pressure to normal. Because of the effectiveness of both these methods of treatment we feel it no longer justified to use anything other than simple local medication to control the intraocular pressure before proceeding to active therapy.

CD012223,0,17266605,0,"Interest of alpha2-adrenergic agonists and antagonists in clinical practice: background, facts and perspectives.","The family of alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(2)-ARs) comprises three subtypes which are each endowed with specific functions. alpha(2)-agonists and alpha(2)-antagonists are part of the clinician armamentarium since several decades; however, none of the compounds so far available is subtype selective. For long, clonidine and yohimbine have been used for the treatment of hypertension and impotence respectively, but both have been superseded by newer drugs. This review attempts, by a comprehensive analysis of the literature, to cover the present clinical use and the potential therapeutic interest of alpha(2)-agonists or antagonists. From the clinical data, it is concluded that, with the exception of a few particular situations, alpha(2)-agonists are only of limited utility as a monotherapy. By contrast, they offer several powerful advantages when used in adjunctive therapy. In perioperative settings, alpha(2)-agonists are extremely valuable adjuncts to anesthetics and analgesics for the induction of anxiolysis, maintenance of sedation, management of pain and prevention of shivering. In the ophthalmic clinic, they are used to lower intra-ocular pressure during laser surgery of the eye. As a daily medication, alpha(2)-agonists are also of interest for the treatment of glaucoma, muscle spasticity, opiate withdrawal, and behavior disorders. The alpha(2)-antagonists are useful antidotes for reversing the threatening effects of agonist overdose, but currently there are very few indications. New applications are under investigation, and new molecules with more refined subtype-selectivity may emerge, so the clinical utility of both alpha(2)-agonists and antagonists will undoubtedly expand in the future."
CD012223,0,18929112,0,Laser therapies for glaucoma: new frontiers.,"Glaucoma is a long-term ocular neuropathy defined by optic disc or retinal nerve fiber structural abnormalities and visual-field defects. Treatment for glaucoma consists of reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) to an acceptable target range to prevent further optic-nerve damage. Currently available treatments include topical drug (single then multidrug combinations) followed, for those patients on maximal tolerated medical therapy who still need additional IOP reduction, by laser treatments. These included laser iridotomy, laser trabeculoplasty, laser iridoplasty, laser cyclophotocoagulation. Although the various types of laser enjoyed great success as glaucoma therapy for many years, recently the excimer laser trabeculotomy is a promising IOP-lowering technique."

CD012223,0,26871761,0,Peripheral iridotomy for pigmentary glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy characterized by retinal ganglion cell death resulting in damage to the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer. Pigment dispersion syndrome is characterized by a structural disturbance in the iris pigment epithelium (the densely pigmented posterior surface of the iris) that leads to dispersion of the pigment and its deposition on various structures within the eye. Pigmentary glaucoma is a specific form of open-angle glaucoma found in patients with pigment dispersion syndrome.Topcial medical therapy is usually the first-line treatment; however, peripheral laser iridotomy has been proposed as an alternate treatment. Peripheral laser iridotomy involves creating an opening in the iris tissue to allow drainage of fluid from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber and vice versa. Equalizing the pressure within the eye may help to alleviate the friction that leads to pigment dispersion and prevent visual field deterioration. However, the effectiveness of peripheral laser iridotomy in reducing the development or progression of pigmentary glaucoma is unknown."

For platelet aggregation, we photoelectrophotometrically investigated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or collagen-induced platelet aggregation in consecutively selected patients with glaucoma (22 patients with NTG and 13 patients with POAG) and 42 glaucoma free control subjects with normal ocular findings. The aggregation patterns of the patients' platelets reacted abnormally to ADP 1 microM or collagen 0.5 microg/ml as evidenced by secondary aggregation were compared with those of control subjects. For blood coagulative and fibrinolytic systems, we measured prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), alpha2 plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex. Seventeen of 22 patients (77%) with NTG and 5 of 13 patients (38%) with POAG showed abnormal secondary aggregation. A significant difference was observed between the two groups. No control subjects showed abnormal secondary aggregation. In the fibrinolytic test, all the parameters examined showed within normal ranges, although the log10(TAT) value was higher in NTG than in POAG. Results of the present study suggested that increased platelet aggregation as defined by ADP or collagen induced abnormal secondary aggregation in vitro is frequently associated with glaucoma patients and this tendency is more apparent in NTG than that in POAG."

CD012223,0,26362541,0,Comparing the effectiveness of selective laser trabeculoplasty with topical medication as initial treatment (the Glaucoma Initial Treatment Study): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Estimated to affect 60 million people worldwide, this figure is expected to rise to 80 million by 2020. Untreated, glaucoma leads to visual decay and eventually to blindness, and can significantly reduce quality of life. First-line treatment in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and exfoliative glaucoma is topical medical therapy with ocular hypotensives as eye drops. However, eye drops have several disadvantages including cost, possible local and systemic side effects, and adherence and perseverance issues. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that selective laser trabeculoplasty is equally as effective in lowering intraocular pressure as eye drops. However, the impact of these two treatment modalities from the patient and economic perspectives has not been adequately determined. Thus, it remains unclear whether topical medical therapy or selective laser trabeculoplasty should be recommended as first-line treatment for glaucoma."

CD012223,0,21376717,0,Effect of PF-04217329 a prodrug of a selective prostaglandin EP(2) agonist on intraocular pressure in preclinical models of glaucoma.,"Better control of intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most effective way to preserve visual field function in glaucomatous patients. While prostaglandin FP analogs are leading the therapeutic intervention for glaucoma, new target classes also are being identified with new lead compounds being developed for IOP reduction. One target class currently being investigated includes the prostaglandin EP receptor agonists. Recently PF-04217329 (Taprenepag isopropyl), a prodrug of CP-544326 (active acid metabolite), a potent and selective EP(2) receptor agonist, was successfully evaluated for its ocular hypotensive activity in a clinical study involving patients with primary open angle glaucoma. In the current manuscript, the preclinical attributes of CP-544326 and PF-0421329 have been described. CP-544326 was found to be a potent and selective EP(2) agonist (IC(50) = 10 nM; EC(50) = 2.8 nM) whose corneal permeability and ocular bioavailability were significantly increased when the compound was dosed as the isopropyl ester prodrug, PF-04217329. Topical ocular dosing of PF-04217329 was well tolerated in preclinical species and caused an elevation of cAMP in aqueous humor/iris-ciliary body indicative of in vivo EP(2) target receptor activation. Topical ocular dosing of PF-04217329 resulted in ocular exposure of CP-544326 at levels greater than the EC(50) for the EP(2) receptor. PF-04217329 when dosed once daily caused between 30 and 50% IOP reduction in single day studies in normotensive Dutch-belted rabbits, normotensive dogs, and laser-induced ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys and 20-40% IOP reduction in multiple day studies compared to vehicle-dosed eyes. IOP reduction was sustained from 6 h through 24 h following a single topical dose. In conclusion, preclinical data generated thus far appear to support the clinical development of PF-04217329 as a novel compound for the treatment of glaucoma."

CD012223,0,2508130,0,The role of endogenous prostaglandins in clinically-used and investigational glaucoma therapy.,"A review of the relevant literature strongly suggests that several medical and laser treatments presently used in glaucoma therapy, and other potential treatments under investigation, reduce IOP, at least, in part, by stimulating endogenous PG synthesis. There are four lines of evidence leading to this conclusion. (1) PGs are potent ocular hypotensive agents. (2) Adrenergic and cholinergic agonists stimulate PG synthesis by ocular tissues in vitro. (3) Epinephrine and ALT cause elevation of PG levels in the aqueous humor in vivo. (4) PG synthesis inhibitors such as indomethacin or flurbiprofen block, or partially inhibit, the reduction of IOP produced by epinephrine, para-aminoclonidine, forskolin, vanadate, verapamil, arachidonic acid, and ALT in rabbits, cats, monkeys, and/or humans. This last finding has great clinical importance with regard to the efficacy of such treatment modalities as epinephrine and ALT, since it indicates that these modalities may be less effective in reducing IOP in glaucoma patients who are taking systemic PG synthesis inhibitors - such as aspirin or indomethacin - for arthritis, cerebrovascular disease, arteriosclerotic coronary vascular disease, headache, or the common cold. Other surgical procedures for glaucoma such as cyclocryotherapy or other cyclodestructive procedures may also reduce IOP in part by stimulating local PG synthesis. Since PGs are produced in various ocular tissues and some of these PGs are highly potent ocular hypotensive agents, their potential role in mediating the reduction of IOP produced by medical or surgical modalities of glaucoma therapy must always be considered. Furthermore, these considerations support the concept that topical application of an appropriately selected PG, or its derivative, may provide a more direct means of lowering IOP than some of the currently used procedures or therapeutic agents."

CD012223,0,8846840,0,The effect of hyperoxia and hypercapnia on fundus pulsations in the macular and optic disc region in healthy young men.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of hyperoxia and hypercapnia on fundus pulsations in the macular and optic disc region and determine a potential autoregulative capacity of the choroid under these conditions. In a randomized cross-over study 100% O2 and a mixture of 5% CO2 with air was inhaled for 10 min by ten healthy male volunteers on different study days. Fundus pulsations were measured with a recently described laser interferometer. These results were compared to changes in systemic haemodynamics and Doppler-sonographic measurements of the radial artery. The fundus pulsation amplitude significantly decreased during hyperoxia and significantly increased during hypercapnia. These effects on fundus pulsations were stronger in the optic disc region than in the macular region. The systemic parameters showed only minor changes. Hence the amplitudes of fundus pulsations measured during hyperoxia and hypercapnia are assumed to be a consequence of metabolic autoregulative mechanisms. This autoregulative capacity is greater in the optic disc region than in the macular region, implying that the fundus pulsation amplitude in the papilla is influenced by both the choroidal and the retinal circulation."

CD012223,0,28982295,0,Location of the internal carotid artery and ophthalmic artery segments for non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement by multi-depth TCD.,"The aim of the present study was to locate the ophthalmic artery by using the edge of the internal carotid artery (ICA) as the reference depth to perform a reliable non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement via a multi-depth transcranial Doppler device and to then determine the positions and angles of an ultrasonic transducer (UT) on the closed eyelid in the case of located segments. High tension glaucoma (HTG) patients and healthy volunteers (HVs) undergoing non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement were selected for this prospective study. The depth of the edge of the ICA was identified, followed by a selection of the depths of the IOA and EOA segments. The positions and angles of the UT on the closed eyelid were measured. The mean depth of the identified ICA edge for HTG patients was 64.3 mm and was 63.0 mm for HVs (p = 0.21). The mean depth of the selected IOA segment for HTG patients was 59.2 mm and 59.3 mm for HVs (p = 0.91). The mean depth of the selected EOA segment for HTG patients was 48.5 mm and 49.8 mm for HVs (p = 0.14). The difference in the located depths of the segments between groups was not statistically significant. The results showed a significant difference in the measured UT angles in the case of the identified edge of the ICA and selected ophthalmic artery segments (p = 0.0002).

METHODS Retrospective, interventional case series. RESULTS 15 consecutive cases with Coats disease were managed with 4 mg/0.1 ml intravitreal TA injection on presentation and were followed for a minimum of 1 year duration. Additional management strategies including drainage of subretinal fluid through an inferior sclerotomy, peripheral laser ablation and/or cryotherapy, cataract extraction and vitrectomy were performed. Improvement of visual acuity could be achieved compared with preoperative vision in all cases in this series, even when 40% needed cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation. One patient needed antiglaucoma treatment to control raised intraocular pressure in this series.

However, it remains unknown as to which procedure is superior. We therefore conducted a prospective randomized study, which compared the effect of the two methods on visual acuity, intraocular pressure, endothelial cell density, depth of the anterior chamber, and iris configuration as well as acceptance by the patients. A total of 30 patients, who were treated for acute angle-closure glaucoma in one eye, were subjected to either surgical iridectomy or Nd:YAG-laser iridotomy in the other eye according to a randomized protocol. All patients were followed for 12 months by examination at the 1st, 6th, and 12th month post treatment. No significant difference between the two treatments was found regarding visual acuity or intraocular pressure. The peripheral anterior chamber increased in depth following both methods, whereas the central depth of the anterior chamber was unaffected. A better gonioscopic visibility of the trabecular meshwork resulted from the increased width of the chamber angle. Whereas the number of endothelial cells remained constant in the patients treated with laser iridotomy, a small decrease was observed in the group of patients who underwent iridectomy (-7.2% after 12 months; difference not significant). The subjective acceptance by the patients was better in the group treated with laser iridotomy. We conclude that the two methods are equivalent with regard to intraocular pressure and visual acuity. The constant number of endothelial cells and the better acceptance by the patients suggest Nd:YAG-laser iridotomy to be the preferable method for prophylaxis of acute angle-closure glaucoma."

CD012223,0,25854109,0,[Aiming for zero blindness].,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of acquired blindness in Japan. One reason that it often leads to blindness is that it can continue to worsen even after effective medical reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), the only evidence-based treatment. The limitations of current treatments make it critical to identify IOP-independent factors that can cause glaucoma and develop new drugs to target these factors. This is a challenging task, as the pathology of glaucoma is thought to be very complex, with different combinations of factors underlying its development and progression in different patients. Additionally, there is a deficiency in methods to efficiently perform clinical evaluations and reliably probe the state of the disease over relatively short periods. In addition, newly developed drugs need to be evaluated with clinical trials, for which human and financial resources are limited, before they can be widely used for treatment. Taking all these issues into consideration, it is evident that there are two urgent issues to consider: the development of methods to classify glaucoma in detail based on its pathology, and the improvement of clinical evaluation methods. In this review, we discuss some of our efforts to develop new neuroprotective agents for glaucoma, with a focus on the following three areas: 1. Clinical research and development of methods to classify glaucoma in detail based on IOP-independent factors, and the exploration of possibilities for the improvement of clinical evaluation of glaucoma. 2. Pathology-based research and development of new drugs for glaucoma, focusing on comprehensive gene expression analysis and the development of molecule-targeting drugs, using murine optic nerve crush as a disease model. 3. Development of next generation in vivo imaging modalities and the establishment of infrastructure enabling ""big-data"" analysis. First, we discuss our clinical research and the development of methods to classify glaucoma in detail based on IOP-independent factors, as well as our investigation of ways to improve the clinical evaluation of the disease. Our research was prompted by the multifactorial nature of glaucoma. There is a high degree of variability in the pattern and speed of the progression of visual field defects in individual patients, presenting a major obstacle for successful clinical trials. To overcome this, we classified the eyes of glaucoma patients into 4 types, corresponding to the 4 patterns of glaucomatous optic nerve head morphology described: by Nicolela et al. and then tested the validity of this method by assessing the uniformity of clinical features in each group. We found that in normal tension glaucoma (NTG) eyes, each disc morphology group had a characteristic location in which the loss of circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT; measured with optical coherence tomography: OCT) was most likely to occur. Furthermore, the incidence of reductions in visual acuity differed between the groups, as did the speed of visual field loss, the distribution of defective visual field test points, and the location of test points that were most susceptible to progressive damage, measured by Humphrey static perimetry. These results indicate that Nicolela's method of classifying eyes with glaucoma was able to overcome the difficulties caused by the diverse nature of the disease, at least to a certain extent. Building on these findings, we then set out to identify sectors of the visual field that correspond to the distribution of retinal nerve fibers, with the aim of detecting glaucoma progression with improved sensitivity. We first mapped the statistical correlation between visual field test points and cpRNFLT in each temporal clock-hour sector (from 6 to 12 o'clock), using OCT data from NTG patients. The resulting series of maps allowed us to identify areas containing visual field test points that were prone to be affected together as a group. We also used a similar method to identify visual field sectors within a 10 x 10 grid displayed by an OCT map of the macula. By analyzing both the visual field and the macular map sectors, we anticipate that a more accurate and sensitive detection of glaucoma progression can become possible. We also used laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) to assess optic nerve blood flow. We found that compared to healthy eyes, eyes with early-stage NTG had decreased blood flow, and the peak of the blood flow wave form of each heartbeat was delayed. Finally, we used a method combining swept source OCT (SS-OCT) and newly developed analysis software to reconstruct the entire lamina cribrosa, a structure situated deep in the optic nerve head. This morphological analysis returned preliminary data suggesting that alterations in the morphology of the lamina cribrosa are already present in the early stages of glaucoma. This result indicates that axonal injury, mediated by morphological abnormalities of the lamina cribrosa, is involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The next topic discussed is the pathology-based drug research and development, focusing on the use of comprehensive gene expression analysis and the development of molecule-targeting drugs in a murine model of optic nerve injury. Learning from clinical data on glaucoma and the lamina cribrosa, we carried out basic research to first determine what factors regulate axonal injury, and then develop drugs targeting these factors. Specifically, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis, using a next generation sequencer, and pathway analysis of retinal samples obtained from a murine model of axonal injury. This analysis revealed a characteristic upregulation of genes (such as Chop) that belongs to the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. An immunohistological analysis revealed that these changes in gene expression took place in the retinal ganglion cells, suggesting that endoplasmic reticulum stress molecules may be suitable therapeutic targets. Among these molecules, we chose CHOP as our primary target for drug development. Currently, we are in the process of screening a library of 1274 drugs, all of which are already used in human subjects, for CHOP inhibitors. The last topic of our discussion is future possibilities for glaucoma management. First, we discuss the development of next generation in vivo imaging modalities that allow detailed description of pathomechanisms of this multifactorial disease, glaucoma. The purpose of this research was to improve the efficacy of glaucoma diagnosis and to visualize its pathology at a cellular/molecular level and develop molecule-specific therapies. Currently available visual field tests are subjective, since they rely on a determination of the threshold of light perception, and are affected by poor reproducibility. The current dependence on visual field tests to ascertain the progression of glaucoma is thus a serious limitation on an important task of ophthalmologists. We, therefore, turned our focus to the establishment of an in vivo imaging method to detect dying retinal ganglion cells, which would highlight the pathologic state of glaucoma with high sensitivity. To this end, we used confocal scanning ophthalmoscopy to assess the usefulness of SYTOX Orange as a cell death probe. Our results showed that this probe could reveal dying retinal ganglion cells clearly, quickly and with high sensitivity. We, therefore, believe that the clinical application of probes that can sensitively detect dying retinal ganglion cells is a highly promising approach. This also applies to the use of molecular tools that can provide information on the molecular pathology of glaucoma. Finally, we would like to introduce our national collaborative work on the analysis of ""big-data"". The project aims to collect as wide a range of data as possible at an unprecedented scale. The data to be registered ranges from basic glaucoma data, such as IOP and visual field test results, to data from the most sophisticated comprehensive expression analyses or imaging data. This is an important area of research, since it promises to enable the exploration of targets for drug discovery and the identification of new biomarkers to efficiently detect glaucoma progression by applying new analysis strategies to the complex mass data. The project not only depends on the collaborative efforts of various types of clinical settings including private practices, medical centers and university hospitals, but also contributions of the pharmaceutical and the medical device industries. Thus, uniting a wide range of Japanese interests and resources is the key for success. In summary, in order to aim for ZERO BLINDNESS, a drastic improvement in the quality of our patient care, drug development research for unmet medical demands, and a strategic collaboration of various professionals in the ophthalmic industry are essential. With the deep appreciation we fell towards the selfless support extended during the earthquake disaster, we wish to translate our ""gratitude"" into ""power"" from Tohoku. In doing so, we as academicians are determined to keep on contributing to the society by making progress in the medicine."

CD012223,0,2188192,0,Contact transscleral continuous wave neodymium:YAG laser cyclophotocoagulation.,"Advanced glaucoma in 140 eyes of 136 patients was treated with contact transscleral continuous wave neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser cyclophotocoagulation (CYC) with a sapphire-tipped probe. The anterior edge of the probe was placed 0.5 to 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus, using 7 to 9 W of power for 0.7 seconds with 32 to 40 applications, sparing the 3 and 9 o'clock meridians. Patients were studied prospectively. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) of 36.7 +/- 0.97 mmHg decreased to 21.2 +/- 0.99 mmHg (P = 0.004) after treatment (mean follow-up, 3.2 +/- 0.35 months) for a mean decrease in IOP of 15.5 +/- 1.21 mmHg and a mean percent decrease of 39%. Forty-one eyes were followed 6 or more months (mean, 6.7 +/- 0.25 months). The CYC reduced IOP to 25 mmHg or less in 71% of eyes, to 22 mmHg or less in 62% of eyes, and to 19 mmHg or less in 49% of eyes. Maximum lowering of IOP occurred 1 week to 1 month after treatment and remained at that level through 6 months of follow-up. Retreatment was required in 11% of patients; only one patient was retreated more than once. Four patients treated with 9 W of power developed IOPs below 5 mmHg; two of these patients had an IOP of 0 mmHg. Other complications of therapy were minimal, and patients had little pain. There was no significant change in visual acuity. Early results of this newly available therapy are encouraging."

CD012223,0,7553116,0,The use of corticosteroid/beta-blocker combinations in the management of regression after PRK for high myopia.,"After nearly 8 years of clinical experience, and with conflicting evidence from trials with and without corticosteroids, there is still no single, universally agreed postoperative management regimen for photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). All agree that corticosteroids will reverse sudden regressions, and so most still use varying corticosteroid regimens. In Hong Kong we are faced with many patients whose myopia is greater than -6 diopters (D), and we agree with the general observation that the regression/haze rate is much greater for these higher errors, and that increased intraocular pressure (IOP) seems to be associated with increased haze. We placed our high myopia group (greater than -6.00D) on corticosteroid/beta-blocker combinations and observed a much lower incidence of haze and regression from this group. We use this regimen now on all our patients and are achieving more accurate endpoint refraction and less haze. Our hypothesis is that lowering the IOP to less than 16 mm Hg reduces keratocyte migration by ""tightening"" the corneal lamellae, thus dampening the healing response. Case studies are presented to illustrate this relationship."

Before and after drug instillation in one eye, protein concentration in the anterior chamber (Ca) was determined from aqueous flare intensity with a laser flare-cell meter and from aqueous flow by fluorophotometry. The Pin was calculated from the Ca, plasma protein concentration, and aqueous flow. One percent pilocarpine produced a maximum increase of 21 +/- 10% in the Ca (mean +/- SEM, n = 10), no significant change in the aqueous flow (n = 5), and a maximum increase of 29 +/- 10% in the Pin (n = 10). Three percent pilocarpine produced a maximum increase of 55 +/- 11% in the Ca (n = 8), a maximum increase of 34 +/- 13% in the aqueous flow (n = 5), and a maximum increase of 74 +/- 18% in the Pin (n = 8). Tropicamide (0.4%) produced a maximum decrease of 17 +/- 7% in the Ca (n = 8), a maximum decrease of 15 +/- 11% in the aqueous flow (n = 8), and a maximum decrease of 24 +/- 13% in the Pin (n = 8).

Two hundred sixty eyes (patients) received either apraclonidine 1% (125 eyes), pilocarpine hydrochloride 4% (37 eyes), timolol maleate 0.5% (35 eyes), dipivefrin 0.1% (32 eyes), or acetazolamide 250 mg (31 eyes) both 1 hour before and immediately following 360-degree argon laser trabeculoplasty. Apraclonidine was the only medication that significantly decreased mean IOP from baseline. Only 4 (3%) of the apraclonidine-treated eyes had IOP rises greater than 5 mm Hg. This frequency was significantly lower than that found in eyes treated with acetazolamide (39%), dipivefrin (38%), pilocarpine (33%), or timolol (32%)."

PhXA34 and PhXA41 reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) significantly in a dose-dependent way. The maximum IOP reductions were 14.5% to 17.5% with baseline adjustment at 10 to 12 hours after a single administration. No transient early elevation in IOP after treatment was observed. Based on the maximum IOP reducing effect of 1 microgram of PhXA34 and PhXA41, PhXA41 appeared to be at least 1.5 times more active than PhXA34. Tachyphylaxis of the ocular hypotensive effect did not develop during repeated administration for 5 days. A mild conjunctival hyperemia occurred in some subjects at high doses; it tended to diminish with time during the repeated administration of both drugs.

A prospective, observational, consecutive case series of 4,368 non-glaucomatous subjects (emmetropes and myopes) aged 16-70 years was carried out from August 2010 to March 2013 at the outpatient ophthalmology clinic in Sohag University Hospital and the Laser Vision Center in Sohag City, Egypt. Refraction, keratometry, slit-lamp examination, and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were obtained for all subjects. CCT was measured by ultrasonic pachymetry. The average CCT was 530.06 ± 38.03 μm. Average CCT was 532.6 ± 33.3 μm in emmetropes, 531.5 ± 31.3 μm in myopes <6 diopters (D), 531.1 ± 31.4 μm in myopes >6 D and 533 ± 33 μm in hyperopes, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. There was a statistically significant difference in CCT between age groups and gender. There was a strong correlation between CCT and IOP among the non-glaucomatous population. CCT was found to be lower in Egyptians than in Caucasian, Hispanic, and Japanese populations but comparable to African and African American populations."

In this retrospective case series, 85 eyes (48 POAG, 37 PXG) of 85 patients were investigated. The medical records of patients who underwent SLT for POAG or PXG were reviewed. The main outcome measures included intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect and ocular side effects. The mean decrease in IOP differed significantly (p < 0.001) between eyes with POAG (-4.4 ± 2.1 mmHg) and eyes with PXG (-6.1 ± 3.6 mmHg) at a mean follow-up period of 1 year.

A three-dimensional study by laser scanning tomography.,"To evaluate the effects of the presence of glaucomatous visual field defects and of intraocular pressure elevations on optic nerve head topography, we analyzed 148 left optic nerve heads of 148 patients using laser scanning tomography. The optic discs are classified according to computerized static perimetry and documented IOP readings: 101 discs show normal visual fields (36 normal discs, 22 ocular hypertensives, 28 normotensive glaucoma suspects and 15 ocular hypertensive glaucoma suspects), 47 discs (34 high-pressure glaucoma discs, 13 normal-tension glaucoma discs) demonstrate glaucomatous visual field damage. A two-way analysis of variance discloses significant differences (P < 0.01) between the groups of optic discs classified according to perimetry for most topometric parameters evaluated except for disc area. Classification according to documented IOP (cut off at 21 mmHg) results in larger disc areas in normotensive discs compared to hypertensive optic nerve heads in the study population. Results suggest that large discs may be susceptible to glaucomatous visual field damage at statistically normal IOP readings."
CD012223,0,3309770,0,Ten years after the Diabetic Retinopathy Study.,"The Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) demonstrated that prompt argon laser photocoagulation, in comparison to indefinite delay in treatment, could reduce by more than 50% the risk of severe visual loss from proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The DRS also enlightened two generations of ophthalmologists about the value of the randomized controlled clinical trial as a way of assessing new and existing treatments for unsolved therapeutic problems. After the example of the DRS, laser treatment was shown to be effective in reducing vision loss in selected patients with branch retinal vein occlusion, age-related macular degeneration, ocular histoplasmosis, and diabetic macular edema. Existing trials, supported by the National Eye Institute, are seeking to determine the appropriate treatment for selected patients with newly diagnosed glaucoma, vascularized corneas, retinopathy of prematurity, proliferative vitreoretinopathy and complicated retinal detachment, and choroidal melanoma. Clinical practice has benefited enormously from these studies all of which owe their existence, at least in part, to the prototypical clinical trial, the DRS.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of timolol in the treatment of myopic regression after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Methods. We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM) from the inception to July 2015 for relevant randomized controlled trials that examined timolol therapy for myopic regression. The methodological quality of the studies included was assessed using the Revman 5.3 software. Results. We included six clinical trials involving 483 eyes in this review, including 246 eyes in treated group and 237 eyes in controlled group. We observed statistically significant improvements on the postoperative SE in the 3 months. However, the change of CCT was not statistically different between the control group and the experimental group. There were fewer cases of IOP, UDVA, and CDVA in treated group having significant difference from the controlled group. Conclusions. Topical timolol could be an effective treatment for reduction of myopic regression especially the spherical errors after myopic LASIK. Further RCTs with larger sample sizes for these trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and limitation for myopic regression after LASIK."

CD012223,0,8260154,0,Laser trabeculoplasty--argon or diode?,"It is important to compare the pressure-lowering effect of the recently introduced diode laser with that of the argon laser currently used for trabeculoplasty, since there is a considerable difference in their wavelengths. In 50 consecutive eyes of 50 patients argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) produced a fall from 23 to 18 mmHg at three months compared with a fall from 23 to 19 mmHg at three months with diode laser trabeculoplasty (DLT). This difference was not statistically significant. Comparing the magnitude of the fall in intraocular pressure (IOP) in these two groups of 50 eyes, 28 patients achieved a fall of 5 mmHg or more with ALT and 17 with DLT and this difference was significant (chi 2 1df = 4.04, P < 0.05). Comparing 23 paired fellow eyes which both needed laser trabeculoplasty, those treated with ALT achieved a fall from 22 to 17 mmHg compared with a fall from 22 to 19 mmHg with DLT and this difference was statistically significant (T = 53.5, P < 0.02, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). These results suggest that the pressure lowering effect of DLT is comparable to that of ALT, but ALT is somewhat more effective as shown by a greater fall in IOP after ALT than DLT in fellow eyes of the same patient. In the unpaired eyes the number of falls of 5 mmHg or more was significantly greater with ALT than DLT, although the mean fall was not statistically different between the two groups."

CD012223,0,22900148,0,Baseline Factors Predictive of SLT Response: A Prospective Study.,"Purpose. To study the response to Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) according to baseline medical treatment, angle pigmentation, age, diagnosis (open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension), and baseline intraocular pressure (IOP). Methods. 74 eyes of 74 patients were enrolled in this study. Baseline characteristics were recorded for each patient. IOP in the treated and fellow eyes was measured at baseline, and 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months following SLT. IOP changes in the different groups were compared using two-way ANOVA and Pearson's correlation. Results. The mean age of our cohort was 71 ± 10 years. The mean baseline IOP was 21.5 ± 5 mmHg, and the mean change in IOP from baseline in the treated eye at one year was -4.67 ± 3.40 mmHg. Higher baseline IOP was highly correlated with greater absolute IOP decrease. Prostaglandin analogue use at baseline was shown to be associated with a statistically decreased IOP-lowering response following SLT when corrected for baseline IOP. No significant differences in IOP response were found when comparing groups stratified for age, angle pigmentation, phakic status, gender, or diagnosis. Discussion. The results of this study confirm the finding that higher baseline IOP is a predictor of greater IOP response following SLT, and that pretreatment with prostaglandin analogue therapy is associated with a decreased IOP-lowering response following SLT. The study is limited by the small number of eyes with data available for complete case analysis."

One drop of 1% apraclonidine or its vehicle was instilled 1/2 hour preoperatively and immediately postoperatively. In addition to intraocular pressure, aqueous flare intensity was also determined before and after the operation by using a laser flare-cell meter. In the apraclonidine group, intraocular pressure showed no significant postoperative increase, whereas it showed a significant increase at six hours in the vehicle group (P < .01). Difference between intraocular pressure recorded at the end of the operation with the Tono-Pen II and that measured postoperatively was significantly greater in the vehicle group by 3.5 to 7.0 mm Hg (P < .05 to .01). In the apraclonidine group, the aqueous flare intensity was about half that in the vehicle group with significant differences at six (P < .05) and 24 (P < .01) hours."
CD012223,0,26426659,0,Comparison of Efficacy Between Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation and Alternative Surgeries in Refractory Glaucoma: A Meta-analysis.,"Refractory glaucoma refers to uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) despite anti-glaucoma medication and surgical treatment, which remains a challenge to be treated. The objective of this study is to evaluate and statistically compare the clinical efficacy between endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP) and alternative surgical techniques in the treatment of refractory glaucoma in this article, as a meta-analysis. Data sources are China Biomedical Database (Sinomed, online version), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cqvip, Wanfang database, and PubMed. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) and case-control study literatures evaluating the clinical efficacy between ECP and other surgical techniques were searched electronically from public databases. The methodology quality of the retrieved articles was evaluated according to the RCT or case-control study criteria. The success rate of treatment, intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual acuity were statistically compared. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the meta-analysis. In total, 6 relevant control studies were selected in this study with a total sampling of 429 cases (429 eyes), including 204 eyes in the ECP group and 225 in the non-ECP group. Meta-analysis demonstrated that the clinical efficacy did not significantly differ between 2 groups (P > 0.05). Postoperative IOP was dramatically reduced in both groups. However, it was difficult to evaluate the combined influence of ECP and non-ECP therapies upon IOP reduction. In conclusion, ECP and non-ECP treatment yielded almost equivalent clinical efficacy in treating refractory glaucoma. The IOP-lowering degree, safety, and incidence of complications remain to be further elucidated by RCTs with a larger sample size."

Clinical trials of timolol.,"The use of the Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) to assess the safety and efficacy of a new drug or treatment can provide a clear evaluation of the relative benefits and risks of the new therapy as compared to the longer-established treatment methodology. In some cases, such as insulin, the benefits are immediately apparent; in other cases, such as photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, the consensus is not so easily obtained, and the clinical trial can supply the answer. Furthermore, the RCT provides the opportunity to identify adverse reactions, in particular those which present with a seemingly unrelated or unexpected set of symptoms. In conducting clinical trials of timolol, researchers must be alert for beta-adrenergic antagonist effects, such as were seen with practolol, and should be especially careful to note early, mild reactions which may be the forerunners of later, more severe or irreversible adverse effects."

The first available alpha 2-agonist, clonidine is of historical importance today. Apraclonidine decrease the aqueous humor secretion and episcleral venous pressure. It is employed to prevent or blunt the acute intraocular pressure rise after ocular laser therapy. It is not recommended as long term therapy due to its high incidence of local adverse reactions and tachyphylaxis. Brimonidine became the alpha 2-agonist of choice in glaucoma chronic treatment, acting by decreasing aqueous humor secretion and increasing uveoscleral outflow. It has a lower incidence of the ocular adverse effects because of greater alpha 2 selectivity. Brimonidine has neuroprotective effect, which is an important feature in the new contexts of glaucoma pathogenesis. Brimonidine has hypotensor effect similar with timolol but with a greater incidence of adverse local reactions. It has been no effects on cardiopulmonary function.

Initial results of a prospective study].,"This paper presents the results of a prospective study on argon laser trabeculoplasty with clinical application in 166 cases up to now. So far, patients have been followed up for between 2 and 12 months. Low-intensity coagulation was performed over 360 degrees of the trabecular meshwork. The coagulation site within the trabecular meshwork was chosen according to the outflow facility as measured by tonography. In eyes with high outflow facility (C greater than 0.08) the unpigmented, so-called nonfunctioning trabecular meshwork was coagulated. Where the outflow facility was lower (C less than 0.03), a pigmented area of the trabecular meshwork was aimed at. Where the facility was intermediate (0.08 greater than C greater than 0.03) the border area between pigmented and nonpigmented meshwork was coagulated. Three groups of patients were treated: (1) older patients with insufficient compliance; (2) patients whose intraocular pressure (IOP) was poorly controlled by drugs and was under 35 mm Hg; (3) patients suffering from glaucoma in aphakia or status post trabeculectomy and poor control of IOP. Applying these criteria , IOP was controlled in 26.8% without additional drugs and in 68% in combination with local medication after 6 weeks. Very few complications were seen (8 cases), and they did not lead to deterioration or loss of vision. In the light of theoretical considerations and initial histopathologic findings in human eyes, the authors assume that low-intensity coagulation causes a denaturation and shrinkage of the trabecular collagen, leading to stretching of the surrounding trabecular structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Long-term evaluation].,"Seventeen eyes of 14 patients affected with severe pars planitis underwent surgical treatment with either cryotherapy - 3 eyes - or diathermy - 14 eyes. The indications for surgery were selected as follows: ten eyes of 9 patients showed recurrence(s) or increase of ocular inflammation following tapering of systemic corticoids; 5 patients had contra-indications to systemic corticoids. Ten eyes had cystoid macular edema. The follow-up after surgery varies from 2,5 years to 10 years with an average of 5 years. Complete and permanent recovery from ocular inflammation was achieved in 7 eyes (41,2%). Permanent although incomplete improvement was achieved in 4 eyes (23,5%). Recurrences of ocular inflammation after incomplete improvement occurred in 4 eyes (23,5%). Complications - cystoid macular degeneration and severe ocular hypotension - occurred in 2 eyes (11,8%). Cystoid macular edema cleared in 9 out of 10 eyes. The final visual acuity was the same or better as compared to the initial visual acuity in 10 eyes, and worse in 7 eyes. It is concluded that the long term evaluation of cryotherapy and diathermy in the treatment of pars planitis confirms the results achieved in other series with a shorter follow-up. The treatment is beneficial in selected cases of severe pars planitis. However complete and permanent recovery from ocular inflammation should be expected in less than 50% of the cases."

To study the influences of transient high intraocular pressure(IOP) during LASIK on retinal functions and ultrastructure. Methods. Thirty-two New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into normal control, experimental control, negative suction 20 s and negative suction 3 min groups. The experimental control group was treated only by laser. Rabbit eyes received suction for different periods of time (20 s, 3 min) by negative pressure generator in different groups. The changes of neuro-optic and retinal ultrastructure were observed under electron and light microscopes; retinal neurofunctional changes were observed with flash-visual evoked potential (F-VEP) and flash-electroreinogram (F-ERG). Results. There was no obvious change in optic nerve, retina, ERG a-wave and b-wave in normal control and experimental control groups. There were slight changes in tissues of optic nerve and retina at various times of suction 20 s compared with control group, and a sharp change in suction 3 min group within 14d after operation, but these changes recovered at 28d . Amplitude of ERG b-wave observed at different time will decrease with suction periods prolonged. It can recover to normal level with the prolonged recovery periods. Amplitude and incubation period of ERG a-wave and VEP-P did not change significantly after different duration of suction. Conclusions. The transient high IOP during LASIK might have influence on retinal function and ultrastructure, but these changes were reversible."

Three patients were found to have high IOP after intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg/0.05 ml ranibizumab. IOP was elevated after the second ranibizumab injection in patients 1 and 2, and after the third injection in patient 3. The increase in IOP was sustained, requiring treatment with anti-glaucoma eye drops in all patients, the addition of systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in one patient, and the application of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in another patient. None of the patients had a previous history of glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Sustained ocular hypertension may occur after intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg/0.05 ml ranibizumab. Although the precise mechanism of the pressure rise is unknown, three eyes in our series were controlled with topical or oral medication and one with SLT.

CD012223,0,8406061,0,The response of blood flow velocity in the ophthalmic artery and blood flow of the finger to warm and cold stimuli in glaucomatous patients.,"Vasospasm appears to be a probable risk factor in the development of glaucoma. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) can detect vasospasm in cerebral vessels. It gives reproducible readings for ophthalmic artery blood velocity measurements. We used the TCD to measure peak flow velocity, mean flow velocity, and end-diastolic flow velocity in the ophthalmic artery and a laser Doppler flow meter to measure blood flow in the fingers of 17 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma (COAG), 13 patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and 8 nonglaucomatous subjects with normal eyes (normals). The opposite hand to that in which the measurements were made was challenged with warm (40 degrees) and cold (4 degrees) water. Five measurements of the ophthalmic artery velocity and finger flow were recorded: the first at baseline, the second during warming of the hand, the third after warming of the hand, the fourth when the hand was immersed in iced water, and the fifth after the hand was removed from the cold water. There was no detectable change in the ophthalmic artery blood velocities but significant decreases in the finger flow measurements when the opposite hand was immersed in cold water. These changes were present in all three diagnostic groups (P < 0.001 for COAG; P < 0.005 for NTG; P < 0.05 for normals). The findings suggest a reflex vasospasm to cold in the finger circulation of most persons but no measurable changes in the ophthalmic artery."

CD012223,0,28427068,0,Intravitreal Steroids in Diabetic Macular Edema.,"Over the past decade, great strides have been made in the management of diabetic macular edema (DME). Therapeutic alternatives now include focal/grid laser photocoagulation, vitreo-retinal surgery, and intraocular injection of anti-angiogenic and steroid molecules. Intravitreal administration of steroids represents a fundamental alternative for recalcitrant and naive eyes with DME, especially in those cases when anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are contraindicated or a treatment regimen with fewer intravitreal injections is required. Currently, 3 intravitreal corticosteroid options for DME treatment are available: the dexamethasone delivery system, the fluocinolone acetonide insert, and off-label intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. All 3 agents are associated with risk of cataract progression and intraocular pressure elevation, but they maintain a good safety profile. In patients who remain unresponsive to anti-VEGF therapy, are pseudophakic, at low risk for glaucoma, or who have significant cardiovascular risk, treatment with long-lasting intraocular steroids is suggested. There still remain many unanswered questions about intravitreal drugs, regarding dose, frequency, the correct regimen of each treatment, and the potential long-term side effects."

The optic disc changes were recorded by measuring the magnification corrected neuroretinal rim area from stereoscopic optic disc photographs and the visual field changes with an automated perimeter. There were no statistically significant differences in success rate, intraocular pressure reduction, and optic disc or visual field changes between the two groups during the first year of follow-up. In half of the laser treated patients the intraocular pressure was below 22 mmHg without medication treatment. Many patients in the medication group required frequent modifications of their therapy. Laser trabeculoplasty has an important role as primary therapy in glaucoma."
CD012223,0,24519164,0,Diode laser trabeculoplasty versus argon laser trabeculoplasty in the control of primary open angle glaucoma.,"A randomised prospective study was carried out to determine whether diode laser trabeculoplasty (DLT) is as effective as argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) in the control of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Forty eyes of 40 patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) despite maximum topical medication were entered into the study. Twenty eyes received DLT, spot size 100 μm, exposure time 0.2 s, mean power 1034 (±56.4) mW. Twenty eyes received ALT, spot size 50 μm, exposure time 0.2 s, mean power 528 (±44.7) mW. They were reviewed at 2 h, 2 and 8 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after laser treatment. Two eyes were withdrawn from the DLT group and four from the ALT group because of uncontrolled IOP during follow-up. Of the remaining eyes in the trial, mean IOP reductions for DLT and ALT, respectively, were: 6 months 7.42 (±2.36) mmHg and 6.36 (±2.3) mmHg; 12 months 7.02 (±2.6) mmHg and 6.28 (±2.2) mmHg; 18 months 6.86 (±2.8) mmHg, 5.98 (±2.02) mmHg; 24 months 6.50 (±2.72) mmHg, 5.92 (±2.02) mmHg. There was a significant reduction in each laser group when IOP at each stage was compared with baseline (p<0.001) (paired Student's t-test), but no significant difference between the two groups. In the ALT group peripheral anterior synechiae developed in four eyes and post laser pain in seven eyes. These complications were not noted following DLT. We conclude that DLT and ALT are equally effective in IOP control, but DLT is associated with less anterior segment inflammation."

CD012223,0,7956270,0,The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS): 1. Study design and methods and baseline characteristics of study patients.,"Medical therapy has been the standard initial treatment for open-angle glaucoma. When some visual field has been lost and maximum tolerated and effective medical therapy does not succeed in controlling the disease, the patient is considered to have advanced glaucoma, and the first of a potential sequence of surgical treatments is usually indicated. Little is known about the long-term course and prognosis of advanced glaucoma or about the long-term effectiveness of sequential surgical treatments in controlling the disease and preventing vision loss and blindness. The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study was designed to study, in advanced glaucoma, the long-term clinical course and prognosis, and, in a randomized trial, the comparative outcomes of two sequences of surgical treatments. Toward these goals, 789 eyes in 591 patients were enrolled at 11 clinical centers between 1988 and 1992. Follow-up will continue until 1996. Eyes were randomly assigned to one of two sequences of surgical treatments. One sequence begins with argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT), is followed by trabeculectomy, an incisional surgical filtering procedure, should ALT fail to control the disease, and by a second trabeculectomy should the first trabeculectomy fail. The other sequence begins with trabeculectomy, is followed by ALT should the trabeculectomy fail, and by a second trabeculectomy should ALT fail. The main outcome of interest is visual function (visual field and visual acuity). Other important outcomes are intraocular pressure, complications of surgery, time to treatment failure, and extent of need for additional medical therapy. We present in this paper the rationale, objectives, design and methods of the study, and the baseline characteristics of study patients and eyes."

These patients benefited from a particularly advantageous situation. Intraocular pressure was once again reliably regulated. In addition, there were no visual disturbances, e.g., as caused by miotics. Local and general tolerance are excellent; the level of patient discomfort is very low, as the drops are only applied once or twice a day; and, finally, the patient remains in ophthalmological care. Postoperative treatment with Timoptol has also proved highly successful in another group of patients, i.e., glaucoma patients in whom an argon laser trabeculoplasty was performed prior to cataract extraction. In these patients the subsequent cataract extraction is greatly facilitated because the pupil can be readily dilated."
CD012223,0,4074550,0,Surgical treatment of open-angle glaucoma.,"The influence of intraocular pressure (IOP) on the visual field of glaucoma patients is discussed; the criterion level for postoperative IOP control was set at 20 mmHg. When the IOP exceeded this level for two consecutive months, the IOP control was judged to be a failure, and the surgical results were analysed by a life-table method. Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) with 50 shots over 180 degrees of the angle was used routinely, because of fewer complications than with 360 degrees ALT. A second session sometimes improved the final success rate, which was about 57% in primary open-angle glaucoma and 94% in capsular glaucoma after a follow-up period of two years and two months. All patients (120 eyes) required drugs, but their use could be reduced in about 35%. The IOP distribution in successful cases showed a peak at 16 to 17 mmHg, and the IOP was 15 mmHg or less in 21%. In trabeculectomy, pretreatment with topical indomethacin and steroid drip infusion was advocated, and concentrated sodium hyaluronate was used during surgery. These procedures reduced the incidence of shallow anterior chamber and associated choroidal detachment. The final success rate was about 60% after five years of follow-up. The IOP distribution after more than two years peaked at 13 to 15 mmHg, and the IOP was 15 mmHg or less in 53%."

CD012223,0,12751655,0,Open-angle glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is the second most common cause of legal blindness in the United States. Open-angle glaucoma is an asymptomatic, progressive optic neuropathy characterized by enlarging optic disc cupping and visual field loss. Patients at increased risk for open-angle glaucoma include blacks older than 40 years, whites older than 65 years, and persons with a family history of glaucoma or a personal history of diabetes or severe myopia. Elevated intraocular pressure is a strong, modifiable risk factor for open-angle glaucoma, but it is not diagnostic. Some patients with glaucoma have normal intraocular pressure (i.e., normal-pressure glaucoma), and many patients with elevated intraocular pressure do not have glaucoma (i.e., glaucoma suspects). Routine measurement of intraocular pressure by primary care physicians to screen patients for glaucoma is not recommended. Open-angle glaucoma usually is discovered during an adult eye evaluation performed for other indications. Final diagnosis and treatment occur in collaboration with ophthalmologists and optometrists. Formal visual field testing (perimetry) is a mainstay of glaucoma diagnosis and management. Eye drops, commonly nonspecific beta-blocker or prostaglandin analog drops, generally are the first-line treatment to reduce intraocular pressure. Laser treatment and surgery usually are reserved for patients in whom medical treatment has failed. Without treatment, open-angle glaucoma can end in irreversible vision loss."

CD012223,0,1954206,0,Trabeculectomy combined with beta irradiation for congenital glaucoma.,"Sixty-six eyes with congenital glaucoma were subjected to trabeculectomy between July 1975 and June 1989 are presented. Thirty-one were treated with beta irradiation at the time of surgery with a strontium-90 applicator; 35 were not treated with beta irradiation. The usual dose was 750 rad. Analysis was limited to three years because of the shorter follow-up of the irradiated eyes. Failure in the two groups was compared statistically. When failure was categorised as IOP greater than 21 mm Hg, beta irradiation was found to be significantly protective with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.11-0.90, p less than 0.05). Failure categorised as the need for additional medical treatment or further surgery showed significant protection with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.33 (confidence interval 0.12-0.94, p less than 0.05). Multiple regression models were used for the analysis of intraocular pressure; beta irradiation was associated with a significantly lower IOP at six months, one year, and three years (p less than 0.05). Other factors identified as being associated with a reduced failure rate or lower IOP were: no previous topical glaucoma medications: age over seven years; lack of previous surgery involving the conjunctiva. The results indicate that beta irradiation may have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of trabeculectomy in children with congenital glaucoma. However, because of the retrospective and observational nature of the study, the results must be regarded as tentative."

CD012223,0,20964459,0,Current approaches to the management of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness in Europe and North America, and the incidence is expected to increase in parallel with the rising incidence of diabetes mellitus. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical presentation and pathophysiology of DR and its principal associated complications, diabetic macular oedema (DME) and neovascularization, and then proceeds to the primary focus of clinical management. A series of major randomized controlled trials conducted over the past few decades has confirmed that tight glycaemic regulation is the most effective measure to reduce the risk of developing DR and to minimize the likelihood of its progression, and that control of blood pressure is also an important feature of preventive management. Laser-based therapies remain the cornerstone of treatment, with panretinal photocoagulation indicated for proliferative and severe nonproliferative DR and focal photocoagulation indicated for treatment of DME. For patients who do not benefit from these approaches, vitrectomy may provide therapeutic benefits. Medical therapies include two broad classes of agents: anti-inflammatory drugs and agents with molecular targets. The utility of oral anti-inflammatory drugs remains to be established, as dose-finding studies have yet to provide definitive conclusions. Intravitreal corticosteroids may be of value in specific circumstances, although adverse effects include cataract progression and elevated intraocular pressure. However, these complications appear to have been limited with new extended-release technologies. With respect to molecular targets, evidence has been adduced for the roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and protein kinase C (PKC)-β2 in the pathogenesis of DR, and agents targeting these factors are under intense investigation. The role of VEGF in mediating pathological angiogenesis and vascular hyperpermeability has been best defined. Preliminary efficacy of pegaptanib and ranibizumab in the treatment of DME is being confirmed in additional clinical trials with these agents and with the off-label use of bevacizumab, another monoclonal antibody related to ranibizumab. Moreover, other agents targeting VEGF, as well as drugs directed against TNFα and PKC-β2, are under study. Evaluation of the ultimate utility of these approaches will await the efficacy and safety results of properly designed phase III trials."

CD012223,0,575991,0,Morphological studies about the efficiency of laser beams upon the structures of the angle of the anterior chamber. Facts and concepts related to the treatment of the chronic simple glaucoma.,"Working at a power density above optical breakdown threshold, irradiation effects upon the angle of the anterior chamber of the Macaca speciosa monkey by a Nd glass Q-switched laser, have been analysed with scanning electron microscopy. Two different damage effects can be identified: openings of Schlemm's canal and the creation of a cyclodialysis, that is opening the uveoscleral outflow routes; the latter may be a more effective one than the former. Also a third mechanism, namely a structural alteration of the trabecular meshwork, at the molecular level by laser action, has been inferred. The physical effects leading to optically induced mechanical damage are discussed. Applicability of such effects upon the morphological findings described here, is limited and to a greater part speculative. A better definition of the physical parameters, required for optimal therapeutical damage effects in the treatment of the wide angle glaucoma may be obtained by trial and error methods, which are guided by the results of electron microscopical analyses of samples obtained from in vivo and in vitro experiments."

Patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and all other variables, including power, number, and distribution of laser applications, were kept constant. Six months postoperatively, those treated 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus had a lower intraocular pressure (P = .0047) than those treated 3.0 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. The 1.5-mm group also required fewer retreatment (P = .017) and had a slightly lower occurrence of visual acuity loss after this procedure. We believe it may be advantageous to locate the laser application approximately 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus, rather than further posteriorly, when performing noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation."
CD012223,0,25245600,0,"The influence of anti-VEGF therapy on present day management of macular edema due to BRVO and CRVO: a longitudinal analysis on visual function, injection time interval and complications.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of intravitreal bevacizumab injections on the management and outcome of patients affected by retinal vein occlusions, their effectiveness on morphological and functional parameters, the modalities of long-term management and the need for additional laser treatment due to ischemic retinal evolution. Patients diagnosed with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) had a comprehensive work-up including complete ophthalmic examination, fluorangiography (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual field testing (VFT), microperimetry (MP), and laser flare photometry (LFP). In case of BRVO, intraocular bevacizumab injection was performed if significant macular edema/visual deficit was still present 3 months after onset of occlusion and injections were started at presentation in case of CRVO. Post-injection follow-up examination including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), LFP, OCT, MP, and VFT were performed monthly and recorded at the end of follow-up. Follow-up FA was performed between 12 and 18 months after diagnosis. Injections were repeated in case of recurrence of a significant central macular edema. Patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to number of injections: 1-4 injections or more than 4 injections. The proportion of resolved cases (no recurrence after a minimum follow-up of 12 months) was calculated and correlated with number of injections. In patients needing sustained injections, management modalities were recorded. The proportion of patients having needed laser photocoagulation treatment because of significant ischemic signs was recorded. Fifty-one patients were diagnosed with retinal vein occlusion between 2006 and 2012 at the Centre for Specialized Ophthalmic Care (COS) in Lausanne, Switzerland. Forty-four had enough data and were included in the study. Nine eyes were affected by CRVO and 35 were affected by BRVO. Mean BCVA at presentation was 0.24 ± 0.2 and improved to 0.81 ± 0.38 (p < 0.01) at 48 months. MP improved from 184.9 ± 92 to 362.5 ± 56.2 (p < 0.01) at 42 months follow-up. The number of injections varied from 1 to 25 (mean 5.5 ± 5.43). 31/44 eyes received 1-4 injections (group 1) of which all were recurrence free, with a follow-up of at least 1 years in all. 13/44 eyes received more than 5 injections (group 2) with functional and morphological parameters maintained in 9/13 but only 1/13 patients showed resolution. Rhythm of injection varied from one patient to another but 8/13 patients needing continuous injections had a constant time interval between injections. In 8/44 patients, laser photocoagulation had to be performed due to ischemic complications. The visual outcome using bevacizumab intravitreal injection was exceptionally good and functional parameters such as BCVA, MP, and VFT improved significantly. In about two-thirds of patients, resolution was obtained after 1-4 injections. In one-third of patients, continuous injections were necessary but a constant rhythm for re-injection for each patient could be established allowing to reduce to a minimum follow-up visits. The absence of significant side effects allowed to re-treat apparently without limitation achieving maintained visual function. FA monitoring for the detection of ischemic complications should not be neglected especially in cases where bevacizumab could be discontinued."

The CLBF calculates flow in microl/min based on the Poiseuille principle. One eye of 20 normal subjects (mean age 36.5; SD 9.7 years) was randomly chosen. A minimum of five measurements was acquired of a temporal arteriole approximately 1 disc diameter from the optic nerve. Measurements were repeated within a 1-month period. Blood pressure and intraocular pressure were measured. The coefficient of variation (COV) and the coefficient of repeatability (COR) were calculated for each individual. The individual COVs for diameter, velocity, and flow ranged from 0.5 to 6.5% (median 2.0%), 4.8 to 39.7% (median 19.9%), and 4.8 to 37.3% (median 19.3%), respectively. The group mean CORs for diameter, velocity, and flow were 5.2 microm (relative to a mean effect of 104.6 microm), 8.8 mm/s (relative to a mean effect of 33.9 mm/s), and 2.6 microl/min (relative to a mean effect of 8.8 microl/min), respectively. The CLBF gave consistent and repeatable measurements of blood flow within retinal arterioles in normal subjects. Given the range of individual variation in the velocity measurement, and thus flow, confidence limits for retinal hemodynamics need to be determined on an individual basis."

As a baseline study, IOP was determined and aqueous protein concentration was determined by laser flare photometry every half hour for 5 hours with the instillation of a placebo. Then, an examination with the same time course was performed on the same subjects with the instillation of 1% MK-507 or oral administration of acetazolamide at a dose of 250 mg. MK-507 lowered IOP 30 minutes after the instillation, and showed a significant reduction of IOP at 1 hour. Aqueous protein concentration increased significantly 30 minutes after the MK-507 instillation. Acetazolamide lowered IOP 30 minutes after the administration, and showed a significant reduction of IOP at one hour. Aqueous protein concentration increased significantly one hour after the acetazolamide administration. Corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber volume, and serum protein concentration were not significantly changed by the drug treatment. These results suggest that the inhibition of aqueous humor production causes the rapid reduction of IOP seen in the use of MK-507 as well as acetazolamide."

CD012223,0,19199899,0,Anti-angiogenic drugs as an adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of diabetic retinopathy.,"Anti-VEGF drugs may be employed in the surgical treatment of diabetic retinopathy: 1. Prior to surgery. The intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs leads to a significant reduction of neovascularization, with a reduction in the adherence of the fibrovascular complex to the retina. This simplifies viscodelamination and reduces intraoperative bleeding during delamination and segmentation. To minimize the risk of tractional retinal detachment due to the contraction of fibrovascular tissue, vitrectomy must be performed within one week after the injection. 2. To decrease the risk of postoperative bleeding. Recurrent vitreous hemorrhages after vitrectomy are often due to small bleeding from persistent neovascularization. The injection of anti-VEGF drugs at the end of vitrectomy could prevent bleeding from these vessels by blocking the pro-inflammatory stimulus of the surgical procedure. 3. To treat postoperative vitreous hemorrhage. The intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs in patients with postoperative bleeding leads to resolution of the hemorrhage. 4. To treat rubeosis iridis. In eyes with complete panretinal photocoagulation, the combination of cryotherapy and intravitreal anti-VEGF injection in the same surgical procedure produces a disappearance of iris neovascularization together with a long term effect with no recurrences. In neovascular glaucoma, anti-VEGF drugs can also facilitate filtrating surgery."

The study consisted of 31 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (study group) and 31 healthy subjects (control group). Corneal biomechanical properties, including corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured with an ocular response analyzer (ORA). IOP was also measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), and central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured with an ultrasonic pachymeter. The differences in ORA parameters and CCT between study and control group participants were analyzed. The mean CH in study and control groups was 8.7 ± 1.9 mmHg (5.3-13.7 mmHg) and 9.8 ± 1.5 mmHg (7.7-14.3 mmHg), respectively (p = 0.018). The mean CRF was 9.5 ± 1.8 (5.5-13.7) in the study group compared with 9.8 ± 1.5 (6.2-12.8) in the control group. The difference for CRF was not statistically significant (p = 0.41). In study and control group, corneal-compensated IOP (IOPcc) values were 18.2 ± 4.2 and 16.9 ± 2.7 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.12). Mean IOP measurement values with GAT were 16.3 ± 3.4 mmHg for study group and 16.5 ± 2.7 mmHg for control group (p = 0.71). The mean differences of IOPcc and IOPGAT in the study group eyes were higher than that of control group eyes (1.9 vs. 0.4 mmHg). CCT was 536.5 ± 25.4 µm (490-593 µm) in study group eyes compared with 534.2 ± 31.4 µm (472-602 µm) in control eyes (p = 0.75). Hyperparathyroidism could be associated with a decrease of CH.

Through extensive research in glaucoma treatment, ophthalmologists now have access to a dozen different medications to treat glaucoma. This has invariably led to a decrease in the need for laser or surgery to control the intraocular pressures, and the number of glaucoma operations performed has progressively declined over the past few years. However, aviation medicine practitioners need to be aware of the potential adverse effects of these medications as some of these undesirable side effects may render the drugs unsuitable for aircrew."

This prospective study comprised 109 eyes of 109 adult cases who had IV bevacizumab or ranibizumab injections because of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), retinal venous occlusion (RVO), diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema or central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). None of the cases had medical histories of any kinds of glaucoma or increased IOP and IV injection before and all of them underwent a detailed ocular examination including measurements of IOP by non-contact tonometer and CCT by ultrasonic pachymeter pre-injection. IOP measurements were repeated at 30 min and 1st, 7th, and 30th day after the injection. CCT measurements were repeated at the 7th and 30th post-injection day. Paired sample t tests were used for the statistical analysis in order to evaluate the significance of changes in IOP and CCT. The mean age of 56 male and 53 female cases was 63.58 ± 11.04 years. Fifty-six cases (51.4 %) had diabetic retinopathy, 33 cases (30.3 %) had ARMD, 11 cases (10.1 %) had RVO, and 9 cases (8.3 %) had CSCR. Bevacizumab was used in 97 (89 %) cases and ranibizumab was used in 12 (11 %) cases. The IOP increased significantly 30 min after the injection (p < 0.001) but significant decreases were observed at the 1st, 7th, and 30th day post-injection (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in CCT between pre-injection and 7th and 30th post-injection day values (p = 0.924 and p = 0.589, respectively). Intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections can cause hyper acute increase in IOP because of vitreal expansion but this effect is generally reversible in non-glaucomatous cases."

In addition, tissue oxygenation was measured using two oximeters with Combi sensors (Periflux 5000, Perimed). The study included four groups of patients (pts) that were compared with a control group. Group A Controls (n=25: 15 males [M] and 10 females [F] aged 36 +/- 3 years); Group B Diabetic pts n=32 (IDDM pts n=20: 12 M and 8 F aged 43 +/- 4 years; NIDDM pts n=12: 6 M and 6 F aged 45 +/- 3 years); Group C Glaucoma pts n=30 (16 M and 14 F aged 42 +/- 5 years); Group D Liver failure pts n=6 (3 M and 3 F aged 44 +/- 5 years); Group E Hypertensive pts n=50 (smokers n=28: 12 M and 16 F aged 40 +/- 4 years, and nonsmokers n=22: 12 M and 10 F aged 38 +/- 3 years). In all patients hemorheological measurements were made using the LORCA (including red blood cell [RBC] deformability and aggregability), morphology was evaluated using computerized videocapillaroscopy (magnification 200 x), and transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure measurements (TcpO2) were made with the Periflux 5000. In patients with diabetic microangiopathy: the capillary loops in 50% (16/32) of these pts showed formations such as 'deer horns', 72% (23/32) showed formations such as 'elephant nose', and in 45% (14/32) formations such as a 'cork screw'; in diabetics with POAD an important capillary rarefaction was found in 26% (9/32) of the pts. In glaucoma patients, in 84% (25/30) we observed 'capillary meandering' and images such as 'a comb'. In patients with more complicated pathology capillary rarefaction was found in 70% (21/30) of the patients. An improvement in the perfusion of non-functional loops was found in deceased patients who had suffered liver failure one week after liver transplantation in 90% (5/6) of the studied cadavers. In non-smoking hypertensives morphological changes were found in 25% (6/22) of the patients, and in hypertensive smokers in 47% (13/28). RBC deformability was detected using LORCA and expressed as the Elongation Index (EI), and RBC aggregability was detected using LORCA and expressed in t 1/2 (seconds) indicating the RBC aggregability peak. Group A controls: EI 0.59 +/- 0.02; t 1/2 3 +/- 1 sec; Group B: IDDM EI 0.55 +/- 0.01; t 1/2 : 2 +/- 0.5 sec p < 0.05; NIDDM EI 0.56 +/- 0.01; t 1/2 2 +/- 0.2 sec p < 0.04; Group C glaucoma: EI 0.56 +/- 0.01; t 1/2 2 +/- 0.3 sec p < 0.05; Group D liver failure: EI 0.56 0.02; t 1/2 2 +/- 0.4 sec p < 0.03; Group E hypertensives: smokers EI 0.56 +/- 0.02; t 1/2 2 +/- 0.6 sec p < 0.04; non-smokers EI 0.57 +/- 0.02; t 1/2 2 +/- 0.6 sec p < 0.04 compared with controls.

It is performed as follows: tight scleral flap trabeculectomy, five or more 10/0 nylon sutures, argon laser lysis of one or more sutures (depending on the eye's postoperative condition) by means of the Hoskins lens. The aim of this technique, performed by the authors for 3 years, is to decrease atalamia and choroidal detachment. Results obtained in 70 eyes of 62 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma are compared by means of statistical analysis with those in 70 eyes of 66 patients operated on by means of the traditional technique. The incidence of choroidal detachment is significantly reduced (P < 0.001). There is no important difference in ocular pressure and visual acuity. In conclusion, this technique is very useful in controlling and titrating the filtration rate, avoiding an excessive lowering of IOP after trabeculectomy and decreasing the complications."

CD012223,0,21302732,0,Selective laser trabeculoplasty in the treatment of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma in patients allergic to all anti-glaucoma drops.,"Secondary chronic open-angle glaucoma associated with pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome accounts for approximately 25% of all glaucomas and represents the most common identifiable cause of glaucoma overall. Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is effective in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucomatous patients and has the advantage of preserving surrounding structures. We report here SLT treatment of a 82 year old female with a secondary developed open-angle pseudoexfoliation glaucoma allergic to all anti glaucoma eye drops especially those which contain bensalconium chloridum as preservative. Since patient was allergic also to methyl-cellulose, we performed SLT with water as a mediator. Patient had PEX syndrome for 10 years, immature cataracts on both eyes, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 0.7 on the right and 0.2 on the left eye. We have monitored intraocular pressure (IOP), the changes in the visual field and optic nerve. Preoperative IOP was 28 mmHg on the right and 30 mmHg on the left eye. The follow up period was 24 months with time points for measured parameters every 3 months. After 18 months IOP remained in the normal values (average 17 mmHg) on the right eye, but on the left eye it increased up to 28 mmHg. SLT re-treatment was carried out on the left eye and the IOP stabilized again on the values between 16-18mmHg. There were no significant change in the visual field and optic nerve configuration before and after SLT (C/D value for right eye: 0.3-0.4; C/D left eye: 0.5). Based on this case report, SLT seems to be very effective treatment for maintaining regular IOP in patient with PEX who is allergic to all types of medications."

CD012223,0,1766638,0,[Anti-inflammatory treatment after argon laser trabeculoplasty].,"After argon trabeculoplasty procedures in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma, the protein appearance and cell circulation were observed within the anterior chamber. Flare and cell measurements of the anterior compartment are parameters of aqueous blood barrier break down. This investigation was performed in 50 patients suffering from elevated intraocular pressure and treated with argon laser trabeculoplasty. Two different anti-inflammatory drugs (prednisolone acetate and cyclooxygenase inhibitor) were applied to the treated eyes and checked for their effect on inflammation reduction. The protein and cell concentrations within the anterior chamber were measured before and 6 and 24 h after trabeculoplasty with a flare cell meter (KOWA) and compared to a control group.

CD012223,0,27175839,0,Glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a set of irreversible, progressive optic neuropathies that can lead to severe visual field loss and blindness. The two most common forms of glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma and primary angle-closure glaucoma, affect more than 2 million Americans and are increasing in prevalence. Many patients with glaucoma are asymptomatic and do not know they have the disease. Risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma include older age, black race, Hispanic origin, family history of glaucoma, and diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for primary angle-closure glaucoma include older age, Asian descent, and female sex. Advanced disease at initial presentation and treatment nonadherence put patients with glaucoma at risk of disease progression to blindness. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that the evidence is insufficient to assess the potential benefits and harms of screening for glaucoma in the primary care setting. Regular eye examinations for adults are recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, with the interval depending on patient age and risk factors. Diagnosis of glaucoma requires careful optic nerve evaluation and functional studies assessing a patient's visual field. The goal of treatment with eye drops, laser therapy, or surgery is to slow visual field loss by lowering intraocular pressure. Family physicians can contribute to lowering morbidity from glaucoma through early identification of high-risk patients and by emphasizing treatment adherence in patients with glaucoma."

CD012223,0,29040280,0,Quantitative analysis of neural tissues around the optic disc after panretinal photocoagulation in patients with diabetic retinopathy.,"In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we quantitatively analyzed the tomographic features in the neural tissues around the optic disc in patients with diabetic retinopathy with and without panretinal photocoagulation. We analyzed 206 eyes, comprising 33 normal eyes in subjects without diabetes (group I), 30 eyes without diabetic retinopathy (group II), 66 eyes with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (group III), 45 eyes with panretinal photocoagulation (group IV), and 32 eyes with normal tension glaucoma (group V). Sequential images acquired using swept-source optical coherence tomography in three-dimensional mode were used to measure peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, neuro-retinal rim thickness, anterior lamina cribrosa depth, prelaminar thickness, and thickness of the lamina cribrosa. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and lamina cribrosa thickness were significantly thinner in group IV than in group III (p = 0.019 and p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in rim thickness, anterior lamina cribrosa depth, or prelaminar thickness between groups III and IV (p = 0.307, p = 0.877, and p = 0.212). Multivariate analysis revealed that time since panretinal photocoagulation and thickness of the lamina cribrosa had a significant effect on peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (p < 0.001 and p = 0.014). In group IV, there was a negative correlation between time elapsed since panretinal photocoagulation and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, rim thickness, and thickness of the lamina cribrosa (r = -0.765, r = -0.490, and r = -0.419), but no correlation with prelaminar thickness or anterior lamina cribrosa depth (r = 0.104 and r = -0.171).

Results of viscocanalostomy and incidence of goniopuncture were retrospectively investigated in 33 eyes of 33 patients. Success was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) below 19 mmHg with an at least 30% decrease compared to the last preoperative measurement. General success rates after a mean follow-up of 33.5 +/- 11.3 months were 79 and 46%, with and without medications, respectively.

Short-term effects.,"This is a prospective study of 82 newly discovered patients with simplex or capsular glaucoma from two centres, collected between 1984 and 1989 and selected at random for primary treatment by either laser or pilocarpine. Preliminary two-year follow-up shows that primary laser treatment gives a significantly higher number of patients where the intraocular pressure is successfully controlled. Primary argon laser trabeculoplasty has been carried out in 40 patients. The first treatment was given to either the upper or to the lower half of the trabecular meshwork. In the second treatment after one month the other half was treated. In both groups the first treatment gave the highest pressure reduction. The somewhat higher pressure reduction after upper treatment versus lower was insignificant.

Pressure rises greater than 10 mmHg occurred in 5% after the first and in 10% after the second treatment. No pressure-lowering substances were given. Considering that 16% of the eyes had an intraocular pressure that was higher than baseline pressure even 6 h after either first or second treatment, it is recommended that a pressure-lowering medication on the day of treatment should be administered."

Their average age was 33 +/- 13 y/o (range 14-45). Under the randomized, double-masked design, one drop of 0.5% timolol maleate was given in one eye, and placebo in the fellow eye. Heart rate, blood pressure, intraocular pressure, and ocular perfusion were measured at baseline, and then 30 minutes and 2 hours after treatment. Ocular perfusion was measured by Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). We used 10 degrees measurement field and 10 x 10 pixels measurement frame. Four areas were measured, i.e., temporal upper, temporal lower, and nasal parts of the optic disc, and macula. In comparison to the baseline, the treated eyes had a slight reduction of blood flow, volume, and velocity 30 minutes after treatment, but these parameters came back close to the baseline value at 2 hours after treatment. Similar changes were also noted in the control eyes. The results showed that a single drop of 0.5% timolol had minimal effects on the retinal and macular circulation within 2 hours after treatment."
CD012223,0,9352164,0,Acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with acetazolamide intoxication in a patient with chronic renal failure.,"Acetazolamide (Diamox) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor commonly used in patients with glaucoma in order to reduce intraocular pressure. Acetazolamide (AZ) is mostly excreted in the urine, therefore, the blood levels of AZ often tend to increase in patients with chronic renal failure. We experienced a case of chronic renal failure in a patient suffering from acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with AZ intoxication. A 66-year-old female with chronic renal failure was referred to our hospital because of drowsiness and an acute deterioration of renal function. She had been treated with AZ, 500 mg per every day for eleven days for the treatment of glaucoma. Laboratory studies showed leukocyturia, thrombocytopenia, severe anemia, and tarry stools. The serum concentration of AZ was elevated to a maximum of 76.5 mg/ml. She was thus diagnosed as having AZ intoxication. On further examination, acute extensive hemorrhagic gastritis was also found by gastroscopy. Despite of the administration of intensive therapies, she died of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and septic shock due to bone marrow depression 6 days after admission. It is generally known that excessive blood levels of AZ inhibit not only the gastric juices but also prostaglandin levels and HCO3- excretion in the gastric mucosal barrier. We thus concluded that an excessive dose of AZ had probably destroyed the gastric mucosal barrier or thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow disorder and thus eventually led to the development of hemorrhagic gastritis. As far as we know, this is the first case report of acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with AZ intoxication. Even though AZ tends to strongly bind to plasma protein and its clearance is generally poor by hemodialysis (HD), in our patient, HD was observed to be rather effective since the clearance of AZ was 45.8 ml/min on HD and 66 ml/min on direct hemoperfusion (DHP). DHP often reduces the number of platelets, also DHP needs a lot of heparin, therefore, we should have performed HD alone instead of DHP. In patients with an impaired renal function, AZ should therefore be administered very carefully in order to avoid an accumulation of the drug. In addition, HD alone should be used to remove any excessive amounts of AZ from the blood."

CD012223,0,16002558,0,Effect of histamine and cimetidine on retinal and choroidal blood flow in humans.,"Intravenous administration of histamine causes an increase in choroidal blood flow and retinal vessel diameter in healthy subjects. The mechanism underlying this effect remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we hypothesized that H2 receptor blockade alters hemodynamic effects of histamine in the choroid and retina. Eighteen healthy male nonsmoking volunteers were included in this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled two-way crossover study. Histamine (0.32 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) over 30 min) was infused intravenously in the absence (NaCl as placebo) or presence of the H2 blocker cimetidine (2.3 mg/min over 50 min). Ocular hemodynamic parameters, blood pressure, and intraocular pressure were measured before drug administration, after infusion of cimetidine or placebo, and after coinfusion of histamine. Subfoveal choroidal blood flow and fundus pulsation amplitude were measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry and laser interferometry, respectively. Retinal arterial and venous diameters were measured with a retinal vessel analyzer. Retinal blood velocity was assessed with bidirectional laser-Doppler velocimetry. Histamine increased subfoveal choroidal blood flow (+14 +/- 15%, P < 0.001), fundus pulsation amplitude (+11 +/- 5%, P < 0.001), retinal venous diameter (+3.0 +/- 3.6%, P = 0.002), and retinal arterial diameter (+2.8 +/- 4.2%, P < 0.01) but did not change retinal blood velocity. The H2 antagonist cimetidine had no significant effect on ocular hemodynamic parameters. In addition, cimetidine did not modify effects of histamine on choroidal blood flow, fundus pulsation amplitude, retinal venous diameter, and retinal arterial diameter compared with placebo. The present data confirm that histamine increases choroidal blood flow and retinal vessel diameters in healthy subjects. This ocular vasodilator effect of histamine is, however, not altered by administration of an H2 blocker. Whether the increase in blood flow is mediated via H1 receptors or other hitherto unidentified mechanisms remains to be elucidated."
CD012223,0,25088622,0,Lens-based glaucoma surgery: using cataract surgery to reduce intraocular pressure.,"Cataract surgery has been demonstrated to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in eyes with glaucoma. The evidence is strong in angle-closure patients that cataract surgery improves IOP and dramatically reduces the future risk for IOP spikes and acute attacks. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that cataract surgery may be preferable to laser iridotomy or phacotrabeculectomy. The data are so convincing that an RCT has been undertaken to assess whether clear lens extraction may be appropriate following acute attacks and in cases of uncontrolled IOP. The case favoring cataract surgery in open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is more controversial. Impressive IOP reduction has been shown in OAG patients when the patients are stratified by preoperative IOP. The patients with the highest preoperative IOPs have pressure reductions up to 8.5 mm Hg. However, these findings have been criticized for methodological weaknesses. Combining cataract surgery with microinvasive glaucoma surgery in phaco-plus procedures provides further options for lens-based glaucoma surgery."

CD012223,0,3536206,0,Diabetic retinopathy: current concepts of evaluation and treatment.,"Diabetic retinopathy is a common, and potentially blinding or visually disabling complication of diabetes. Nearly all diabetic subjects will have some degree of retinopathy after 20 years of diabetes, and 50% of those with insulin dependent diabetes will have proliferative retinopathy after 15 years. Macular oedema frequently produces central vision loss and legal blindness, most commonly in non-insulin dependent diabetics. In recent years, several therapeutic modalities have been demonstrated to be effective on the basis of large-scale randomized, controlled clinical trials. These include panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), using the argon laser or xenon arc, for proliferative retinopathy, and focal photocoagulation for macular oedema. Vitrectomy surgery is effective for diabetic vitreous haemorrhage and traction retinal detachment, producing improved vision in most patients, but only a relatively small percentage of patients so treated recover good visual acuity (greater than or equal to 6/12). Other therapeutic modalities, such as hypophysectomy for severe retinopathy, remain controversial, while still others, such as rigorous blood glucose control and aldose reductase inhibitors, are currently under investigation. The primary care physician who deals with diabetic patients should be familiar with the lesions of diabetic retinopathy and with current therapeutic modalities. He should perform an examination of the posterior retina with the direct ophthalmoscope on each diabetic patient at each visit, and should institute prompt referral to an ophthalmologist at the first sign of change. Periodic examination of all diabetic patients by an ophthalmologist should be conducted at the intervals recommended in the previous section. Definitive evaluation and treatment of diabetic retinopathy should be carried out by the ophthalmologist."

CD012223,0,29582808,0,"Simplifying ""target"" intraocular pressure for different stages of primary open-angle glaucoma and primary angle-closure glaucoma.","Lowering of intraocular pressure is currently the only therapeutic measure for Glaucoma management. Many longterm, randomized trials have shown the efficacy of lowering IOP, either by a percentage of baseline, or to a specified level. This has lead to the concept of 'Target"" IOP, a range of IOP on therapy, that would stabilize the Glaucoma/prevent further visual field loss, without significantly affecting a patient's quality of life. A clinical staging of Glaucoma by optic nerve head evaluation and perimetric parameters, allows a patient's eye to be categorized as having - mild, moderate or severe Glaucomatous damage. An initial attempt should be made to achieve the following IOP range for both POAG or PACG after an iridotomy. In mild glaucoma the initial target IOP range could be kept as 15-17 mmHg, for moderate glaucoma 12-15 mmHg and in the severe stage of glaucomatous damage 10-12 mmHg. Factoring in baseline IOP, age, vascular perfusion parameters, and change on perimetry or imaging during follow up, this range may be reassessed over 6 months to a year. ""Target"" IOP requires further lowering when the patient continues to progress or develops a systemic disease such as a TIA. Conversely, in the event of a very elderly or sick patient with stable nerve and visual field over time, the target IOP could be raised and medications reduced.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 74 POAG patients (74 eyes) whose IOP was inadequately controlled by PG analogs (bimatoprost [13 eyes], latanoprost [34 eyes], tafluprost [11 eyes], and travoprost [16 eyes]) and underwent primary trabeculectomy. The proportion of patients with no recurrent IOP elevation within 24 months post-trabeculectomy was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in the bimatoprost group (31.3%) than in the latanoprost (83.2%), tafluprost (45.5%), or travoprost groups (65.6%). Deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus (DUES) was observed before trabeculectomy in 18 of 74 eyes (24.3%) treated with bimatoprost (9 eyes; 50.0%), latanoprost (3 eyes; 16.7%), tafluprost (1 eye; 5.5%) and travoprost (5 eyes; 27.8%). The proportion of patients with no recurrent IOP elevation up to 24 months post-trabeculectomy was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower in the DUES(+) group (34.7%) than in the DUES(-) group (74.3%). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, with no recurrent IOP elevation used as dependent variable, and bimatoprost, latanoprost, travoprost, tafluprost, β-blocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, brimonidine, gender, age, preoperative IOP, mean deviation, duration of PG analog use before surgery, and the number of ophthalmic solutions used as independent variables, identified only bimatoprost as a significant independent factor (P = 0.0368). Thus, the outcome of trabeculectomy varied depending on the PG analog used preoperatively, and bimatoprost use was associated with a high risk of recurrent IOP elevation up to 2 years post-trabeculectomy. This may indicate that the incidence of DUES differed with the PG analog used. Patients with glaucoma who are treated with bimatoprost should be monitored for DUES, and when these patients undergo trabeculectomy, the postoperative course of IOP should be followed carefully."

Tolerance of the original IOP, which was close to the age norm according to tonography readings, a reduced linear blood circulation, somewhat higher parameters of the peripheral resistance registered in the ocular artery (OA) and in the central retinal artery--(CRA)--(p < 0.05) and absolute defects of blood filling of the vascular system of the optic nerve disk (OND) were found to be typical of the group with a resistant and relatively low pressure (< or = 20 mm Hg), which was indicative of the predominant role of vascular disorders in the discussed patients. As for the group with a relatively high pressure (< or = 26 mm Hg), apart from the impaired orbital blood circulation, intolerance of the original IOP, as well as reduced parameters of secretion and discharge were found to be typical of it.

CD012223,0,25820518,0,Agreement between diurnal variations of intraocular pressure by Tono-Pen and Goldmann applanation tonometer in patients on topical anti-glaucoma medication.,"To estimate agreement in diurnal variations of intraocular pressure (IOP) by Tono-Pen (TP) and Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) in glaucoma patients on topical anti-glaucoma medication(s). IOP was measured at every 3 h from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. in 50 eyes of glaucoma patients on topical medication(s). Diurnal fluctuation of IOP by each method was calculated as maximum-minimum IOP in a day. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured by ultrasonic pachymeter. There was good correlation between TP and GAT at all times during a day, minimum, and maximum IOPs during a day (Correlation coefficient, 0.706 at 7 a.m., 0.624 at 10 a.m., 0.682 at 1 p.m., 0.814 at 4 p.m., 0.652 at 7 p.m., 0.572 at 10 p.m., 0.668 minimum IOP, 0.689 maximum IOP). Mean IOPs by TP were always higher than GAT at all times during a day. Bland-Altman plots suggested a close relationship between the two sets of readings, and that this relationship was consistent at different times in a day, in maximum IOPs, minimum IOPs and also in fluctuation of IOPs. Linear regression analysis between the differences of diurnal fluctuation (diurnal fluctuation by GAT-diurnal fluctuation by TP) and CCT showed strong association (R 2 = 0.857, p < 0.001). The mean change in difference of diurnal fluctuation (GAT-TP) for a 10-micron increase in CCT was 0.69 mmHg. TP can be considered a reliable alternative to GAT in glaucoma patients for knowing the diurnal control of IOP; however these two methods should not be used interchangeably. Difference of diurnal fluctuation between two methods is dependent on CCT."
CD012223,0,24467200,0,"Glucocorticoids: structure, signaling and molecular mechanisms in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the working population worldwide. Vascular leakage, angiogenesis and neuronal degeneration are key features of DR. Current effective interventions for DR include treatment of systemic risk factors such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia. Ocular treatments include vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) inhibitors, laser photocoagulation and surgery. While anti-VEGF therapy has become as first-line treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) that causes reduced vision, intravitreal glucocorticoids also have been shown to be efficacious in this situation. It has been reported that all the major pathological processes of DR are susceptible to glucocorticoid treatment. The effects of glucocorticoids on vascular leakage and angiogenesis may be mediated through their well established anti-inflammatory role. Alternatively, glucocorticoids may affect other mechanisms known to be activated in DR. Potential mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids include blockage of cytokine production and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion induced by VEGF-A. Glucocorticoids decrease the expression of VEGF-A directly, and increase the production, or decrease phosphorylation, of tight junction-associated proteins. Glucocorticoids have also been shown to be neuroprotective, in contrast to VEGF-A inhibitors which animal studies suggest may be neurotoxic. This review outlines the biological properties of synthetic glucocorticoids, with particular emphasis on the potential beneficial effect of combining glucocorticoids with anti-VEGF treatment for DME and DR."
CD012223,0,26825853,0,Treatment of retinitis pigmentosa due to MERTK mutations by ocular subretinal injection of adeno-associated virus gene vector: results of a phase I trial.,"MERTK is an essential component of the signaling network that controls phagocytosis in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the loss of which results in photoreceptor degeneration. Previous proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the efficacy of gene therapy using human MERTK (hMERTK) packaged into adeno-associated virus (AAV2) in treating RCS rats and mice with MERTK deficiency. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of gene transfer via subretinal administration of rAAV2-VMD2-hMERTK in subjects with MERTK-associated retinitis pigmentosa (RP). After a preclinical phase confirming the safety of the study vector in monkeys, six patients (aged 14 to 54, mean 33.3 years) with MERTK-related RP and baseline visual acuity (VA) ranging from 20/50 to <20/6400 were entered in a phase I open-label, dose-escalation trial. One eye of each patient (the worse-seeing eye in five subjects) received a submacular injection of the viral vector, first at a dose of 150 µl (5.96 × 10(10)vg; 2 patients) and then 450 µl (17.88 × 10(10)vg; 4 patients). Patients were followed daily for 10 days at 30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365, 540, and 730 days post-injection. Collected data included (1) full ophthalmologic examination including best-corrected VA, intraocular pressure, color fundus photographs, macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography and full-field stimulus threshold test (FST) in both the study and fellow eyes; (2) systemic safety data including CBC, liver and kidney function tests, coagulation profiles, urine analysis, AAV antibody titers, peripheral blood PCR and ASR measurement; and (3) listing of ophthalmological or systemic adverse effects. All patients completed the 2-year follow-up. Subretinal injection of rAAV2-VMD2-hMERTK was associated with acceptable ocular and systemic safety profiles based on 2-year follow-up. None of the patients developed complications that could be attributed to the gene vector with certainty. Postoperatively, one patient developed filamentary keratitis, and two patients developed progressive cataract. Of these two patients, one also developed transient subfoveal fluid after the injection as well as monocular oscillopsia. Two patients developed a rise in AAV antibodies, but neither patient was positive for rAAV vector genomes via PCR. Three patients also displayed measurable improved visual acuity in the treated eye following surgery, although the improvement was lost by 2 years in two of these patients. Gene therapy for MERTK-related RP using careful subretinal injection of rAAV2-VMD2-hMERTK is not associated with major side effects and may result in clinical improvement in a subset of patients."
CD012223,0,9474317,0,Surgical results in malignant glaucoma refractory to medical or laser therapy.,"We investigated the surgical results in 25 patients identified with malignant (ciliary block) glaucoma. Four of these patients (16%) had successful outcomes following laser treatment alone. Nineteen patients (76%) underwent microsurgery for glaucoma refractory to conventional medical and/or laser therapy and are the subjects of this study. Core vitrectomy was successful in 4 of 6 pseudophakic patients (67%) and in 1 of 4 phakic patients (25%). Combined cataract extraction and vitrectomy had a higher success rate in patients undergoing posterior capsulectomy at the time of surgery (5 of 6 patients; 83%) compared with those patients left with an intact posterior capsular bag (1 of 4 patients; 25%). Intracapsular cataract extraction was successful in 1 of 2 patients (50%). We conclude that surgical vitrectomy in the presence of an intact posterior capsule may preclude the surgical resolution of aqueous misdirection. In eyes with pre-existing cataract, we recommend combined lens extraction, primary posterior capsulectomy and surgical vitrectomy for the surgical management of phakic malignant glaucoma."

However, migration of the implant into the anterior chamber with elevation of intraocular pressure and corneal decompensation might occur in some cases. We report a case of an 80-year-old male who underwent intravitreal scleral fixation of OZURDEX(®) due to postoperative macular edema secondary to complicated cataract surgery. He had a previous angle-supported lens implantation with superior Nd:YAG laser iridotomy. During surgery, the dexamethasone implant was introduced into the vitreous cavity and sutured to the sclera using a 10-0 non-absorbable polypropylene suture to prevent the risk of anterior complications in case of migration into the anterior chamber. After 6 months of follow-up, the macular edema had disappeared completely, the drug delivery system was not observed in the posterior segment and best-corrected visual acuity improved from 20/125 to 20/40 (Snellen equivalent). Neither anterior nor posterior segment complications were reported during the follow-up period. Intravitreal scleral fixation of the OZURDEX(®) to the pars plana could be recommended as an alternative technique to avoid anterior migration of the device in a patient with an anterior chamber intraocular lens, which may lead to corneal decompensation and increased intraocular pressure."

The blood flow in the iris and ciliary body was detected by laser-Doppler flowmetry (bpm, 403a; TSI; wavelength, 780 nm; power, < 1.6 mW). The blood flow in the ophthalmic artery was measured by pulsed Doppler sonography (4 MHz, EME). The blood pressure, pulse respiration, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were recorded. Vascular resistance (RF) was calculated by the equation RF = (RRmean--IOP)/blood flow. Group 1 was treated with a single drop of Betamann (3 mg/ml) applied topically, and group 2 was treated with Isoglaucon (2.5 mg/ml). Measurements were made before and 30 min after application. Both drugs significantly lowered the IOP by about 7% (P = 0.01). Clonidine did not affect the blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery. In group 2 (metipranolol) we found a significant increase in the blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery during the diastolic period (from 11.0 +/- 3.7 to 11.9 +/- 2.2 cm/s, P = 0.05). Both clonidine and metipranolol decreased the iridal blood flow [clonidine, from 9.3 +/- 3.9 to 7.6 +/- 3.1 (flux), P = 0.05; metipranolol, from 7.5 +/- 2.9 to 6.5 +/- 2.6 (flux), P = 0.05].

Neovascular glaucoma without peripheral anterior synechiae developed between one and five weeks following CRAO onset. All patients received 0.75 mg (0.03 ml) IVB. In all patients, complete regression of the iris and anterior chamber angle neovascularization was confirmed within one week. PRP was applied two weeks after the injection. The follow-up period was four to seven months (average, five months). Intraocular pressure was controlled in all patients using topical antiglaucoma medications alone. However, one patient experienced a recurrence of neovascularization three months after the initial combination treatment.

The consecutive patients who underwent LASIK from January to June 2004 were reviewed retrospectively. Thirteen eyes from 8 patients with myopic regression and 60 eyes from 42 patients with no myopic regression within 12 months of follow-up were enrolled. We compared the pre- and postoperative data which were associated with regression in the two groups. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was significantly higher in the regression group than in the non-regression group (p = 0.03). During the period of 12 months, the two groups differed in corneal bowing. In the regression group, both posterior and anterior corneal surfaces were significantly bowing (all p < 0.05). In contrast, in the non-regression group, both posterior and anterior surfaces were relatively stable (all p > 0.05). The higher preoperative IOP and the progressive postoperative biomechanical bowing in the posterior and anterior surfaces of the cornea are two factors related to myopic regression in this study. Lowering the IOP preoperatively and postoperatively may be an effective way to prevent the myopic regression after LASIK."

After 12 weeks of treatment, latanoprost reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) from 22.2 +/- 2.0 mmHg to 14.8 +/- 1.9 mmHg (33% reduction); timolol maleate and dorzolamide hydrochloride also reduced IOP from 22.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg to 17.1 +/- 2.7 mmHg (24% reduction). Latanoprost monotherapy significantly lowered IOP compared with unfixed combination therapy of 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% dorzolamide hydrochloride. Furthermore, a systemic adverse effect of bradycardia was not observed in the latanoprost monotherapy group. Concerning compliance, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Thus, latanoprost monotherapy is more effective than unfixed combination therapy with 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% dorzolamide in the treatment of CACG following relief of pupillary block in Japanese patients."
CD012223,0,22718058,0,Current trends in the pharmacotherapy of diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most debilitating disorders of microvasculature of the retina and one of the leading causes of vision loss among the working class worldwide. At present, intravitreal anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids) and anti-angiogenesis (anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) agents are being used as wide options for the pharmacotherapy of DR and diabetic macular edema (DME). Anti-inflammatory agents (Triamcinolone acetonide and other agents) have shown evidence-based clinical benefits in various randomized clinical trials for the treatment of DR and DME, and also shown improvement in best corrected visual acuity. However, direct intravitreal injections are associated with serious side-effects like cataract and elevation of Intra Ocular Pressure. Despite this, corticosteroid therapy has been effective for DR and DME, therefore current focus is on the development of novel intravitreal steroid delivery devices that release a small quantity over a prolonged period of time. In addition to corticosteroids, anti-angiogenic agents are found to be effective for the treatment of DR and DME. The most popular target of these agents is the subfamily of proteins known as VEGF, whose over-expression is believed to play a role in numerous diseases including DR and Age-related Macular Degeneration. Intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin®) and Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) are gaining popularity as a clinical adjunct to panretinal photocoagulation in patients with proliferative DR. Moreover, Lucentis has been recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. Further, systemic agents (specially, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and anti-hypertensive agents) have shown beneficial results in reducing the progression of DR. In conclusion, it can be stated that for the present scenario systematic use of available pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to laser photocoagulation, which is gold standard therapy, can be a useful tool in the prevention of vision loss from DR and related disorders. This article summarizes the up-to-date developments in the pharmacotherapy of DR. Method- Literature search was done on online database, Pubmed, Google Scholar, clinitrials.gov and browsing through individual ophthalmology journals and leading pharmaceutical company websites."

Anticholinergic or adrenergic agents are the most common for inducing ""pupillary block"" angle-closure glaucoma. Patients with a narrow irido-corneal angle are at high risk. Sulfa drugs induce ""non-pupillary block"" angle-closure glaucoma as an idiosyncratic reaction to the drug in patients with an open or narrow irido-corneal angle.

The results were compared with the surgical outcomes of penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). Seventy-nine eyes with keratoconus treated with DALK and 81 eyes with LI-BK treated with DSAEK were studied, and the graft clarity rate, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, endothelial cell density (ECD), and surgical complications were compared with 273 eyes with keratoconus and 98 eyes with LI-BK all treated with PKP. Keratoconus eyes showed excellent visual outcomes with DALK and PKP, but graft survival was higher for PKP (100%, 98.9%, and 96.3% vs. 98.6%, 90.6%, and 86.1%, at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery, respectively; P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the ECD up to 1 year after surgery. Greater ECD decline was observed for PKP at 3 and 5 years after surgery. Descemet membrane microperforation was observed in 49 eyes treated with DALK. Postoperative complications in eyes treated with PKP were increased incidence of immunological rejection and secondary glaucoma compared with eyes treated with DALK. LI-BK graft survival rates were excellent in both groups (DSAEK: 89.6% and 86.1%; PKP: 100% and 98.6%, 1- and 2-year rates, respectively; P = 0.17). Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was better in the DSAEK group, and ECD showed a higher rate of decrease with DSAEK than with PKP.

CD012223,0,23985980,0,New insights into pathophysiological mechanisms regulating conventional aqueous humor outflow.,"The aim of the article was to overview the pathophysiology of the conventional outflow pathway, trabecular meshwork, and intraocular pressure and to discuss the options of future glaucoma treatment directed to improvement in aqueous outflow. The literature search in the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases from April to May 2012 was performed; a total of 47 articles analyzed. The diminished conventional pathway may be altered by several pathophysiological mechanisms like TM obstruction caused by transforming growth factor-β2, clastic nondeformable cells, macrophages leaking from hypermature cataract, iris pigment, lens capsular fragments after YAG-laser posterior capsulotomy, proteins and their subfragments. It is known that trabecular meshwork contraction reduces outflow, and the actomyosin system is directly linked to this mechanism. New glaucoma drugs are still under investigation, but it is already proven that agents such as latranculin-B are effective in improving aqueous drainage. Selective Rho-associated coiled coilforming protein kinase inhibitors have been shown to cause a significant improvement in outflow facility and may become a new option for glaucoma treatment. Caldesmon negatively regulates actin-myosin interactions and thus increases outflow. Stem cells may replace missing or nonfunctional trabecular meshwork cells and hopefully will bring a new treatment solution. Pathophysiological mechanisms regulating conventional aqueous humor outflow are still not fully understood and require further investigations. Future treatment decisions should be directed to a specific mechanism regulating an elevation in intraocular pressure."

Inflammation peak occurs 48 hours after ALT and clinically relevant inflammation is seen in 100% of pigmentary glaucomas (PIG), 75% of pseudoexfoliative glaucomas (PEXG) but only in 25% of primary open angle glaucomas (POAG). We also showed that topical diclofenac reduced inflammation in all 17 treated patients. Prostaglandins are thought to play a major role in ALT-inflammation and it is therefore logical to assume that NSAID are effective in that situation and will probably advantageously replace corticosteroids. In order to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of diclofenac drops (Voltaren Ophtha) we included a total of 37 PIG or PEXG (19 in the diclofenac and 18 in the placebo group) scheduled for ALT in prospective randomized placebo-controlled study.

In the first group of patients mean intraocular pressure was 16.1 (+/-3.85) mm Hg before surgery, and 13.2 (+/-3.14) mm Hg after surgery with a significant difference (p = 0.0027). In the second group of patients mean intraocular pressure was 16.0 (+/-4.13) mm Hg before surgery and 13.0 (+/-3.0) mm Hg after surgery with a significant difference (p = 0.0045). In the third group of patients mean intraocular pressure was 17.7 (+/-3.8) mm Hg before surgery and 12.4 (+/-2.6) mm Hg after surgery, with a significant difference (p = 0.0005). In conclusion, according to our results, non-contact tonometry needs a correcting factor for measuring the intraocular pressure in patients that underwent photorefractive keratectomy, related to the degree of refractive treatment."

CD012223,0,8718935,0,Purity and stability assessment of a semi-solid poly(ortho ester) used in drug delivery systems.,"The research work carried out for developing bioerodible drug delivery devices in which the erosion process was to be confined to the polymer-water interface is at the origin of the discovery of a class of polymers known as poly(ortho esters) (POEs). Thus far, three POE systems have been described. The latest POE was prepared by a transesterification reaction between a triol and an ortho ester, followed by a self-condensation of the reaction product. This polymer, which exhibits viscous characteristics at room temperature, was investigated for use as a drug delivery system in glaucoma filtering surgery. The assessment of POE purity and stability was carried out by a detailed analysis of the influence of the purification procedure and storage conditions. This bioerodible semi-solid POE was purified by a repeated precipitation procedure. Elimination of the small molecular weight oligomers and monomers and of the catalysts and stabilizers used in the synthesis, as well as a decrease of the polydispersity, were obtained with this method. Fourier transform infrared analysis also verified the disappearance of degradation products after the first precipitation. Drying of the precipitated polymer was performed at 40 degrees C in order to avoid thermal degradation of the POE at higher temperatures and to facilitate solvent evaporation through the polymer network by a reduction of polymer viscosity. Water vapour uptake of the polymers stored at different relative humidities has demonstrated the high moisture sensitivity of these semi-solid POEs. The average molecular weight of the polymer and hence its viscosity, as well as the solubility characteristics of the incorporated drug, were found to have a considerable influence on the rate of water vapour absorption and on polymer degradation. The use of inert gas or vacuum to maintain the polymer under anhydrous conditions has been studied. Storage of the semi-solid POE under argon in sealed glass bottles provides good protection of the polymer over time."

Sixteen eyes of 16 myopic patients were studied. LASIK was performed and intraocular pressure was raised to levels ≥65 mmHg. Color Doppler images were obtained to study the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month. There was no significant correlation between patient age and preoperative ocular blood flow parameters. A significant positive correlation between the degree of myopia and the peak systolic volume of the ophthalmic artery (r = 0.6, P = 0.01) was found. A highly significant decrease in the peak systolic volume and end-diastolic volume with an increase in the resistive index of both arteries (P < 0.005) was seen at 1 day and 1 week postoperatively. There was no significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative data 1 month after the procedure. The findings of this study show temporary alterations in ocular blood flow parameters after LASIK. LASIK is an increasingly common lifestyle procedure and further studies on larger groups are still recommended."

Therapeutic problems].,"Achieving an adequate intraocular pressure (IOP) is critical to the successful management of children affected with juvenile glaucoma, in whom medical therapy is often insufficient to control IOP. Anti-glaucoma eyedrops are usually not approved for use in children but, however, are frequently used in pediatrics. Although ocular hypotensive eyedrops may be well tolerated in young patients, their chronic use is often problematic because of systemic side effects or noncompliance. Glaucoma filtering surgery with adjunctive antifibrosis therapy (particularly with mitomycin C), aqueous shunt surgery and cyclodestructive procedures are currently undertaken in patients with juvenile glaucoma. Filtration surgery is usually less successful in patients with juvenile glaucoma: the higher failure rate stems from the excessive wound healing response in younger patients, resulting in subconjunctival fibrosis."
CD012223,0,19199898,0,Ranibizumab for diabetic retinopathy.,"Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is a Fab-Antibody with high affinity for VEGF, and is being designed to bind to all VEGF isoforms. This quality makes it a powerful drug for VEGF inhibition. Diseases of retinal and choroidal blood vessels are the most prevalent causes of moderate and severe vision loss in developed countries. Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of many of these diseases. Results of the pilot studies showed that intraocular injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis) decrease the mean retinal thickness and improve the BCVA in all the subjects. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy, currently treated with destructive laser photocoagulation, represents another potential target for anti-VEGF therapy. The early experience in animal models with proliferative retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma shows that posterior and anterior neovascularizations are very sensitive to anti-VEGF therapy. The outcome of two phase III clinical trials will increase our knowledge of the role of Lucentis in the treatment of DME."

Nd:YAG laser iridotomy was accompanied by less severe complications at the time of iridotomy--failure to produce full-thickness iridotomy, post-laser hypertensive response, bleeding, dissemination of pigment throughout the anterior chamber and posterior synechiae formation--than the dye laser. Nd:YAG laser iridotomy initially achieved relief of pupil block in all the eyes undergoing this procedure. However, the overall success rate of Nd:YAG iridotomies over the 3 months' follow-up period fell to 78 per cent due to inability of small iridotomies to relieve pupil block (4 eyes), and closure of iridotomies by iris pigment epithelial proliferation (3 eyes) and/or stromal healing (3 eyes). In patients with narrow angle glaucoma severe, and in cases prolonged elevations of intraocular pressure occurred following iridotomy with both lasers.

CD012223,0,1479791,0,[Severe occlusive bilateral retinal vasculitis within the scope of seronegative systemic lupus erythematosus].,"Retinal vascular manifestation is the most common form of ophthalmic involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Most frequently these consist of cotton-wool spots with or without intraretinal hemorrhages. Although rare, a more severe retinal vaso-occlusive disease, termed retinal vasculitis, has been described. We report on a 37-year-old white female with a 13-year follow-up of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, which suffered massive bilateral visual loss coincident with the systemic exacerbation of her disease (proteinuria, pneumonia, serositis, leucopenia). The diagnosis of SLE was established with reference to the revised ARA-criteria (American Rheumatism Association). Ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography revealed the typical aspect of a SLE-associated vaso-occlusive retinopathy on both eyes with marked ischemia of the macula. Immediate maximal immuno-suppressive therapy, early performed panretinal photocoagulation and subsequent cryoretinopexy did not stop the progression of the disease. Six months after the initial event vascularisations of the disc and rubeosis iridis occurred, but no secondary glaucoma up to date. In this patient, the almost complete absence of characteristic autoantibodies and immunological markers was striking. The correlation with other lupus manifestations, different therapeutic concepts and prognostic factors in SLE-associated retinal vasculitis are discussed."

CD012223,0,7070779,0,Miotics: side effects and ways to avoid them.,"Pilocarpine, a parasympathomimetic drug used in the treatment of glaucoma, produces a variety of ocular and systemic adverse reactions. Ocular side effects include miosis, accommodative spasm, frontal headaches, twitching lids, conjunctival injection, cataractous changes, allergic reactions, iris cysts, retinal detachment, increased permeability of the blood-aqueous barrier, anterior chamber narrowing, and the potential for inducing an acute angle-closure attack. Systemic side effects include nausea, vomiting, tenesmus, abdominal spasm, salivation, lacrimation, sweating, pulmonary edema, and bronchial spasm. The systemic side effects can best be minimized initially through proper use of the medication and nasolacrimal occlusion. The Ocusert, a long-acting pilocarpine-incorporated ocular insert, is a recent advance in delivery technique that offers an adequate hypotensive action with fewer side effects. Pilopex is a promising new experimental pilocarpine polymer salt presently being studied in Israel. Photomydriasis, a process involving the use of a laser to enlarge miotic pupils also offers help for these patients. N-demethylated carbachol is a new parasympathomimetic drug currently under study for glaucoma therapy.

CD012223,0,1711957,0,New developments in the drug treatment of glaucoma.,"This article reviews standard treatment modalities for patients with glaucoma and describes 3 classes of drugs which are undergoing development: apraclonidine (aplonidine, ALO 2145), an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist which has been released for clinical use; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, a modification of the systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors currently in use; and prostaglandins (PGs), a new class of drugs with topical ocular hypotensive activity. Standard treatment modalities include parasympathomimetic agents such as pilocarpine, carbachol, and phospholine iodide, which lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. A newer form of pilocarpine as a gel produces a longer action. Adrenergic agonist medications, such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and its prodrug dipivefrine (dipivalyl epinephrine), function by increasing uveoscleral outflow and trabecular outflow facility. A decrease in aqueous formation by the ciliary processes is thought to be the mechanism of action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, but the physiological basis for this action has not been clearly demonstrated. A newer beta-blocker, betaxolol, has relatively selective beta 1-blocking activity. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are nonbacteriostatic sulphonamide derivatives which decrease aqueous formation by the ciliary body. Almost 50% of patients taking these medications are unable to tolerate them because of their adverse effects, and there is thus much interest in the development of a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor with the potential for fewer adverse effects. MK 507 is the most recent and most potent compound in the series of topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Apraclonidine hydrochloride is a derivative of clonidine hydrochloride, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist. Clonidine has previously been shown to lower IOP significantly, but has the potential to produce marked lowering of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Its major ocular effect appears to be a decrease in aqueous production. The structural modification to apraclonidine decreases corneal absorption and the drug's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, minimising the risk of centrally mediated cardiovascular side effects. Apraclonidine may also influence secondary avenues of aqueous outflow, such as uveoscleral outflow, and may also affect conjunctival and episcleral vascular flow. It produces a mean decrease in IOP of 25% for as long as 12 hours. Adverse effects include blanching of the conjunctiva, minimal mydriasis and eyelid retraction. This drug has been approved in the US for use in prevention of elevated IOP after argon laser trabeculoplasty and iridotomy, and has potential uses in preventing an IOP rise after YAG laser posterior capsulotomy and cataract surgery in patients already on other antiglaucomatous medications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD012223,0,28898284,0,Optic nerve head and retinal blood flow regulation during isometric exercise as assessed with laser speckle flowgraphy.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate regulation of blood flow (BF) in the optic nerve head (ONH) and a peripapillary region (PPR) during an isometric exercise-induced increase in ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) using laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) in healthy subjects. For this purpose, a total of 27 subjects was included in this study. Mean blur rate in tissue (MT) was measured in the ONH and in a PPR as well as relative flow volume (RFV) in retinal arteries (ART) and veins (VEIN) using LSFG. All participants performed isometric exercise for 6 minutes during which MT and mean arterial pressure were measured every minute. From these data OPP and pressure/flow curves were calculated. Isometric exercise increased OPP, MTONH and MTPRR. The relative increase in OPP (78.5 ± 19.8%) was more pronounced than the increase in BF parameters (MTONH: 18.1 ± 7.7%, MTPRR: 21.1 ± 8.3%, RFVART: 16.5 ±12.0%, RFVVEIN: 17.7 ± 12.4%) indicating for an autoregulatory response of the vasculature. The pressure/flow curves show that MTONH, MTPRR, RFVART, RFVVEIN started to increase at OPP levels of 51.2 ± 2.0%, 58.1 ± 2.4%, 45.6 ± 1.9% and 45.6 ± 1.9% above baseline. These data indicate that ONHBF starts to increase at levels of approx. 50% increase in OPP: This is slightly lower than the values we previously reported from LDF data. Signals from the PPR may have input from both, the retina and the choroid, but the relative contribution is unknown. In addition, retinal BF appears to increase at slightly lower OPP values of approximately 45%. LSFG may be used to study ONH autoregulation in diseases such as glaucoma."
CD012223,0,9549260,0,"Glaucoma medications, glaucoma therapy, and the evolving paradigm.","Therapy for the glaucomas is dynamic, with changes evolving as new medications or modalities are discovered. In comparing the method(s) of treating open-angle glaucoma today, as compared to treatment in the 1980s, clear differences emerge. While topical beta-blockers remain the mainstay for treatment of open-angle glaucoma, other medications and modalities have recently become available that supplement their use. Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs), introduced in 1995, have become an important addition to the glaucoma armamentarium. They are more useful than their oral counterparts, since they cause fewer systemic side effects, with similar efficacy. Brimonidine, a topical alpha2-adrenergic agonist, and latanoprost, a topical prostaglandin, have become important additions to the glaucoma regimen because of their ability to reduce the intraocular pressure (i.o.p.) with an improved therapeutic index, as compared to older medications. Finally, argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) appears to be a safe technique and useful in reduction of IOP."
CD012223,0,20806741,0,Intraocular gas associated pressure-induced interface keratopathy 8 years after laser in situ keratomileusis.,"The authors report a clinically distinctive form of elevated intraocular pressure-induced interface keratopathy that occurred after a pars plana vitrectomy with intraocular gas tamponade for a macular hole in the right eye in a 35-year-old woman who had laser in situ keratomileusis in both eyes 8 years previously. The intraocular pressure was increased to 37 mm Hg after surgery. Diffuse lamellar keratitis-like interface infiltration was found with concurrent elevated intraocular pressure. The interface infiltration did not respond to steroids but resolved after the intraocular pressure was controlled. This case suggests that interface keratopathy is associated with increased intraocular pressure. Assessment of intraocular pressure is essential in patients presenting with interface keratopathy, especially in those who have undergone posterior segment operations with gas tamponade."
CD012223,0,9148259,0,Long-term elevation of intraocular pressure after neodymium: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.,"Uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction (EC) followed by posterior chamber lens implantation (PCL) has been shown to cause long-term lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in most patients. Since it has been suggested that Neodymium: YAG (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy can provoke persistent glaucoma, we examined the hypothesis that Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy may lead to a permanent elevation of IOP. In a case-control study, we compared two groups of 75 normotensive patients, who were unilaterally pseudophakic after phacoemulsification (PE) + PCL. Patients in group 1 had undergone Nd:YAG capsulotomy at least 2 months prior to this study, while in group 2 the posterior capsule was intact. Both groups were selected at random. Prior to surgery, none of the patients had suffered from glaucoma. Goldmann applanation tonometry was performed in both eyes of each patient and from that the ratio of IOP(pseudophakic)/IOP(phakic) was calculated. The distribution of this ratio for the two groups was compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. There were 52 female and 23 male patients in group 1 versus 56 female and 19 male patients in group 2. Their mean ages were 75 + or -11 (group 1) and 75 + or - 9 years (group 2). The mean interval after PE + PCL was 48 + or - 29 months for patients with Nd:YAG capsulotomy and 16 + or - 17 months for patients with intact posterior capsule. Since the Nd:YAG capsulotomy, 28 + or - 23 months had elapsed on average. The median ratio of IOP (pseudophakic)/IOP(phakic) was higher in the Nd:YAG capsulotomy group than in the group of patients with an intact posterior capsule (1.00 vs. 0.80; p < 0.0001). There was almost no percentile, for which the distribution curve of group 1 intersected the curve of group 2. The median IOP in pseudophakic eyes was 14 mm Hg in group 1 and 12 mm Hg in group 2 (p<0.0001). These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that Nd:YAG capsulotomy will raise IOP permanently in most patients. Therefore Nd:YAG capsulotomy may harbor the risk of glaucomatous optic nerve damage in the long run. Long-term follow-up seems advisable in order to prevent possible glaucoma damage."

A thorough history, review of systems, and laboratory evaluation revealed no pertinent medical history or risk factors for delayed-onset DLK after LASIK. Confocal microscopic examination of both corneas demonstrated a large number of activated keratocytes in the flap interface, particulate debris of variable size distributed throughout the interface, and scattered inflammatory cells. It was then decided to lift and wash both corneal flaps and interfaces. Scrapings for stains and cultures were also taken from both flap beds and were negative. After treatment with prednisolone acetate 1% and topical cyclosporin A 0.5%, the DLK resolved in both eyes with residual faint, diffuse, corneal haze.

One year follow-up.,"The effect of sodium hyaluronate (Healon) on the post-operative course 1 week, 1 month and 1 year after trabeculectomy is reported. Forty-six eyes of 38 patients with open-angle glaucoma (16 simple, 16 capsular and 14 secondary glaucomas) were operated with the use of sodium hyaluronate. The study was prospective. For comparison, 46 eyes of 38 age-, sex- and diagnosis-matched patients with glaucoma operated during the pre-Healon period were selected. Patients in the study group were operated by the same surgeon and in the control group by different senior staff members. IOP decrease was essentially the same in both groups. No differences in post-operative pressure level existed between the different types of glaucoma. Extremely shallow or flat chamber occurred more frequently in the control series: 15 versus 9. Statistical analysis could not be applied. The trend in favour of Healon is discussed. Pressure rise greater than or equal to 30 mmHg 2-7 days after the operation was diagnosed in 8 eyes of the Healon group and 13 eyes of the control group. IOP rise was relieved by argon laser treatment of the fistula during the first week post-operatively in 6/8 eyes of the Healon group in order to facilitate aqueous drainage. Sodium hyaluronate facilitated the technical performance and prevented collapse of anterior chamber and AC haemorrhages during the operation. Sodium hyaluronate seems to prevent excessive early filtration and hypotony.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Two hundred myopic eyes undergoing laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) were enrolled into a prospective, non-randomized study. Corneal parameters examined included full ocular examination, measurement of CCT, corneal topography, corneal curvature and ocular refractivity. Intraocular pressure measurements were obtained using three different instruments-non-contact tonometer, Goldmann applanation tonometer and TonoPen XL (TonoPen-Central and TonoPen-Peripheral). All measurements were performed pre-operatively and 4 months post-operatively. Post-operative intraocular pressure was significantly lower than pre-operative values, with all instruments (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test). The post-operative intraocular pressure decrease was smallest using the Tonopen-XL compared to the Goldmann applanation tonometer and non-contact tonometer (p value < 0.001, ANOVA). Intraocular pressure readings are significantly reduced following corneal ablation surgery. We determined in our myopic patient cohort that the TonoPen XL intraocular pressure measurement method is the least affected following PRK and LASIK as compared to other techniques."

CD012223,0,22675660,0,Antiangiogenic therapy for ischemic retinopathies.,"Neovascularization is a common pathological process in various retinal vascular disorders including diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). The development of neovascular vessels may lead to complications such as vitreous hemorrhage, fibrovascular tissue formation, and traction retinal detachments. Ultimately, irreversible vision loss may result. Various proangiogenic factors are involved in these complex processes. Different antiangiogenic drugs have been formulated in an attempt treat these vascular disorders. One factor that plays a major role in the development of retinal neovascularization is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Anti-VEGF agents are currently FDA approved for the treatment of AMD and RVO. They are also extensively used as an off-label treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME), proliferative DR, and neovascular glaucoma. However, at this time, the long-term safety of chronic VEGF inhibition has not been extensively evaluated. A large and rapidly expanding body of research on angiogenesis is being conducted at multiple centers across the globe to determine the exact contributions and interactions among a variety of angiogenic factors in an effort to determine the therapeutic potential of antiangiogenic agent in the treatment of a variety of retinal diseases."

Our aim was to investigate the effect of commonly used mydriatic agents on the provoked vascular response of retinal arterioles. One eye was randomly selected for mydriasis from 10 healthy volunteers (age 23.3 ± 4.9 years). A single drop of: 1% tropicamide (T), or a combination of 0.8% tropicamide and 5% phenylephrine (TP), or 1% cyclopentolate (C) were instilled into the volunteers lower fornix at each of three visits. Volunteers underwent a standardized isocapnic hyperoxic provocation. Four retinal hemodynamic measurements were acquired with the Canon Laser Blood Flowmeter at equivalent positions on the superior temporal arteriole (STA) and inferior temporal arteriole (ITA) at baseline, during provocation and after recovery. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed-effect models. Pre- and post-dilation measurements indicated that pupil diameter increased with use of T, TP, C (all <0.001), while systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and intraocular pressure did not change significantly (all >0.05). In response to a standardized isocapnic hyperoxic challenge, blood vessel diameter, blood velocity and flow decreased in both the STA and ITA relative to baseline. Comparison between the change elicited by isocapnic hyperoxic gas stimuli with respect to blood vessel diameter, blood velocity, blood flow, were equivalent for each mydriatic agent in the STA (p = 0.66, p = 0.99, p = 0.99, respectively) and the ITA (p = 0.85, p = 0.80, p = 0.66, respectively).

The IOP was unmeasurable with the Goldmann applanation tonometer; rebound tonometry showed an IOP of 30 mm Hg in the central cornea and 58 mm Hg in the superior cornea. Medical treatment of the elevated IOP resulted in resolution of the accumulated interface fluid. This case highlights the inaccuracy of IOP measurements in the central cornea with interface fluid or central corneal edema caused by elevated IOP after LASIK and shows the efficacy of IOP measurements at the peripheral cornea using rebound tonometry.

It offers a reasonable surgical option in the high-risk glaucoma population, which includes patients with neovascular glaucoma, glaucomas with active uveitis, glaucomas in aphakia or pseudophakia, and other cases in which filtering surgery has failed or is felt to have a low chance for success. Satisfactory intraocular pressure reduction was achieved in 62% of the patients with one treatment session. After one or more repeated procedures in 21% of the study group, the final intraocular pressure was below baseline in 94%, with a mean final reduction of 24 mm Hg, which was judged to be adequate for 87% of the patients.

Patients with neovascular glaucoma had the greatest percentage of visual loss at 46%, compared with 34% and 38% for patients with glaucomas in pseudophakia and aphakia, respectively. While it is hard to know how many of these cases of visual loss were a direct result of the cyclophotocoagulation, the procedure should be used with caution in eyes with a potential for good central vision.

CD012223,0,16607783,0,[Current trends in neovascular glaucoma treatment].,"Neovascular glaucoma is divided in three clinical stages: rubeosis iridis, secondary open-angle glaucoma, and synechia of the angle-closure glaucoma. 36% of neovascular glaucomas occurs after central retinal vein occlusion, 32% after diabetic proliferative retinopathy, and 13% occurs after carotid artery obstructive. The key of success in the treatment of neovascular glaucoma is the early and rightly diagnosis, the treatment is aimed mainly at relieving pain, as the prognosis for maintaining visual function is extremely poor. The most important surgical procedures are trabeculectomy, artificial drainage shunts and cyclo-distraction by trans-scleral diode laser.

CD012223,0,3446535,0,Argon laser trabeculoplasty in narrow angle glaucoma.,"A prospective trial of argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) in narrow angle glaucoma (NAG) was undertaken. In eyes with NAG the mechanism of the glaucoma could be a combination of pupil block with subsequent irido-trabecular adhesion and trabecular damage with an increase in outflow resistance. To achieve relief of pupil block, eyes were randomly assigned to treatment with short pulsed laser iridotomy (LI) with the YAG or Dye lasers, or surgical peripheral iridectomy (PI). Alternatively, argon laser iridoplasty (IP) was performed to widen the anterior chamber angle sufficiently to permit ALT. Fifty-two eyes were treated and follow-up was from 12 to 22 months. A high rate of failure to control IOP with topical medication and progression of visual field loss occurred in all treatment groups. Iridoplasty followed by ALT was particularly unsuccessful as, in 50 per cent of cases, progressive synechial closure of the anterior chamber angle occurred following treatment. In eyes treated with PI/LI and ALT, the IOP control was improved in 12 per cent, unchanged in 30 per cent and remained uncontrolled in 58 per cent. By 15 months follow-up, a satisfactory outcome (IOP less than 21 mmHg on topical medication, visual field and acuity stable) was obtained in 24 per cent of the 33 eyes treated with PI/LI and ALT. Thirty-one of these eyes showed visual field loss. Of the 10 eyes that did not receive ALT following PI or LI, 90 per cent had a satisfactory outcome. Eight of these eyes showed little or no visual field loss. The authors conclude that iridoplasty followed by ALT is an unsuitable treatment for eyes with NAG. We further conclude that ALT is unlikely to be of benefit in eyes with NAG and visual field loss, even after pupil block has been relieved. Relief of pupil block alone may help eyes with early NAG without visual field loss."

The mechanism of the angle closure is complex and includes pupillary block and non-pupillary block. Currently, opinion is that laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) alone is not sufficient to prevent disease progression. Laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPIP) is an alternative and effective way of widening the angle recess in eyes that are affected by primary angle closure (PAC). However, it is not known if greater benefit would be achieved using LPI plus LPIP for PAC with multiple mechanisms (MAC). Thus, the aim of this study is to demonstrate if LPI plus LPIP would be more effective than single LPI in controlling the progression of PAC with multiple mechanisms, based on ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) classification. A secondary aim is to determine whether or not this would result in the use of less medication and/or prolong the time to antiglaucoma surgery."

No selection was made as to the type of glaucoma (congenital, primary, secondary due to trauma or inflammation). We applied between 16 and 60 exposures 0.5-2 mm posterior to the limbus. Prior to cyclophotocoagulation the mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was 40.4 mm Hg (+/- 8.0). As a result of the treatment, the mean IOP was lowered to 21.1 mm Hg (+/- 5.2). In eyes with congenital, neovascular, and inflammatory glaucoma, a therapeutic effect could only be achieved by repeated coagulations. The patients were followed for a mean of 4.8 months (3-7 months). One eye developed a transient choroidal detachment. In two eyes, iris hemorrhages were noted. Contact cyclophotocoagulation is generally well tolerated. Randomized studies are to be carried out to confirm whether cyclophotocoagulation is an effective tool in the treatment of glaucoma. Until then, cyclophotocoagulation should be restricted to cases not responding to conventional therapy."

CD012223,0,26501989,0,Neovascular Glaucoma.,"Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a secondary ocular pathological condition resulting from a myriad of ocular and systemic conditions with retinal ischemia as a mediator in over 95% of cases. NVG is caused by the growth of a fibrovascular membrane secondary to a local angiogenic stimulus over the trabecular meshwork obstructing aqueous outflow. This results in an initial secondary open-angle glaucoma stage that may be amenable to intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications and modulation of the underlying ischemic process, often in combination with panretinal photocoagulation and adjunctive use of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. In the more advanced stages of neovascularization, connective tissue myofibroblasts associated with new vessel growth contract causing progressive synechial closure of the anterior-chamber angle. Elevation of IOP, once significant secondary angle closure is established, tends to be refractory to topical and oral IOP-lowering medications and often requires glaucoma surgical interventions."

Angle-opening distance at a point 500 m from the scleral spur (AOD500), trabecular-iris angle (theta1), trabecular ciliary process distance (TCPD), ciliary process-iris angle (CPI), iris thickness (ID1, ID3), length of iris-lens contact distance (ILCD) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were assessed before and after each procedure. Thirteen patients with LI and 16 with PT were prospectively enrolled. There were statistically significant increases in AOD500, theta1, and ILCD in both groups. CPI was decreased in both groups. ACD, TCPD, and iris thickness were not changed significantly. The changes in angle configuration after LI or PT may result more from alterations in aqueous pressure gradients across the iris and the changes of configuration were greater in the iris roots without rotation of ciliary body. However, we didn't find any significant differences in the changes of parameters between the two procedures."

Twenty-four eyes of 23 patients (mean preoperative spherical equivalent refraction -7.36 diopters (D); range, -4.12 D to -19.25 D), demonstrating myopic regression ranging between 1.00 D and 6.88 D (mean: 2.64 D), were treated according to the same therapeutic protocol. Changes in corneal haze, corneal topography, and refraction were evaluated over 6 months. Eighteen eyes (78.26%) showed 1.00 D or more reversal of myopic regression. Sixteen eyes (69.56%) regained the attempted correction present when corticosteroids were first stopped (+/- 1.00 D). The difference between mean refraction before reintroducing corticosteroids (-2.64 D; range, -1.00 D to -6.88 D) and when stabilization occurred (-0.60; range, +1.50 D to -4.50 D) was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The improvements in corneal haze and spectacle corrected visual acuity were also significant (both P < 0.01). Stabilization occurred between 1 to 4 months after surgery (mean, 2.22). In five eyes (21.74%) increased intraocular pressure of more than 20 mm Hg were reduced with beta-blockers. Topical corticosteroid therapy can modulate refractive changes after PRK, appearing to reduce myopic regression. However, a longer follow up will be necessary to determine the final refractive outcome of these eyes."

Each patient ingested 1 capsule/day of either aspirin (650 mg) or placebo for 14 days. Following a 1-month washout period, the treatment was reversed. The bidirectional laser Doppler technique and monochromatic photography were used to measure the blood flow rate in a major temporal retinal artery in 1 eye of each patient at baseline and on the 14th day of each treatment period. Retinal blood flow increased following aspirin in 7 of the 8 patients. Using a standard crossover analysis we found a mean aspirin-placebo treatment difference of 21 +/- 17% (mean +/- 95% CI), which was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Retinal blood flow increased following aspirin by 44 +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM) in the 5 patients with no retinopathy (p = 0.04), but only by 8 +/- 10% (n.s.) in the 3 patients with minimal retinopathy."

CD012223,0,18508420,0,Correlation between quadrant specific automatic visual field defect and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness as measured by scanning laser polarimetry in patients with primary open angle glaucoma.,"The purpose of this study was to correlate quadrant specific Humphrey visual field mean deviation (MD) with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness as measured by scanning laser polarimetry (GDx), and to determine whether there is a difference in the correlation with visual field defect between the Asian normative database provided by GDx (GDx database) and our native normative database (KMU database). In an age-matched study, a control group of 240 normal eyes underwent GDx. Another 60 eyes with visual field defect due to primary angle glaucoma underwent autoperimetry and GDx examination. First, we compared four GDx measurements between the control and study groups. Next, we divided the visual field into four quadrants (superior, inferior, temporal, nasal) and calculated the MD of each quadrant. We correlated the MD of superior, inferior and overall visual field with RNFL thickness judged by two databases (the GDx Asian internal normative database and the database from our control group). GDx detected abnormal RNFL thickness significantly more accurately when using the KMU database (p = 0.0473 for superior quadrant; p = 0.0074 for inferior quadrant; p = 0.0011 for average thickness) than when using the GDx database. There was no significant difference in the specificity between these two databases. The normal ranges in the GDx internal normative database for Asians are too wide. By using our own GDx normative database, the correlations with MD of autoperimetry were significantly improved. We suggest that every laboratory and clinic establish its own normative database of GDx in Asia."
CD012223,0,1987105,0,Effect of two weeks of timolol maleate treatment on the normal retinal circulation.,"The effect of 2 weeks of topical treatment with timolol maleate 0.5% ophthalmic solution on the retinal circulation was investigated using bidirectional laser Doppler velocimetry and monochromatic fundus photography. Fifteen normal healthy volunteers were included in this study. In a double-masked, randomized design one eye of each received one drop of timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily for 14 days, and the fellow eye received placebo. Vessel diameter (D), maximum erythrocyte velocity (Vmax), and volumetric blood flow rate (Q) were determined in one major retinal vein of each eye before treatment, and then, 2 hr after the instillation of drops on the morning of the 15th day of treatment. After treatment, the average change from baseline in D (+0.7%), Vmax (-8.2%) and Q (-7.7%) were not statistically significant in the placebo-treated eyes. In the timolol-treated eyes, the average increase from baseline in D (+0.1%) and Q (+10%) were not statistically significant. Average Vmax, on the other hand, increased significantly from baseline (P less than 0.05) by 9.6%. In comparison to the placebo-treated eyes, Vmax and Q were significantly increased in the timolol-treated eyes (P less than 0.0005 and P less than 0.01, respectively). These results are similar to those reported previously in a study of the effect of a one-time instillation of timolol and, therefore, suggest that the effect of timolol on the retinal circulation is maintained over a 2-week period."

CD012223,0,6727252,0,[The technic of argon laser trabeculoplasty and its results].,"Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) was performed on 130 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma or capsular glaucoma. Three different methods of ALT were employed to determine if the methods itself affects the incidence of immediate postoperative rises in intraocular pressure (IOP). Thirty-five eyes received 100 burns over 360 degrees of the posterior trabecular meshwork; these were categorized as Group 1. Group 2 comprised 77 eyes given 50 burns over 180 degrees of the posterior meshwork. Group 3 consisted of 18 eyes treated with 50 burns over 180 degrees of the anterior trabecular meshwork. The duration of each burn was 0.2 s in Group 1 and 0.1 s in Groups 2 and 3. The power of each burn ranged from 700 to 1000 mW in each group. Immediate postlaser IOP rise was defined as a pressure elevation exceeding prelaser value by 5 mmHg or more. In Group 1 the incidence of IOP rise was 82%; it was 58% after the first session in Group 2, but only 22% in Group 3. A sustained, marked pressure rise was most frequently observed in Group 1 as compared with the other two groups. Other complications, including sustained iritis, peripheral anterior synechiae and hyphema, were seen most frequently in Group 1 and least frequently in Group 3. Successful control of IOP, defined as an IOP of less than 20 mmHg, was achieved in 37% in Group 1, 70% in Group 2 and 56% in Group 3. The follow-up period ranged from 1.5 to 52 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD012223,0,28480761,0,Topical treatment of glaucoma: established and emerging pharmacology.,"Glaucoma is a collection of optic neuropathies consisting of retinal ganglion cell death and corresponding visual field loss. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide and is forecasted to precipitously increase in prevalence in the coming decades. Current treatment options aim to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) via topical or oral therapy, laser treatment to the trabecular meshwork or ciliary body, and incisional surgery. Despite increasing use of trabecular laser therapy, topical therapy remains first-line in the treatment of most forms of glaucoma. Areas covered: Novel glaucoma therapies are a long-standing focus of investigational study. More than two decades have passed since the last United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a topical glaucoma drug. Here, the authors review established topical glaucoma drops as well as those currently in FDA phase 2 and 3 clinical trial, nearing clinical use. Expert opinion: Current investigational glaucoma drugs lower IOP, mainly through enhanced trabecular meshwork outflow. Although few emerging therapies show evidence of retinal ganglion cell and optic nerve neuroprotection in animal models, emerging drugs are focused on lowering IOP, similar to established medicines."

The laser parameters of a Q-switched, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG-laser are set to selectively target pigmented trabecular meshwork cells without visible damage to the adjacent non-pigmented tissue. SLT acts non-thermally, the intracellular microdisruptions triggered by the laser are confined to the targeted cells, the laser pulses are so short that heat caused within the targeted cells does not have time to spread to the surrounding tissue. A controlled prospective randomised clinical study was conducted to compare the long-term results, safety and efficacy after SLT with two different laser systems and after ALT in the treatment of ocular hypertension and medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma."
CD012223,0,20423681,0,Advances in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy, the most common long-term complication of diabetes mellitus, remains one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Strict metabolic control, tight blood pressure control, laser photocoagulation, and vitrectomy remain the standard care for diabetic retinopathy. Focal/grid photocoagulation is a better treatment than intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in eyes with diabetic macular edema and should be considered as the first-line therapeutic option. The current evidence suggests that intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents result in a temporary improvement of visual acuity and a short-term reduction of central macular thickness in patients with refractory diabetic macular edema and are effective adjunctive treatment to laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy. However, triamcinolone is associated with risks of elevated intraocular pressure and cataract. Vitrectomy with removal of the posterior hyaloid without internal limiting membrane peeling seems to be effective in eyes with persistent diffuse diabetic macular edema, particularly in eyes with associated vitreomacular traction. Emerging therapies include islet cell transplantation, fenofibrate, ruboxistaurin, pharmacologic vitreolysis, rennin-angiotensin system blockers, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists."

CD012223,0,1427134,0,The relationship between intraocular pressure and visual field progression in glaucoma.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the intraocular pressure characteristics in glaucoma suspects and patients whose visual fields were classified as stable or progressing over a long-term follow-up. We present data from 64 patients who received either medical or laser treatment and who were followed up for a median of 7.4 years. The visual fields of 27 patients were classified as stable and 37 as progressing using predetermined criteria on either the Tübinger or Goldmann perimeter. Patients with initially normal and initially abnormal fields were analysed separately to avoid bias. There were no significant group differences in the mean, highest or interquartile range of intraocular pressure in the follow-up. The largely overlapping distributions over a wide spectrum of the pressure variables in patients with stable and progressing fields show that intraocular pressure alone cannot separate these two groups of patients. Our study does not suggest that pressure reduction in glaucoma has no beneficial effect, but that there may be other factors which determine the fate of the visual field in glaucoma."

These patients were divided into six groups. Each group of eyes had a slightly different technique of argon laser therapy. Except for one group, there was an adequate pressure lowering effect at the longest follow-up (-18 to -28%). Since the worst complication of argon laser trabeculoplasty is the immediate elevation in intraocular pressure with subsequent worsening of the field and/or disc, the immediate rise in intraocular pressure was measured and compared for each of the various techniques. In addition comparison was made when treating 180 degrees in one eye and 360 degrees in the other eye of 30 individuals having similar glaucomatous disease bilaterally.

Success was defined as IOP reduction ≥ 20% by Goldmann applanation tonometry. 24-hour IOP-related pattern recording with a contact lens sensor (CLS) (SENSIMED Triggerfish, Sensimed, Switzerland) was done before (baseline) and 1 month after SLT. A cosine function was fitted to the mean CLS patterns for each individual in the SLT success and non-success groups and the amplitude before and after SLT was calculated. Diurnal, nocturnal, and 24-hour CLS pattern local variability was determined for pre- and post-SLT sessions. Cosine amplitude and variability were compared before and after SLT by group using paired t-tests, with α = 0.05. Patients (11 women, 7 men) had a mean age of 65.1 ± 13.7 years. Mean IOP was 15.3 ± 2.2 mm Hg at baseline and was reduced by 17.0% to 12.7 ± 1.8 mm Hg 1 month after SLT (P = 0.001). SLT was successful in 8 patients (44%). The amplitude of the fitted cosine was reduced by 24.6% in the success group, but displayed an amplitude increase of 19.2% post-SLT in the non-success group. Higher diurnal local variability of the CLS pattern was observed after SLT in non-success subjects (P = 0.002), while nocturnal variability showed no significant change. The increase in diurnal variability in the non-success group led to an increase in 24-hour variability in this group (P = 0.001). No change in local variability (diurnal, nocturnal, and 24-hour) was seen in the success group. The IOP-related pattern cosinor amplitude was reduced in NTG patients with a successful SLT treatment whereas the non-success group exhibited an increase of cosine amplitude. Higher diurnal and 24-hour CLS pattern variability was observed in non-success patients 1 month post-SLT."

Irradiation parameters were as follows: wavelength 0.63 microns, light spot diameter 5 mm, energy 2 mWt, session duration 240 sec. A course consisted of 10 sessions. Seventeen eyes of the same patients were controls. Visual field was examined before the treatment and after it, immediately and in 3 to 3.5 months using Humphrey field analyzer and full field 120 points threshold related test. The treatment resulted in field deficit reduction by 10% and more in 21 (75%) of the 28 eyes. On an average, visual field deficit reduced by 22.4%. Three to 3.5 months after the treatment the mean value of visual field deficit was still lower than initially by 19.7%. No side effects were observed in any of the cases. In controls a trend to increase of field deficit developed within the same period, though the differences were statistically unreliable.

CD012223,0,23009061,0,Management algorithms for primary angle closure disease.,"In contrast to primary open angle glaucoma, preventive interventions in primary angle closure disease (PACD) can sometimes be definitive. Data from randomized, controlled trials - and where this is not available - principles grounded in known biology, biological plausibility, logic, preferred practice and personal experience have been synthesized to develop explicit clinical algorithms for management of the spectrum of PACD. The mainstay of first-line intervention is usually a laser iridotomy: a commonly necessary but sometimes insufficient manoeuvre in PACD. The crucial stepwise considerations after iridotomy are: whether the angle is open or closed; whether the IOP can be medically controlled; the extent of PAS, and the presence of visually significant cataract. Indication for subsequent interventions--which may include iridoplasty, cataract surgery, trabeculectomy or phacotrabeulectomy--are herein based on an arbitrary threshold (180 degrees) for angle opening and extent of PAS following initial treatment."

To assess differences in translaminar pressure gradient (TPG) and neuroretinal rim area (NRA) in patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), high tension glaucoma (HTG), and healthy controls. Methods. 27 patients with NTG, HTG, and healthy controls were included in the prospective pilot study (each group consisted of 9 patients). Intraocular pressure (IOP), intracranial pressure (ICP), and confocal laser scanning tomography were assessed. TPG was calculated as the difference of IOP minus ICP. ICP was measured using noninvasive two-depth transcranial Doppler device. The level of significance P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results. NTG patients had significantly lower IOP (13.7(1.6) mmHg), NRA (0.97(0.36) mm(2)), comparing with HTG and healthy subjects, P < 0.05. ICP was lower in NTG (7.4(2.7) mmHg), compared with HTG (8.9(1.9) mmHg) and healthy subjects (10.5(3.0) mmHg); however, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The difference between TPG for healthy (5.4(7.7) mmHg) and glaucomatous eyes (NTG 6.3(3.1) mmHg, HTG 15.7(7.7) mmHg) was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Higher TPG was correlated with decreased NRA (r = -0.83; P = 0.01) in the NTG group. Conclusion. Translaminar pressure gradient was higher in glaucoma patients. Reduction of NRA was related to higher TPG in NTG patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the involvement of TPG in glaucoma management."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis based on five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing 1428 subjects and 17 non-RCTs evaluating 8358 cases. In the RCTs, an increased risk of SE-IOP was found in the anti-VEGF group (summary risk ratio [RR] = 3.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63-5.53) compared with the sham injection or laser group. The increased risk of SE-IOP was correlated with follow-up duration (RR = 2.14, 95% CI 0.69-6.57 at 6 months; RR = 3.15, 95% CI 0.99-10.09 at 12 months; RR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.38-8.78 at 23 months).

CD012223,0,11811578,0,Short term surgical outcomes of modified deep sclerectomy with catgut implant.,"We compared the effectiveness of and complications resulting from modified deep sclerectomy with catgut implant (modified-DSCI) with those of standard deep sclerectomy with collagen implant (DSCI) in the short term following surgery. In this retrospective study, standard-DSCI was performed on thirteen patients (17 eyes), and modified-DSCI was performed on seven patients (11 eyes). After dissection of a 5x5 mm sized superficial scleral flap, a 3x4 mm sized rectangular deep scleral flap was constructed in DSCI and a 2x3 mm sized triangular deep scleral flap in modified DSCI. A collagen implant was placed on the scleral bed in DSCI and # 0 CHROMIC Catgut Absorbable Suture was used in modified DSCI. The mean follow up was 11.0+/-6.1 months in DSCI and 9.3+/-4.7 months in modified DSCI. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 38.6+/-10.9 mmHg in DSCI and 34.8+/-8.6 mmHg in modified DSCI. In the DSCI group, the IOP was 13.4+/-3.0 mmHg at final follow up, and was 11.4+/-3.2 mmHg in the modified DSCI group. The number of Nd:YAG goniopuncture was 3 cases (25%) in the modified DSCI group, and 3 cases (21.4%) in the DSCI group. The number of intraoperative microperforations was 3 in the DSCI group and 2 in the modified DSCI group. Temporary hypotony was encountered in 8 eyes (57.1%) of the DSCI group and 4 eyes (50%) of the modified DSCI group. There was no significant difference observed between the two groups in regards to the effectiveness or rate of complications seen during short term follow up."

CD012223,0,21394976,0,[Selective laser trabeculoplasty in glaucoma treatment--results during three years follow-up].,"The authors present results of their own modification of selective laser trabeculoplasty in primary open angle glaucoma and other groups of glaucoma using the laser machine Laserex Tango (wave length 532 nm, Q-switched, Nd-YAG laser, pulse duration 3 ns [nanoseconds], target diameter 400 Um, 80 burns, extension? of the circumference of the anterior chamber angle, power 1.0 mJ). The intraocular pressure was measured by means of the non-contact tonometer Nidek 2000, calibrated according to the current legislation. In the first group, the changes of the intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma in 106 eyes of 75 patients, aged 21 - 80 years, with seven controls during 36 months were followed-up. Remarkable decrease of the IOP from the baseline of 20.7 +/- 4.6 mm Hg to 17.5 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (one month - M1), 17.8 +/- 3.5 mm Hg (3 months - M3), 17.7 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (6 months - M6), 17.8 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (12 months - M12), 17.9 + 2.6 mm Hg (24 months - M24), and 18.2 + 3.1 mm Hg (36 months - M36) was recorded. The average IOP decrease by 3.2 mm Hg (decrease by 15.5%) between the baseline and the values after 1 months of treatment was proven to be statistically significant (p-value <0.0001) as well as the average difference of 2.9 mm Hg (decrease by 14.0%), 3.0 mm Hg (decrease by 14.5%), 2.9 mm Hg (decrease by 14.0%), 3.0 mm Hg (decrease by 14.5%), 2.9 mm Hg (decrease by 14.0%), 2.8 mm Hg (decrease by 13.5%), and 2.5 mm Hg (decrease by 12.1%) among the baseline IOP values and the IOP values measured successively after 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. In the second group, the IOP and treatment changes were followed-up in patients with the primary open angle glaucoma with 3 controls during 36 months in 420 eyes of 263 patients (age 21 - 84 years). In the end of three years follow-up period, in 234 eyes the simplified monotherapy remained, in 146 eyes the treatment was the same as before the laser surgery, in 40 cases it was necessary to perform re-SLT, and out of this number, in 19 cases the trabeculectomy was consequently performed due to unsatisfactory IOP compensation. It was recorded remarkable IOP values decrease from the baseline 20.8 +/- 4.1 mm Hg to 18.0 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (12 months - M12), 17.7 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (24 months - M24), and 17.7 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (36 months - M36).The average IOP lowering by 2.8 mm Hg (decrease by 13.5%) found between the baseline values and values 12 months after the SLT was found to be statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001), as well as the average difference of 3.1 mm Hg (decrease by 14.9%) and 3.1 mm Hg (decrease by 14.9%) among the baseline IOP values and values found consequently after 24 and 36 months. Pigmentary glaucoma (35 eyes)--significant, but short-term effect of the SLT to the IOP decrease was observed. In two cases, shortly after the laser treatment, it was necessary due to extreme IOP elevation to perform the trabeculectomy. In 12 eyes it was necessary due to the unsatisfactory IOP compensation to repeat during one-year period the SLT procedure. Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (37 eyes)--very good and rapidly appearing effect of the SLT to the IOP decrease was found. In 2 eyes, during the one-year follow-up period, it was performed the phacoemulsification of the lens with artificial intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. During further follow-up, the SLT was indicated and performed again in all eyes, and after that, in other 6 eyes of this group the phacoemulsification of the lens with IOL implantation was performed. The SLT as primary treatment (44 eyes)--all patients, even after 3 years follow-up period, are without the necessity of antiglaucomatous treatment. At the present time, the SLT was already performed in 122 eyes as the primary treatment. SLT as termination of the treatment (80 eyes)--in the remaining group of 40 patients, there are still 35 patients without treatment after three years, the data from the others are not available. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is effective and considerate method in the treatment of different groups of glaucoma diseases."
CD012223,0,3737126,0,Argon laser trabeculoplasty in black and white patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.,"The effect of argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) on lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) was studied retrospectively in 68 black patients and 42 white patients with uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma on maximally tolerated medical therapy. Patients with the diagnosis of pigmentary or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and those having previous intraocular or laser surgery were excluded. While the mean age of the black patients (66.9 years) was lower than the white patients (72.2 years), the prelaser IOP was similar between the two groups: 26.2 mmHg for the black patients and 25.5 mmHg for the white patients. The mean IOP one year (18.4 mmHg for black patients and 18.4 mmHg for white patients) and two years (19.5 mmHg and 20.3 mmHg, respectively) after ALT was the same between the two groups of patients. A similar percentage of black (85%) and white (83%) patients showed more than a 15% decrease in IOP from their prelaser values one year after treatment. The IOP lowering effect of ALT decreased during the second post-operative year; but the diminished response was identical in patients of both races, with 71% of patients of both groups still showing greater than 15% reduction from their pre-laser IOP. We conclude that ALT is equally effective in lowering IOP for black and white patients with medically uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma."

A controlled study comparing argon and neodymium: YAG.,"Laser peripheral iridectomies were performed on both eyes of 38 patients with acute or chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma or with narrow angles capable of closure. The right eye was treated with the neodymium YAG laser (Nd:YAG) and the left eye with the argon laser. Patients were followed for a minimum of eight months. The mean number of applications to produce iris penetration was six with the Nd:YAG laser and 73 with the argon laser. Visual acuity, postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), corneal changes, and pigment dispersion were similar in the two groups. Microhyphema was more prevalent in the Nd:YAG iridectomy group. Pupillary distortion, iritis, and late failure of patency were more frequent in the argon laser group. Nd:YAG laser iridectomies require fewer applications and produce less inflammation.

Study design and additional therapy.,"In a prospective study 82 patients recently diagnosed with simple or capsular glaucoma were randomized to receive primary argon laser trabeculoplasty or pilocarpine treatment. A 2-year follow-up showed a better success rate in the laser group, with less need for additional therapy. The average intraocular pressure and peak pressure was lower and the daytime pressure variation was significantly less in the laser group. The better increase in facility of outflow in the laser group was not statistically significant. In capsular glaucoma, laser treatment resulted in a significantly lower average pressure than with medication. In simple glaucoma the effect was about the same in the two treatment groups. Increase in facility of outflow was significantly better in simple glaucoma than in capsular glaucoma. High initial intraocular pressure gave a significantly lower success rate. Primary argon laser trabeculoplasty as a single glaucoma treatment seems advantageous in comparison to medication with pilocarpine for regulating intraocular pressure."

A 10-year prospective study.,"We conducted a prospective, planned study of argon laser panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) over a 10-year period in 123 eyes. On comparing the lasered eyes versus the nonlasered eyes, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of development of angle neovascularization (NV), neovascular glaucoma (NVG), retinal and/or optic disc NV, or vitreous hemorrhage, or in visual acuity. Our study, however, did show a statistically significant (P = 0.04) difference in the incidence of iris NV between the two groups, with iris NV less prevalent in the laser group than in the nonlaser group, but only when the PRP was performed within 90 days after the onset of CRVO. The other parameter which showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups was the peripheral visual fields-the laser group suffered a significantly (P less than or equal to 0.03) greater loss than the non-laser group. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of the natural history of ischemic CRVO and of ocular NV. Since the original rationale for advocating PRP in ischemic CRVO was the proven beneficial effect of PRP on ocular NV in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, we also discuss the disparities in the disease process between ischemic CRVO and proliferative diabetic retinopathy and in their responses to PRP."

To inhibit the wound-healing process and to achieve a better intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect as well as bleb formation, we performed a sclerostomy using a THC:YAG laser (thulium, holmium, and chromium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet crystal) and a subconjunctival injection of mitomy-cin-C given 24 h or 5 days before a filtering operation or soon after the filtering process in rabbits. A 1-mm conjunctiva wound was made 12 mm away from the sclerostomy site to allow for entry of an optic probe for delivering energy. Forty-eight rabbits were divided into four groups. Group I received a subconjunctival injection of 0.2 ml of 0.2 mg/ml of mitomycin-C 24 h before the operation. The same dosage of mitomycin-C was given to Group II 5 days before the operation and to Group III immediately following the operation. Group IV served as a control, and only 0.2 ml of normal saline solution was given 24 h preoperatively. One eye of each rabbit was randomly selected for the experiment, while the other eye served as a control. The bleb lasted 30.9 $pM 15.7 days in Group I, 16.0 $pM 6.4 days in Group II, 15.5 $pM 6.5 days in Group III, and 2.3 $pM 0.7 days in Group IV. The IOP lowering effect was parallel to bleb formation. The results demonstrate that a subconjunctival mitomycin-C injection given 24 h before a filtering operation is more effective in prolonging the filtering effect produced by the THC:YAG laser than one given postoperatively."

In a 28-day study in 186 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, maximum IOP lowering was 27.2% and 30.1% for brimonidine 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. The most common adverse events were dry mouth fatigue/drowsiness, and blurring, which occurred significantly more frequently with brimonidine 0.5% than 0.2%. Brimonidine 0.5% was tested in 471 patients undergoing argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT). One drop administered preoperatively, postoperatively or both pre- and postoperatively significantly reduced the number of postoperative IOP spikes (1-2% of patients compared to 23% receiving only vehicle). Systemic hypotension, dry mouth, lid retraction and conjunctival blanching occurred more frequently in patients who received the drug twice. Brimonidine 0.2% twice daily was compared with three times daily in 101 patients.

Recent studies show that apraclonidine, a new alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, can reduce the incidence of this problem. In a randomized, double-masked prospective study, we explored the efficacy of apraclonidine combined with pilocarpine during laser iridotomy in a Hispanic population. A significantly lower early postoperative IOP with less frequent severe pressure spikes occurred in the apraclonidine-treated patients. The addition of pilocarpine did not interfere with the beneficial effect of this medication. Of particular interest was the fact that chronic angle-closure glaucoma was the diagnosis in all patients who had a significant postoperative IOP rise in this study."
CD012223,0,16931274,0,In vivo confocal microscopic findings of interlamellar stromal keratopathy induced by elevated intraocular pressure.,We report the confocal microscopic findings in a case of interlamellar stromal keratopathy induced by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). In vivo confocal microscopy showed swollen and enlarged cellular structures and the presence of microlacunae separating the stromal collagen lamellae. Inflammatory mononuclear cells and granulocytes typically seen in patients with diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK) were absent. Stopping the topical steroids with concurrent lowering of the IOP resulted in improvement in the uncorrected and best corrected visual acuities and was associated with resolution of the corneal findings. In vivo confocal microscopy is a useful tool to study interlamellar stromal keratopathy induced by elevated IOP after LASIK in humans and the response to treatment and to differentiate interlamellar stromal keratopathy from DLK.

In analyses of two multinational trials in patients with DMO previously treated with macular laser photocoagulation, fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.2 μg/day was significantly more efficacious than sham injection in improving visual acuity. At 24 months post injection, 29 % of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.2 μg/day recipients had an improvement in the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of ≥15 compared with 16 % in the sham injection group (p = 0.002) [primary endpoint]. Treatment benefit was most evident in the subgroup of patients whose duration of DMO was ≥3 years. In this subgroup at 36 months, 34 % of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.2 μg/day recipients had an increase in the BCVA score of ≥15, compared with 13 % of sham injection recipients (p < 0.001).

CD012223,0,19422885,0,Combined effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and LINGO-1 fusion protein on long-term survival of retinal ganglion cells in chronic glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a progressive neuropathy characterized by loss of vision as a result of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. There are no effective neuroprotectants to treat this disorder. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is well known to transiently delay RGC death in ocular hypertensive eyes. The CNS-specific leucine-rich repeat protein LINGO-1 contributes to the negative regulation to some trophic pathways. We thereby examined whether BDNF combined with LINGO-1 antagonists can promote long-term RGC survival after ocular hypertension. In this study, intraocular pressure was elevated in adult rats using an argon laser to photocoagulate the episcleral and limbal veins. BDNF alone shows slight neuroprotection to RGCs after a long-term progress of 4 weeks following the induction of ocular hypertension. However, combination of BDNF and LINGO-1-Fc prevents RGC death in the same condition. We further identified that (1) LINGO-1 was co-expressed with BDNF receptor, TrkB in the RGCs, and (2) BDNF combined with LINGO-1-Fc activated more TrkB in the injured retina compared to BDNF alone. These results indicate that the combination of BDNF with LINGO-1 antagonist can provide long-term protection for RGCs in a chronic ocular hypertension model. TrkB may be the predominant mediator of this neuroprotection."

In this retrospective study, patients were divided into one of two subgroups according to IOP fluctuation values using GAT: 43 eyes in the low IOP fluctuation group (LIFG [GAT fluctuation ≤1.7 mmHg]); and 55 eyes in the high IOP fluctuation group (HIFG [GAT fluctuation >1.7 mmHg]). IOP fluctuation was defined as the standard deviation of all IOP values during follow-up. IOP parameters using GAT were compared with those of DCT. Correlation analyses were performed among IOP parameters, and between IOP fluctuation and associated factors including central corneal thickness, corneal curvature, and axial length. All IOP parameters demonstrated significantly high values in the HIFG compared with those in the LIFG. Mean and peak IOP using DCT were significantly higher than those using GAT in both groups. However, there were no significant differences in IOP fluctuation and reduction using both tonometry methods in the HIFG (p = 0.946 and p = 0.986, respectively). Bland-Altman analysis revealed similar fluctuations using GAT and DCT. In multivariate analyses, there was a significant correlation between fluctuations using GAT and DCT in the HIFG (p = 0.043). These results suggest that IOP monitoring using GAT is a reliable method of monitoring IOP change in glaucoma patients with a history of laser refractive surgery, especially those exhibiting high IOP fluctuation. Nevertheless, several factors, including central corneal thickness, corneal curvature, and axial length, should be considered when using GAT for IOP monitoring."

Two hundred thirty-three eyes of 176 patients with a mean preoperative spherical equivalent refraction of -8.70 +/- 2.3 D (range, -5.75 D to -18.13 D) underwent PRK with a 193nm ArF excimer laser (ExciMed, Summit) for myopic corrections of between -6.20 D and -11.90 D. The first 66 of 233 eyes that reached at least 1 year of postoperative follow up are reported. One year postoperatively, the mean manifest spherical equivalent refraction was -1.50 D +/- 1.90 D (range -6.25 D to +3.25 D); 34% of eyes were within +/- 1.00 D of attempted correction; uncorrected visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 75% of eyes. No eyes lost two or more Snellen lines of spectacle corrected visual acuity. Central corneal haze was mild in 20% of eyes and moderate in 3% of eyes. Five eyes developed ocular hypertension that subsequently resolved with treatment. Excimer laser PRK is reasonably effective and safe in the treatment of -6.00 D to -12.00 D of myopia. However, it is less accurate than PRK in eyes with low to moderate myopia and is more likely to result in significant corneal haze."

The efficacy of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% in preventing IOP elevation after an argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) was evaluated. Eighty patients were selected for a randomized, prospective study. Each patient was assigned to one of four treatment regimens: (1) brimonidine before and after ALT(B/B), (2) brimonidine before and placebo after ALT(B/P), (3) placebo before and brimonidine after ALT(P/B), (4) placebo before and after ALT(P/P). IOP elevation of 5 mmHg or greater occurred in 3.3% (2/60) of brimonidine-treated patients and in 30% (6/20) of placebo-treated patients.

Ten subjects were used, eight men and two women, with an age range of 19-37 (mean = 23.2). All subjects wore an optimum refractive correction giving visual acuities of 20/20 or better. Darkroom measurements of tonic accommodation (TA), tonic vergence (TV), and pupil diameter were determined with a Badal laser optometer , a nonius alignment device and infra-red photography, respectively. Far and near points of accommodation and oculo-motor balance tests were determined by standard optometric techniques and intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by applanation tonometry. Both TA (mean = 1.66 D) and TV (mean = 2.10 deg) assumed intermediate resting positions in the absence of visual stimulation. A double-blind protocol between Timolol and Saline demonstrated a mean myopic shift in TA of +0.85 D over 40 min with Timolol. All other experimental parameters, apart from IOP, were unaffected by Timolol. It is concluded that sympathetic innervation to the ciliary muscle plays a significant role in determining the TA position and that this innervation is mediated by inhibitory beta adrenoceptors."

The incidence of shallow or flat anterior chamber was significantly less in eyes that had received seven to nine sutures than in those that had received from two to six. Also, the incidence of cornea-lens touch was significantly less in the eyes with seven to nine sutures (P = .02, Fisher Exact Test). This study suggests that extra scleral flap sutures (in combination with laser suture lysis) is a safe and effective method of significantly reducing the risk of overfiltration after trabeculectomy."

CD012223,0,10163328,0,Value of ultrasound biomicroscopy for ciliodestructive procedures.,"Ciliodestructive procedures are commonly performed by the transscleral approach because ciliary processes are seldom visible. Thus the ablative energy is directed toward an ""invisible"" target whose position can only be estimated on the basis of experimental data. Ultrasound biomicroscopy has been recently introduced in ophthalmologic practice. This high-frequency ultrasound B-scan method gives real-time images of the subsurface structures of the anterior portion of the living eye at microscopic resolution. Ultrasound biomicroscopy perfectly visualizes the ciliary body and its surrounding structures and is a promising complementary tool for ciliodestructive procedures. The system has been used to image early and late ciliary body alterations after transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, to establish the position of the ciliary body to ensure correct laser probe placement, to locate ciliary body residuals for retreatment, and to rule out scleral damage after the procedure. An apparatus has been designed for simultaneous contact cyclophotocoagulation and ultrasound biomicroscopy analysis. A prospective randomized clinical trial is now needed to clarify the influence of ultrasound biomicroscopy on the success rate of ciliodestructive procedures."

CD012223,0,18284311,0,Disease progression and the need for neuroprotection in glaucoma management.,"Glaucoma, the second leading cause of worldwide blindness, is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by a loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons beyond typical age-related baseline loss. Diagnosis is defined by optic disc and visual field changes, and the primary goal of glaucoma treatment is to preserve vision. Proven existing therapies (ie, pharmacotherapy, laser, and surgical) focus on reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), although elevated IOP is no longer a diagnostic feature of glaucoma. New neuroprotectant drugs are being investigated, with the goal of reducing retinal ganglion cell loss, either prophylactically or after the insult has occurred. Various treatment strategies are being evaluated, and include a neuroprotectant only, or a complete therapy approach comprised of both a neuroprotectant supplemented by an IOP-lowering therapy. Dually targeted complete therapy may directly preserve the optic nerve, decrease the risk factors that cause glaucoma damage, and reduce glaucoma-related morbidities. Neuroprotectant therapy outcomes should include functional and structural effects of disease progression and neuroprotectant therapies, as well as patient functioning and economic impact."
CD012223,0,23304448,0,The outcome of 270-degree selective laser trabeculoplasty.,"Purpose. To evaluate the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) by a single-session 270° selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PXFG) and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Methods. A successful outcome was defined as an IOP reduction ≥20% from baseline with no further need for laser or incisional surgery. The preoperative pharmaceuticals were maintained unchanged throughout the course of the study. 70-80 nonoverlapping pulses were distributed around 270° in the trabecular band. Results. Sixty-six eyes of 42 patients with PXFG (30 eyes) or POAG (36 eyes) met the inclusion criteria. The mean ± standard deviation preoperative IOP was 23.7 ± 4.5 mmHg and at the end of the followup was 19.0 ± 4.5 mmHg with a pressure drop of 4.7 ± 3.1 mmHg (20%) (P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval 3.94-5.46). The cumulative probability of success was 39% (26 of 66 eyes) after 6 months of followup. Statistically significant differences in success rates were observed between the PXFG and POAG groups (27% versus 50%; P = 0.025). Postoperative inflammatory reaction was scanty. Conclusions. 270-degree SLT is useful in lowering IOP in PXFG and POAG, but the average reduction of IOP seems to be within the same range as reported with 180-degree SLT previously."

There were 93 eyes of men and 64 eyes of women, in the age range from 20 to 84 years. Three methods were used: Group 1, 36 eyes treated with about 100 laser shots to the trabecular pigment band over 360 degrees; Group 2, 84 eyes with about 50 shots to the pigment band over 180 degrees; and Group 3, 37 eyes with similar treatment to the anterior part of the trabecular band. The frequency of the initial IOP rise and the maximum postoperative IOP level were in the order of Groups 1, 2 and 3. Other complications, iritis, hemorrhage and peripheral anterior synechiae, were most frequent in Group 1. The success rate of the postoperative IOP control below 20 mmHg with continued medication was analyzed by the life-table method: It was 39 +/- 8% over the period averaging 39 months in Group 1, 66.5 +/- 6% over 17.3 months in Group 2, and 33.7 +/- 15% over 8.1 months in Group 3. The ALT over 180 degrees aimed at the pigment band gave better IOP control with less complications than 360 degrees ALT. The success rate in the eyes of Group 2 was 57 +/- 6% and 94 +/- 6% in POAG and capsular glaucoma, respectively. The IOP distribution after the ALT had a peak at 16-17 mmHg; the IOP was lower than 15 mmHg in about 21% of the eyes. Concurrent IOP measurement and tomography revealed that the IOP reduction after ALT was due largely to a reduction of the outflow resistance in the aqueous outflow channel."

Long-term effects on visual fields.,"In a prospective randomized study on primary argon laser trabeculoplasty vs pilocarpine in 82 newly detected open-angle glaucoma patients, visual field changes were analysed for absolute changes over 2 years on automated threshold perimetry and manual Goldmann perimetry. Regression analysis was also performed using the threshold perimetry examinations taken every second month. Analyses based on automatic perimetry were corrected for eventual bias due to cataract and induced miosis. There was significantly less decay of visual field in the group treated with laser. This was even more pronounced for eyes with capsular glaucoma, especially in the early stage. For the smaller group with simple glaucoma no significant advantage of laser could be shown. Successful intraocular pressure reduction significantly improved the visual field outcome. Laser trabeculoplasty is therefore recommended as primary therapy in capsular glaucoma."

In each patient, the techniques and suture material used in the two eyes were identical, and the surgeon was the same. The only variable was the type of conjunctival flap used: one eye received a limbal-based flap and the other a fornix-based flap. These patients were followed up from three to 13 months (median, 8.5 months). There was no difference between the two groups in postoperative anterior chamber depth, intraocular pressure control, occurrence of hyphema, size and shape of the bleb, or the rate of complications.

An additional 44 cases (77 eyes) of primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and 30 normal subjects (34 eyes) were also randomly enrolled as control groups for comparison in the clinical study. Ultrasonic biometric measurements of the anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and axial length of the eyeball were performed. Using an potic microgauge attached to the slit-lamp, the entrance of anterior chamber angle was also calculated. The clinical manifestations and the natural course, including the characteristic appearance of anterior chamber angle, the form of peripheral anterior synechia as well as the facility of outflow, were carefully investigated. There were significant differences in the biometric parameters of the anterior segment of eye among above three groups. The facts reveal that the anatomic features of eyeball, especially in the anterior segment differentiate from those of primary acute angle-closure glaucoma. Follow-up study for the early stage cases showed that topical administration of miotics and/or peripheral iridectomy can effectively prevent iris from forming peripheral anterior synechia and thus halt its development. The criteria of diagnosis and the principles of prevention and treatment at the early stage cases were presented. The pathogenesis was discussed. We emphasized that the progressive stage after intermittent attacks of primary acute angle-closure glaucoma should not be confused with primary chronic angle-closure glaucoma."
CD012223,0,7950110,0,[Sutureless wound adaptation. Comparison between corneal and corneoscleral incision].,"Fifty-four eyes with concomitant diseases, either a coagulation disorder or previous glaucoma surgery, were implanted with a folded, disc-shaped silicone intraocular lens (IOL) via a 3.5 mm three-step clear corneal tunnel; we developed this technique in 1991. IOLs of the same lens type were implanted through a 3.5 mm corneoscleral tunnel by the same surgeon in a control group consisting of 52 eyes. The final visual outcome was reached after 4 weeks in 44.7% of the patients (compared to 63.5% in the control group). The postoperative astigmatism stabilized after 3 months in 31.4% of the patients belonging to the clear corneal tunneling group and after 1 month in 32.1% of the patients belonging to the corneoscleral tunneling group. Compared to the control group, the continuously decreasing induced astigmatism was significantly greater in the clear corneal tunneling group at all times, except for 1 week postoperatively. After 1 year, the mean astigmatism was 0.91 +/- 0.50 D, compared to 0.57 +/- 0.36 D in the control group. After 18 months, the average induced astigmatism in the clear corneal tunneling group increased to 1.30 +/- 0.54 D, compared to the stable value in the control group amounting to 0.59 +/- 0.52 D. As an alternative to routine corneoscleral small incision surgery, the clear corneal technique is especially suited for patients with a coagulation disorder, with unfavorable anatomic conditions, or with glaucoma; a scleral incision should be avoided in these cases."

Although it has been speculated that spontaneous vessel pulsation is related to primary open-angle glaucoma, no evaluation has been done on the depth position of such a pulsation inside the cup and its relationship to the intraocular pressure. Using laser scanning tomography, we measured the depth position of the maximal spontaneous vessel pulsation inside the optic cup in 24 discs of 24 patients, including 15 ocular hypertensives and 9 controls. The two groups did not differ significantly in age or refraction. The depth position of the maximal venous collapse, however, showed a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.005), the mean value being 301 +/- 95 microns beyond the first retinal vessel reflection in the control-group eyes and 507 +/- 193 microns in the ocular hypertensive discs. The location of the depth position of the maximal venous collapse within the excavation could be a parameter that indicates the individual pressure tolerance of the ocular tissues."

Laser photocoagulation remains the definitive treatment for ischaemic vein occlusion with secondary neovascularization. Timely treatment with anti- vascular endothelial growth factor prevents development of rubeotic glaucoma. We hereby report an unusual case of bilateral retinal vein occlusion complicated by rubeosis irides, which was successfully managed to improve vision and prevent rubeotic glaucoma."

We evaluated the success of the laser treatment and followed the course of the intraocular pressure (IOP) during 5 1/2 years after treatment. Three diagnosis-groups were formed. Group I consisted of primary open angle glaucoma (n = 208), secondary glaucoma (n = 8) and pigmentary glaucoma (n = 3). Group II (n = 29) consisted of low tension glaucoma. Group III (n = 26) had the diagnosis narrow angle glaucoma. Success was defined as follows: a reduction in IOP, no progressive visual field loss, no visual acuity loss due to glaucoma, no filtering surgery and no repeat LTP. Follow-up was continued until the moment of failure. In the case of success the minimum follow-up was 6 months. The mean decrease in IOP after LTP stabilized in all three groups. During a follow-up of 5 1/2 years the IOP lowering effect did not diminish in successful eyes. To compute the rate of success we used the Kaplan-Meier method. The low tension glaucoma group had a success rate of 82% after 4 years. The probability of success in group I was 53% after 5 1/2 years and in group III 51% after 4 1/2 years. These success rates did not differ significantly. Resuming, this study shows that LTP has postponed the need for surgical intervention at least up to 5 1/2 years."

CD012223,0,24327300,0,[Post-surgical treatment after non-penetrating glaucoma surgery: the goniopuncture].,"Non-penetrating glaucoma surgery was primarily developed as an alternative to the widely applied trabeculectomy. Since the anterior chamber in non-penetrating surgery is not directly opened, common postoperative complications such as hypotony are rare. The most frequently applied technique in this group is the deep sclerectomy. After having prepared a superficial scleral flap a deeper scleral flap is performed and excised unroofing Schlemm's canal. The trabecular meshwork is then peeled leaving a residual trabeculodescemet membrane. As a consequence aqueous humour diffuses via the trabeculodescemet membrane under the scleral flap and subsequently under the conjunctiva. One of the reasons for a postoperatively high IOP is seen in the resistance of the residual trabculodescemet membrane. A solution to this problem lies in its puncture, the so-called goniopuncture. Goniopunctures are done in approximately 50 % of cases after deep sclerectomy and are also applied in cases of canaloplasty and viscocanaloplasty. Usually a 1064 nm Nd : YAG laser is used. A potential risk of iris incarceration is described. Two studies have shown that an equally IOP lowering effect can be achieved by treating the trabeculodescemet membrane with a frequency-doubled 532 nm Nd : YAG laser (SLT). No complications were detected in those cases. In conclusion, goniopuncture should be considered as the first line treatment for postoperative IOP increase in cases of non-penetrating glaucoma surgery. It should therefore be preferred to a (re)start of topical treatment."

In all, 12 uremic diabetic patients who submitted to kidney transplantation alone served as the control group; 4 of these subjects received a kidney transplantation alone, whereas 8 underwent a double kidney-pancreas transplantation but lost the pancreas graft within the first few weeks post-surgery. The mean age and the mean duration of both diabetes and dialysis were comparable in the two groups. All patients were studied prior to and at 6 and 9 months after surgery, then at annual intervals. Subjects were divided into three groups according to follow-up: less than 1 year, between 1 and 3 years and greater than 3 years. At each control visit, a complete clinical examination was performed by two independent examinators; retinal fluorescein angiography was carried out as well. The following parameters were evaluated: visual acuity, capillary closure, macular oedema, neovascularization at the disk and elsewhere and vitreous haemorrhage. A score ranging from -2 to +2 was assigned to each parameter for quantification of the variation between baseline values and those obtained at the end of the follow-up. This score was assigned by two different ophthalmologists. Eyes that were affected at baseline by end-stage diabetic retinopathy (secondary retinal detachment, neovascular glaucoma) were not entered in the study. A total of 18 eyes were lost to follow-up in the 2 groups because of laser treatment, cataract extraction, anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and cytomegalovirus retinitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD012223,0,22336823,0,Laser peripheral iridoplasty for angle-closure.,"Angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Treatment is aimed at opening the anterior chamber angle and lowering the IOP with medical and/or surgical treatment (e.g. trabeculectomy, lens extraction). Laser iridotomy works by eliminating pupillary block and widens the anterior chamber angle in the majority of patients. When laser iridotomy fails to open the anterior chamber angle, laser iridoplasty may be recommended as one of the options in current standard treatment for angle-closure. Laser peripheral iridoplasty works by shrinking and pulling the peripheral iris tissue away from the trabecular meshwork. Laser peripheral iridoplasty can be used for crisis of acute angle-closure and also in non-acute situations.  "

Methods. An 18-month randomized double-masked cohort study including 30 open-angle glaucoma patients receiving fixed-combination treatment with Dorzolamide/Timolol (DTFC) or Latanoprost/Timolol (LTFC) (n = 15 per group) was performed. Intraocular pressure (IOP), arterial blood pressure (BP), ocular and diastolic perfusion pressures (OPP, DPP), color Doppler imaging, pulsatile ocular blood flow analysis, scanning laser polarimetry, and Humphrey visual field evaluations were included. Results. Both treatments showed statistically similar IOP reduction. Six patients in DTFC and 7 in LTFC group met glaucoma progression criteria. DTFC group had higher OPP, DPP, and lower vascular resistivity indices as compared to the LTFC. Progressing patients had higher nerve fiber index, lower systolic BP, OPP, DPP, higher ophthalmic and central retinal artery vascular resistance, and lower pulse volume (P < .05; t-test).

The study spanned more than five years. The transpupillary argon laser photocoagulation of the ciliary process procedure, done on an outpatient basis, shows promise as a convenient, low-risk, and useful alternative procedure in selected aphakic glaucoma cases that are poorly controlled by medical or surgical measures. This new approach may also be used as an adjunct in the medical and/or surgical management of aphakic ciliary block glaucoma. The magnitude of intraocular pressure reduction is directly related to the number of ciliary processes coagulated and the level of laser energy applied. The indications for this new procedure are generally similar to that of the cyclocryotherapy."

CD012223,0,10776828,0,Pharmacological therapy for glaucoma: a review.,"For some time the medical treatment of glaucoma has consisted of topical beta-blockers, adrenergic agents, miotics and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs). However, the therapeutic arsenal available for the medical treatment of glaucoma has recently extended with new classes of ocular hypotensive agents i.e. prostaglandins, local CAIs and alpha2-adrenergic agents. Beta-blockers are still the mainstay in glaucoma treatment and are first line drugs. However, even if they are applied once daily, as with timolol in gel forming solution and levobunolol, the possible cardiopulmonary adverse effects of beta-blockers remain a cause for concern. When monotherapy with beta-blockers is ineffective in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) or is hampered by adverse effects, a change of monotherapy to prostaglandins, local CAIs, alpha2-adrenergic agonists (brimonidine) or to dipivalyl epinephrine is advised. Prostaglandins, local CAIs and alpha2-adrenergic agonists, such as brimonidine, may in time become first line drugs because they reduce IOP effectively and until now systemic adverse effects have rarely been reported with these agents. The development of a pro-drug of either a local CAI or an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with a sustained and continuous effect on IOP level, which could be applied once a day is suggested. Because of these new developments, miotics, i.e. pilocarpine and carbachol, are recommended as second or third line drugs. The cholinesterase inhibitors are considered third line drugs as better agents with fewer local and systemic adverse effects have become available. Oral CAIs may be used temporarily in patients with elevated IOPs e.g. postsurgery or post-laser, or continuously in patients with glaucoma resistant to other treatment. Combining ocular hypotensive drugs is indicated when the target pressure for an individual patient cannot be reached with monotherapy. Combination therapy of beta-blockers is additive with prostaglandins, topical CAIs and miotics. Prostaglandins such as latanoprost can be combined with beta-blockers, adrenergic agents, local CAIs and miotics. Combinations with brimonidine or local CAIs need further investigation. Treatment of glaucoma with the new ocular hypotensive agents, either in monotherapy or combination therapy, may provide lower IOPs and delay or postpone the need for surgery."
CD012223,0,7627753,0,Effect of excimer laser keratectomy on the mechanical performance of the human cornea.,"Enucleated human eye globes were set-up for measurements of pressure (2-100 mmHg) induced tangential epithelial and endothelial side corneal strain, and for measurements of central corneal thickness and central radius of curvature. In one experimental group (N = 6), a shallow ablation (15-20 microns deep) removing Bowman's layer was performed in the central 7 mm diameter zone of the cornea. The fellow eye served as control (N = 6). In another experimental group (N = 6) a 70% deep keratectomy was performed in the central 7 mm diameter zone. The pressure induced central corneal strain was 5-10% higher in corneas without Bowman's layer compared with intact corneas. The epithelial side tangential corneal strain in eyes with a 70% deep keratectomy increased to twice as much as that of intact corneas, but the endothelial side strain was similar. In all groups of eyes Young's modulus of elasticity increased rapidly with the corneal stress level up to testing loads of 25 mmHg. At higher loads the degree of stress-stiffening was smaller. The differences in average corneal strain between the 3 groups could be explained by the induced changes in central corneal thickness, as there were no statistically significant differences in stress-normalized Young's modula of elasticity between the 3 groups. The central radius of curvature did not change significantly with increasing pressure in intact eyes or in eyes without Bowman's layer. In deep keratectomized corneas the corneal radius of curvature decreased approximately 1% when the intraocular pressure was increased from 2 to 100 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Twenty-two eyes were divided into two groups: (1) the eyes in which intraocular pressure (IOP) could be controlled by iridotomy and/or topical medication (iridotomy success group, 15 eyes) and (2) the eyes that underwent trabeculectomy to control IOP in spite of a patent opening (iridotomy failure group, 7 eyes). The clinical variables between the two groups were analyzed. Age, sex, visual field defect, presenting IOP and cup/disk ratio were not significantly different between the iridotomy success and failure groups. However, presence of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) greater than 50% was found more frequently in the iridotomy failure group as compared with the iridotomy success group (4/7 vs. 1/15, p = 0.02). Dilated, miotic-resistant pupils were observed only in the iridotomy failure group (4/7 vs. 0/15, p = 0.004). PAS greater than 50% and dilated, fixed pupils were observed in these same cases (4 eyes). Our results suggest that laser iridotomy may not be helpful in cases with dilated and miotic-resistant pupils with formation of extensive PAS."

The Heidelberg retina flowmeter (HRF) was used to assess optic nerve head blood flow in 13 open-angle glaucoma patients. In the same patients, color Doppler imaging (CDI) measurements were obtained from the ophthalmic artery, the central retinal artery and the posterior ciliary arteries. Using data for one randomly selected eye per subject, correlations between HRF recordings and CDI measurements were evaluated by means of Spearman's rank correlation factor. All three HRF parameters correlated with CDI measurements obtained from retrobulbar vessels. The most marked correlations were those of the HRF parameter 'volume' with the end-diastolic velocity in the ophthalmic artery and the medial posterior ciliary artery (R = 0.79, p = 0.0012 and R = 0.81, p = 0.0007, respectively), and the peak systolic velocity in the lateral posterior ciliary artery (R = 0.82, p = 0.0006).

CD012223,0,18284312,0,Current management of glaucoma and the need for complete therapy.,"Glaucoma is a long-term ocular neuropathy defined by optic disc or retinal nerve fiber structural abnormalities and visual field abnormality. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. Currently available treatments, initiated in a stepwise process, focus on intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, and initially include topical drug therapy (single then multidrug combinations), followed by laser then surgical treatment. Topical prostaglandin analogues or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers are first used, followed by alpha-agonists or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and infrequently, cholinergic agonists and oral therapy. Limitations to existing topical IOP-reducing medications include continued disease progression in glaucoma patients with normal IOP, treatment failure, and low rates of compliance and persistence. Therapeutic agents under investigation include neuroprotectants, which target the disease process manifested by death of retinal ganglion cells, axonal loss, and irreversible loss of vision. Neuroprotectants may be used alone or in combination with IOPreducing therapy (a treatment strategy called complete therapy). Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker currently approved for dementia, is the neuroprotectant farthest along in the process seeking regulatory approval for glaucoma treatment and has a favorable safety profile because of its selective mechanism of action. Several other neuroprotectants are in early stage investigation. Complete therapy provides hope for improved outcomes by reducing the significant morbidity and economic consequences that occur as a result of neurodegeneration and disease progression."

IOP was measured by central Goldmann and non-contact tonometry in 54 patients pre and post-PRK, and in 43 patients pre- and post-LASIK. An interval of 12 months was allowed after surgery. Patients were selected to have one of four specific initial values of refractive error (-2.5, -5.0, -7.5 and -10.0 D). Fellow unoperated eyes were used as controls. A paired Student's t-test and a one-way ANOVA test were used for statistical analysis. After PRK and LASIK, a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.01) was observed in the IOP of the treated eyes (but not for control eyes; p > 0.01). Although the magnitude of the change increased with the attempted refractive correction, this trend was not statistically significant (p > 0.01). No statistically significant differences were found between the results obtained following the two types of surgery, although the recorded fall in IOP was smaller following LASIK (p > 0.01). The IOP measured after PRK and LASIK for myopia may be reduced because of reduced corneal thickness and curvature and, possibly, tissue softening after natural healing.

Glaucoma Laser Trial Research Group.,"The Glaucoma Laser Trial Research Group has examined the acute effects of argon laser trabeculoplasty on immediate change in intraocular pressure and the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae among the 271 eyes assigned to argon laser trabeculoplasty as initial treatment for primary open angle glaucoma. Argon laser trabeculoplasty was administered in two sessions. Intraocular pressure rises of greater than 5 mm Hg occurred in 34% of eyes after one or both of the treatment sessions; intraocular pressure rises of greater than 10 mm Hg occurred in 12%. Eyes that had an intraocular pressure rise after the first session were more likely to have a rise after the second session than eyes with no rise after the first session. Among the many patient, eye, and treatment characteristics examined, only pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork was strongly associated with intraocular pressure rises. Forty-six percent of eyes developed greater than or equal to 1 degree of peripheral anterior synechiae. Brown iris color and posterior placement of laser burns were associated with higher rates of peripheral anterior synechiae formation."

CD012223,0,7231918,0,Long-term follow-up of laser iridotomy.,"Argon laser iridotomy was performed on 140 eyes, with greater than one year postoperative follow-up in 88 eyes. Iris holes were satisfactorily produced in every eye treated, with two-thirds having only one treatment session. Late reclosure of laser iridotomy was rare and easily treated. At an average of 1.8 years after treatment, visual acuity was the same or improved in 85% of the eyes. Cataract progression was responsible for those eyes with decreased acuity; the rate of progression being comparable to similar groups of aged persons treated by surgical iridectomy for angle closure types of glaucoma. Other complications were temporary and did not affect vision. Laser iridotomy appears to have particular advantages in certain patients, particularly those with chronic angle closure glaucoma, aphakic pupillary block, or incomplete surgical iridectomy."

We summarize available evidence for considering SLT as an alternative treatment in OAG through systematic review and meta-analysis. Among OAG patients who range from newly diagnosed to those on maximally tolerated medical therapy, SLT results in a 6.9-35.9% intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. Complications are rare and include an IOP spike requiring surgery, persistent macular edema, and corneal haze and thinning. Meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials shows that SLT is non-inferior to ALT and medication in IOP reduction and also in achieving treatment success. Number of medications reduction is similar between SLT and ALT. More robust evidence is needed to determine its efficacy as a repeated procedure."

Prospective interventional, longitudinal, non-comparative series of cases, including 16 eyes of 15 patient's post-PKP on maximal anti-glaucoma medical therapy with intraocular pressures above 22 mmHg. All patients received 18 shots, 360° peri-limbal (avoiding the long posterior ciliary nerves and arteries at 3 and 9 o'clock positions) of trans-scleral DCPC (2000 mW, time: 2.0 s/shot). There was a 55.5 % reduction (total of 14.0 mmHg) of the mean pre-operative IOP (31.5 mmHg) after the first diode laser application (p = 0.0020). Re-treatment was required in 31.2 % of eyes over a mean period of 10.7 months. In these five eyes, the mean pre-operative IOP was 40.4 mmHg, which decreased to 15.0 mmHg post-therapy, and a mean IOP reduction of 25.4 mmHg (p = 0.0218). There was a 51.0 % reduction in the mean number of medications used after the first, and a 57.1 % reduction after a second laser application. The incidence of failure (IOP ≥ 22 mmHg or need of additional medical therapy) from initial intervention to loss of follow-up was 1.3 % per person-month. DCPC effectively reduces the intraocular pressure and the number of anti-glaucoma medications with few complications in patients after high-risk PKP and secondary glaucoma. Only, one-third of the eyes needed a second intervention to control the intraocular pressure. Post-DCPC complications were limited to phthisis bulbi and endothelial dysfunction, one eye each.

CD012223,0,2342799,0,Surgical goniosynechialysis for angle-closure glaucoma.,"Fifteen patients with synechial angle-closure glaucoma uncontrolled by medical and laser therapy were treated with surgical goniosynechialysis. Five patients were treated with goniosynechialysis alone, and ten were treated with goniosynechialysis in combination with other surgical procedures. The procedure was successful, in terms of reducing synechiae, in 14 eyes (93%). The extent of angle closure was reduced from 340 degrees +/- 45 degrees (mean +/- standard deviation) preoperatively to 80 degrees +/- 70 degrees postoperatively; the mean reduction was 260 degrees +/- 95 degrees (P less than 0.0001) for the group overall and 280 degrees +/- 80 degrees (P less than 0.0007) for the subgroup treated with goniosynechialysis alone. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 40 +/- 4 mmHg. The mean postoperative IOP was 14 +/- 4 mmHg. The mean reduction in IOP was 26 +/- 15 mmHg (P less than 0.0001) for the group overall and 27 +/- 18 mmHg (P less than 0.015) for the subgroup treated with goniosynechialysis alone. Glaucoma medications were reduced from a mean of 2.6 +/- 1.0 preoperatively to 1.1 +/- 1.2 postoperatively for the group overall and to 1.4 +/- 1.5 for the subgroup treated with goniosynechialysis alone. Complications consisted of two eyes with intraoperative bleeding. One of these required intraoperative conversion to surgical trabeculectomy. The other was associated with a transient postoperative IOP elevation to 40 mmHg. Surgical goniosynechialysis may be an effective means of reducing synechiae and lowering IOP, either alone or in conjunction with other surgical procedures, in patients with angle closures of less than 6 months' duration."

One drop of study medication was instilled into the operative eye one hour before laser surgery, and one drop immediately after the laser surgery. ALO 2145 treated eyes exhibited a significantly lower mean intraocular pressure increase in the immediate postoperative phase, compared with placebo treated eyes. ALO 2145 also significantly reduced the postoperative incidence of intraocular pressure spikes, defined as intraocular pressure increases of more than 10 mmHg over baseline (17% of cases for active treatment vs 60% of cases for placebo).

The result showed that the mean rise in intraocular pressure was significantly less in the timolol-pretreated group than that in the comparison group within 4 hours after laser procedure and the intraocular pressure was the lowest 2 hours after capsulotomy. The mean rise in intraocular pressure in pretreated group was less than that in the comparison group 24 or 48 hours after capsulotomy, but the difference was not significant. It is suggested that pretreatment with 5 mg/ml (0.5%) timolol could blunted the immediate post-capsulotomy pressure rise though delayed pressure increases could not be prevented. Therefore, it is recommended that timolol should be administrated before the YAG laser capsulotomy in order to reduce side effects caused by higher immediate post-capsulotomy pressure rise."

Diclofenac (0.1%) or placebo drops were administered once before and after trabeculoplasty and then four times daily for a total of 4 days. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and anterior chamber flare, measured with the laser flare-cell meter, were evaluated before trabeculoplasty, 3 and 6 hours after trabeculoplasty, and 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 days after trabeculoplasty. Flare increase after argon laser trabeculoplasty was completely blocked by 0.1% topical diclofenac and the mean of maximal flare increases was reduced significantly in the diclofenac group. Therefore, 0.1% diclofenac drops represent a very efficient anti-inflammatory therapy after argon laser trabeculoplasty."

The hereby induced changes in anterior chamber architecture were analyzed using Scheimpflug photography (SP). SP was performed in eyes with AAC and in fellow eyes (FE) before and after LPI. Intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber volume (ACV), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber angle width (ACA), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were analyzed. The group consisted of 18 patients (14♀, 4♂; 69 ± 11 years) with unilateral AAC. Mean IOP in AAC eyes decreased from 49.3 ± 2.8 mmHg at presentation to 13.7 ± 1.6 mmHg after LPI (p = 0.001). Mean ACV increased from 48.2 ± 3.6 to 60.6 ± 2.4 mm(3) in AAC eyes (p < 0.001) and from 60.4 ± 4.6 to 74.1 ± 3.7 mm(3) in the FE (p < 0.001).

In 25 treatments intraocular pressure increased 3 mm Hg or more within four hours. Topical indomethacin pretreatment had no effect on the incidence, magnitude, or time course of this acute increase. It also did not alter the long-term effectiveness of the laser treatment (-3.8 mm Hg in the indomethacin-treated group vs -4.3 mm Hg in the placebo-treated group). The overall incidence of new peripheral anterior synechiae found on gonioscopy at one month was 32% (16 of 50 treatments). Synechiae formation was much higher in blacks (ten of 11 eyes or 91%) than in whites (five of 38 eyes or 13%).

CD012223,0,8965469,0,[Effect and side effects of apraclonidine].,"Apraclonidine is a alpha 2 adrenergic agonic which is a para-amino derivative of clonidine. This molecular alteration helps prevent apraclonidine from crossing the blood-brain barrier so it minimally influences the heart rate and blood pressure. Apraclonidine reduces the intraocular pressure primarily by an aqueous suppressant mechanism. Its ocular hypotensive efficacy as monotherapy is similar to timolol maleate 0.5% up to eight hours post dosing, but is less than timolol maleate by 12 hours following instillation. As an adjunctive agent apraclonidine decreases the intraocular pressure approximately 16% over that of timolol maleate done. These clinical effects are stable out of three months after the initiation of therapy. Apraclonidine is also additive to maximally tolerated medical therapy. As many as 60% of these patients do not require additional therapy after adding apraclonidine for as long as five months. Apraclonidine also is useful to prevent transiently increased intraocular pressure following anterior segment laser procedures and intraocular surgery. Apraclonidine is well tolerated systemically with no serious adverse event attributed previously to this medicine. The most common ocular side effect is anterior segment intolerance in between 8-36% of patients. Symptoms of itching, as well as burning, and signs of conjunctival inflammation may appear. The intolerance quickly resolves upon discontinuation of the medicine. In summary, apraclonidine is useful in chronic therapy for chronic open-angle glaucoma and helping to prevent acute increased intraocular pressure following anterior segment laser procedures."

Thirty patients had linear-incision Nd:YAG laser iridotomy in one eye and linear-incision argon laser iridotomy in the other. Two-hour post-laser IOP rises averaged 7.33 mmHg for the Nd:YAG laser and 8.64 mmHg for the argon laser. The argon laser produced lens burns in 9 of 30 eyes, including 7 of 9 blue eyes. No lens damage occurred with the Nd:YAG laser. No corneal or retinal damage was seen with either laser. Local oozing of blood inhibited optical breakdown and required a pause before completion in 5 of 30 eyes with Nd:YAG iridotomy, including 4 of 6 dark brown thick irides. Because the iris fibers must be cut by direct contact with the laser plasma, serial cutting of iris fibers by multiple low-energy plasmas is safer than a single-shot, high-power plasma occupying the full thickness of the iris. Because it is effective and because it avoids the hazards of argon laser iridotomy and of high-power Nd:YAG laser iridotomy, linear incision Nd:YAG laser iridotomy is recommended as the safest method of iridotomy."

CD012223,0,7933896,0,[3-dimensional topography of the optic papilla with laser scanning tomography: clinical correlation of cluster analysis].,"BACKGROUND The evaluation of optic disc topography is essential for the clinical diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma. The purpose of this study was (1) to establish a computerized cluster formation of optic nerve head topography based on quantitative three-dimensional parameter values and (2) to describe the resulting clusters according to morphological appearance and visual fields. PATIENTS AND METHODS 337 optic nerve heads (glaucomatous optic neuropathy (n = 99), glaucoma suspects (n = 159), normals (n = 79) were analyzed using laser scanning tomography. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed based on standardized variables (optic disc area, rim area, area-ratio, cup depth, cup steepness, height variations along the contour-line). Visual fields were tested by computerized static threshold perimetry. RESULTS A seven cluster solution met the optimizing criteria. The characteristic morphology of the clusters can be described as ""normal"" (N), ""normal, large"" (NL), ""supernormal"" (SN), ""pseudonormal"" (PN), ""glaucoma-like-flat"" (GF), ""glaucoma-like-steep"" (GS) and ""macropapillary"" (M). Visual fields were normal in 180 eyes. 99 eyes had glaucomatous field defects, 58 eyes revealed isolated relative scotomas < 10 db. Presence and degree of visual field defects varied within the automatically classified optic disc groups considerably. Visual field defects were found in 7.7% (SN), 8.3% (N), 18.8% (NL), 33.3% (M), 37% (PN), 64.7% (GF) and 83.3% (GS) respectively. Pseudonormal discs were characterized by a flattening of the height variations along the disc border. CONCLUSIONS (1) Optic nerve heads may be automatically classified based upon a combination of three-dimensional topographic variables. (2) Analysis of optic disc topography and computerized perimetry are supplementary tools in the evaluation of the glaucoma patient. Visual field defects may be present within any cluster. However, the likelyness of the presence of visual field defects differs considerably among the topometrically defined groups of optic nerve heads. Functional damage is to be expected in association with reduced height variations along the disc border, a small rim area and a steep cupping of the optic nerve head."
CD012223,0,26886121,0,Management of Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma.,"Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is a progressive optic nerve degeneration and is defined as a glaucomatous optic neuropathy with associated characteristic enlargement of optic disc cupping and visual field loss that is secondary to ocular hypertension caused by closure of the drainage angle. Angle closure is caused by appositional approximation or adhesion between the iris and the trabecular meshwork. The main treatment strategy for PACG lies in the reduction of intraocular pressure, reopening of the closed angle, and possible prevention of further angle closure. There is no universally agreed best surgical treatment for PACG. Trabeculectomy, goniosynechialysis (GSL), glaucoma implant, and cyclodestructive procedures are effective surgical options. Each of them plays an important role in the management of PACG with its own pros and cons. Accumulating evidence is available to show the effectiveness of visually significant and visually nonsignificant cataract extraction in the treatment of PACG. Trabeculectomy and GSL are often combined with cataract extraction, which may offer additional pressure control benefits to patients with PACG. This review article will discuss laser peripheral iridotomy, argon laser peripheral iridoplasty, and surgeries such as GSL, phacoemulsification, and phaco plus glaucoma surgeries that lower intraocular pressure and also alter the anterior segment and/or drainage angle anatomy. Currently, glaucoma implants and cyclodestruction are mainly reserved for PACG patients who have failed previous filtering operations. Their role as initial surgical treatment for PACG will not be discussed."

We retrospectively reviewed preoperative, intraoperative, and 12-month postoperative medical records in 2485 eyes of 1309 patients who underwent LASIK with an FS laser or an MK for myopia and myopic astigmatism. Data were extracted, such as preoperative age, sex, IOP, manifest spherical equivalent (MSE), central corneal keratometry (CCK), central corneal thickness (CCT), and intended flap thickness and postoperative IOP (postIOP) at 1, 6 and 12 months. Linear mixed model (LMM) and multivariate linear regression (MLR) method were used for data analysis. In both models, the preoperative CCT and ablation depth had significant effects on predicting IOP changes in the FS and MK groups. The intended flap thickness was a significant predictor only in the FS laser group (P < .0001 in both models). In the FS group, LMM and MLR could respectively explain 47.00% and 18.91% of the variation of postoperative IOP underestimation (R2 = 0.47 and R(2) = 0.1891). In the MK group, LMM and MLR could explain 37.79% and 19.13% of the variation of IOP underestimation (R(2) = 0.3779 and 0.1913 respectively). The best-fit model for prediction of IOP changes was the LMM in LASIK with an FS laser."

We studied the retinal and neuroretinal rim capillary perfusion with the Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter in one randomly selected eye of 31 healthy volunteers, 42 primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients and 17 normal pressure glaucoma (NPG) patients. The reproducibility of the measurements on the temporal and nasal retina and on the disc rim was 19%, 26% and 28% in the unselected control group, 12% in the POAG and 12%, 13% and 10% in the NPG group, respectively. Optic disc flow was significantly higher than retinal flow (p < 0.000001). Differences in corresponding flow values between healthy volunteers and glaucoma patients as well as between POAG and NPG patients were not statistically significant. There was no correlation between the temporal and nasal flow values of the same eyes. The average variation in flow between adjacent frame positions was 18.5%. Actual intraocular pressure and the type of treatment had no influence on the retinal flow. The results suggest that the position of the test-frame is very important for the final result.

CD012223,0,6585072,0,Argon laser trabeculoplasty for open angle glaucoma. A retrospective study of 380 eyes.,"Three hundred and eighty eyes of 300 patients which were treated with argon laser trabeculoplasty for medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma were studied retrospectively. Among the 334 eyes having at least six weeks follow up, the mean overall pressure drop was 8.1 mm Hg. In 19.2 per cent of eyes, pressure was inadequately controlled by laser treatment and subsequent glaucoma surgery was required. Phakic primary chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG), aphakic COAG, pseudoexfoliation, pigmentary, and low tension glaucoma eyes all had a significant drop in pressure. Eyes with juvenile glaucoma or inflammatory glaucoma had a much poorer response in terms of mean pressure drop and number requiring later operation. There was no statistically significant difference in response between aphakic and phakic coag eyes, between pseudoexfoliation and phakic COAG eyes, or between eyes treated over the full 360 degrees and eyes treated over half the angle with treatment over the second half later if needed. A higher initial pressure usually resulted in a greater lowering of pressure. Medication was reduced after treatment in 28.7 per cent of eyes. The data suggest that the effect of laser trabeculoplasty generally persists for at least one year. Complications were few, the most serious being elevated intraocular pressure, which rose 10 mm Hg or more in 2.1 per cent of all eyes."

One hundred eyes (100 patients) underwent 180 degree of laser treatment with a mean of 59 spots of 50 microns size and 800 to 1000 mW power. The IOP was measured during the first three hours after laser treatment, at 24 hours, and at two months. Forty-six patients (92%) in the placebo group had an immediate rise of IOP. The mean rise (SD) for these patients was 8.6 (7.1) mmHg. Fifteen patients (30%) in this group had an IOP rise of greater than 10 mmHg. Nine patients (18%) receiving acetazolamide had an immediate rise of IOP. The mean rise for these patients was 4.3 (3.1) mmHg, and no patient had an increase in IOP of greater than 8 mmHg.

CD012223,0,16856103,0,Lens extraction for chronic angle-closure glaucoma.,"Angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by obstruction to the outflow of aqueous humor and consequent rise in intraocular pressure. The obstruction may result from an anatomical predisposition of the eye or may be due to pathophysiologic processes in any part of the eye. The former is considered the primary form and the latter a secondary form of angle closure. Relative pupillary block obstructing free flow of aqueous from the posterior chamber of the eye to the anterior chamber is considered to be the most common mechanism of angle closure. Crowding of the angle is another mechanism, which often coexists with pupillary block. This can result from an anterior placement of the lens due to an increase in the thickness of the lens (as occurs with aging), anterior displacement by a posterior force (for example choroidal effusion), or laxity of the zonules."

A retrospective study was undertaken on 437 eyes from 282 patients (137 women, 145 men) followed in Saint Joseph's Hospital (Paris).

At least twice a year, intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity (VA) and mean total visual capability (TVC) on the Friedmann analyser were recorded on a computer. The severity gradient (SG) was calculated from the evolution gradient of TVC versus IOP with time for each group (medical, ALT, surgery) before and after treatment. Medical SG was not significantly different from ALT SG or surgery SG (trabeculectomy or combined surgery). For each group, SG before treatment was not significantly different from SG after treatment. For tonometric failures after ALT or surgery, SG before treatment was not different from SG after treatment. Nevertheless, after trabeculectomy, in the cases of clear tonometric success (IOP less than or equal to 16 mmHg), SG was significantly improved (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, no positive influence was noted on visual field evolution in cases of a commonly admitted good tonometric control (IOP less than or equal to 21 mmHg). Visual acuity loss after trabeculectomy was greatest during the first year (6/20). The cataractogenic role of trabeculectomy was statistically confirmed. The incidence of cataract at 5 years was 46%.

This delay probably depends on temporal transfer characteristics of the activated precortical visual system. In a pilot study, luminance onset and pattern-reversal stimulation using this technique (light-emitting diode stimulator; transition time, 50 ms) were applied to 18 glaucomatous eyes with early visual field damage. The visual evoked cortical potential latency shifts between ramp and step mode were compared with visual field indices (mean defect, corrected loss variance). The pattern-reversal stimulation in ramp mode yielded a significant difference between the glaucoma group and normal subjects (p less than 0.004). The difference between groups with pattern-reversal stimulation in step mode was not significant (p = 0.15). From the determined visual field indices, only the mean defect showed a significant correlation to the measured visual evoked cortical potential latency shift, with both luminance-onset and pattern-reversal stimulation. In glaucoma with early malfunction, the precortical transmission and processing of lower and middle temporal frequencies, which are predominant in ramp-like temporal stimulus courses, are obviously more affected than the transmission of higher frequencies. The ramp stimulation technique for visual evoked cortical potentials might be of interest as a tool to detect early and specific functional defects in glaucoma."

When the number of endothelial cells is reduced to a significant degree, fluid begins to accumulate within the cornea. As a result, the cornea loses its transparency and the individual suffers a reduction in vision.

Three consecutive NVG patients whose intraocular pressure (IOP) was not controlled with maximal medication were offered an off-label subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab (2.5-3.75 mg/0.1-0.15 mL, Avastin). Bevacizumab was injected into the subconjunctival space close to the corneal limbus in two or three quadrants using a 26-gauge needle. Serial anterior segment photographs were taken before and after the injection. Following subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab, iris or angle neovascularization regressed rapidly within several days. Such regression was accompanied by lowering of IOP in all three cases.

CD012223,0,9112167,0,Evaluation of the peripapillary circulation in healthy and glaucoma eyes with scanning laser Doppler flowmetry.,"In order to study peripapillary perfusion, one randomly selected eye of 34 of healthy volunteers and 40 glaucoma patients (27 suffering from primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) 10 from normal pressure glaucoma (NPG) nd three from other types of glaucoma) was studied with a Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter. Temporal flow adjacent to the disc edge was significantly higher than the nasal flow (p < 0.01). It was reduced significantly in myopia both in controls (p < 0.05) and in glaucoma patients (p < 0.001). However, there was no difference between either controls and glaucoma patients or between POAG and NPG patients. It was independent of treatment type in glaucoma. Within the temporal peripapillary area extremely high flow values (values higher than the mean + 2 SD of the corresponding individual retinal flow) seemed to represent deep peripapillary vascular rings. They were significantly more frequent in glaucoma (72%) than in healthy volunteers (44%, p < 0.05). Their frequency was 83% in myopic and 23% in non-myopic eyes in the control group (p < 0.001). However, in glaucoma patients they were common both in myopic eyes (71%) and in non-myopic ones (75%). The results suggest that capillary perfusion adjacent to the temporal edge of the disc is significantly reduced in myopia. Deep peripapillary vascular structures can be measured on images focused on the surface of the retina, especially if the retina is thinner than normal (healthy myopic eyes and glaucomatous eyes independently of the refraction). This may mask a deficient function of the retinal capillary bed."

LTP was as effective in both groups with a success rate of 65% in simple glaucoma and 68% in capsular glaucoma. In half of the successful responders medication could be tapered. The mean intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction was greater in capsular glaucoma (37%) than in simple glaucoma (22%).

If hypotony lasts for more than 1 week, it could affect vision. This is a case of refractory glaucoma following cataract surgery that was managed by ECP. We drained subchoroidal fluid as CD did not resolve after 1 week. After 5 months, the intraocular pressure was restored to 16 mmHg with one topical glaucoma medication, uncorrected vision improved to 20/300, and with aphakic soft contact lens, it was 20/50. Ophthalmologists facing such complications need not panic and manage hypotony, and the prognosis of such intervention seems to be promising."
CD012223,0,15510721,0,[Use of corneal pachymetry in ocular hypertension and chronic glaucoma].,"Among the numerous corneal variables that may influence the determination of the ""true"" intraocular pressure (IOP) from applanation tonometry measurements and considering the still non conclusive scientific data on all the different aspects of this topic, the measurement of the central corneal thickness (CCT) may be an interesting diagnosis tool in hypertensive and glaucomatous patients. As far as the physiologic variability of the corneal thickness is considered, the measurement of CCT can potentially become an important confounding variable when measuring applanation tonometry in patients with ocular hypertension. It could also improve the management of patients with normal tension glaucoma and patients with suspicious optic discs. In these three groups, the measurement of CCT may be useful in determining if there is an artefactual error in the IOP measurement due to a thicker (too high) cornea or thinner (too low) cornea. Therefore the IOP corrected by CCT may change or influence a decision to initiate or modify treatment. CCT measurement has also proved to be crucial in patients who have undergone laser refractive surgery."

Laser burns were placed in the anterior trabecular meshwork (ATM) in 58 eyes and directly over Schlemm's canal in the posterior trabecular meshwork (PTM) in 60 eyes. Twenty-nine eyes received 100 burns and 89 eyes received 50 burns distributed equally over 360 degrees. Peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) developed in seven (12%) of the eyes having anterior trabeculoplasty and in 26 (43%) of those having posterior trabeculoplasty . There was no correlation between the development of PAS and sex, width of the anterior chamber angle, or the number of laser burns. Eyes having anterior trabeculoplasty had a final decrease in intraocular pressure equal to those having posterior trabeculoplasties . Our results strongly suggest that trabeculoplasty is a safer but no less effective procedure when the laser burns are placed on the ATM rather than the PTM."

CD012223,0,9684489,0,Effect of successful combined renal and pancreatic transplantation on diabetic retinopathy.,"The treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most challenging problems in ophthalmology. The possibility of modulating DR by successful combined kidney and pancreas transplantation thus holds an attractive promise for the ophthalmologist. From June 1983 until April 1997, a total of 86 combined kidney and pancreas transplantation procedures were performed at the Prague-based Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine. All recipients are on close follow-up in terms of their ophthalmic status. However, evaluation of the effect of transplantation is problematic because of the advanced status of DR prior to the procedure. We divided the transplant recipients into two groups according to type of transplantation. In Group I (segmental transplantation), proliferative DR was present in 100% eyes, 70% had undergone vitrectomy, and there were 21% of blind eyes. All eyes had been treated by laser. In this group, long-term stabilization of the finding was observed in three patients. In Group II (whole pancreas transplantation), proliferative and non-proliferative DR was diagnosed in 86% and 14%, respectively. There were 12% of blind eyes, and 70% had been treated by laser prior to transplantation. After a successful transplantation, stabilization was found in 60%, improvement in 18%, and deterioration in 22% of eyes in this group. The stabilization and improvement can be explained by subsequent normoglycemia (HbAlc 5.6%). By contrast, we were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the deterioration and progression of these findings. While the effect of immunosuppression on DR remains unclear, it obviously accelerates the existing cataract."
CD012223,0,21437758,0,Long-term reduction of laser flare values after trabeculectomy but not after cyclodestructive procedures in uveitis patients.,"The aim of this study was to examine long-term changes of laser flare (LF) after trabeculectomy (TE) and transscleral diode cyclophotocoagulation (TDCPC) in patients with uveitic secondary glaucoma. Retrospective, single-center analysis. Overall, 40 TE (mean follow-up 21.1 months) and 68 TDCPC (mean follow-up 21.8 months, P = 0.38) procedures were performed. The intraocular pressure (IOP) level was consistently lower in the TE group at the preoperative visit and at each follow-up visit, while IOP reduction was similar in both groups (P = 0.91). LF decreased from 59.4 photons/ms at baseline to 41.9 photons/ms in the TE group (P = 0.017) and remained unchanged in the TDCPC group (71.2 vs. 70.7 photons/ms, P = 0.84). No significant increase in the number of complications could be observed at the end of the postoperative follow-up, while best-corrected visual acuity drop and cataract formation was higher in the TE group. TE significantly reduced postoperative LF values. Higher LF values did not increase the development of new complications in this study, but an increased occurrence of cataract formation was seen in the TE group."

CD012223,0,15593281,0,Dexamethasone alters F-actin architecture and promotes cross-linked actin network formation in human trabecular meshwork tissue.,"Elevated intraocular pressure is an important risk factor for the development of glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness. This ocular hypertension is due to increased hydrodynamic resistance to the drainage of aqueous humor through specialized outflow tissues, including the trabecular meshwork (TM) and the endothelial lining of Schlemm's canal. We know that glucocorticoid therapy can cause increased outflow resistance and glaucoma in susceptible individuals, that the cytoskeleton helps regulate aqueous outflow resistance, and that glucocorticoid treatment alters the actin cytoskeleton of cultured TM cells. Our purpose was to characterize the actin cytoskeleton of cells in outflow pathway tissues in situ, to characterize changes in the cytoskeleton due to dexamethasone treatment in situ, and to compare these with changes observed in cell culture. Human ocular anterior segments were perfused with or without 10(-7) M dexamethasone, and F-actin architecture was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. We found that outflow pathway cells contained stress fibers, peripheral actin staining, and occasional actin ""tangles."" Dexamethasone treatment caused elevated IOP in several eyes and increased overall actin staining, with more actin tangles and the formation of cross-linked actin networks (CLANs). The actin architecture in TM tissues was remarkably similar to that seen in cultured TM cells. Although CLANs have been reported previously in cultured cells, this is the first report of CLANs in tissue. These cytoskeletal changes may be associated with increased aqueous humor outflow resistance after ocular glucocorticoid treatment."

The study was aimed at comparing the long-term effects of different antiglaucoma eye drops on conjunctival structures using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Methods. Eighty patients diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma and twenty healthy volunteers were included in this study. The participants were divided into 5 groups according to the different medications. The lachrymal film break-up time, Schirmer's I test, and Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire were performed in all subjects. The confocal microscopy was used to observe the basal epithelial cell density (ECD), goblet cell density (GCD), dendritic cell density (DCD), and subepithelial collagen fiber diameter (SFD). Results. Statistically significant differences were found among the control group and the antiglaucoma therapy groups in the values of three clinical data (P < 0.05).

This new procedure, done on an out-patient basis, shows promise as a convenient, low-risk, and useful alternative procedure in selected glaucoma cases that are poorly controlled by medical or surgical measures. This new approach may also be used as an adjunct in the medical and/or surgical management of aphakic and ciliary block glaucoma."

CD012223,0,15021217,0,The role of diurnal pressure measurements in the management of open angle glaucoma.,"The measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) is essential in the diagnosis and management of open-angle glaucoma, but a single measurement in the ophthalmologist's office may or may not reflect what the IOP is at other times of the day or night. It is well documented that the range of the daily fluctuations in IOP is greater in patients with glaucoma than in normal individuals, and a report by Asrani et al. suggested that the range of the diurnal fluctuation may be an independent risk factor for the progression of visual field loss. There have been reports of nocturnal increases in IOP, particularly in patients with normal tension glaucoma, and some ophthalmologists believe these may account for progression of visual field loss in some patients with glaucoma. This review will analyze recent articles that report the impact of various glaucoma therapies on the diurnal IOP curve and the use of diurnal curves in glaucoma diagnosis."

CD012223,0,12676887,0,Evaluation of the ocular hypotensive response of serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor ligands in conscious ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys.,"Published investigations of serotonin-1A (5-hydroxytryptamine1A; 5-HT1A) receptor agonists and serotonin-2A (5-hydroxytryptamine2A; 5-HT2A) receptor antagonists in nonprimate species provide conflicting results with regard to their intraocular pressure-lowering efficacy. Thus, their therapeutic utility in the treatment of human glaucoma has been confusing. We evaluated the effect of selected 5-HT1A agonists and 5-HT2A receptor antagonists on intraocular pressure in a nonhuman primate model, the conscious cynomolgus monkey with laser-induced ocular hypertension. Neither selective 5-HT1A agonists [e.g., R-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin and flesinoxan] nor selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonists [e.g., R-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-piperidinemethanol (M-100907) and 6-chloro-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-N-[6-[(2-methyl-3-pyridinyl)oxy]-3-pyridinyl]-1H-indole-1-carboxamide (SB-242084)] lowered intraocular pressure in the primate model following topical ocular administration. However, compounds that function as agonists at both the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors were found to effectively lower intraocular pressure in the model: 5-hydroxy-alpha-methyltryptamine, 5-methoxy-alpha-methyltryptamine, 5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (bufotenine), and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Furthermore, the selective 5-HT2 receptor agonist R-(-)-1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane lowered intraocular pressure in the primate model, demonstrating a pharmacological response associated with activation of the 5-HT2 receptor. These observations suggest that compounds that function as efficient agonists at 5-HT2 receptors should be considered as potential agents for the control of intraocular pressure in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma in humans."

CD012223,0,20207973,0,A comparison of rates of change in neuroretinal rim area and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in progressive glaucoma.,"PURPOSE. To evaluate and compare rates of change in neuroretinal rim area (RA) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurements in glaucoma patients, those with suspected glaucoma, and normal subjects observed over time. METHODS. In this observational cohort study, patients recruited from two longitudinal studies (Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study-DIGS and African Descent and Evaluation Study-ADAGES) were observed with standard achromatic perimetry (SAP), optic disc stereophotographs, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT-3; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), and scanning laser polarimetry (GDx-VCC; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). Glaucoma progression was determined by the Guided Progression Analysis software for standard automated perimetry [SAP] and by masked assessment of serial optic disc stereophotographs by expert graders. Random-coefficients models were used to evaluate rates of change in average RNFLT and global RA measurements and their relationship with glaucoma progression. RESULTS. At baseline, 194 (31%) eyes were glaucomatous, 347 (55%) had suspected glaucoma, and 88 (14%) were normal. Forty-six (9%) eyes showed progression by SAP and/or stereophotographs, during an average follow-up of 3.3 (+/-0.7) years. The average rate of decline for RNFLT measurements was significantly higher in the progressing group than in the nonprogressing group (-0.65 vs. -0.11 microm/y, respectively; P < 0.001), whereas RA decline was not significantly different between these groups (-0.0058 vs. -0.0073 mm(2)/y, respectively; P = 0.727). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves used to discriminate progressing versus nonprogressing eyes were 0.811 and 0.507 for the rates of change in the RNFLT and RA, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The ability to discriminate eyes with progressing glaucoma by SAP and/or stereophotographs from stable eyes was significantly greater for RNFLT than for RA measurements."

The study was conducted in a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, three way cross-over design. 12 healthy subjects were scheduled to receive either L-NMMA (an unspecific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), phenylephrine (an α-adrenoceptor agonist) or placebo on three different study days. Optic nerve head blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry and IOP was increased stepwise with a suction cup. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and IOP were measured non-invasively and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated as OPP = 2/3 MAP-IOP. Administration of L-NMMA and phenylephrine significantly increased MAP and therefore OPP at rest (p < 0.01). L-NMMA significantly reduced baseline blood flow in the optic nerve head (p < 0.01). Application of the suction cup induced a significant increase in IOP and a decrease in OPP (p < 0.01). During the stepwise increase in IOP, some autoregulatory potential was observed until OPP decreased approximately -30% below baseline. None of the administered substances had an effect on this autoregulatory behavior (p = 0.49). The results of the present study confirm that the human optic nerve head shows some regulatory capacity during a decrease in OPP. Nitric oxide is involved in the regulation of basal vascular tone in the optic nerve head but does not seem to be involved in the regulatory mechanisms during an acute increase in IOP in young healthy subjects."

CD012223,0,23567206,0,Lipofuscin in human glaucomatous optic nerves.,"Lipofuscin accumulation has been observed in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. We recently found that autofluorescent particles also occur in the aged human optic nerve. In this study we sought to determine the nature of these particles and their correlation with aging, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Groups of eight optic nerves from patients diagnosed with primary open angle glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, age-matched controls and four optic nerves derived from controls younger than 42 years were used for the study. All samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde and frozen frontal sections were prepared. Sections were analyzed with fluorescence microscopy, bright field microscopy, Sudan black staining and spectrofluorometry using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Sections were photographed and analyzed to establish the distribution, quantity, and size of the autofluorescent particles. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the ultrastructural location of the granules. On unstained sections under light microscopy granules are detectable as pale brown inclusions and are easily stained with oil-soluble dyes, such as Sudan black. Granules fluoresce when excited at all tested wavelengths but lose their fluorescence after staining with Sudan black. These particles are distributed throughout the axonal columns, but not in the septa, and appear to be located within the glia ensheathing optic nerve axons. The histologic properties of the granules seen in the optic nerve sections correspond to lipofuscin aggregates, a result of incomplete degradation of oxidized proteins. Our morphometric analyses indicate that overall the optic nerves from control, glaucoma, and AMD donors contain similar amounts of lipofuscin. However, optic nerves derived from donors with glaucoma contain lipofuscin particles that are larger than those observed in the age-matched control and AMD groups. Furthermore optic nerves from glaucoma donors display a smaller diameter than those from age-matched controls resulting in a higher concentration of lipofuscin in glaucomatous optic nerves."

However, it is poorly understood how the ROCK pathway affects the pathological signs of retinal vein occlusion (RVO). In this study, we evaluated the effects of ripasudil, a ROCK inhibitor, on a murine RVO model. In vivo, RVO was induced by retinal vein laser irradiation in mice, and evaluated with ripasudil. In vitro, the effects of ripasudil were examined on tight junction protein integrity in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). Moreover, we investigated the expression level of the phosphorylated myosin phosphatase target protein (MYPT)-1 after administration of ripasudil. Ripasudil significantly prevented deterioration, such as retinal edema, reduced the size of the nonperfusion area, and improved retinal blood flow. Ripasudil treatment inhibited disintegration of ZO-1 in HRMECs. Administration of ripasudil suppressed retinal phosphorylation of MYPT-1 in a murine RVO model. These findings indicate that ripasudil might be as a possible therapeutic agent for RVO."

Patients with ocular hypertension had normal eye examinations and had documented elevated intraocular pressures of 23 mmHg or higher on two or more separate occasions. In a double-masked randomized design, one eye of each subject received timolol maleate 0.5% and the fellow eye received placebo. Vessel diameter, maximum velocity of red blood cells, and volumetric blood flow rate were determined in a major retinal vein of each eye just prior to the instillation of drops, and then 2 hr later. In comparison to the baseline value, there was an increase of 12.0% in average red blood cell velocity (P less than 0.005, statistically significant) and of 8.4% in volumetric blood flow rate in the timolol-treated eyes (P less than 0.05, statistically significant). No significant changes in these quantities were observed in the placebo-treated eyes. Also, no significant change in venous diameter was detected in the placebo- and the timolol-treated eyes. In comparison to the baseline, a significantly larger increase in red blood cell velocity was observed in the timolol-treated eyes than in the placebo-treated eyes (P less than 0.05). The difference between the increase in blood flow observed in the timolol-treated eyes and the placebo-treated eyes achieved a probability value of P = 0.058. The increase in blood flow observed in the timolol-treated eyes may be related to the increase in perfusion pressure produced by this drug."

A prospective, controlled follow-up study.","We followed two comparable groups of patients operated on for cataract immediately before and after a transition from intracapsular extraction with an anterior chamber lens to extracapsular technique with a posterior chamber lens. Both groups consisting of 69 eyes of 69 patients were invited to follow-up examinations 4 months and 2 1/2 years after surgery. The visual acuity was similar in the two groups at the two follow-up examinations. Significantly more eyes in the intracapsular group showed either a rise in intraocular pressure or received anti-glaucomatous medications at the latest follow-up. YAG-laser capsulotomy had been performed in 14.5% of the 69 extracapsularly operated eyes. There was a trend towards more intra-operative and cumulative post-operative complications in the intracapsular group, but this difference was not statistically significant. We conclude, that both intracapsular and extracapsular cataract extraction are followed by such low incidences of post-operative complications, that it will require a very large number of eyes to confirm or reject a possible statistically significant difference in post-operative complication rate."

A topical and systemic anti-glaucomatous treatment were given and laser peripheral iridotomies were performed and, the intraocular pressure were stabilized. However, the anterior chambers remained very shallow and peripheral ciliochoroidal detachment was observed and confirmed echographically. Assuming that the mechanism of acute bilateral simultaneous angle closure glaucoma differs from the common pupillary block, and is related to external cause, the topiramate therapy was discontinued, and the patient was treated with cycloplegic agent and steroids. A gradual deepening of the anterior chamber and resolution of the choroidal edema were accompanied by improvement of visual acuity and corneal clarity. The presumed mechanism of drug related acute bilateral angle closure glaucoma is choroidal effusion and detachment associated with forward budging of the iris-lens diaphragm. This, in turn, causes a shallow anterior chamber and blockage of the ocular draining system."

Mean intraocular pressure decreased from 27 +/- 4 mmHg to 20 +/- 5 mmHg (median follow-up, 9 months). From 1978 through 1981, the mean annual rate of filtering surgery was 16. Only one filtering procedure was performed in 1982, the first full year of ALT use. However, 15 filtering procedures were performed in 1983 and 18 were performed in 1984. Despite a large number of apparently effective ALT treatments and despite an overall reduction in outpatient visits of 20%, the rate of filtering surgery has returned to the pre-ALT level. This suggests that ALT may be effective in delaying the need for surgery, but in many cases it probably does not prevent surgery."
CD012223,0,3985828,0,Intraocular pressure and the corneal endothelium after neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Relative effects of aphakia and pseudophakia.,"We studied intraocular pressure (IOP) changes and specular microscopic findings in 118 consecutive neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy procedures; 37 cases were aphakic, and 81 were pseudophakic. There was a significantly greater rise in IOP one hour after Nd-YAG laser treatment in the aphakic group than in the pseudophakic group (8.2 mm Hg vs 3.5 mm Hg, respectively). At one week postoperatively, IOPs in the aphakic group were still significantly elevated over baseline levels (3.6 mm Hg), while those in the pseudophakic group had returned to baseline levels. Differences in treatment between the aphakic and pseudophakic groups in total number of pulses, average energy, and total energy did not explain the differences in IOP. No significant change in endothelial cell densities was seen between pretreatment measurements and those taken one week after Nd-YAG laser treatment."

Half of the eyes in each group underwent capsulotomies performed with six 2-mJ bursts of energy, and the remaining eyes underwent capsulotomies performed with three 4-mJ bursts of energy. There was no significant difference in pressure responses between eyes treated with 2 or 4 mJ. The mean rise in intraocular pressure was significantly less in the timolol-pretreated group one hour after capsulotomy. After four hours, the difference between groups was not significant. Pretreating with timolol did not prevent late pressure rises. Nonpseudophakic eyes were more likely to sustain pressure increases greater than 10 mm than were pseudophakic eyes."

CD012223,0,3776504,0,Intraocular pressure reduction after argon laser trabeculoplasty in open-angle glaucoma. A two-year follow-up.,"One hundred and twenty-eight eyes of 113 pre-surgical patients with open-angle glaucoma, treated with 360-degree orgon laser trabeculoplasty, were followed up for 24 months. Success was defined as an intraocular pressure below 23 mmHg as well as an intraocular pressure reduction of at least 20% with the same medical therapy as given before laser treatment, or less. The total success rate was 64%. In 79 eyes with capsular glaucoma the success rate was 76%, whereas in 49 eyes with simple glaucoma it was 45%. The success rate increased in groups with higher degrees of trabecular pigmentation, probably an effect of a higher proportion of eyes with capsular glaucoma in these groups. Baseline intraocular pressure had no influence on the success rate. No correlation was found between the amount of laser energy delivered and the degree of pressure reduction after 6 months. Neither was there any significant difference in laser energy levels between eyes showing successful results and those regarded as failures at the end of the 2-year follow-up period."

Part I.,"We describe herein a new trial to stimulate trabecular meshwork tissue and thereby increase outflow facility. The efficacy of our laser trabeculostimulation (LTS) was compared with that of conventional laser trabeculoplasty (LTP), since LTP causes shrinkage and cicatrization of the meshwork tissue, thus limiting the reduction of postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP). The mean preoperative IOP of 40 eyes was 24.9 +/- 6.8 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). LTS was applied with a 50-microns spot, a power setting of 50 mW and an exposure time of 1 s. With LTS, the IOP decreased but then increased afterward. Results indicate that low power (50 mW) is effective if used for a longer duration. Our LTS can be applied repeatedly and used in addition to conventional LTP. Although our LTS was less effective than LTP, the trial may lead to the development of another useful treatment modality."

Twenty-eight eyes (21 patients) with chronic narrow angle glaucoma underwent argon laser iridotomy. Fourteen eyes were treated with ALO 2145; the remainder received a placebo. All eyes received one drop of the appropriate medication one hour before and following the iridotomy. Six eyes (43%) treated with the placebo and no eyes treated with ALO 2145 experienced an IOP increase greater than 10 mm Hg over baseline. The mean IOPs and mean IOP changes from baseline were significantly lower during the first three postoperative hours in the eyes treated with ALO 2145. No significant difference was noted in the ease of iridotomy formation, rate of iridotomy closure, visual acuity, anterior segment inflammation, or mean heart rate."

CD012223,0,21426837,0,[Challenge and treatment strategy for ocular surface damage in patients with long term use of antiglaucoma drugs].,"Long term use of topical anti-glaucoma drugs has been shown to induce chronic conjunctivitis, superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) and dry eye symptom. Under these conditions, a loss of goblet cells in conjunctiva, epithelial squamous metaplasia and apoptosis were morphologically revealed. Benzalkonium Chloride (BKC), a most frequently used preservative in eye drops, has been found to be an important factor causing ocular surface damage. Furthermore, a big challenge for ophthalmologists is that toxic damage of medication to ocular surface tissues is mild, poor specificity, and delayed manifestation in patients, especially when coexisting with other ocular surface diseases. Impairment of ocular surface tissues greatly impacts the life quality of patients and subsequently influences compliance with glaucoma therapy. This paper emphasizes to take measures to prevent ocular surface tissue damage resulted from chronic use of topical anti-glaucoma drugs and further discusses the treatment strategy. Effective and long-lasting action drugs should always be selected for glaucomatous patients in order to decrease the frequency of topical instillation or at a more expensive medication, a fixed combination formula can be considered for glaucoma therapy. An early surgery or laser treatment is also proposed for the patients who require an IOP reduction with an existing ocular surface impairment. Future investigation and development of new medications with long-term efficacy and appropriate BKC are suggested and preservative-free or drugs with new preservative materials recommended."

Thirty eyes were stabilized by photocoagulation, though 25 required long-term glaucoma medications. Six eyes required additional procedures. Vision deteriorated in 21 of the 36 eyes (nine eyes finally having ""no light perception"") during the 32.8-month follow-up.

CD012223,0,26424819,0,Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation in refractory acute and chronic angle closure glaucoma.,"Angle closure glaucoma, both acute and chronic, is a major cause of blindness worldwide. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCP) is conventionally undertaken non-urgently in patients with advanced glaucoma and poor visual potential with poor control of intraocular pressure (IOP). We describe a case of a patient with refractory acute angle closure glaucoma and severe pain in whom emergency TSCP was undertaken 12 h after presentation, reducing the IOP from 68 to 10 mm Hg. Further, a patient with chronic angle closure glaucoma underwent TSCP, reducing the IOP from 78 to 14 mm Hg. Both patients consequently underwent uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery with preservation of visual acuity and long-term IOP control. TSCP may achieve prompt IOP control and symptomatic relief in the acute setting in patients with acute and chronic forms of angle closure glaucoma refractory to medical therapy. TSCP may reduce the risk of definitive surgical intervention by temporising phacoemulsification or trabeculectomy surgery until the IOP is well controlled."

CD012223,0,26269445,0,Efficacy and safety of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery versus conventional phacoemulsification for cataract: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) versus conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery (CPCS) in the treatment of cataract. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Nine qualified studies with a total of 989 eyes were included. Compared with CPCS, FLACS significantly reduced mean phaco energy and effective phacoemulsification time (EPT) required in the surgery. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was significantly lower in FLACS at 1 day of follow-up, but CCT and corneal endothelial cells count was comparable at 1 week of follow-up or longer. FLACS achieved a better visual outcome at postoperative 1 week and 6 months, but the difference was not significant at postoperative 1-3 months. Regard to surgical complications, the incidences of intraoperative anterior capsule tear, postoperative macular edema and elevated intraocular pressure were similar. In conclusion, femtosecond laser pretreatment can reduce phaco energy and EPT, which may reduce the heat damage to ocular tissues by ultrasound. This novel technique might be beneficial for patients with dense cataract and/or low preoperative endothelial cell values. Well-designed RCTs with longer follow-up are still necessary to provide more reliable evidence."

CD012223,0,10537770,0,Perspectives in the medical treatment of glaucoma.,"Many advances in medical therapy for chronic glaucoma have taken place in the past few years that have altered previous concepts of stepwise medical therapy for glaucoma. beta-adrenergic blockers are still the most common medicine prescribed as monotherapy. However, latanoprost and brimonidine are often given as monotherapy as well as early adjunctive therapy. In addition, newer treatments that are used as early adjunctive therapy are dorzolamide, brinzolamide, apraclonidine, and the combination products, consisting of dorzolamide/timolol maleate and pilocarpine/timolol maleate. Older adjunctive treatments are now often prescribed as late adjunctive therapy including pilocarpine, epinephrine compounds, and acetazolamide. The extent of maximum tolerated medical therapy and the decision to perform either laser or conventional filtration surgery depend on the physician's judgment and on the patient's needs and preferences. In the future, newer medical therapies that may protect the health of the optic nerve directly could be developed including blood flow-based, neuroprotective, and genetically based agents."

Using a life-table method, there was no significant difference in the outcome of trabeculotomy between groups divided by duration and type of preoperative topical therapy. There was not statistically significant difference in the intraocular pressure reduction between the groups of long or short duration of topical therapy. We concluded that the duration and type of topical antiglaucoma medications had no significant effect on the outcome of trabeculotomy."
CD012223,0,3991123,0,Effect of pilocarpine in treatment of intraocular pressure elevation following neodymium: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.,"A prospective study was conducted in 30 eyes of 30 patients to determine if pilocarpine would prevent increased intraocular pressure following Q-switched neodymium (Nd):YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Fifteen eyes were given pilocarpine 4%, immediately following laser therapy and every hour until bedtime. Fifteen eyes served as untreated controls. Our results show that without prophylactic therapy, 10 of 15 eyes (67%) had a post-laser intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation of greater than 10 mmHg, while only one of 15 (6.6%) of the pilocarpine-treated eyes had a rise of that magnitude. The facility of outflow was reduced by 42% in the untreated eyes in contrast to an increase of 3% in those eyes treated with pilocarpine. Thus, pilocarpine 4% is effective in reducing the incidence and magnitude of elevated IOP following Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy."

Three methods may be used either singly or in combination to cut short an attack: (1) peripheral iridoplasty, (2) pupilloplasty, and (3) laser iridectomy. Laser treatment is preferable to and safer than intraocular iridectomy in such cases. Pilocarpine, which increases the axial length of the lens and shallows the anterior chamber, may worsen angle closure by increasing the pupillary block. An enlarged lens or forward movement of the lens may be a significant factor in medically unresponsive attacks. The routine use of copious amounts of pilocarpine should be avoided in treating angle-closure glaucoma."

After a mean period of follow-up 14.7 months (12-36 months), the average intraocular pressure was decreased from pre-operative 5.93 kPa (44.5 mmHg) to post-operative 1.96 kPa (14.7mmHg). The experimental group of patients was compared with the control group, 41 eyes of 39 cases at the same period randomly undergoing trabeculectomy without laser suture lysis. The control rate of intraocular pressure is higher (89.8%:73.2%) and the incidence of ocular complications (such as, shallow anterior chamber, choroid detachment, hyphema, lens opacity) is significantly lower in the former group, showing that trabeculectomy with following laser suture lysis is a safe and effective anti-glaucoma surgery.

Their mean visual acuity improved from 0.31 +/- 0.13 to 0.93 +/- 0.08 after 18 +/- 5 days (p less than or equal to 0.001). Of the sixteen of 18 evaluable eyes that were additionally treated with a mean of 3.28 +/- 1.07 three-weekly posterior subtenon's injections, 15 eyes including all uveitis CME responded to treatment. Their mean visual acuity improved from 0.49 +/- 0.20 to 0.96 +/- 0.31 (p less than or equal to 0.001). Two patients were excluded; in 22/23 eyes the sequential treatment was successful with an overall success rate of 95% of cases (improvement of five lines on the Snellen chart or final visual acuity of 0.8 or better). Initial angiographic cystoid macular edema was comparable and significantly improved after therapy in the two treatment groups. No mean intraocular pressure rise was noted after steroid injections. Measurement of anterior chamber inflammation with the laser flare-cell meter (Kowa FC-1000) showed elevated flare in all cases which significantly decreased in both treatment groups and represented a good follow-up parameter for the effect of antiinflammatory treatment and restoration of blood-ocular barrier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Data derived from the Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT), a randomized trial of the efficacy and safety of argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) as compared with the efficacy and safety of topical medications as initial therapy for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), demonstrated an estimated mean pressure reduction of 0.5 mm Hg in the contralateral eye that had received ALT. This contralateral effect is smaller than that observed in other studies of POAG patients. Lower initial IOP, longer duration of treatment with timolol, and/or improved outflow facility modulation in the ALT-treated eyes may be responsible for the smaller contralateral effect of timolol observed in the GLT patients."

CD012223,0,10202286,0,Blood flow velocity in the peripheral circulation of glaucoma patients.,"Using the laser Doppler technique we measured finger blood flow velocity in 25 untreated primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), 22 untreated low-tension glaucoma (LTG) and 19 age-matched normal subjects. Four blood flow measurements were recorded: baseline flow, after immersion in warm water for 2 min (40 degrees C maximum flow), after 10 s exposure to cold water (4 degrees C minimum flow) and time to recover to baseline flow after cold immersion. Significant differences between the LTG group and both the normal and POAG groups were found in a greater maximum flow (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively), a lower minimum flow (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively) and a longer recovery time to baseline flow (p = 0. 0001 for both the normal and POAG groups). A longer recovery time to baseline flow (p = 0.008) in POAG was the only difference between the normal and POAG groups. Both glaucoma groups had more systemic vascular disease than normal, and there were more smokers in the POAG group than normals. Subgroup assessment performed with migraine, vascular disease and smoking subjects excluded from the analysis did not alter the overall results. We conclude that systemic vasospasm is a strong feature of low-tension glaucoma."

Twenty-nine eyes (20 patients) with angle-closure glaucoma underwent ALI. Eighteen eyes were treated with apraclonidine, and the remainder received a placebo 1 hour before and immediately after ALI. The mean IOP increase in the apraclonidine group was lower than that in the placebo group at each postlaser interval (p less than 0.01). Although the average value of the maximal increases of IOP after ALI in the apraclonidine group was 4 mmHg, that in the placebo group was 16 mmHg. In the placebo group, 27.3% (3 out of 11 eyes) experienced an IOP rise greater than or equal to 10 mmHg. However, that kind of IOP rise was not found in the apraclonidine group (0 out of 18 eyes) (p less than 0.01). Ocular or systemic side effects were not found in a series of examinations in both groups. Therefore, apraclonidine proved to be effective in lowering the IOP rise after ALI."

It results in a progressive loss of peripheral vision and, in late stages, loss of central vision leading to blindness. Early treatment of glaucoma aims to prevent or delay vision loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main causal modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. Aqueous outflow obstruction is the main cause of IOP elevation, which can be mitigated either by increasing outflow or reducing aqueous humor production. Cyclodestructive procedures use various methods to target and destroy the ciliary body epithelium, the site of aqueous humor production, thereby lowering IOP. The most common approach is laser cyclophotocoagulation."

In a double masked, randomized design, one eye received two drops of timolol maleate 0.5% and the fellow eye received two drops of placebo. Vessel diameter, maximum velocity of red blood cells, and volumetric blood flow rate were determined in a major temporal vein of each eye just prior to the instillation of drops, and then 90 min later. In comparison to the baseline value, there was a significantly larger average percentage increase in maximum velocity of red blood cells and volumetric blood flow rate in the timolol-treated eyes (11.0% and 13.2%, respectively) than in the control eyes (2.2% and 1.5%, respectively, paired t-test, P less than 0.05). No significant change in venous diameter was detected. No significant linear correlations were found between the percentage change in maximum velocity of red blood cells and mean brachial artery blood pressure, and between the percentage change in volumetric blood flow rate and mean brachial artery pressure in the placebo-treated eyes, whereas significant correlations were present between these quantities in the timolol-treated eyes (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). The lack of such correlations in the control eyes is probably due to autoregulation of the retinal circulation. The presence of correlations in the timolol-treated eyes suggests that the drug may affect the capacity of the retina to autoregulate."
CD012223,0,3342976,0,Neodymium: YAG laser iridotomies--short-term comparison with capsulotomies and long-term follow-up.,"This study addresses three aspects of anterior segment Nd:YAG laser treatment--acute endothelial damage, as assessed by endothelial specular photomicrography (ESP), acute and long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) changes, and long-term iridotomy patency. The acute ESP and IOP changes in 26 eyes (21 patients) after Nd:YAG laser iridotomies were compared to 39 eyes (37 patients) after Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy. Similar endothelial damage occurred in both groups, although less damage was noted in the group of 9 eyes in which capsulotomies were undertaken in the presence of an intraocular lens. In a parallel study 53 eyes (44 patients) were followed for a mean of 83 weeks (19 months) from the time of Nd:YAG iridotomy. There were no late closures and no late rises in IOP. The level of acute IOP rise after treatment did not predict long-term IOP. We conclude that Nd:YAG iridotomy is an effective procedure in the long-term, and that both iridotomy and capsulotomy are accompanied by noteworthy acute endothelial changes and intraocular pressure rises."

CD012223,0,26692257,0,A Review of Randomized Trials of Approved Pharmaceutical Agents for Macular Edema Secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion.,"There are 3 approved pharmaceutical agents for treating macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO): dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) implant and ranibizumab and aflibercept (both antivascular endothelial growth factor agents). All show a superior ability to improve vision and reduce macular thickness in comparison with sham injections or macular grid laser treatment. Prompt treatment with these agents may lead to a better outcome. A review of randomized trials of injected aflibercept or ranibizumab reveals protocol variations. They include ""as needed"" injections until functional and anatomical changes are achieved, preceded by either 1 injection or 3 to 6 monthly injections as loading doses. Ocular and systemic adverse effects of vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists for macular edema secondary to RVO are rarely severe. The antiedematous response to a single intravitreal dexamethasone implant is maximal 1 to 3 months after the injection. Intraocular pressure elevation and cataract aggravation should be monitored after the use of intravitreal dexamethasone implants. Intravitreal dexamethasone implants and ranibizumab injections reduce not only macular edema, but also the risk of retinal ischemia and neovascularization in patients with RVO."

Systemic blood pressure (BP) and intraocular pressure were also measured, and the retinal perfusion pressure was calculated. The measurements were compared to those previously obtained from a younger group of 7 healthy subjects, aged 25-38 years. Total retinal blood flow was 73 +/- 13 microliters/min in the middle-aged subjects and was not significantly different from the value measured in young subjects (80 +/- 12 microliters/min). Retinal perfusion pressure was significantly higher in the older subjects, primarily due to elevated systemic BP. The similarity in total flow between the two groups, even though the retinal perfusion pressures were higher in the older group, is an indication of an increased vascular resistance to flow. The increase may be an aging phenomenon or an indication of a well-functioning autoregulatory capacity in the retinal vasculature of the older subjects."

CD012223,0,18929126,0,Assessment of neuroprotection in the retina with DARC.,"Currently, assessment of new drug efficacy in glaucoma relies on conventional perimetry to monitor visual field changes. However, visual field defects cannot be detected until 20-40% of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the key cells implicated in the development of irreversible blindness in glaucoma, have been lost. We have recently developed a new, noninvasive real-time imaging technology, which is named DARC (detection of apoptosing retinal cells), to visualize single RGC undergoing apoptosis, the earliest sign of glaucoma. Utilizing fluorescently labeled annexin 5 and confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscopy, DARC enables evaluation of treatment effectiveness by monitoring RGC apoptosis in the same living eye over time. Using DARC, we have assessed different neuroprotective therapies in glaucoma-related animal models and demonstrated DARC to be a useful tool in screening neuroprotective strategies. DARC will potentially provide a meaningful clinical end point that is based on the direct assessment of the RGC death process, not only being useful in assessing treatment efficacy, but also leading to the early identification of patients with glaucoma. Clinical trials of DARC in glaucoma patients are due to start in 2008."

Using laser-speckle tissue blood flow analysis, normalized blur (NB; a quantitative index of tissue blood velocity) was measured every 0.125 sec at a temporal ONH site free of visible surface vessels. Measurements were averaged for 3 cardiac cycles (NB(ONH)). Color Doppler Imaging (CDI) was also used to evaluate peak systolic blood velocity (PSV), endo-diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistive index (RI) in the central retinal artery (CRA) and mean blood velocity (MV) in the central retinal vein (CRV). One drop of 0.005% latanoprost was instilled into one eye and its vehicle into the other in eleven healthy volunteers in a double-blinded manner. Measurements of bilateral NB(ONH), CDI parameters, intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate (PR) were performed before, and 45, 90, 180, and 270 min after instillation. After a single instillation of latanoprost or the vehicle, there was no significant bilateral difference throughout the experimental period. The difference in NB(ONH) between that before and at each time point of measurement (delta NB(ONH)) in the latanoprost-treated eyes was significantly higher between 45 and 270 min after instillation than that in vehicle-treated eyes (P = 0.0003 to 0.0156); ANOVA for repeated measurements also revealed significant difference between both eyes (P < 0.00001). BP, PR, and NB(ONH) in the eye that received only the vehicle, PSV, EDV, and RI in the CRA in both eyes, and MV in the CRV in both eyes changed little. Tissue blood velocity in the ONH increased at least temporarily following a single instillation of topical latanoprost. Although the mechanism of the increase is unclear, the effects of latanoprost on ONH tissue circulation in humans may have clinical implications."

CD012223,0,11095133,0,Laser trabeculodissection with a photopolishing scanning excimer laser.,"A phase I study of nonpenetrating trabeculectomy (Zimmerman procedure) using a scanning excimer laser system was conducted to evaluate the ability of this laser system to achieve the deep dissection required to allow significant filtration without inadvertent penetration into the anterior chamber. A photopolishing, scanning 193 nm excimer laser system (LS 2000, LaserSight, Inc.) was used with a proprietary fluence, spot size, scanning pattern, and ablation shape to perform a trabeculodissection under a scleral flap with a limbal-based conjunctival flap in 8 cases of advanced glaucoma including 5 eyes that had a failed trabeculectomy. The laser trabeculodissection (LTD) was carried through Schlemm's canal and the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork, achieving vigorous aqueous outflow. No peripheral iridectomy was done. The scleral flap was closed loosely with a 10-0 suture. Mitomycin-C was used intraoperatively. In no case did inadvertent penetration into the anterior chamber occur. No peripheral iridectomy was performed. No intraoperative hyphema occurred. There was no postoperative iritis except minimal anterior chamber reaction in 1 eye with preoperative rubeosis. Postoperatively, a good filtering bleb was achieved in all 8 eyes with substantial reduction in the intraocular pressure without topical antiglaucoma therapy. No cases of postoperative shallowing (overfiltration) occurred. Gonioscopy, postoperatively, revealed no new peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) to the filtration site and an intact inner trabecular meshwork. All eyes were followed for a minimum of 6 months. In this phase I study, laser trabeculodissection (LTD) with a 193 nm photopolishing, scanning system appears to be a promising alternative to full-thickness trabeculectomy, achieving significant filtration while perhaps avoiding much of the risk of filtration surgery. The laser system seemed to provide a more reliable, better-controlled dissection than a knife. The aqueous drainage seems to have acted as a self-regulating endpoint by absorbing UV energy, thus avoiding inadvertent penetration into the anterior chamber. More study is needed to establish the appropriate role of LTD in glaucoma therapy."

Initial therapy entails the use of topical and systemic pressure lowering agents as well as anti-inflammatory/analgesics for the provision of relief. Those refractory to medical therapy may require surgical intervention in the form of cyclodestructive procedures, retrobulbar injection of absolute alcohol and evisceration or enucleation. A case series of 5 patients of absolute glaucoma who were successfully treated with retrobulbar alcohol injection is reported. Pain was recorded on a verbal analogue score (VAS).All the patients were pain free twelve months after the injection. No significant long term complications were observed.

CD012223,0,28231380,0,Perioperative medications for preventing temporarily increased intraocular pressure after laser trabeculoplasty.,"Glaucoma is the international leading cause of irreversible blindness. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only currently known modifiable risk factor; it can be reduced by medications, incisional surgery, or laser trabeculoplasty (LTP). LTP reduces IOP by 25% to 30% from baseline, but early acute IOP elevation after LTP is a common adverse effect. Most of these IOP elevations are transient, but temporarily elevated IOP may cause further optic nerve damage, worsening of glaucoma requiring additional therapy, and permanent vision loss. Antihypertensive prophylaxis with medications such as acetazolamide, apraclonidine, brimonidine, dipivefrin, pilocarpine, and timolol have been recommended to blunt and treat the postoperative IOP spike and associated pain and discomfort. Conversely, other researchers have observed that early postoperative IOP rise happens regardless of whether people receive perioperative glaucoma medications. It is unclear whether perioperative administration of antiglaucoma medications may be helpful in preventing or reducing the occurrence of postoperative IOP elevation."

We report here results of a study evaluating the safety and biodistribution of rAAV2tYF-CB-hRS1 in normal cynomolgus macaques. Three groups of male animals (n = 6 per group) received an intravitreal injection in one eye of either vehicle, or rAAV2tYF-CB-hRS1 at one of two dose levels (4 × 10(10) or 4 × 10(11) vg/eye). Half the animals were sacrificed after 14 days and the others after 91 or 115 days. The intravitreal injection procedure was well tolerated in all groups. Serial ophthalmic examinations demonstrated a dose-related anterior and posterior segment inflammatory response that improved over time. There were no test article-related effects on intraocular pressure, electroretinography, visual evoked potential, hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, or gross necropsy observations. Histopathological examination demonstrated minimal or moderate mononuclear infiltrates in 6 of 12 vector-injected eyes. Immunohistochemical staining showed RS1 labeling of the ganglion cell layer at the foveal slope in vector-injected eyes at both dose levels. Serum anti-AAV antibodies were detected in 4 of 6 vector-injected animals at the day 15 sacrifice and all vector-injected animals at later time points. No animals developed antibodies to RS1. Biodistribution studies demonstrated high levels of vector DNA in the injected eye but minimal or no vector DNA in any other tissue. These results support the use of rAAV2tYF-CB-hRS1 in clinical studies in patients with XLRS."
CD012223,0,18461333,0,[Secondary glaucoma in childhood uveitis].,"Ocular hypertension and secondary glaucoma are frequent and challenging complications in childhood uveitis. They are commonly found in patients with panuveitis or anterior uveitis and are often associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Angle closure is rare, while secondary open angle glaucoma accounts for the majority of cases and often continues after the acute inflammation has healed. Monitoring should include tonometry, perimetry, and the objective assessment of the optic disc and nerve fibre layer. First-line therapy should consist of topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, followed by beta blockers, and then the alpha-2 agonists. Topical therapy must be monitored closely, as drug-related systemic side effects may preferentially occur in children. Because topical therapy in children is commonly ineffective, surgical interventions are often required. Reports on the use of trabeculectomy, goniosurgery, glaucoma drainage devices, and cyclodestructive procedures show higher failure rates than when used for primary open angle glaucoma in adults."

CD012223,0,1945315,0,Subconjunctival THC:YAG laser thermal sclerostomy.,"A THC:YAG laser (thulium, holmium, chromium-doped YAG crystal) was used to create thermal sclerostomies in 21 glaucomatous eyes of 19 patients. The laser is a long-pulsed (300 microsec), compact, self-contained, solid state laser operating in the near infrared (2.1 mu). A 1-mm conjunctival stab incision was made 12 mm away from the sclerostomy site to allow entry of a specially designed 22-gauge (712 mu) optic probe that delivers energy at a right angle to the long axis of the fiber. Probe insertion produced minimal disturbance of the conjunctiva. Pulse energies of 80 mJ to 120 mJ were used with a repetition rate of 5 pulses/second. Total energy levels to produce full-thickness sclerostomies ranged from 1.4 to 4.8 J. Subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil injections were administered in 15 eyes. At 3 months the mean intraocular pressure of successful cases (16) was 14 mmHg (range, 9 to 22 mmHg). Of successful cases, the mean intraocular pressure at 6 months was 13 mmHg (range, 2 to 22 mmHg). Five cases failed within the initial 3 months, and 3 additional cases failed by 6 months. The authors conclude that this full-thickness sclerostomy technique may simplify filtering surgery without anterior chamber instrumentation and with minimal conjunctival trauma."
CD012223,0,21476309,0,[Basic and clinical studies of pressure-independent damaging factors of open angle glaucoma].,"Pathogenesis of open-angle glaucoma involves both pressure-dependent damaging factors and pressure-independent damaging factors. The high prevalence of open-angle glaucoma with normal pressure (normal-tension glaucoma) in Japan implies that treatment of pressure-independent damaging factors in Japanese open-angle glaucoma patients is of importance. In an attempt to investigate the roles of pressure-independent damaging factors in open-angle glaucoma, we carried out basic and clinical studies and obtained the following results. 1. The rate of deterioration of visual field after trabeculectomy in normal tension glaucoma patients with post-operative intraocular pressure (IOP) of 10 mmHg was found to be -0.25 dB/year of mean deviation (MD), suggesting that contribution of pressure-independent damaging factors to the deterioration of MD in open-angle glaucoma is around -0.25 dB/year of mean deviation (MD). 2. Experiments using isolated purified cultured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) indicated that calcium-channel blockers and some of antiglaucoma drugs showed neuroprotective effects on RGCs at concentrations of 0.01 microM or higher. 3. In mice, damage to RGCs resulted in secondary degeneration of neurons and activation of glial cells in the lateral geniculate nucleous (LGN) and superior colliculus, and these secondary changes in the central nervous system (CNS) due to RGC damage was partly ameliorated by systemic administration of memantine. 4. Mice experimental high IOP glaucoma models could be established using laser irradiation of the limbal area, and the usefulness of Tonolab in IOP measurements of mice eye was confirmed. 5. Monkey experimental high IOP glaucoma models revealed that in the glaucomatous optic nerve head vaso-constrictive reactions to an alpha-1 agonist was abolished, while vasodilative reaction to a prostaglandin FP receptor agonist was retained. 6. In monkeys with experimental high IOP glaucoma, secondary damage to neurons in the LGN and the glial reaction to it were also found, similar to the mice experiments. In living monkeys the glial reaction in the LGN could be observed by means of positron emission tomography. 7. In the LGN of monkeys with experimental high IOP glaucoma, the M-cell system was preferentially damaged in the early stage, while in the later stages both the M- and P-cell systems were damaged. 8. In a single-instituted prospective double-blinded clinical trial, oral administration of nilvadipine at 4 mg/day, a DHP calcium-channel blocker, was found to significantly retard the visual field progression in normal tension glaucoma patients over 3 years, while significantly increasing the choroidal and optic nerve blood flow by about 35%. 9. A multi-instituted prospective double-blinded clinical trial in normal tension glaucoma patients revealed that the rate of MD deterioration under monotherapy with either topical nipradilol or timolol was around -0.05 dB/year, thought to be considerably slower than -0.25 dB/year, the commonly estimated rate of MD deterioration by pressure-independent damaging factors. The current results indicate the possibility of treatment of pressure-independent damaging factors of open-angle glaucoma in Japanese open-angle glaucoma patients with oral nilvadipine and topical anti-glaucoma agents."

We have considered reopened angles on 360 degrees after a crisis of closed angle; eyes with a positive ""neosynephrine - pilocarpine"" test; the second eye of a primary closed angle glaucoma and primary mixed glaucoma. Sixty affected eyes have been divided in two groups in a randomized study. Group A: Thirty eyes requiring a bilateral surgical peripheral iridectomy, Group B: Thirty eyes requiring a bilateral Argon laser iridotomy. The patients are regularly followed at intervals of: one week, three months, six months, one year and two years. Four parameters have been researched: 1. Intraocular pressure between 9 h-12 h a.m. Intraocular pressures lower or equal to 22 mmHg were considered to be successes. 2. Far visual acuity with correct lenses. 3. Opacity of the crystalline lenses: normal or sclerosed (0, +/-, +) cataract (++, ). 4. Post-operative complications. Some cases have required several periods of Argon laser photocoagulation (colorless iris, older patients) but we prefer a proper result immediately in order not to take any risks with pupillary blocking-up. The statistical analysis gives the following results: Same tonometric results according to the different technics even if the treatment has been prophylactic (positive provocation test; second eye) or curative (primary closed-angle glaucoma with solvable crisis; mixed glaucoma).

CD012223,0,16919396,0,Focus on triamcinolone acetonide as an adjunct to glaucoma filtration surgery.,"Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Despite continued advances in medical and laser therapy, incisional surgery still appears to be an important and for many cases the only option by which intraocular pressure is controlled. Unlike many other types of surgery in which complete healing of tissue would be a desirable outcome, glaucoma surgery seeks to achieve incomplete healing to allow aqueous humor to escape the eye. Pharmacologic modulation of wound healing is a hot topic in glaucoma filtration surgery. Although routine antifibrotic medications are associated with good results in modulating wound healing in glaucoma surgery, they carry with them the possibility for significant morbidity due to the adverse effects of treatment. Challenge continues to be to find a safe and effective agent for this purpose. Because of beneficial effects of triamcinolone acetonide in some conditions which are associated with secondary glaucoma and also potential effects of this agent in modulating wound healing process, we propose it as a useful adjunct to glaucoma filtration surgery. This approach may allow modulation of wound healing with less of the toxicity associated with commonly used antifibrotics (5-FU and mitomycin C)."

CD012223,0,8499355,0,Double-blind corticosteroid trial in identical twins following photorefractive keratectomy.,"The use of topical corticosteroids following excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is widespread, but the role of corticosteroids remains poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of different corticosteroid postoperative regimens following 193-nanometer excimer PRK in identical twins. Preoperatively, cycloplegic refraction of the left eye of each twin measured -3.00 D sphere. The full correction was treated utilizing the identical technique within the same 30 minute period. The study was conducted in a double-blind fashion and the refraction, corneal clarity, uncorrected and best spectacle corrected visual acuity, and keratometry were assessed over the 6-month study period. Both twins were placed on an identical regimen, tapering their drops over a 3-month period. Corneal clarity was remarkably well preserved with essentially clear corneas observed in both twins. Similarly, both twins achieved 20/15 vision with a cycloplegic refraction of +0.75 D at 6 months. The only difference in the healing pattern was the slightly more rapid visual recovery in twin A. The code was revealed upon the cessation of corticosteroid regimen. Twin A had received fluoromethalone 0.1% and Twin B received dexamethasone 0.1%. Keratometry demonstrated identical flattening. There were no corticosteroid induced intraocular pressure rise or other complications noted. Identical twins presented a unique opportunity to better understand wound healing following laser keratectomy. The results of this limited study indicated that for at least lower degrees of myopia the need for full strength topical corticosteroids remains questionable."
CD012223,0,19266465,0,[Diabetic eye disease].,"Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of blindness among the working population in the industrial world. The individual risk can be significantly reduced by early blood glucose control and treatment of vascular risk factors. Ophthalmologic screening visits in diabetics even without visual symptoms are necessary to ensure early treatment. Once visual function is impairmed, it is often irreversible. Ophthalmologic treatment is indicated when neovascularizations develop, carrying the risk of vitreous hemorrhage and tractive retinal detachment. Panretinal photocoagulation improves the balance of retinal oxygen demand and supply and therefore reduces the neovascular stimulus. In case of diabetic macular edema, focal retinal photocoagulation or intravitreal drug injections can be performed to stabilize capillary permeability in order to preserve vision. In advanced cases, the decision for surgical treatment via pars-plana-vitrectomy has to be evaluated individually."

CD012223,0,18264628,0,Update on the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.,"Retinopathy is the most feared complication of diabetes, compromising quality of life in most sufferers. Almost all patients with type 1 diabetes will develop retinopathy over a 15- to 20-year period, and approximately 20-30% will advance to the blinding stage of the disease[1]. Greater than 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes will have retinopathy. This situation is highlighted by the frightening statistic that diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the most common cause of vision impairment in people of working age in Western society. With the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes, this predicament is set to worsen as over 360 million people are projected to suffer from diabetes and its complications by 2030. Vision loss from diabetes is due to a number of factors, including haemorrhage from new and poorly formed blood vessels, retinal detachment due to contraction of deposited fibrous tissue, and neovascular glaucoma resulting in an increase in intraocular pressure. Diabetic macular oedema is now the principal cause of vision loss in diabetes and involves leakage from a disrupted blood-retinal barrier. In terms of treatment, there is clear evidence that strict metabolic and blood pressure control can lower the risk of developing DR and reduce disease progression. Laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy are effective in preventing severe vision loss in DR, particularly in the most advanced stages of the disease. However, both procedures have limitations. This review examines evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that shows that targeting inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, vascular endothelial growth factor, corticosteroids, protein kinase C, growth hormone, and advanced glycation end-products are potential treatments for DR."

CD012223,0,18046281,0,[Glaucoma in the over-eighties].,"Due to the recent rapid increase in the aging population, glaucoma in the over-eighties population will become a significant problem of ocular health in the coming decades. It is important to determine the natural effects of aging on the optic nerve head and aqueous humor dynamics in these patients for early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma. Its characteristics, context, management, and treatment are very perceptibly different from those of the younger glaucomatous patient. For many reasons, such as its frequent association with macular age-related degeneration, diagnosis of glaucoma in the over-eighties may be difficult. Management of the over-eighties glaucoma is frequently difficult and time-consuming. Less aggressive than in a younger patient and based on topical medications in most cases, it must be discussed case by case and will be based on the general context, the quality of compliance, and especially on the potential consequences of the glaucomatous visual-field defects on the patient's quality of life. In any case, overtreatment as well as treatments that are too complex must be avoided. Given the reduced metabolism in the very elderly, the safest medications must also be selected. It is important to always consider glaucoma medications as part of the patient's medicine regimen. Associated risk factors, especially concomitant systemic hypotension, will be simultaneously treated. Laser trabeculoplasties probably have broader indications than in younger patients. Except for phacoextraction, which is very frequently helpful in controlling IOP, incisional filtering procedures or laser diode cyclophotocoagulations remain infrequently indicated in over-eighties glaucoma patients."

Postoperative IOP elevations of 5 mm Hg or more occurred in 13% of the apraclonidine recipients and in 59% of the nonrecipients; elevations of 10 mm Hg or more occurred in 4% of the former and in 27% of the latter. Our results suggest that apraclonidine can be a useful adjunct in preventing IOP elevations following YPC in glaucoma patients."

Fifty eyes had undergone a peripheral iridectomy, incisional or laser; 64 had been treated medically, without surgery. The two groups were not strictly comparable. (It is assumed but not proven that, since iridectomy was considered necessary in one group and not in the other, the surgically-treated patients were more seriously diseased.) Comparing clinical data obtained at the first visit with data obtained at the last visit, the eyes receiving iridectomies, as compared with those receiving medical treatment alone, showed a greater number of improved anterior chamber configurations (74% vs 28%), had a lower incidence of peripheral anterior synechiae (2% vs 10%), and required fewer glaucoma medications (30% fewer vs 10% fewer). The percentage of eyes with increased intraocular pressure was similar in both groups (36% vs 28%), as was the percentage of those with decreased visual field (17% vs 21%) and decreased visual acuity (66% vs 60%).

We reviewed the literature for evidence of outcomes disparities between Black and White populations after trabeculectomy, Ex-PRESS shunt, viscocanalostomy, canaloplasy, tube shunt, laser trabeculoplasty, and cyclophotocoagulation. There are reports of decreased surgical success in Black patients after trabeculectomy, Ex-PRESS shunt, tube-shunt, and canaloplasty. At this time, there is no strong evidence that any procedure is more effective for intraocular pressure control than standard trabeculectomy for Black patients. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to recommend any particular secondary intervention over another, despite differences in inflammation and bleb-dependence. There is a need for randomized, controlled trials to assess race as a risk factor for failure after non-penetrating filtration surgery (NPFS). There is also a need for data on the efficacy of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) in Black populations."

Normalized blur (NB), a quantitative index of blood flow velocity, was measured every 0.125 sec and averaged over 5 pulses in the temporal site of ONH free of surface vessels and in the middle site of the choroid-retina between ONH and macula. Intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate (PR) were also measured. On the first day, NB, IOP, BP, and PR were measured before and every 90 minutes for 6 hours after a 30 microliters instillation of placebo in both eyes (control eyes). The measured values were used as controls. On the other day one week later, a 30 microliters instillation of unoprostone was performed in one randomly chosen eye and the placebo in the other eye (treated and untreated eye). The above parameters were measured as the first day in a double masked manner. In the control experiment, no significant change occurred in any parameter. After topical application of unoprostone, NB in ONH showed no significant change. NB in the choroid-retina significantly increased at 3 (8%) and 4.5 (11%) hours in the treated eyes compared with the control eyes. After topical application of unoprostone, the IOP significantly decreased at 1.5 and 4.5 hours in the treated eyes compared with the control eyes. BP and PR showed no significant change. These results suggest that instillation of unoprostone can increase blood flow in the choroidretna in human eyes."
CD012223,0,18646165,0,Laser peripheral iridoplasty for angle-closure.,"Angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Treatment is aimed at opening the anterior chamber angle and lowering the IOP with medical and/or surgical treatment (e.g. trabeculectomy, lens extraction). Laser iridotomy works by eliminating pupillary block and widens the anterior chamber angle in the majority of patients. When laser iridotomy fails to open the anterior chamber angle, laser iridoplasty may be recommended as one of the options in current standard treatment for angle-closure. Laser peripheral iridoplasty works by shrinking and pulling the peripheral iris tissue away from the trabecular meshwork. Laser peripheral iridoplasty can be used for crisis of acute angle-closure and also in non-acute situations."
CD012223,0,21605352,0,The effectiveness of early lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma (EAGLE): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. Although primary open-angle glaucoma is more common, primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is more likely to result in irreversible blindness. By 2020, 5·3 million people worldwide will be blind because of PACG. The current standard care for PACG is a stepped approach of a combination of laser iridotomy surgery (to open the drainage angle) and medical treatment (to reduce intraocular pressure). If these treatments fail, glaucoma surgery (eg, trabeculectomy) is indicated. It has been proposed that, because the lens of the eye plays a major role in the mechanisms leading to PACG, early clear lens extraction will improve glaucoma control by opening the drainage angle. This procedure might reduce the need for drugs and glaucoma surgery, maintain good visual acuity, and improve quality of life compared with standard care.EAGLE aims to evaluate whether early lens extraction improves patient-reported, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care."

CD012223,0,7906539,0,Influence of apraclonidine and pilocarpine alone and in combination on post laser trabeculoplasty pressure rise.,"Apraclonidine and pilocarpine have been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of intraocular pressure (IOP) spikes following argon laser trabeculoplasty. An additional reduction in the incidence of acute pressure rise might theoretically be expected by combining these two effective agents. In a prospective randomised study we compared the ability of apraclonidine and pilocarpine alone and in combination to prevent post laser pressure spikes. Patients receiving regular pilocarpine to either eye were excluded. Seventy five eyes received either apraclonidine (26 eyes), pilocarpine (23 eyes), or both drugs (26 eyes). Apraclonidine 1% was instilled 1 hour before and immediately after, and pilocarpine 4% immediately after trabeculoplasty. IOP was measured before and at 1, 2, and 3 hours following trabeculoplasty. In only two (8%) eyes receiving combined treatment was a pressure rise observed. This frequency was significantly lower than that seen in eyes treated with apraclonidine alone (38%), or pilocarpine alone (39%). The mean fall in IOP at 1, 2, and 3 hours was significantly greater in those eyes receiving combined treatment than in the other two groups."
CD012223,0,7940142,0,Studies of the ocular pulse in primates.,"Ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured in groups of human subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), ocular hypertension (OHT), low-tension glaucoma (LTG), retinal degenerations (RD), in OHT volunteers treated with single doses of 2% epinephrine, 4% pilocarpine, 0.5% timolol or 1% p-amino-clonidine, and in normal subjects before and after exercise. Compared to normal controls, OHT subjects showed significantly higher IOP and OPA, while OPA was significantly lower in ocular normotensive LTG and RD subjects groups. All drug treatments lowered IOP in OHT subjects, but did not change OPA significantly. Exercise in normal volunteers increased calculated ocular perfusion pressure by 22.5%, lowered IOP by 32%, but showed no significant change in OPA. When IOP was elevated > or = 5 mmHg in lasered monkey eyes peak pulse volume (PPV) was increased significantly in the unlasered eyes. Epinephrine 2% or 1% p-aminoclonidine lowered IOP moderately with no change in PPV, while treatment with 4% pilocarpine or 0.5% timolol reduced IOP and increased PPV significantly. The findings suggest that LTG may be associated with an ocular vascular abnormality. OPA in OHT or normal human subjects did not change when IOP was decreased by antiglaucoma drug treatments or exercise, respectively. These results indicate that OPA may be physiologically autoregulated in human subjects with IOPs in the 11-21 mmHg range. However, laser-induced glaucomatous monkey eyes with higher IOP (30-35 mmHg) did not autoregulate, but showed a low peak pulse volume, which increased when IOP was reduced 5 mmHg or more by means of antiglaucoma drug treatment."

CD012223,0,9176895,0,Trabecular meshwork phagocytosis in glaucomatous eyes.,"Trabecular meshwork cells are actively phagocytic and may function to keep the drainage pathways free of cellular debris, pigment and other material. A decrease in phagocytic capacity has been proposed in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. This study was performed to compare the phagocytic capability of the human trabecular meshwork in glaucomatous and normal human eyes. The anterior segments of 6 donors with glaucoma (primary open-angle glaucoma, POAG: 5 donors; pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, PEX: 1 donor) and 6 normal donors were placed in perfusion organ culture. During the final 24 h of culture, latex microspheres, labeled with FITC and coated with antibodies, were perfused into the anterior segments. Eyes were then fixed, the trabecular meshworks were treated with a rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody, sectioned and the number of ingested beads determined with the laser scanning confocal microscope. Nuclei were quantitated and used to calculate the phagocytic index of each eye (number of ingested beads/number of nuclei). Anterior segments of glaucomatous donors were cultured for 1-3 days, as a preliminary culture study had revealed that culture of glaucomatous anterior segments is successful in only 50% when cultured for 21 days. Specimens of normal donors were cultured for 21 days. Ingested beads appeared green and could be differentiated from noningested beads, which appeared red, using appropriate wavelengths of the laser. Bead ingestion was confirmed with electron microscopy and the use of a secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Ingestion rates appeared similar among all three groups of eyes: POAG, 3.8 beads/cell; PEX, 3.3 beads/cell; normal, 3.5 beads/ cell. No evidence of significant migration or loss of trabecular cells was noted. Cell counts were not significantly different: POAG, 127 +/- 40 cells/section; normals, 136 +/- 49 cells/section. In conclusion, the phagocytic ability of the trabecular meshwork appears similar between eyes with POAG and normal eyes in perfusion organ culture. Cell loss after phagocytosis was not observed in these single-exposure experiments."

CD012223,0,3582103,0,Prevention of IOP-rise following Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy with pre-operative timolol eye-drops and 1 tablet acetazolamide 250 mg systematically.,"Short-term observation following Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy indicates that serious elevation of intra-ocular pressure may occur, unrelated to the amount of energy used. In this study the IOP in 3 groups of 10 pseudophakic patients undergoing Nd-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was measured before capsulotomy and 2 and 4 hours afterwards, using the fellow-eye as control. The first group received no medication, the second received timolol 1/2% eyedrops preoperatively, the third group a combination of timolol 1/2% and 1 tablet of acetazolamide 250 mg systemically. Pretreatment with timolol 0.5% minimizes IOP-rise but does not give complete protection. The combination of timolol 0.5% with 1 tablet of acetazolamide 250 mg proves to be a safe procedure for the prevention of IOP-rise after YAG laser capsulotomy. To prevent other complications it is advisable to make a small capsulotomy of 2-3 mm diameter using as little energy as possible. Also a defocussing system in the laser is a great advantage. Indomethacin drops during a period of 6 weeks after Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy should prevent cystoid macular edema."

CD012223,0,10362745,0,Acetazolamide-induced cerebral and ocular vasodilation in humans is independent of nitric oxide.,"Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is used orally in the treatment of primary and secondary open-angle glaucoma and induces ocular and cerebral vasodilation. Several in vitro studies have shown that carbonic anhydrase pharmacology and the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway are closely related. We investigated the role of NO in acetazolamide-induced vasodilation on cerebral and ocular vessels in 12 healthy subjects in the presence or absence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a NO synthase inhibitor, and in the presence or absence of L-arginine, the precursor of NO. Acetazolamide was administered after pretreatment with either L-NMMA or placebo and either L-arginine or placebo. Pulsatile choroidal blood flow was assessed with laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation. In addition, mean blood flow velocity (MFV) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and ophthalmic artery (OA) was measured with Doppler sonography. Acetazolamide increased ocular fundus pulsation amplitude (FPA; +27%, P < 0.001) and MFV in the MCA (+38%, P < 0.001) and in the OA (+19%, P = 0.003). Administration of L-NMMA alone reduced FPA (-21%, P < 0.001) and MFV in the MCA (-11%, P = 0. 030) but did not change MFV in the OA. All hemodynamic effects of L-NMMA were reversed by L-arginine. However, neither L-NMMA nor L-arginine altered acetazolamide-induced changes in cerebral or ocular hemodynamic parameters. The present data indicate that acetazolamide-induced hemodynamic changes are not mediated by NO. Which mediators other than NO are involved in the hemodynamic effects as induced by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors remains to be elucidated."

Long-term effects on optic nerve head.,"In a prospective, randomized study on primary argon laser trabeculoplasty vs piloparpine in 82 newly detected open-angle glaucomas the progress of optic nerve head damage is presented. In 70 patients reliable stereo photographs could be analysed. In the laser treated group a progression of glaucoma damage after 24 months was seen in 6/37 eyes (16%) and in the pilocarpine-treated group 16/33 (49%) (p = 0.0048). There was a statistically significant favourable outcome if intraocular pressure was regulated in terms of peak and range of pressure, but not average pressure. This was even more pronounced in capsular glaucoma, but not significant for simple glaucoma. Pilocarpine increased the risk for further damage to the optic nerve head 6.4 times compared to laser trabeculoplasty. Thus, laser is recommended as the primary therapy in high tension glaucoma, especially in capsular glaucoma."

CD012223,0,22920012,0,Eye drops preservative as the cause of corneal band keratopathy in long-term pilocarpine hydrochloride treatment.,"The aim is to present a patient with severe bilateral corneal complications after long-term antiglaucoma treatment with 1% pilocarpine hydrochloride (Pilokarpin, Pliva, Zagreb, Croatia) and its management. A patient with narrow-angle glaucoma treated with 1% topical pilocarpine hydrochloride eye drops for the last twenty years complained of impaired vision, intermittent visual haloes and eye redness. Ophthalmologic examination showed bilateral band keratopathy, peripheral laser iridotomy, medicamentous myosis, brown nuclear cataract, and synchysis scintillans of his right eye. Band keratopathy was thought to have resulted from the presence of the preservative phenylmercuric nitrate in the pilocarpine hydrochloride eye drops. Treatment of the patient consisted of two separate procedures for both eyes, i.e. phaco trabeculectomy and six months later corneal procedure including abrasion of corneal epithelium followed by removal of the superficial stromal calcium deposits by means of a 3.75% ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) solution. After phaco trabeculectomy, visual acuity was 0.8 on both eyes. Bilateral visual improvement with visual acuity 1.0 was recorded after corneal treatment with EDTA. In conclusion, one must be aware of preservative complications in long-term topical use, such as band keratopathy that can be visually incapacitating. Surgical treatment using EDTA is safe and effective treatment for band keratopathy."

CD012223,0,26559142,0,Statistical analysis plan for the Laser-1st versus Drops-1st for Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension Trial (LiGHT): a multi-centre randomised controlled trial.,The LiGHT trial (Laser-1st versus Drops-1st for Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension Trial) is a multicentre randomised controlled trial of two treatment pathways for patients who are newly diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). The main hypothesis for the trial is that lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) with selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) as the primary treatment ('Laser-1st') leads to a better health-related quality of life than for those started on IOP-lowering drops as their primary treatment ('Medicine-1st') and that this is associated with reduced costs and improved tolerability of treatment.

The study comprised 38 patients divided into two groups. Healon and balanced salt solution (BSS) were randomly applied and the patients were age-matched. The emulsification was done in the anterior chamber. Healon is shown to have a protective effect on the cornea as judged by corneal thickness measurements and by endothelial cell counts. Healon facilitated the procedure in several ways. In this study no attempt was made to remove Healon from anterior chamber at the end of surgery. It cannot be excluded that Healon may occasionally cause increased intraocular pressure. With regard to postoperative inflammatory reaction and wound healing, no side effects have been observed after use of Healon."

The mean age of the subjects at the time of diagnosis was 34.0 years and at the time of the study 44.1 years. The follow-up time ranged from 2 to 30 years with a mean follow-up time of 10.1 years. At the time of the study eighty-nine percent of the eyes had normal vision (0.7 or better), 3% slight impairment of vision (0.6-0.3), 5% low vision (0.2-0.05) and 3% were blind. Visual field defects were mild in 78%, moderate in 13% and severe in 8% of the eyes. One eye (1%) had normal fields. In 8 patients the stage of the field defects was asymmetrical between the two eyes. All were able to read at least monocularly with glasses. No one was blind, retired early or professionally limited because of pigmentary glaucoma. Thirty-nine eyes were on topical treatment. Fifteen eyes had additionally been treated with laser trabeculoplasty when the glaucoma could not be stabilized with topical treatment combined with systemic acetazolamide. Further twenty eyes had undergone trabeculectomy, 18 of them when medical treatment had failed and 2 following LTP. The non-involved eye of a patient suffering from a monocular disease was without treatment. The mean intraocular pressure at the time of the diagnosis was 33.5 mmHg (SD 10.4 mmHg) and at the final visit 17.5 mmHg (SD 3.4 mmHg).

Aqueous humor proteome was analyzed by antibody microarray. The expression of tested proteins was detected by protein Cy3/Cy5 labeling, column purification and hybridization on antibody-spotted glass microarray. Fluorescent signals were detected by fluorescence laser scanning. Aqueous humor levels of SOD as well as of GST were significantly lower (2.0- and 2.2-fold, p < 0.01) among patients than controls; both NOS and GS expression were significantly higher (2.2- and 2.6 fold, p < 0.01) among patients than controls. Our data showed substantial differences of GS, NOS2, SOD and GST aqueous humor levels between glaucomatous patients and controls as measured by antibody microarray technology. The overproduction of NO through inducible NOS can form toxic products and change the metabolic conditions of the TM. The GS over-expression might be related to neuronal injury or to the potential role of glutamate as a modulator in the ciliary body signaling. The reduced expression of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and GST could aggravate the unbalance between both oxygen- and nitrogen-derived free radicals production and detoxification. Based on our results, GS, NOS2, SOD and GST as measured by antibody microarray technology may be useful oxidative markers in aqueous humor of glaucomatous patients."

In a masked randomised fashion, one eye of each subject received betaxolol and the fellow eye received placebo (hypromellose). Retinal blood flow (RBF) was determined in a major temporal vein of each eye just prior to instillation of drops and 2 h later, using laser Doppler velocimetry and monochromatic fundus photography. There was an increase of 15.0% in RBF (p = 0.03) in the betaxolol-treated eyes. No significant change was observed in the placebo-treated eyes. Intraocular pressure was reduced by 27.7% in the treated eyes, resulting in an increase of 16.9% in perfusion pressure (p = 0.02) compared with an 8.4% increase in placebo-treated eyes (p = 0.15). This study demonstrated that betaxolol increases RBF in eyes with ocular hypertension; this increase is probably related to the increase in perfusion pressure."
CD012223,0,26099427,0,[Ocular hypertension after intravitreal steroid injections: Clinical update as of 2015].,"Intravitreal injections are a therapeutic delivery method best suited to the treatment of retinal diseases. Recent years have been marked by the use of anti-VEGF agents as well as the arrival of sustained-release corticosteroid implants in France, replacing triamcinolone acetonide. A common complication of IVT steroids is secondary ocular hypertension (OHT) resulting from increased outflow resistance. This article summarizes current understanding. OHT induced by topical steroids has been described for 60 years. Intravitreal use also shows a temporary effect if the exposure is short, dose dependence, and varying incidence depending on the drug used. Sustained release formulations and discontinuing treatment have reduced the risk of induced OHT. Risk factors that induce OHT must be clearly identified prior to an injection. Most cases of OHT can be controlled medically, although differences exist between different drugs. In cases where it cannot be controlled, removal of the implant, selective laser trabeculoplasty, and filtration surgery can be discussed."

This prospective cohort study recruited NTG patients taking antiglaucoma medication. Subjects were excluded if they had previous glaucoma surgery/laser or corneal pathologies. All subjects underwent a 1-month washout. A single session of SLT was performed to 360° of the trabecular meshwork. Medication was resumed at 1 month to achieve a targeted 30% intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction from the post-washout/pre-SLT IOP. IOP was measured every 3 months and medication use was recorded at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Subjects with a secondary SLT or cataract extraction were excluded from IOP and medication analyses. At 24 months, 34 of the initial 45 right eyes were eligible for analyses. There were significant IOP reductions at all time intervals (except at 1 week) following SLT when compared to the prestudy (without medication) or pre-SLT (post-washout) IOP (P < 0.0001). Medications were likewise significantly reduced at all time intervals following SLT (P < 0.0001). At 24 months, the IOP was 11.5% lower than the prestudy IOP, 22.0% lower than the pre-SLT IOP, and medication use was reduced by 41.1% (P < 0.0001). Six out of 45 eyes (13.3%) required a secondary SLT. Absolute success (IOP reduction >20% from pre-SLT, without medication) was achieved in 11.1% (5/45).

This randomized double-blind study comprised 34 consecutive patients with open-angle glaucoma, already treated with either timolol alone or in combination with other antiglaucoma agents. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either betaxolol (n = 17) or timolol (n = 17) instead of the present timolol drops. Additional antiglaucoma therapy remained unchanged. The retinal blood flow was assessed by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry and the pulsatile choroidal blood flow was assessed by laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude. Ocular blood flow measurement as well as systemic hemodynamic and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed at baseline and 1 week and 1 and 3 months after the therapy change. Visual field testing was performed at baseline and at 3 months. After 3 months of treatment with either timolol or betaxolol, neither the retinal nor the pulsatile choroidal blood flow were significantly altered. The power to detect a 9% change in pulsatile choroidal blood flow and a 20% change in retinal blood flow in the present study was 90%. The IOP was not significantly altered in either group. In contrast, visual fields slightly improved after betaxolol treatment compared to baseline (p = 0.047), but this effect was not significant versus timolol. Changing therapy from timolol to betaxolol has no effect on ocular blood flow in patients with open-angle glaucoma."

One treatment modality is aimed at reduction of intraocular pressure, the other at therapy of hemodynamic and metabolic disorders. General and local drug therapy and physiotherapy, including electro- and laser stimulation of the retina and optic nerve and magneto-therapy, are used to correct these disorders. Modern ocular hypotensive agents are myotics and beta-adrenoblockers, adrenergic drugs, alpha 2-agonists, carboanhydrase inhibitors, some prostaglandins, osmotic agents. The author emphasizes that drugs should be selected individually and regularly replaced in order to prevent the development of the habituation phenomenon and the negative side effects. The progress attained in conservative therapy of glaucoma should by no means be overstated. In many cases only a combination of conservative and surgical methods of treatment helps preserve vision in a glaucoma patient."

CD012223,0,8336889,0,Hypotony maculopathy following the use of topical mitomycin C in glaucoma filtration surgery.,"Intraoperative mitomycin C has been shown to be highly effective in increasing the success rate of glaucoma filtration surgery. Between October 1991 and June 1992, 169 eyes of 156 patients underwent filtration procedures with intraoperative mitomycin C. In the postoperative period, five eyes (2.9%) developed hypotony maculopathy, characterized by disc edema, vascular tortuosity, and chorioretinal folds in the macular area. Cryotherapy was applied to three eyes, and was effective in reversing the hypotony in two of them. However, the visual prognosis was poor: after a mean follow up of 5.3 months (range, 3.5 to 8 months), visual acuity returned to preoperative levels in one case. Hypotony maculopathy may develop after glaucoma filtration surgery with intraoperative mitomycin C. We suggest restricting the indication of its adjunctive use to eyes with poor surgical prognosis or those in which a very low intraocular pressure is desired. The use of extra sutures (which can be sectioned by laser) or releasable sutures to prevent excessive filtration in the postoperative period also is advisable."

There were 24 patients (32 eyes) in the laser group and 26 patients (34 eyes) in the needle group. There were not significant differences in sex, age, pre-operative visual acuity and intraocular pressure, and classification of cataract between the two groups. The results show that patients in the laser group have better post-operative visual acuity. The reason is YAG laser capsulotomy lessens the entering of anterior chamber by instruments. The stress on the periphery retina is reduced. The lens cortex is more readily aspirated. In turn, post-operative complications are avoided."

CD012223,0,11944846,0,Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) for optic nerve head drusen.,"Optic nerve head drusen (ONHD) are either clinically invisible or clearly protruding from the disc, in the later case leading to the condition of an irregular, indistinct disc margin or a swollen disc on biomicroscopy. They also may cause visual field defects, even with slow progression. Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) has been proposed as a rapid, objective and reproducible technology for retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) assessment and clinical studies have demonstrated that SLP can help to distinguish between normal and glaucomatous eyes, identify glaucoma suspects and correlates well with visual field defects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential applicability of SLP in 20 consecutive patients with optic nerve head drusen (18 bilateral) that were clinically visible (22 eyes) and invisible (16 eyes). RNFL thickness was studied in patients with and without visual field defects. Patients with visual field defects and ONHD were significantly older and had a small, but significant reduction of visual acuity. Some global SLP parameters (average thickness, ellipse average) were significantly different between subjects with normal and abnormal visual fields. The comparison of the groups with visible and invisible drusen showed that there was no difference in demographic or perimetric data. RNFL thickness measurements were also very similar in both groups. Clinical visibility of drusen was not correlated with RNFL thinning as measured with the GDxTM. SLP assessment, however, was well correlated with functional loss. This objective, non-invasive technology may be an additional option for RNFL evaluation in this condition and an especially useful tool for long-term follow-up."

Increased risk factors for idiopathic open-angle glaucoma include advancing age, black race, a family history of glaucoma, and increased intraocular pressure. The primary-care physician is in the prominent position of recognizing patients with increased risk factors or suspicious eye findings who should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Topically applied ophthalmic medications have systemic side effects that must be recognized and monitored by the primary-care physician.

Accordingly, there is a great need for preventing the often visually devastating outcomes of NVG. The STRONG study is designed to test whether the topically active anti-angiogenic agent aganirsen is able to inhibit the formation of neovascularisation leading to the development of secondary NVG in eyes with iCRVO. At the same time, STRONG will provide important information on the natural course of iCRVO and NVG in a large and well-characterised cohort of such patients."

CD012223,0,4056314,0,[Argon laser trabeculoretraction in chronic open-angle glaucoma. Personal results based on 100 eyes].,"Argon laser trabeculoplasty (or trabeculoretraction) was used following WISE's technique in 100 cases of open angle glaucoma. The patients, all of different ages, presented with various forms of open angle glaucoma. In some cases, the intraocular pressure had not been normalized by the medical treatment, and in some others, the patients showed drug intolerance. We eliminated the patients whose angle was too narrow to allow photocoagulation. They were examined at regular intervals of 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after therapy. Pressure figures only were considered in the therapeutic follow-up. After 12 months, the mean pressure drop was 7.3 mmHg after 180 degrees trabeculoplasty and 11.43 mmHg after 360 degrees trabeculoplasty, the latter consequently entailing a more considerable drop. Older subjects however showed a greater pressure decrease. We obtained less satisfactory results in cases of exfoliative syndrome glaucoma and pigmentary glaucoma. The important point is that pressure normalization was obtained--in most cases--only if the prior medical treatment was maintained either without any change or lightly reduced. The trabeculoplasty alone reduced ocular pressure in only 3.57% and in 9.09% respectively after 180 degrees and 360 degrees trabeculoplasty. We can therefore conclude from these observations that this technique is only an auxiliary method in open angle glaucomas that do not sufficiently respond to medical treatment."

CD012223,0,9283149,0,Circumferential profiles of peripapillary surface height with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy.,"The purpose of this study was to compare the circumferential profiles of relative peripapillary retinal surface height (RPSH) between normal and glaucoma, with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmology (CSLO), and to examine the ability of the mean height to distinguish glaucoma from normal. Fifty-three patients with open-angle glaucoma and forty-three normal subjects matched for age, race and refractive error were studied. To extract circumferential profiles, we developed software to quantify RPSH from images obtained with a CSLO (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), Heidelberg Engineering, Germany, Software: IR1-V1.11) outside the optic disc margin every 50 microns. Mean heights from circumferential profiles were calculated and compared between normal and glaucoma. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the mean height to discriminate normal from glaucoma subjects. T he average (+/- SD) visual field mean deviation in the glaucoma group was -4.8 +/- 3.4dB. The average height of each circumference increased from the disc margin to 250 microns away in both normal and glaucoma subjects. There were statistically significant differences for the mean height (P < 0.001) between the two groups. The largest difference between normal and glaucoma was found in the inferior sector compared with the other sectors (p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic precision of the mean height were 83%, 67% and 76%, respectively. The mean height from the circumferential profiles of RPSH can be used as a useful marker to identify early glaucoma."
CD012223,0,9237131,0,Holmium YAG laser sclerostomy ab externo for refractory glaucoma.,"Ab externo thermal sclerostomy was performed with the holmium YAG (thulium, holmium, chromium-doped YAG crystal) laser in 21 eyes of 20 patients with refractory glaucoma. We used either the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or mitomycin C (MMC) antimetabolites in all cases. The rate of intraocular pressure (IOP) control defined as IOP < 21 mmHg regardless of whether antiglaucoma medication was applied postoperatively) was estimated by the life-table methods of Kaplan-Meier. The postoperative IOP control rate was 47.1% in the MMC-treated group at 57 months, and 14.3% in the 5-FU-treated group at 52 months. There were statistically significant differences in success rates between the MMC- and 5-FU-treated groups. We observed no clinically significant complications except excess filtration associated with a shallow anterior chamber in one case. This procedure is thought to have several advantages over more conventional filtration surgery; the operation time is shorter, and there is no need for intraocular manipulation, which means conjunctival trauma is minimal. However, the IOP control rate was substantially lower than that achieved via conventional trabeculectomy. Our results suggest that the selection of patients and the use of MMC is an important factor in maintaining successful filtration."

CD012223,0,28427069,0,Practical Lessons from Protocol I for the Management of Diabetic Macular Edema.,"Protocol I, a multicenter randomized clinical trial, compared the visual outcomes of patients treated with 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab with either prompt or deferred (by 24 weeks laser), 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone with prompt laser, or sham injection with prompt laser for the treatment of center-involving diabetic macular edema (DME). A total of 854 adult patients with type I or II diabetes and any level of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or proliferative retinopathy with adequate panretinal photocoagulation, with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 78 to 24 ETDRS letters (Snellen equivalent of 20/32 to 20/320) and visual loss attributed to macular edema, or retinal thickening with central subfield thickness of at least 250 µm by OCT were enrolled. The main outcomes relevant for practicing clinicians are as follows. (1) Intravitreal ranibizumab treatment provides superior visual outcomes compared to conventional laser treatment. (2) Adjunctive laser treatment does not appear to provide substantial visual benefit compared to ranibizumab treatment alone, but may reduce the number of injections required to resolve DME. Deferral of laser is likely beneficial in patients with worse initial visual acuity. (3) Intravitreal triamcinolone provides similar visual outcomes compared to intravitreal ranibizumab in pseudophakic patients but is associated with a clinically important increased risk of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), need for glaucoma medications, and need for glaucoma surgery. (4) Delayed initiation of intravitreal ranibizumab therapy provides improved visual outcome among patients initially treated with conventional laser photocoagulation or triamcinolone, but the magnitude of the benefit is not as great as is observed when ranibizumab treatment is initiated promptly. (5) The number of ranibizumab injections required to achieve the desired visual outcome decreases substantially after the first year, with the majority of patients not requiring further treatment after 3 years. (6) Patients who do not have a rapid response to ranibizumab still display long-term benefit to continued therapy, although perhaps less than those with immediate improvement. (7) Intravitreal ranibizumab is not only effective in reducing retinal edema and improving BCVA among patients with DME, it is also a disease modifying therapy and induces improvement of the diabetic retinopathy severity score by 2 or more steps in approximately one third of patients. Triamcinolone injection also induces improvement in diabetic retinopathy severity in DME patients, but perhaps to a lesser degree. (8) No increased risk of systemic adverse events was observed among patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab compared to sham-injected controls or triamcinolone-treated patients, but the low frequency of adverse events, restrictive enrollment criteria, and specific posology employed in this study limit the generalization of this conclusion to patients routinely encountered in clinical practice. (9) There was no clinically important increased risk of major ocular complications among patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab (including the risk of glaucoma), although endophthalmitis is a potentially devastating outcome should it occur. In addition to the risk of endophthalmitis, intravitreal triamcinolone injection was associated with clinically important increased risk of cataract progression and increased IOP."

CD012223,0,7804105,0,Contact diode laser cyclo-photocoagulation for refractory glaucoma. A pilot study.,"Initial experience with non-contact diode cyclo-photocoagulation for refractory glaucoma has shown positive results. Diode laser irradiation applied via a contact probe results in greater transmission through the sclera and delivery of more energy to the ciliary body. A trial was performed to evaluate the effects of contact diode cyclo-photocoagulation. A total of 12 patients with glaucoma due to conditions such as central retinal vein occlusion were treated. A mean of 22 pulses (810 nm) with powers of up to 2 W and of 2 s duration were applied via a fibre-optic delivery system and a contact probe. The mean intra-ocular pressure dropped from 42.3 to 13.6 mmHg over 3 months. Four patients required retreatment. Three patients had side effects that included hyphaema, anterior fibrinous uveitis and pupil block. In conclusion, contact diode cyclo-photocoagulation had a significant ocular hypotensive action in the treatment of refractory glaucoma. As compared with non-contact diode cyclo-photocoagulation, the contact modality produced more marked non-therapeutic side effects."

Pre-existing glaucoma of varying severity was present in 139 eyes and no known ocular pathology other than cataract in 157 eyes. During the first eight weeks following surgery, intraocular pressure elevations greater than or equal to 15 mmHg above baseline were seen in 23% of glaucomatous eyes controlled before surgery with glaucoma medications, in 39% of glaucomatous eyes controlled before surgery with argon laser trabeculoplasty, and in only 3% of nonglaucomatous eyes. The implantation of a PC-IOL did not influence the incidence of postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations. Among glaucomatous eyes with severe preoperative visual field loss (split fixation or central island less than or equal to 10 degrees), 9.7% had worsening of visual field after surgery. Open angle glaucoma of unclear etiology developed in 1.4% of normal eyes following uncomplicated ECCE with PC-IOL implantation.

CD012223,0,26213460,0,Dexamethasone intravitreal implant in the treatment of diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) resembles a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction, and is characterized by blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown and retinal capillary leakage. Corticosteroids are of therapeutic benefit because of their anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and BRB-stabilizing properties. Delivery modes include periocular and intravitreal (via pars plana) injection. To offset the short intravitreal half-life of corticosteroid solutions (~3 hours) and the need for frequent intravitreal injections, sustained-release intravitreal corticosteroid implants have been developed. Dexamethasone intravitreal implant provides retinal drug delivery for ≤6 months and recently has been approved for use in the treatment of DME. Pooled findings (n=1,048) from two large-scale, randomized Phase III trials indicated that dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.35 mg and 0.7 mg) administered at ≥6-month intervals produced sustained improvements in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular edema. Significantly more patients showed a ≥15-letter gain in BCVA at 3 years with dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.35 mg and 0.7 mg than with sham injection (18.4% and 22.2% vs 12.0%). Anatomical assessments showed rapid and sustained reductions in macular edema and slowing of retinopathy progression. Phase II study findings suggest that dexamethasone intravitreal implant is effective in focal, cystoid, and diffuse DME, in vitrectomized eyes, and in combination with laser therapy. Ocular complications of dexamethasone intravitreal implant in Phase III trials included cataract-related events (66.0% in phakic patients), intraocular pressure elevation ≥25 mmHg (29.7%), conjunctival hemorrhage (23.5%), vitreous hemorrhage (10.0%), macular fibrosis (8.3%), conjunctival hyperemia (7.2%), eye pain (6.1%), vitreous detachment (5.8%), and dry eye (5.8%); injection-related complications (eg, retinal tear/detachment, vitreous loss, endophthalmitis) were infrequent (<2%). Dexamethasone intravitreal implant offers a viable treatment option for DME, especially in cases that are persistent or treatment (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor/laser) refractory."

CD012223,0,23103498,0,Role of endothelin-A receptors in optic nerve head red cell flux regulation during isometric exercise in healthy humans.,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is an important regulator of vascular tone in the eye. It appears to play a role in ocular disease because of its strong vasoconstrictor action, its role in intraocular pressure homeostasis, and its neurotoxic potential. We have previously shown that ET-1 is involved in choroidal red cell flux (RCF) regulation during isometric exercise in healthy humans. In the present study we hypothesized that ET-1 also plays a role in optic nerve head (ONH) RCF regulation during isometric exercise. To test this hypothesis, we performed a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study in 15 healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive intravenous infusions of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist BQ-123 and placebo on two different study days. During these infusion periods, subjects performed squatting for 6 min to increase ocular perfusion pressure (OPP). ONH RCF was assessed with laser-Doppler flowmetry, and OPP was calculated from mean arterial pressure and intraocular pressure. BQ-123 did not change OPP or ONH RCF at baseline. The relative increase in OPP during isometric exercise was comparable between both groups (between 84 and 88%, P = 0.76 between groups; P < 0.001 vs. baseline). Isometric exercise increased ONH RCF during placebo and BQ-123, but the increase was more pronounced when the endothelin type-A receptor antagonist was administered (placebo, 27.3 ± 5.4%; and BQ-123, 39.2 ± 4.4%; P = 0.007 between groups). The present data indicate that ET-1 regulates red cell flux in the ONH beyond the autoregulatory range."

CD012223,0,23596508,0,Alterations of choroidal blood flow regulation in young healthy subjects with complement factor H polymorphism.,"A common polymorphism in the complement factor H gene (rs1061170, Y402H) is associated with a high risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In the present study we hypothesized that healthy young subjects homozygous for the high-risk haplotype (CC) show abnormal choroidal blood flow (ChBF) regulation decades before potentially developing the disease. A total of 100 healthy young subjects were included in the present study, of which 4 subjects were excluded due to problems with genotyping or blood flow measurements. ChBF was measured continuously using laser Doppler flowmetry while the subjects performed isometric exercise (squatting) for 6 minutes. The increase in ChBF was less pronounced than the response in ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), indicating for some degree of choroidal blood flow regulation. Eighteen subjects were homozygous for C, 47 subjects were homozygous for T and 31 subjects were heterozygous (CT). The increase in OPP during isometric exercise was not different between groups. By contrast the increase in ChBF was more pronounced in subjects homozygous for the high risk C allele (p = 0.041). This was also evident from the pressure/flow relationship, where the increase in ChBF in homozygous C carriers started at lower OPPs as compared to the other groups. Our data indicate that the regulation of ChBF is abnormal in rs1061170 CC carriers. So far this polymorphism has been linked to age related macular degeneration (AMD) mainly via inflammatory pathways associated with the complement system dysfunction. Our results indicate that it could also be related to vascular factors that have been implicated in AMD pathogenesis."

Ranibizumab is injected into the vitreous in the same way as pegaptanib, the first VEGF antagonist to be approved for an ocular indication. (3) Clinical evaluation of ranibizumab includes 2 placebo-controlled trials (900 patients in total), a trial versus verteporfin (423 patients), and a trial testing ranibizumab in combination with verteporfin (162 patients). More than 90% of patients treated with ranibizumab in these two trials had no tangible loss of vision for one to two years, compared to about 68% of patients treated with verteporfin (statistically significant difference). These trials did not attempt to determine the optimal interval between intravitreal injections. (4) No trials have directly compared ranibizumab with pegaptanib; indirect comparisons suggest that ranibizumab is better than pegaptanib. (5) Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab can have local adverse effects, similar to pegaptanib. These include inflammatory reactions, infections, and elevated intraocular pressure. Arterial thromboses at distant sites, in particular strokes, have been reported with ranibizumab, at a higher frequency with 0.5 mg per infection (about 1%) than with 0.3 mg per injection. (6) When visual acuity continues to deteriorate in patients with age-related macular degeneration despite treatment with verteporfin, ranibizumab provides an effective alternative for patients with no particular risk factors for stroke."

CD012223,0,25708282,0,"Collagen cross-linking in keratoconus in Asian eyes: visual, refractive and confocal microscopy outcomes in a prospective randomized controlled trial.","To evaluate the safety and efficacy of collagen cross-linking (CXL) in the treatment of keratoconus. A prospective randomized sham-controlled clinical trial was undertaken and 43 eyes with moderate to severe keratoconus were randomized into two groups that is the treatment (n = 23) and the sham (n = 20) group. CXL was performed with riboflavin (0.1 in 20 % dextran) followed by UVA radiation (365 nm, 3 mW/cm(2), 30 min). In the sham group, only riboflavin was administered without UVA radiation. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity, intraocular pressure, corneal thickness, keratometry, endothelial count, confocal microscopy were evaluated at baseline and at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months. In cases where CXL was done, UDVA improved by mean 0.11 ± 0.06 logMAR units at 6 months (P = 0.01). The refractive cylinder and spherical equivalent decreased by mean of 0.62 D (P = 0.01) and 0.5 D (P = 0.19), respectively. Ultrasonic central corneal thickness decreased by mean 22.7 ± 10.3 μm (P = 0.01). The maximum and minimum keratometry decreased by mean of 1.2 ± 0.8 D (P = 0.01) and 0.83 ± 1.2 D (P = 0.39), respectively. The specular count and intraocular pressure did not show any significant change. In the sham group, no significant change was observed in any parameter. Confocal analysis showed that the epithelial healing was complete at 1 week after crosslinking. The sub-epithelial plexus showed loss of nerve plexus at 1 month, regeneration of nerve fibers which started at 3 months and was complete at 6 months. The anterior stroma showed loss of keratocytes with honeycomb oedema and apoptotic bodies till 3 months. The regeneration of keratocytes started at 3 months and was complete at 6 months of follow-up. Collagen cross-linking is an effective procedure to halt progression in keratoconus. The confocal microscopic changes correlate with the outcomes in the treatment and the sham groups."

CD012223,0,8944108,0,Effect of intraocular lens fixation on acute intraocular pressure rise after neodymium-YAG laser capsulotomy.,"Neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy is associated in some cases with an acute rise in the intraocular pressure (IOP), possibly caused by blockage of the trabecular meshwork by debris. To test the hypothesis that the IOP rise is preventable if fixation of the intraocular lens (IOL) in the capsular bag is ensured, we conducted a study comparing IOP changes at 1, 2, 3 and 24 hours after Nd:YAG capsulotomy between eyes with capsular bag-fixated, one haptic in the bag (haptic in/out) and cillary sulcus-fixated IOLs. Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed that after capsulotomy there were significant increases in IOP from baseline (p < 0.05) in both the sulcus-fixated (1, 2 and 3 hours) and haptic in/out groups (2 and 3 hours), while IOPs in the bag-fixated group did not show any significant increase. The increases in IOP in the sulcus-fixated group at 1, 2 and 3 hours after capsulotomy were significantly higher than the IOP changes at the corresponding periods in the other two groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.01). The mean maximum IOP rise in the sulcus-fixated group (11.33 +/- 7.85 mmHg) was significantly higher than that in the haptic in/out group (3.89 +/- 7.14 mmHg) and the bag-fixated group (1.10 +/- 2.71 mmHg), while there was no difference between the latter two groups. In 57.5% of the sulcus-fixated group, 5% of the haptic in/out group and none of the eyes of the bag-fixated group the IOP rise was more than 10 mmHg. A significantly larger proportion of sulcus-fixated eyes had anterior chamber cells and capsular debris after capsulotomy (chi 2 test, p < 0.001). In the haptic in/out group significant correlation (-0.56, p = 0.009) between IOP rise at 1 hour and the percentage enclosure of the IOL by the anterior capsule was demonstrated. There was no significant difference in maximum IOP rise between glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous eyes (Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.49)."
CD012223,0,6676979,0,Funduscopically controlled scotometry.,"The following is a brief summary of the results in our ten groups of cases. The positive features of laser scotometry are emphasized. The normal response is well defined: there are no uncertain blind spot margins. The peripheral field is probably extended beyond 60 degrees nasally and superiorly. The size and shape of the small central scotomas associated with macular holes are easily defined and correlated directly with the visible edge of the hole. This result is distinct from the intact subjective response with cystoid maculopathy and surface wrinkling retinopathy. Plotting the margins of peripheral abnormalities such as retinal detachments, retinoschisis, and lattice degeneration is easily done. Schisis is distinguished by an absolute scotoma. This scotometry is facilitated by a larger ""normal"" field with the laser instrument. Lattice degeneration causes a field defect. A branch retinal artery occlusion shows a slightly jagged border, difficult to detect by standard methods. A cotton-wool spot does not show a total nerve-fiber-bundle defect. Small absolute scotomas are correlated with degenerative changes within nevi. Degenerative changes over small melanomas--ie, the orange spots--also produce absolute field defects. ""Bear track"" lesions have a normal field, whereas dense black isolated lesions are associated with absolute scotomas. In macular degeneration the bright laser test object is usually visible to the patient within detachments of neuroepithelium, detachments of the pigment epithelium, and over recent subretinal neovascularization. Response is absent over sharply-defined zones of pigment atrophy and over late subretinal fibrovascular mounds. In contrast to the degenerative cases, a selection of hereditary cases showed no direct correlation between the zone of pigment atrophy and the zone of absolute scotoma. The scotoma was much larger than the atrophic region, extending to the edge of the cream-colored subretinal spots. The laser target method sharply defines the absolute scotoma associated with papilledema. It also detects a slit-like nerve-fiber-bundle defect, suggesting progressive damage. Small, but possibly not the earliest, scotomas associated with glaucoma can be detected with laser scotometry. In some cases they are detected when the Goldmann perimetric field is normal. Late residual visual fields are easily defined, since fixation can be directly monitored. The vertical border of hemianopic defects can be defined within one degree of accuracy."

CD012223,0,10651386,0,Chemotherapy for retinoblastoma: a current topic.,"Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular tumour in children, with an incidence of 1 in 15,000 live births. Treatment strategies for retinoblastoma have gradually evolved over the past few decades. There has been a trend away from enucleation (removal of the eye) and external beam radiation therapy toward focal 'conservative' treatments. Every effort has been made to save the child's life with preservation of eye and sight, if possible. Primary enucleation continues to be the commonly used method of treatment for retinoblastoma. It is employed in situations where eyes contain large tumours, long standing retinal detachments, neovascular glaucoma and suspicion of optic nerve invasion or extrascleral extension. Most of these eyes either have or are expected to have no useful vision. Radiation therapy continues to be an effective treatment option for retinoblastoma. However, external beam radiotherapy has unfortunately been associated with secondary non-ocular cancers in the field of radiation (primarily in children carrying the RB-1 germline mutation). Ophthalmic plaque brachytherapy has a more focal and shielded radiation field, and may carry less risk. Unfortunately, its applicability is limited to small to medium-sized retinoblastomas in accessible locations. Cryotherapy and transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) have been used to provide control of selected small tumours. TTT is an advanced laser system adapted to the indirect ophthalmoscope which provides flexible nonsurgical treatment for small retinoblastomas. Recent research in the treatment of retinoblastoma has concentrated on methods of combining chemotherapy with other local treatment modalities (TTT, radiotherapy, cryotherapy). This approach combines the principle of chemotherapeutic debulking in paediatric oncology with conservative focal therapies in ophthalmology. Termed chemoreduction, intravenous or subconjunctival chemotherapy is used to debulk the initial tumour volume and allow for local treatment with TTT, cryotherapy and plaque radiotherapy. Cyclosporin has been added to the chemotherapy regimen in several centres. Other clinical settings where chemotherapy is considered are situations where the histopathology suggests a high risk for metastatic disease and where there is extraocular extension. There is no consensus that chemotherapy is needed when choroidal invasion is observed on histopathology. However, in patients where the retinoblastoma is noted beyond the cut end of the optic nerve or if there is disruption of the sclera with microscopic invasion of the orbital tissue, treatment has been helpful. Systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy with local and cranial radiotherapy has improved the survival of these patients. Most recently, the use of new chemotherapy modalities with haematopoietic stem cell rescue or local radiotherapy has increased the survival of patients with distant metastasis. Nevertheless, the prognosis of patients with central nervous system involvement is still poor."
CD012223,0,6371649,0,Argon laser trabeculoplasty: comparison of bichromatic and monochromatic wavelengths.,"A randomized prospective study was undertaken to examine the effects of bichromatic argon laser therapy and monochromatic argon laser therapy when used for trabeculoplasty in chronic open angle glaucoma. Fifty patients underwent laser trabeculoplasty with the continuous wave argon laser emitting wavelengths of multiple lines (454.5 nm to 528.7 nm) in the bichromatic spectrum (blue and green). Fifty additional patients underwent laser trabeculoplasty using a continuous-wave argon laser emitting a monochromatic (green) wavelength at 514.5 nm. Patients treated with the bichromatic laser had an average decrease in their intraocular pressure of -7.1 +/- 5.2 mmHg and patients treated with the monochromatic laser had an average decrease of -8.0 +/- 6.2 mmHg. The length of the follow-up was 2 to 13 months with an average of 10 months. For each group, this decrease in intraocular pressure from the pretreatment values was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the decrease in the intraocular pressure between the two groups (P = 0.34). No differences were noted in the postoperative course or in the complication rate between the two groups."

Medical therapy, laser trabeculoplasty, and filtration surgery each have their advocates as the best modality for initial treatment. The advantages and disadvantages of these three options are discussed here. It is pointed out that there may not be a single answer as to how to begin treatment. Patient factors such as age, general health, and stage of glaucoma as well as various socioeconomic and technologic factors may lead to different recommendations for different patients. At present, most patients with open-angle glaucoma are started on medical therapy. beta-Blockers are used most commonly as the initial drug of choice, but latanoprost and brimonidine are now being recommended by many as alternate first-line therapy."
CD012223,0,8428674,0,Assessment of optic disc topography with scanning laser ophthalmoscope.,"Evaluation of the topography of the optic disc is of clinical importance to assess the degree of nerve damage. We conducted a study in 17 glaucomatous and 20 control subjects with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO; Rodenstock) and compared the results with those in conventional photographs. A tomographic image of the cup area in control subjects and the neuroretinal rim area in glaucomatous subjects obtained with the SLO was smaller than that in photographs taken with a conventional camera (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively). In both the control and glaucoma groups, the optic disc area obtained with the SLO was significantly smaller than that in conventional photographs (P < 0.01). The coefficient of variation of the optic disc parameters studied with the SLO range from 4.2% to 9.1%.

Prospective case-control study with 30 eyes of 30 patients randomly divided in two groups: 15 eyes in the LPI group and 15 eyes in the IOL group. Patients in the LPI group underwent LPI using argon and Nd:YAG laser. Patients in the IOL group underwent phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Examinations before and after the procedure included gonioscopy, Goldmann applanation tonometry, and anterior chamber evaluation using the Pentacam rotating Scheimpflug camera. The mean follow-up time was 31.13 ± 4.97 months. There was a statistically significant reduction in the intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of anti-glaucoma medications (p < 0.01) only in the IOL group. Anterior chamber depth, angle, and volume were all higher in the IOL group (p < 0.01) at the end of the follow-up period. Phacoemulsification with posterior chamber IOL implantation results in a higher anterior chamber depth, angle, and volume, when compared to LPI. Consequently, phacoemulsification has greater efficacy in lowering IOP and preventing its long-term increase in patients with CPAC and cataract."

A comparison of the OND calculated parameters obtained for 16 patients (31 eyes), both by the ""Rodenstock"" scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) and by HRT-II, revealed that the OND parameters calculation preformed by HRT-II was more informative, diversified and automated, which essentially cuts the procedure time. We examined, by HRT-II, a group of 31 patients (61 eyes), comprising patients with high pressure glaucoma (HPG), with suspected NPG and with moderate-pressure glaucoma (MPG) and a group of controls with moderate arterial hypertension. A comparison of OND areas' distributions of three groups (NPG group, MPG group and HPG group) showed that the majority of disks had an area ranging from 2.0 to 2.6 mm2 in the NPG, the same index ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 mm2 in the MPG group, and in the HPG group the disks were evenly distributed by area virtually in all ranks. The OND area was on the average less (2.13 mm2) in an impaired autoregulation versus the group without any symptoms of peripheral vasospasm (2.49 mm2). According to our findings, a higher OND size contributes to aggravating glaucoma at a lower intraocular pressure (IOP). It is noteworthy, that more pronounced changes are observed on the side with a bigger OND area in absence of any other risk factors, e.g. neuro-ophthalmic pathology or stenosis of the main cerebral arteries."

This study investigated whether glaucomatous changes of the deep retinal layer occur outside the parapapillary region. The nuclei of the retinal photoreceptors and RPE cells were counted in histologic slides of 23 eyes with painful secondary angle-closure glaucoma resulting from perforating corneal injuries. Fourteen eyes with malignant choroidal melanoma not involving the ciliary body or trabecular meshwork served as the control group. No surgical procedure, including laser treatment, had been performed posterior to the ora serrata. There were no hints of retinal vessel occlusion and localized traumatic retinopathy, historically, ophthalmoscopically, or histologically. Photoreceptor count was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the glaucoma eyes than in the control group. Count of RPE cells did not differ between the two groups. This may indicate that glaucoma can be associated with a loss of photoreceptors.

Some widely employed drugs such as vasodilators may be useless or even contra-indicated. Emphasis is placed on anti-coagulants, fibrinolytics, antiaggregating agents and methods of lowering blood viscosity. Their action is difficult to test objectively.

Intraocular injections of anti-VEGF drug are considered to be an effective treatment for macular edema after retinal vein occlusion, however, recurrent/persistent edema is common. The recent reports may lead to a shift in treatment paradigm for DME, from laser photocoagulation, to newer approaches using anti-VEGF drugs. There have been several well-publicized prospective, randomized studies that demonstrated the efficacy of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs for patients with AMD. Adjuvant bevacizumab for neovascular glaucoma may prevent further PAS formation, and it is likely to open up a therapeutic window for a panretinal photocoagulation and trabeculectomy. Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB) results in a substantial decrease in bleeding from the retinal vessels or new vessels during a standard vitrectomy. IVB has also been reported to be effective for inducing the regression of new vessels in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The use of bevacizumab in stage 4 or 5 retinopahty of permaturity (ROP) is to reduce the plus sign to help reduce hemorrhage during the subsequent vitrectomy.

CD012223,0,17594622,0,[Glaucoma in childhood uveitis].,"Secondary glaucoma is a common complication in childhood uveitis. The incidence of glaucoma depends on the anatomic localisation of inflammation and the associated underlying disease. The pathophysiology can be divided in secondary angle closure and open angle glaucoma. Data on conservative and operative therapy often rely on small patient groups or can only be transferred from children with non-uveitic glaucoma. The selection of topical medication must reflect the special quality of the juvenile organism. Topical therapy of first choice seems to be antagonists of carboanhydrase due to their good clinical effect without elevated risk profile. As second choice beta-receptor antagonists are suitable. Gel formulations of 0.1% timolol seem to exhibit fewer of the known side effects. Children aged 2 years and under have a special risk of apnoea. Alpha agonists should not be used in children of 6 years and younger because of their central nervous side effects. Prostaglandins might induce more recurrences of uveitis and might aggravate cystoid macular oedema, therefore this group should only be used with restrictions. Active uveitis is a contraindication for the use of prostaglandins. Parasympathomimetics are generally not recommended in uveitis due to the known side effects. Surgical therapy follows ineffective conservative therapy. The choice of the adequate surgical approach depends on individual factors and general recommendations cannot be made. Techniques include filtering procedures, cyclodestructive procedures, trabecular meshwork surgery, and glaucoma drainage devices. Before surgery the duration of quiescence of inflammation should be 8 weeks or longer."

Glaucoma medication was effective, although miotics sometimes increased pupillary block. Laser iridotomy was successful in 83% of six eyes; laser gonioplasty in 91.6% of 12 eyes. Peripheral iridectomy succeeded in two of seven eyes, and filtering operations provided tension control in two of five eyes. Thirteen of 15 eyes undergoing filtration surgery suffered severe postoperative visual loss. Cataract extraction improved vision in only three of six eyes.

CD012223,0,15663346,0,Management of glaucoma: focus on pharmacological therapy.,"Glaucoma represents a major cause of vision loss throughout the world. Primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of glaucoma, is a chronic, progressive disease often, though not always, accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). In this disorder, retinal ganglion cell loss and excavation of the optic nerve head produce characteristic peripheral visual field deficits. Patients with normal-tension glaucoma present with typical visual field and optic nerve head changes, without a documented history of elevated IOP. A variety of secondary causes, such as pigment dispersion syndrome and ocular trauma, can result in glaucoma as well. Treatment of all forms of glaucoma consists of reducing IOP. With proper treatment, progression of this disease can often be delayed or prevented. Treatment options for glaucoma include medications, laser therapy and incisional surgery. Laser techniques for the reduction of IOP include argon laser trabeculoplasty and selective laser trabeculoplasty. Both techniques work by increasing outflow of aqueous humour through the trabecular meshwork. Surgical options for glaucoma treatment include trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage tube implantation and ciliary body cyclodestruction. While each of these types of procedures is effective at lowering IOP, therapy usually begins with medications. Medications lower IOP either by reducing the production or by increasing the rate of outflow of aqueous humour within the eye. Currently, there are five major classes of drugs used for the treatment of glaucoma: (i) cholinergics (acetylcholine receptor agonists); (ii) adrenoceptor agonists; (iii) carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs); (iv) beta-adrenoceptor antagonists; and (v) prostaglandin analogues (PGAs). Treatment typically begins with the selection of an agent for IOP reduction. Although beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are still commonly used by many clinicians, the PGAs are playing an increasingly important role in the first-line therapy of glaucoma. Adjunctive agents, such as alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and CAIs are often effective at providing additional reduction in IOP for patients not controlled on monotherapy. As with any chronic disease, effective treatment depends on minimising the adverse effects of therapy and maximising patient compliance. The introduction of a variety of well tolerated and potent medications over the past few years now allows the clinician to choose a treatment regimen on an individual patient basis and thereby treat this disorder more effectively."

CD012223,0,9195749,0,Three-dimensional reconstruction of aqueous channels in human trabecular meshwork using light microscopy and confocal microscopy.,"Conventional two-dimensional imaging of the trabecular meshwork (TM) provides limited information about the size, shape, and interconnection of the aqueous channels within the meshwork. Understanding the three-dimensional (3-D) relationships of the channels within this tissue may give insight into its normal function and possible changes present in the eye disease glaucoma. The purpose of our study was to compare laser scanning confocal microscopy with standard 1 micron Araldite-embedded histologic sections for 3-D analysis of the trabecular meshwork. In addition, the study was done to determine whether computerized 3-D reconstruction could isolate the fluid spaces of the trabecular meshwork and determine the size of interconnections between the fluid spaces. Confocal microscopy appears comparable to 1 micron Araldite-embedded tissue sections and has the advantage of inherent registration of the serial tissue sections. Three-dimensional reconstruction allowed the isolation of the fluid spaces within the trabecular meshwork and revealed the presence of numerous interconnections between larger fluid spaces. The distribution of these interconnections was randomly arranged, with no predilection for specific regions within the trabecular meshwork. This distribution of constrictions and ""expansion chambers"" may provide a clue to the mechanism by which subtle histologic changes are associated with increased ocular pressure in glaucoma."
CD012223,0,7725227,0,Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.,"The Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH) is a bilateral, diffuse granulomatous uveitis associated with poliosis, vitiligo, alopecia, and central nervous system and auditory signs. These manifestations are variable and race dependent. This inflammatory syndrome is probably the result of an autoimmune mechanism, influenced by genetic factors, and appears to be directed against melanocytes. On histopathologic examination typical cases show nonnecrotizing diffuse granulomatous panuveitis with initial sparing and late involvement of the choriocapillaris and formation of Dalen-Fuchs' nodules. Fluorescein angiography, lumbar puncture, and echography are useful adjuncts in the diagnosis and management of VKH syndrome. Patients with this syndrome are treated generally with high dose systemic corticosteroids or, when necessary, with cyclosporine or cytotoxic agents. The prognosis of patients with VKH syndrome is fair, with nearly 60% of patients retaining vision of 20/30 or better. The complications of VKH syndrome that lead to visual loss include cataracts in about 25% of patients, glaucoma in 33%, and subretinal neovascular membranes (SRNVMs) in about 10%; the latter, however, are an important cause of late visual loss. These complications usually require medical and/or surgical intervention, including photocoagulation. The major risk factor for the development of cataracts, SRNVMs, and, to some extent, glaucoma, is chronic recurrent intraocular inflammation that may be resistant to corticosteroid therapy. It appears that initial treatment with high dose corticosteroids, combined with prolonged corticosteroid therapy at appropriate dosage, may minimize these complications and may improve visual prognosis."
CD012223,0,1428545,0,The pattern ERG in glaucoma: effect of pattern reversal time.,"Pattern reversals with a ramp-like temporal course evoke transient pattern electroretinograms (PERG) that are delayed and attenuated in comparison with responses evoked by a step-like course (abrupt pattern reversals). This delay depends on the reversal time and probably represents a measure for temporal characteristics of the activated retinal structures. A pattern reversal stimulator with adjustable reversal periods (matrix of 8 x 14 rectangular red light emitting diodes, element size 2 degrees x 1 degree, stimulus area 16 degrees x 14 degrees) was used to record transient PERGs from 20 glaucomatous eyes with early or moderate visual field damages (measured with computer perimetry). The q-wave (P1) amplitude difference between the glaucoma group and normal subjects with step-like reversal stimulation was not significant (P = 0.23). On the other hand, a highly significant separation (P < 0.0001) between both groups was possible using the P1 latency at ramp-like stimulation or the response latency shift between step and ramp-like stimulation (Pattern reversal time, 30 ms)."

To evaluate the morphological changes of the anterior segment using ultrasonic biomicroscopy (UBM) imaging in pseudophakic patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with silicone oil or gas (C3F8) internal tamponade agent injection. Method. This prospective study included pseudophakic patients with planned PPV, divided into two groups according to internal tamponade agent: those in which silicone oil was used (n = 27, Group 1) and those in which gas (C3F8) was used (n = 24, Group 2). UBM measurements were performed in the supine position before and one week after surgery. Results. In patients of Group 1, postoperative trabecular meshwork-ciliary process distance (T-CPD) and iris-ciliary process distance (I-CPD), according to preoperative values, were found to be statistically significantly reduced, and postoperative mean value of scleral thickness (ST) and intraocular pressure (IOP), according to preoperative value, was found to be statistically significantly increased. In patients of Group 2, postoperative mean values of anterior chamber depth (ACD), ciliary body thickness (CBT), T-CPD, I-CPD, and IOP, according to preoperative values, were found to be statistically significantly reduced. Preoperatively, in Group 2 patients, according to Group 1 patients, TIA and IOP were found to be statistically significantly increased.

Mean maximum intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation was 8 +/- 2 mm Hg following treatment with normal saline, 5 +/- 3 mm Hg following treatment with 2% pilocarpine, and 1 +/- 2 mm Hg following treatment with 0.5% timolol. Fewer patients treated with 0.5% timolol developed an IOP elevation of 5 mm Hg or more than control patients. On aphakic patient treated with 0.5% timolol developed a maximum IOP greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg.

CD012223,0,3712263,0,Glaucoma and intraocular lens implantation.,Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation is a viable method to rehabilitate the glaucoma patient with a cataract effectively. The success with this procedure in uncomplicated cases is translated into excellent results in the glaucomatous eye. This paper reports the results of extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in four groups of glaucoma patients: (1) chronic open-angle glaucoma; (2) angle-closure glaucoma; (3) after argon laser trabeculoplasty; (4) after filtering procedures. The visual acuity after this surgical procedure improved to 20/40 or better in 86% of patients. Intraocular pressure was controlled in all groups at a level approaching the preoperative value. Ninety percent were controlled with equal or less medication than that used preoperatively. There has been no significant progression of optic nerve cupping or visual field loss.

CD012223,0,6549515,0,Use of the neodymium:YAG laser to create iridotomies in monkeys and humans.,"In a prospective study the Nd:YAG laser was used to create iridotomies in cynomolgus monkeys, using various levels of energy and pulse-trains of 1 to 9. Although no change occurred in the endothelial cell count of the cornea, opacities of the corneal endothelium and lens did occur. In addition, one eye showed rupture of the anterior lens capsule immediately behind the iridotomy. Most of the iridotomies in these animals closed within 3 to 4 weeks. Attenuated pigment epithelium bridged the gap within 9 days and in many sections it appeared that the iridotomies closed by fibrous contraction or early stromal regeneration. A prospective short-term clinical study evaluated argon and Q-Nd:YAG laser iridotomies in 42 eyes of 21 patients with primary chronic angle-closure glaucoma. In each patient one eye was randomly treated with an argon laser iridotomy and the fellow eye with a Nd:YAG laser iridotomy. In every case a patent iridotomy was created in one session. A mean of 12 +/- 11 and 0.033 +/- 0.025 Joules was required to complete an iridotomy with the argon and Nd:YAG lasers, respectively. Thirty percent of the argon iridotomies became sufficiently closed with pigment to require retreatment; whereas none of the Nd:YAG iridotomies closed. A postoperative rise in IOP greater than 10 mm Hg was seen in 38% argon- and 29% Nd:YAG-treated eyes. Although bleeding around the iridotomy occurred in 48% of eyes, in no case was this of significant consequence. No acute lens damage was observed in the Nd:YAG-treated human eyes, while 43% of lenses in the argon group had focal opacities. Thirty-three percent of Nd:YAG- and 24% of argon-treated eyes had focal, nonprogressive corneal opacities above the iridotomy. Specular microscopy showed a significant central corneal epithelial cell loss in argon laser eyes only. The potential of creating a laser iridotomy with a single burst of energy is extremely attractive and worthy of further investigation."

CD012223,0,8116740,0,The effect of long-term medical therapy on the outcome of filtration surgery.,"Long-term medical therapy and laser trabeculoplasty have been implicated as risk factors in the outcome of glaucoma filtration surgery. A retrospective analysis was performed of patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy during three key periods: before use of beta-blockers and laser trabeculoplasty (1975 and 1976), after introduction of beta-blocker therapy but before use of the laser (1980), and after common use of beta-blockers and laser (1985 and 1986). A total of 150 patients were included in the analysis. Eyes treated with laser trabeculoplasty at some time before filtration surgery had a decreased probability of successful filtration surgery (intraocular pressure less than 21 mm Hg, 75% vs 91% at one year, P = .05; 50% vs 86% at five years, P = .01). It is unknown whether laser was detrimental to subsequent filtration surgery or merely acted as a selection factor in identifying patients who would have less successful surgical outcomes. Preoperative use of topical medication did not influence the outcome of surgery. Patients having bilateral filtration surgery had similar outcomes between fellow eyes despite the longer use of therapy in the second eye (mean of 1.8 years between operations). In the subgroup of eyes with low preoperative intraocular pressures (less than 21 mm Hg), surgery was successful in reducing pressure to a lower level in 70% of eyes at one year (preoperative pressure, 17.8 mm; one-year postoperative pressure, 13.3 mm, P = .007)."

CD012223,0,6829674,0,Influence of the number of laser burns administered on the early results of argon laser trabeculoplasty.,"We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-masked study to examine the influence of the number of burns administered on intraocular pressure after argon laser trabeculoplasty. Each of 40 patients with open-angle glaucoma had 50 burns placed over one half the trabecular meshwork (Group 1, 20 patients) or 100 burns placed over the entire trabecular meshwork (Group 2, 20 patients). There was no significant difference between the mean intraocular pressure decreases in Group 1 (-9.20 +/- 6.43 mm Hg) and Group 2 (-6.95 +/- 5.74 mm Hg) after two months (P less than .25). In each group, the intraocular pressure was lowest after two months in those patients in whom it was not increased during the immediate postoperative period (Group 1, P less than .006; Group 2, P less than .07). Because the changes in intraocular pressure were statistically similar in the two groups and because patients receiving only 50 burns may have fewer complications, administering 50 laser burns to one half the trabecular meshwork appears to be the better choice for an initial procedure."
