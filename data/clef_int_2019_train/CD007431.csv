CD007431,0,7072537,0,Lumbar spondylolisthesis. Clinical syndrome and operative experience with Cloward's technique.,"The paper gives a survey, based on literature reports and our own experiences in 59 cases. According to Kilian (1853) spondylolisthesis is defined as ventral slipping of a vertebral body together with the pedicles. In pseudospondylolisthesis (Junghanns) the whole vertebra slips ventrally. Elongation of the isthmus of the pedicle or a cleft in the interarticular portion are prerequisites for spondylolisthesis. A dysplastic origin during childhood and adolescence is assumed. The relation of males to females is 2 : 1. Evolution of spondylolisthesis occurs during childhood and adolescence. The slipping process is finished in adults. Most often the condition is encountered in the lumbar, in particular in the lumbosacral, region. A third to one half of patients with spondylolysis (5-7%) demonstrate spondylolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis is usually an accidental finding, although the condition may lead to low back pain and sciatica. The earlier symptoms arise the gloomier usually is the prognosis. Very rarely a herniated disc in the cause of symptoms. Sciatica is mostly due to irritation of a nerve root by compression on the vertebral edge. Low back pain is caused by arthrogenic, pseudoarthrotic, and spondylotic degenerative disease. Diagnosis is established by AP, lateral, and oblique X-rays, and functional investigations. Myelogram and ossovenogram demonstrate compression of caudal sac and nerve roots. Conservative treatment consists of drugs and physical therapy, and cures one fifth of the patients. The best operative results are found after decompression and stabilisation (Cloward)."
CD007431,0,8748845,0,The C-reactive protein for detection of early infections after lumbar microdiscectomy.,"The tendency for short hospitalization after lumbar microdiscectomy implies the need for early confirmation or disapproval of serious postoperative infections such as spondylodiscitis or deep wound infections. The C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known screening parameter for monitoring postoperative infectious complications in other fields. Our objective was to establish the diagnostic significance of CRP-in comparison with ESR and WBC-for monitoring infectious complications after lumbar microdiscectomy. Over a 15 months period we studied prospectively a homogeneous group of N = 400 patients with lumbar disc herniations who were operated on a single level for the first time. CRP, ESR and WBC values were determined in all patients pre-operatively, and on postoperative days 1 and 5. Clinical and laboratory findings were correlated and the diagnostic significance of CRP, ESR and WBC calculated. N = 385 (96%) patients had an uneventful postoperative course. N = 15 (4%) patients developed infectious complications, of which N = 6 (1.5%) were unrelated and N = 9 (2.5%) related to surgery. Evaluation of the laboratory values showed: The CRP baseline is a very individual value of no prognostic relevance. A high postaggression peak is typical and essential as a reference value for only the future time course will disclose any infection. We found 0% false negative and 4% false positive results on day 5. The sensitivity for serial CRP testing was calculated as 100% and specificity as 95.8%. ESR (sensitivity: 78.1%/specificity: 38.1%) and WBC (sensitivity: 21.4%/specificity: 76.8%) both failed to reach such distinct diagnostic significance on day 5. The C-reactive protein has thus proved to be a reliable, simple and economical screening test for infectious complications after lumbar microdiscectomy, superior to classical laboratory parameters."
CD007431,0,3819738,0,Pain in sciatica depresses lower limb nociceptive reflexes to sural nerve stimulation.,"The inhibitory effects of acute pain produced by the Lasègue's manoeuvre on the lower limb nociceptive flexion reflexes induced by electrical sural nerve stimulation were explored in patients complaining of sciatica as a result of an identified unilateral disc protrusion. Lassègue's manoeuvre on the affected side produced a typical radicular pain and resulted in a powerful depression of nociceptive reflexes elicited either in the normal or in the affected lower limb. Simultaneously, patients reported relief of the electrically-induced pain. In contrast, painless Lasègue's manoeuvre on the normal side had no effect on these parameters."
CD007431,0,7941692,0,[Satisfaction following automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy as a function of clinical parameters].,"182 patients assessed their condition after automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy (APLD). The analysis of descriptive data parameters++ provides new guidelines for the indication of this minimally invasive procedure: persistent leg pain despite conservative treatment, lumbar disc prolapse in one segment, minimal monological pathology, This ideal constellation implies a restriction of the common guidelines. Under these premises 50% of the patients will be satisfied. So the indication for APLD seems to be justified under more unfavorable patient profiles if the natural course of sciatica was poor."

CD007431,0,6623193,0,The surgical treatment of nerve root compression caused by scoliosis of the lumbar spine.,"Twenty patients with radicular compression caused by scoliosis of the lumbar spine with attendant spondyloarthrosis have been relieved of pain with restoration of function following surgical decompression. The stenosis caused by arthropathy is alleviated by foraminotomy and facetectomy after laminectomy over multiple levels along the concavity of the scoliotic curve. The spinous processes and attached ligaments are reconstructed to maintain the normal intermuscular septum contributing to stability. The clinical features are described with documentation by means of radiographic studies, myelography, and CAT scanning in all patients. In addition, the histopathologic findings of the facets removed at the time of surgery are described and the relationship of these findings to the symptomatology is indicated. The long-term results have been gratifying, supporting the efficacy of this means of therapy."
CD007431,0,15948202,0,Electrical impedance myography in the detection of radiculopathy.,"Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a new bioimpedance-based technique for neuromuscular disease assessment. Past work has focused on EIM in the evaluation of diffuse diseases (such as myopathy). In this study, the method's most basic form, linear-EIM, was used for the assessment of restricted radiculopathic disease. Ten normal subjects and 10 patients with unilateral cervical or lumbosacral radiculopathy, diagnosed by electromyography and clinical criteria, were enrolled. Linear-EIM was performed bilaterally on all individuals, and comparisons with the major outcome variable, theta(avg), were made. In normal subjects, side-to-side differences in theta(avg) averaged 0.64% and were no greater than 15.9% in magnitude. In the 10 patients with radiculopathy, theta(avg)was consistently lower in the affected extremity, with a mean side-to-side difference of 15.3%, but ranging as low as 72.3%; there was a tendency for muscles with more prominent chronic neurogenic change to show greater relative reductions in theta(avg). These findings support the potential utility of EIM in assessment of localized neuromuscular disease."

In group A (n = 13) the patients received a caudal epidural injection of 1 ml (7 mg) bethametason (Diprophos) in 10 ml normal saline and 20 ml local anesthetic (Lignocaine 1%). The second group B (n = 13) received a caudal epidural injection of 20 ml local anaesthetic (Lignocaine 1%) and 10 ml normal saline. The third group C (n = 13) received a superficial injection of 1 ml (7 mg) bethametason around of the sacral hiatus. All injections were performed by the same experienced anaesthesiologist. An independent physician, who was not aware which type of injection had been given, carried out the clinical measurements and the evaluation. Taking of analgesic drug Tramadol was permitted. The symptoms were assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS 100 mm), lumbar flexion (Schober and finger-floor distance), the angle of raised leg sign (RLS degrees), and by complete neurological examination, the investigation was made 5 times (1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, 1 week, and 4 weeks after epidural injections). The results between 0-1 week and 0-4 week were statistically analysed by Student-, Wilcoxon-, and Mann-Whitney test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean VAS values decreased in time in all patient groups. There was no difference between the three treatment groups either after one or after 4 weeks by ANOVA. The mobility of the lumbar spine improved in all patient groups, but there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. The raised led sign--values improved in all patient groups. There was a significant difference between the three treatment groups by ANOVA after one week, due to the difference between group A and C. After four weeks there was no significant difference. No major complications or side effects were seen in our trial. The raised leg sign due to epidural steroid injection showed better results in comparison to steroid injection around of the sacral hiatus were seen."

CD007431,0,6317780,0,Cervical radiculopathy: the diagnosis and treatment of pathomechanics in the cervical spine.,"Lateral flexion anteroposterior roentgenograms of the cervical spine were obtained of patients suffering from cervical radiculopathy. Specific attention was given to the normal mechanical attitudes of the cervical motion segments at their end range. Deviations from the normal coupling mechanism in the cervical spine were directly related to the level of clinical radiculopathy. Aberrancies in the coupling mechanism of the cervical motion segments were reduced by manipulation, and post manipulative reduction examination revealed improvements in sensation, motor power, and deep tendon reflexes, as well as subjective patient improvement. Normal mechanical attitudes could be restored by manipulative reduction of the cervical motion segments."

CD007431,0,6251391,0,[Electromyographic study of mentalis muscle reaction to pain].,"Three types of muscular reaction to pain were distinguished. Type I--a defensive reaction to a noxious stimulus, type II--muscular guarding at the site of pain, type III--suffering expression. The third type includes reaction of facial muscles discernible only at high pain intensity in subjects with hypersensitivity to pain. In a search for this reaction in all pains electromyographic investigations of the mentalis muscle were carried out since their connection with nociceptive stimulation is made use of in the sign of Marinesco-Radovici. In 18 out of 20 patients with sciatic pain spontaneous activity was observed in the mentalis muscle. Intensification of pain caused by nerve stretching (straight-leg-raising test) evoked activity of these muscles in all studied patients and its intensity was higher. The observed reaction may be an objective evidence of suffering."
CD007431,0,11034886,0,MRI evaluation of lumbar spine flexion and extension in asymptomatic individuals.,"Flexion and extension movements or positions have been advocated in the treatment of various forms of low back dysfunction due to the potential pain relieving effects attributed to displacements of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Objective in vivo determination of the segmental behaviour of the disc to contrasting positions has until recently been difficult. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in this study to evaluate the influence of sagittal plane positions on lumbar IVD height and nucleus displacement in a small asymptomatic population.T2-weighted sagittal plane images from L1 to S1 were obtained from 10 subjects (mean age: 30+/-5 years) positioned supine in lumbar flexion, followed by extension. Changes in disc height and localization of nucleus position (determined by peak MRI signal intensity) between the two positions were calculated. Discs were classified for degenerative changes using a semi-quantitative grading scale. The mean range of lumbar sagittal movement achieved in the MRI was 44 degrees (range: 22-77 degrees ). Between flexion and extension, a significant increase in measured anterior disc height of 1.1 mm (P<0.0001) and anterior displacement of the nucleus of 6.7% (P<0.0001) was observed. Despite the anterior displacement of the nucleus in extension observed in the pooled analysis, 30% of discs did not follow this trend. Nucleus degeneration was observed in at least one disc in nine subjects and in 26% of all discs examined. Lumbar spine position was found to be associated with small measured changes in anterior disc height and nucleus position, however, this response was variable within and between individuals. The theoretical concept of a stereotypical effect of spinal position on the lumbar IVD is challenged by these initial data. Since the health of the disc is often unknown in clinical practice, manual therapy treatment for lumbar spine pain should be based on the symptomatic response to movement and position rather than biomechanical theory."
CD007431,0,3183727,0,Changes in radicular function following low-back surgery.,"Results of neurological assessment 1 year following surgical treatment of herniated lumbar intervertebral discs and lumbar stenosis are reported in 443 patients. The data were collected using separate series of questionnaires to be completed by the patient and the surgeon. Preoperatively, motor loss was reported by 12% of patients, while surgeons found motor weakness in 28%. Postoperative motor loss was still present in 24% and 25% of these cases, respectively; the operation had caused or aggravated motor loss in 5% and 3% of cases, respectively. Sensory phenomena were reported by 53% of the patients, while surgeons found sensory loss in 45%. Sensation was reported as abnormal 1 year after surgery both by patients and by surgeons in one-third of these cases. Sensory loss, considered by the patient to be caused or aggravated by operation, occurred in 15% of cases and in 12% of cases the surgeons agreed. Preoperatively, unilaterally diminished knee and Achilles tendon reflexes were found in 9% and 42%, respectively; at 1 year after surgery, these had recovered in 65% and 57% of cases, respectively. Surgery caused or aggravated unilaterally diminished knee or ankle jerks in 3% and 10% of cases, respectively."
CD007431,0,8267686,0,Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy: surgical technique and preliminary results compared to microsurgical discectomy.,"Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy is a new technique for removing ""contained"" lumbar disc herniations (those in which the outer border of the anulus fibrosus is intact) and small ""noncontained"" lumbar disc herniations (those at the level of the disc space and occupying less than one-third of the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal) through a posterolateral approach with the aid of specially developed instruments. The technique combines rigid straight, angled, and flexible forceps with automated high-power suction shaver and cutter systems. Access can thus be gained to the dorsal parts of the intervertebral space where the disc herniation is located. Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy is monitored using an endoscope angled to 70 degrees coupled with a television and video unit and is performed with the patient under local anesthesia and an anesthesiologist available if needed. Its indication is restricted to discogenic root compression with a minor neurological deficit. Two groups of patients with contained or small noncontained disc herniations were treated by either percutaneous endoscopic discectomy (20 cases) or microdiscectomy (20 cases). Both groups were investigated in a prospective randomized study in order to compare the efficacy of the two methods. The disc herniations were located at L2-3 (one patient), L3-4 (two patients), or L4-5 (37 patients). There were no significant differences between the two groups concerning age and sex distribution, preoperative evolution of complaints, prior conservative therapy, patient's occupation, preoperative disability, and clinical symptomatology. Two years after percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, sciatica had disappeared in 80% (16 of 20 patients), low-back pain in 47% (nine of 19 patients), sensory deficits in 92.3% (12 of 13 patients), and motor deficits in the one patient affected. Two years after microdiscectomy, sciatica had disappeared in 65% (13 of 20 patients), low-back pain in 25% (five of 20 patients), sensory deficits in 68.8% (11 of 16 patients), and motor deficits in all patients so affected. Only 72.2% of the patients in the microdiscectomy group had returned to their previous occupation versus 95% in the percutaneous endoscopic discectomy group. Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy appears to offer an alternative to microdiscectomy for patients with ""contained"" and small subligamentous lumbar disc herniations."

This imaging unit under study also demonstrated low claustrophobic potential and yielded comparatively high resolution images with little motion/magnetic susceptibility/chemical shift artifact. Overall, it was found that rMRI underestimated the presence and maximum degree of gravity-dependent spinal pathology and missed altogether pathology of a dynamic nature, factors that are optimally revealed with p/kMRI. Furthermore, p/kMRI enabled optimal linkage of the patient's clinical syndrome with the medical imaging abnormality responsible for the clinical presentation, thereby allowing for the first time an improvement at once in both imaging sensitivity and specificity."

Statistically significant differences in the disc angle of the involved spinal segment were found between the two test groups. Both groups also contrasted significantly with asymptomatic controls. There also appears to be distinct postural complexes associated with these syndromes, although it is not clear if these postural changes were secondary processes such as antalgia, or primary and possibly predisposing."
CD007431,0,1270487,0,Infection of intervertebral discs after operation.,"Infection of the intervertebral space is a rare complication of operation on the disc (Ford and Key 1955). It occurred in five cases in a series of 650 operations for lumbar disc protrusion done by two of the authors of this paper--an incidence of 0-8%. Symptoms began between seven and twelve days after operation. After initial relief of the original sciatic pain, the patients developed severe back pain and muscle cramps in the legs. Straight-leg raising became much more limited than before operation. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was raised in all cases. The diagnosis was confirmed by rescreening the Myodil, when an indentation was seen opposite the intervertebral space from which the disc had been excised. Early removal of infected material from the disc space resulted in complete relief of pain and cure of the infection."

This investigation employs history, physical examination, imaging studies, and electrodiagnostic medicine evaluations to clearly define unilateral/unilevel L5 or S1 nerve root compromise. Inclusion criteria require all of the preceding diagnostic methods to corroborate a specific nerve root lesion. Regression equation analysis for cortical P1 latencies evaluating age and height based on comparable patient and control reference populations reveals segmental and dermatomal sensitivities for L5 radiculopathies to be 70% and 50%, respectively, at 90% confidence intervals. Similar sensitivities are obtained for 2 standard deviation mean cortical P1 latencies. Side-to-side cortical P1 latency difference data reveal segmental and dermatomal sensitivities for S1 radiculopathies to be 50% and 10%, respectively, at two standard deviations. The clinical utility of both segmental and dermatomal SEPs are questionable in patients with known unilateral/unilevel L5 and S1 nerve root compromise."

CD007431,0,14733958,0,Congenital form of spinal muscular atrophy predominantly affecting the lower limbs: a clinical and muscle MRI study.,"We describe clinical and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 11 cases (three familial and eight sporadic) with the form of spinal muscular atrophy characterised by predominant involvement of the lower limbs with weakness of the proximal and distal muscles and marked atrophy of the distal leg and foot muscles. All patients presented at birth with talipes, which were in extension in seven of the 11. Arm muscle and function were preserved and lower limbs appeared to be disproportionately shorter compared to trunk and upper limbs. Functional abilities were markedly affected and only one of the 11 is able to walk independently for long distances, while six require support of crutches and two use callipers for walking. One child lost ambulation following a fall. The course of the disease is relatively stable and the progression of disability appeared to be related mostly to increased contractures rather than to loss of muscle strength. Respiratory and cardiac function were well preserved. A neurogenic disorder was suggested by electromyography and/or muscle biopsy in all patients, while motor nerve conduction was consistently normal. Muscle MRI of the thighs revealed diffuse atrophic appearance with relative hypertrophy of the adductor longus and of the semitendinosus. Genetic studies excluded the involvement of the survival motor neuron gene but none of these families was sufficiently informative to study linkage to the locus on chromosome 12q23-q24 previously found to be involved in patients with similar phenotype. In our experience this form of spinal muscular atrophy affecting predominantly the lower limbs is a relatively common form and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infants with talipes and weakness in the lower limbs. The identical clinical and imaging features of the sporadic and familial cases suggest that these cases are likely to be affected by the same condition."

In most cases clinical symptoms are different from those of disc herniation. Myelography with ""amipaque"" appears necessary to allow a really planified operation, with liberation of all the roots involved by bony compression. In these conditions, a high percentage of good results is obtained. Consequently, after failure of conservative treatment, open release of the compression is advisable, even in elderly patients. In some cases postero-lateral fusion should be performed in addition."

Key to assessing the interest in this new motion technique is evaluating the results in terms of functional and radiologic outcomes. This prospective study reports the outcome of 64 Maverick devices implanted between January 2002 and November 2003. The degree of improvement was equivalent to that obtained with anterior fusion cages using the mini-invasive technique. Radiographic follow-up in this series showed a degree of mobility close to normal. The technique is safe because the intra- and postoperative complication rate is low. The Oswestry score improved for 75% of patients. This improvement is significantly correlated with facet arthrosis and muscle fatty degeneration.

An increase in right atrial filling pressure reflected in elevated paraspinal venous volumes within the reduced confines of a stenotic lumbar spine has been cited as the cause of this syndrome. Six cases of concomitant nocturnal calf cramps and fasciculations associated with the night pain and paresthesias are reported. In all cases a reduction in cardiopulmonary compliance was noted, with clinical and electromyographic evidence of paraspinal and lower extremity fasciculations increasing at night. Symptoms were relieved by assuming an erect or semi-reclining sleep position. In five of the six reported cases of lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis was also present. The motor equivalent of Vesper's curse was evaluated by electromography, evoked potentials, CAT scan, and myelography.

CD007431,0,10398990,0,Long-term outcome of patients suffering from clinical instability after microsurgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation.,"A total of 39 patients suffering from clinical instability of the lumbar spine after microdiscectomy were evaluated for their long-term outcome. Included there were 21 (54%) male and 18 (46%) female patients with a mean age of 55 years. All had been operated on for a virgin single-level lumbar disc herniation between the years 1985-1989 and they were evaluated for the presence of lumbar instability in 1991. Clinical signs and symptoms of segmental instability were then detected in all patients, with the symptom of ""apprehension"" positive in 30. During the follow-up, 2 (5%) patients had been treated by lumbar spondylodesis. At the time of the present investigation, both of them gave the information that their low back pain and sciatica had diminished as compared to the prediscectomy situation; both were retired. The symptom of ""apprehension"" was negative in both. Of the remaining 37 patients, low back pain had completely recovered in 4 (11%) and diminished in 23 (62%) patients, while in 9 (24%) patients, back pain had remained unchanged and become worse in 1 (3%). Further, sciatica had completely recovered in 4 (11%) and diminished in 23 (62%) patients, while in 7 (19%) patients, sciatica had remained unchanged and become worse in 3 (8%). Only 14 (38%) of these patients were able to work. However, evaluated by the Oswestry Index, the overall outcome in daily activities had significantly improved in all 37 patients since 1991 (p = 0.01). The symptom of ""apprehension"" was now positive in 26 patients. A significant correlation was observed between the positivity of this test and the persistence of low back pain (p = 0.02) and a poor outcome in daily activities (p < 0.0001). Comfirming earlier observations, the findings of this study support the concept that patients with postoperative lumbar instability have a poor prognosis.

We further sought to compare these results with those reported in the literature for discectomies at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels."
CD007431,0,7603590,0,Serial MRI in the early postoperative period after lumbar discectomy.,"The aim of this study was to determine MRI findings in patients successfully operated upon for lumbar disc herniation. We investigated 20 patients with a successful outcome after L4-5 or L5-S1 disc operations clinically and with MRI preoperatively, and at 5 days, 6 weeks, and 4 months after surgery. Postoperatively, T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained. At 4 months gadolinium-enhanced images were added. Pronounced intraspinal MRI changes were seen during follow-up. Deformation of the dural sac was seen in 13 patients preoperatively, in 19 at 5 days after operation, in 15 at 6 weeks, and in 12 at 4 months. Nerve root involvement was seen in all cases both preoperatively and at 5 days after operation, in 17 at 6 weeks, and in 15 at 4 months. No correlation between symptoms or the straight leg raising test and the size or nature of the abnormal tissue in the spinal canal postoperatively could be demonstrated. It was concluded that early postoperative MRI after lumbar discectomy must be interpreted carefully, and that oedema and scar formation are probable reasons for difficulties in interpretation."
CD007431,0,10552236,0,Diagnostic value of history and physical examination in patients suspected of sciatica due to disc herniation: a systematic review.,"We conducted a systematic review of the literature from 1965-1994 to assess the value of history and physical examination in the diagnosis of sciatica due to disc herniation; we also included population characteristics and features of the study design affecting diagnostic value. Studies on the diagnostic value of history and physical examination in the diagnosis of sciatica due to disc herniation are subject to important biases, and information on numerous signs and symptoms is scarce or absent. Our search revealed 37 studies meeting the selection criteria; these were systematically and independently read by three readers to determine diagnostic test properties using a standard scoring list to determine the methodological quality of the diagnostic information. A meta-analysis was performed when study results allowed statistical pooling. Few studies investigated the value of the history. Pain distribution seemed to be the only useful history item. Of the physical examination signs the straight leg raising test was the only sign consistently reported to be sensitive for sciatica due to disc herniation. However, the sensitivity values varied greatly, the pooled sensitivity and specificity values being 0.85 and 0.52, respectively. The crossed straight leg raising test was the only sign shown to be specific; the pooled sensitivity and specificity values were 0.30 and 0.84, respectively. There was considerable disagreement on the specificity of the other neurological signs (paresis, sensory loss, reflex loss). Several types of bias and other methodological drawbacks were encountered in the studies limiting the validity of the study results. As a result of these drawbacks it is probable that test sensitivity was overestimated and test specificity underestimated."
CD007431,0,9546444,0,Microsurgical excision of lateral lumbar disc herniation through an interlaminar approach.,"We made a prospective study of 43 consecutive patients treated for intraforaminal (34) or extraforaminal (9) herniations of a lumbar disc by excision through an interlaminar approach, using an operating microscope. The intraforaminal herniations were contained or extruded in 52% and sequestrated in 47%; for extraforaminal herniation the proportions were 66% and 33%, respectively. There was additional posterolateral protrusion or spinal stenosis at the level of the lateral herniation in seven and four cases, respectively. The patients were reviewed at three months and two years after surgery. Radiographs showed three grades of facetectomy: grade I, removal of 50% or less, grade II, excision of 51% to 75%, and grade III, subtotal or total facetectomy. For intraforaminal herniations the results were excellent or good in 88% of patients when reviewed at three months and in 91% at two years. For extraforaminal herniations, there was an excellent or good outcome in 89% of patients in the short term and in all in the long term. The facetectomy had been grade I in 14 and grade II in 25; it had been grade III in four, but only one had had total facetectomy. No patient had developed vertebral hypermobility as a result of the operation. An intralaminar approach using an operating microscope can provide adequate access to a lateral protrusion. It has the advantage of allowing the treatment of posterolateral protrusion or posterior annular bulge and of spinal stenosis at the same level."
CD007431,0,8423717,0,Effectiveness of the Short TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence in MR imaging of intramedullary spinal lesions.,"A Short TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence with spin-echo data collection was compared to a conventional cardiac gated long TR spin-echo (SE) sequence for detecting intramedullary signal abnormalities. The cervical (n = 48), cervico-thoracic (n = 1), and thoraco-lumbar (n = 18) spinal cord was imaged in a sagittal plane with a 0.5 T (n = 61) or 1.5 T (n = 6) MRI unit in 67 patients with clinical evidence of myelopathy of different etiologies (e.g., multiple sclerosis, trauma, herniated intervertebral disk, spondylosis, etc.). In all patients, ungated double or quadruple echo STIR images (TR 1000-1400 msec, TI 100 msec, TE 30-60 or 30-60-90-120 msec) were compared with cardiac gated long TR (1400-2100 msec), double echo (30-100, 50-100, or 50-150 msec) SE images with first order flow compensation for the second echo. Although STIR images appeared ""noisier"" than long TR SE images, they showed fewer ghost artifacts. In 55 patients, single or multiple, focal or diffuse, hyperintense areas within the spinal cord were observed on both long TR SE and (magnitude reconstructed) STIR images. Lesion conspicuity was better on the STIR images in 25 patients, better on the SE images in 14 patients, and equal in 16. STIR sequence provides a valuable alternative to gated long TR SE sequence for the MRI investigation of intramedullary spinal lesions."
CD007431,0,2336978,0,"Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and myelography in the diagnosis of recurrent lumbar disc herniation.","Thirteen patients with recurrent symptoms after lumbar discectomy were evaluated. All the patients were enrolled in the study on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs only. The patients were examined with MRI, CT, and myelography in order to compare a) the clinical findings with the imaging investigations, b) the predictive value of the different investigations, and c) the clinical and investigative results with the operative findings. All patients were operated upon according to the clinical findings, and the surgical results were used as the final diagnosis. In six patients a new disc herniation was detected. In the remaining cases surgery revealed either scar tissue or nothing to explain the recurrence of the symptoms. The three imaging modalities were analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.68 for MRI, 0.83 for CT, and 0.43 for myelography. The difference in areas between CT and myelography was significant (p less than 0.05). The results indicate that CT has the highest predictive value for demonstrating the recurrence of a lumbar disc herniation."
CD007431,0,8245078,0,Repeat decompression of lumbar nerve roots. A prospective two-year evaluation.,"In a prospective, consecutive study 93 patients who had had previous lumbar spinal surgery underwent repeat decompression for persistent or recurrent back and leg pain. The previous operations had been discectomies in 65 patients and decompression for spinal stenosis in 28; two of the latter group had also had posterolateral fusion. At the repeat operation, disc herniation was found in 19 patients, lateral spinal stenosis in 19, central spinal stenosis in 20 and periradicular fibrosis in 35. Ninety-one patients were followed up for two years after surgery; the effect of the operation was recorded using a four-scale grading system. The results were significantly related to the diagnosis. Nerve-root compression due to recurrent disc herniation or to bony compression responded well to repeat decompression. In patients with a single nerve-root compression the results were similar to those obtained in primary operations. Sciatica due to nerve-root scarring was seldom improved by the repeat operation."
CD007431,0,11680522,0,A prospective randomized controlled study of VAX-D and TENS for the treatment of chronic low back pain.,"Low back pain is one of the most significant medical and socioeconomic problems in modern society. International guidelines call for evidence-based management for the pain and disability associated with musculoskeletal disorders. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to address the question of efficacy and appropriateness of vertebral axial decompression (VAX-D) therapy, a new technology that has been shown in clinical research to create negative intradiscal pressures, and has been shown to be effective in treating patients presenting with chronic low back pain (> 3 months duration) with associated leg pain. Successful outcome was defined as a 50% reduction in pain utilizing a 10 cm Visual Analog Pain Scale and an improvement in the level of functioning as measured by patient-nominated disability ratings. Patients were randomly assigned to VAX-D or to TENS which was used as a control treatment or placebo. The TENS treatment demonstrated a success rate of 0%, while VAX-D demonstrated a success rate of 68.4% (p < 0.001). A statistically significant reduction in pain and improvement in functional outcome was obtained in patients with chronic low back pain treated with VAX-D."

Children with back pain, therefore, have frequently undergone exhaustive diagnostic testing. There have been few prospective studies, however, about the diagnosis rate and appropriate diagnostic methods for back pain in children. This study prospectively examines the rate of diagnosis for pediatric back pain and the value of various diagnostic studies for this problem."

They are as follows: (1) The chaotic nature of spatial pain parameters; (2) Infinite limits of its temporary parameters; (3) Mutual suppression of ""foci"" of pain; (4) Replacement of the monocausal dependence by polycausal. The formation of painful syndromes is explained from phylogenetic viewpoints."
CD007431,0,8381518,0,The value of magnetic stimulation in the diagnosis of radiculopathies.,"We studied 42 patients with cervical and lumbar radiculopathies using magnetic stimulation. Prolonged latencies following magnetic stimulation of the brain, the paravertebral spinal nerve, or both, showed a highly significant correlation with muscle weakness in clinical testing (24 of 26 patients with weakness had pathological motor evoked potentials) as well as with spontaneous activity of the target muscles in needle electromyography (24 of 25 subjects). The determination of both the central and the peripheral motor conduction time was found to be essential in patients with radiculopathies, because different patterns of latency changes correlated with different morphological results in computed tomography: in patients diagnosed as having a lateral compression of the nerve root the peripheral nerve latency was delayed; whereas, in patients with more medially localized herniations, a prolonged central motor latency was the most frequent finding. This study posits that combined magnetic stimulation of the brain and nerve root is an effective and painless technique for the noninvasive evaluation of nerve root function."

Such changes may for the first time present a biologic or biochemical basis for the development of sciatica. Disk-related cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have been found to mediate such changes, and clinical trials have now been initiated to assess the possibility of treating sciatica with selective inhibition of TNF."

CD007431,0,128126,0,Clinical and electromyographic evaluation after chemonucleolysis for lumbar disk disease.,"Results in 200 patients with lumbar disk disease who had chemonucleolysis were evaluated by two means. First, the surgeon evaluated the patients clinically from 6 to 30 months after chemonucleolysis by rating each case as excellent, good, fair, or unimproved. Results were judged excellent or good in 91% of the 153 ""clean"" cases (without previous operation) and in 53% of the 36 with previous operation; 11 patients were lost to follow-up. No patients were clinically worse than before treatment. Scond, a physiatrist did a repeat electromyogram three months or longer after chemonucleolysis. He judged a patient improved if there was a decrease or disappearance of the positive waves and/or fibrillation potentials noted on initial electromyogram. Based on these objective findings, 90.5% of ""clean"" cases and 85.4% overall showed improvement. Surgeons' clinical evaluations and the independent physiatrical evaluations based on objective electromyographic findings thus correlated closely."

Data was collected from twenty-two medical centers for patients who received VAX-D therapy for low back pain, which was sometimes accompanied by referred leg pain. Only patients who received at least ten sessions and had a diagnosis of herniated disc, degenerative disc, or facet syndrome, which were confirmed by diagnostic imaging, were included in this study; a total of 778 cases. The average time between the initial onset of symptoms and the beginning of this therapy was 40 months, and it was four months or more in 83% of the cases. The data contained the patients' quantitative assessments of their own pain, mobility, and ability to carry out the usual 'activities of daily living'. The treatment was successful in 71% of the 778 cases, when success was defined as a reduction in pain to 0 or 1, on a 0 to 5 scale. Improvements in mobility and activities of daily living correlated strongly with pain reduction. The causes of back pain and their relationship to this therapy are also discussed."

Numerous natural and synthetic materials have been investigated as means to prevent or reduce postoperative scarring after these operations. Preservation of the ligamentum flavum for this purpose has not been studied in depth. A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study was conducted. The aim was to present a new technique for preserving the ligamentum flavum during lumbar discectomy, and to evaluate whether this helps prevent or diminish postoperative fibrosis."
CD007431,0,8528776,0,Influence of age on symptoms and signs in lumbar disc herniation.,"In a prospective and consecutive study we evaluated the prevalence of pain-related symptoms, the results of the straight leg raising (SLR) test and neurological disturbances by age group in a total of 150 patients operated on due to lumbar disc herniation. On admission, all patients were interviewed, and pain at rest, at night and on coughing was recorded. Walking capacity was recorded under four categories: > 5 km, 1-5 km, 0.5-1 km and < 0.5 km. Results of the SLR test were also registered as category data: positive 0-30 degrees, positive 30-60 degrees, positive > 60 degrees or negative. Findings from examination of tendon reflexes and power of the extensor hallucis longus (EHL) muscle were registered, as were sensory disturbances. The above mentioned parameters were analysed separately for five different age groups: 20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years and above 60 years of age. There was an age-related change in the prevalence of certain parameters. Highly restricted positive SLR test results and pain on coughing was most commonly found in the youngest patient group. With increasing age there was a decreasing prevalence of highly restricted positive SLR test results, while the prevalence of severe reduction of walking capacity increased. In short, the youngest patient group showed the most obvious clinical picture of disc herniation and, with increasing age, the clinical picture gradually changed towards the picture associated with spinal stenosis."
CD007431,0,7586844,0,Pain and pathology in lumbar disc hernia.,"The authors analyzed pain drawings of patients having lumbar disc surgery and tried to correlate pain pattern to disc pathology and level. Preoperatively, patients having spinal surgery were asked to draw on a standardized form the localization, postural variation, and modality of their pain. In this study, 185 consecutive patients with unilateral and unisegmental L4-L5 and L5-S1 hernias were analyzed. The pain drawings were coded and read blindly; each drawing was divided operationally into anatomic areas, and the type of pain symbol in each pixel was recorded, digitized, and analyzed by stepwise discriminant analysis. For predicting the level of the lesion, the most important variables were pain on the anterolateral aspect of the leg (L4-L5) and pain radiating to the posterior aspect of the foot (L5-S1). For predicting the grade of herniation, the most discriminative factors were pain radiating to the foot (sequestrated hernia) and bilateral back pain (protruded hernia). Pain drawing facilities communication and documentation. In addition, it is an aid to diagnose the level and degree of the hernia, and therefore is useful for selecting patients who might benefit from disc surgery. For scientific purposes, data are digitized easily, allowing analyses of large populations."

Included were 99 (52%) men and 91 (48%) women with a mean age of 42 years. During the observation period, sciatica had completely recovered or markedly diminished in 172 (90%) patients, and 142 (75%) patients had returned to work. However, as many as 29% of the patients occasionally suffered from low back pain. Clinical examination revealed various signs and symptoms of segmental instability of the lumbar spine in 22% of the surgical patients. There was a significant association between postoperative instability and unsatisfactory long-term outcome: of the 42 patients with instability, 62% suffered from low back pain and 45% were on sick leave or retired because of the back, while the corresponding numbers for those patients without instability were 20% and 8%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the mean value of the Oswestry index in instability patients was as high as 34% (SD 12), indicating moderate disability, whereas a significantly (p = 0.0001) lower Oswestry Index 16% (SD 13), indicating minimal disability, was detected in patients without instability."

It was found that only lumbar phlebography was more accurate than the most simple procedure, the clinical examination. Myelography is more accurate than clinical examination only in making a positive diagnosis. In this case, it equals the reliability of lumbar phlebography, but so does plain film radiography which however leads to a positive diagnosis less constantly. Lumbar phlebography is the most accurate procedure for making a negative diagnosis, mainly by avoiding a false negative conclusion.

The beds employed were an ""orthopedic"" hard bed with 720 reinforced coils and a built-in bed board, a softer 500 coil bed, a standard 10 in. thick waterbed, and a hybrid bed of foam and water. Subjectively the majority of patients preferred the hard bed and felt that their back pain improved to a greater extent after 2 weeks on the hard bed as compared to the other beds. The next largest group of patients to show improvement used the waterbed. Limitations in performing the straight leg raising test coincided with the subjective complaints. Significantly improved straight leg raising was observed after use of the hard bed or waterbed in 25% of the patients using those beds. No other objective signs were altered. The 500 coil bed and the hybrid bed proved of no benefit to any patient in this study group. This limited study indicates that hard beds should remain the first choice of patients with chronic low back pain. However, if relief is not obtained for these chronic pain patients, a trial on a waterbed may prove beneficial."

CD007431,0,15931510,0,"Relationship between low-back pain, muscle spasm and pressure pain thresholds in patients with lumbar disc herniation.","It is not known whether or not muscle spasm of the back muscles presented in patients with sciatic scoliosis caused by lumbar disc herniation produces muscle pain and/or tenderness. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) of the lower back and low-back pain were examined in 52 patients (13 of 52 presenting sciatic scoliosis) with lumbar disc herniation who complained of radicular pain and in 15 normal subjects. PPTs were measured at five points bilaterally using an electronic pressure algometer. Low-back pain was evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings. All patients complained of radicular leg pain and were divided into the following three groups according to the presence of and the region of low-back pain: no low-back pain group, low-back pain with no laterality group, and low-back pain dominantly on the herniation side group; the VAS rating on the side ipsilateral to the herniation side was higher than that on the contralateral side. In the normal subjects, there were no statistically significant differences between sides in mean PPTs at all sites examined. PPTs were not lower in the spasmodic side (concave side) than the convex side in patients with sciatic scoliosis. PPTs on the herniation side were significantly lower than those on the contralateral side in patients with low-back pain dominantly on the herniation side. Furthermore, the areas of low PPTs were beyond the innervation area of dorsal ramus of L5 and S1 nerve root. It was considered that not only the peripheral mechanisms but also the hyper excitability of the central nervous system might contribute in lowering PPTs of the lower back on the herniation side."

The authors defined these neurological deficits as ""skip lesions"", and reviewed the neurological deficits in tethered cord syndrome. Among 29 cases, inconsecutive segmental motor weakness in 3 cases, inconsecutive segmental sensory impairment in 6 cases, positive Babinski reflex in 8 cases, supranuclear neurogenic bladder in 3 cases and lumbago or leg pain in 4 cases were observed and they were thought to be compatible with the neurological deficits called ""skip lesions"". The basic mechanism of this sign is that the cephalic portion of the spinal cord is functionally impaired during flexion of the lumbosacral spine, while the caudal spinal cord with decreased visco-elasticity dose not elongate. Inconsecutive motor-sensory disturbance, accelerated deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, positive Babinski or other pathological reflexes in the lower extremities, uninhibited neurogenic bladder, lumbago and pain in the legs were considered to belong to the category of ""skip lesions"" and they can be treated by the untethering procedure.

For epidurography the most acceptable are water-soluble contrast substances. The method of an ascending verografin epidurography was elaborated and used in clinical practice. Some indications and contraindications for epidurography are outlined. A group of 396 patients with osteochondrosis of the lumbar part of the spine was examined. The method allowed a topic diagnosis of the disc hernia not only along the spine, but in the cross-section of the motor segments (median, paramedian and lateral hernias). The studies make it possible to exclude a disc prolapse in a nonhernial form of osteochondrosis. In 32 patients with spinal tumors epidurography permitted to determine the initial growth of the tumor, its size and relation to the dura mater."

Based on differential diagnosis of pains in the lumbar area and the leg, 2 groups of patients were singled out: patients with post surgical vertebrogenic pain syndromes of non-root genesis (45 patients) and patients with clinical presentations of recurrent compressive lumbosacral radicular syndromes (209 patients). The features of the clinical presentations of recurrent pain syndromes, which reflect the main role of commissural compression of vascular formations of the spinal canal in the disease genesis, are shown. The results allow to optimize clinical diagnosis of recurrent pain syndromes of post surgical period with a following choice of the rational scheme for further examination and therapy policy."
CD007431,0,3693993,0,[Comparative study on the pre-and postoperative myelogram in anterior lumbar surgery].,"In order to investigate the change of the dural tube and radicular sheath after anterior surgery, metrizamide myelography was performed in 32 cases of lumbar disc herniation, 12 of spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, and 9 of degenerative spondylolisthesis. Postoperative myelography was performed 3 to 8 weeks after surgery. The improved postoperatively in radicular sheath was 67% of the cases of disc herniation, 60% of spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, and 36% of degenerative spondylolisthesis. Postoperatively, no abnormal findings of dural tube were observed in the lateral view in 80% of the cases of disc herniation, and 78% of those of spondylolytic spondylolisthesis. Improvement of myelographic findings of the dural tube seemed to be related to the clinical results of surgery for disc herniation and degenerative spondylolisthesis. These facts indicated that anterior surgery is a reliable procedure to obtain surgical decompression and favorable clinical results."

Pain was eliminated in 36 (60%) and reduced in all but 3 (5%). Two-thirds of patients had no residual weakness or numbness. Thirty patients (50%) developed some new low-grade back pain, 17 (28%) developed some radicular pain, 9 (19%) developed some degree of radiographic instability, and 9 (15%) required further operative procedures. Based on this information, surgeons should be able to provide realistic expectations for their patients regarding outcomes. Based on our review of the literature, results using the paraspinal window appear similar, but not superior, to other available techniques, and the choice of approach should be based on the comfort of the surgeon."

Although multiple studies have assessed the outcome of microdiscectomy, only a few studies have evaluated the outcome of those patients who have undergone a second microdiscectomy at the same location as the original one. The purpose of this study was to review 55 patients who, over a 4-year period, underwent a second microdiscectomy at the same location as their original operation and to evaluate those factors associated with improved outcomes. The results showed the overall outcome to include 86% with complete or partial relief of all pain symptoms; 88% with complete or partial relief of sciatica; 85% with complete or partial relief of back pain; 100% returning to work in an average of 7 weeks; and 89% were glad they had the second operation. Those factors without predictive value included age, sex, weight, height, level of operation, side of operation, surgeon at the first or second operation (e.g. consultant or junior staff), length of the first operation ( < or = 60 min or > 60 min) and duration of symptoms before the first operation. The key features centred on preoperative job status, the interval between recurrence of symptoms and the second operation, and the duration of the second operation ( < or = 90 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

This study includes 20 consecutive patients with a contained lumbar disc herniation. Sequential MRI were performed immediately before and after surgery, on the day of surgery, and 6 weeks after surgery. The development of pain, nerve root tension sign (SLR), and neurological findings were analyzed, as was the need for subsequent open surgery. There was no significant difference in the maximum protrusion of the disc herniation between the three measurements. The sciatic pain improved significantly on the first day after surgery but not at 1 week or 6 weeks after surgery. The SLR was reduced significantly after surgery and at 1 and 6 weeks after surgery. There was no correlation between the MRI findings and the early clinical outcome. Seven patients needed subsequent open surgery. The findings indicate that the effect of APLD is not mediated by reducing the size of the disc herniation. In this small series of patients, APLD was ineffective in the treatment of a contained lumbar disc herniation. There was no correlation between the MRI findings and the early clinical outcome."

Thus we observed that the falciform process of the sacrotuberous ligament may act in this way. Besides helping us to understand the clinical symptoms, this anatomical study allowed choosing the technique we found most appropriate for the anatomical conditions observed out of the various neurophysiological examinations described in the literature. Lastly, we describe the surgical technique that allows releasing the trunk of the pudendal nerve under an operating microscope."

The main aim of the present study of false positive P1 latency prolongation in lumbosacral sensory nerve SEP was to investigate whether elicitation of such symptoms secures adequate sensory nerve stimulation. Nerve roots were studied on the asymptomatic side in 64 patients with unilateral sciatica. Saphenous (L4), superficial peroneal (L5), and sural (S1) nerve SEP were registered in all patients. Pretibial dermatomal SEP were registered in ten of them. Stimulation was equidistant from the registration electrode in all SEP registrations. The false positive rate was lower in saphenous nerve SEP with than without verified supramaximal stimulation (1/30 vs. 6/22, P = 0.03) in spite of radiating stimulus-related sensory symptoms in both groups. This difference was not caused by subclinical myelographic nerve root compression or general peripheral nerve dysfunction. The P1 latency was longer in the pretibial dermatomal SEP than in the saphenous and superficial peroneal nerve SEP with the same conduction distance (mean difference 4.7 (95% CI = 3.8 to 5.6) and 4.4 ms (95% CI = 3.4 to 5.4), respectively). It is concluded that dermatomal SEP have longer P1 latency than sensory nerve SEP. Verified supramaximal nerve simulation is recommended to avoid false results due to admixture of dermatomal to sensory nerve SEP."
CD007431,0,794071,0,Selective ascending lumbosacral venography in the assessment of lumbar-disc herniation. An anatomical study and clinical experience.,"Epidural venography was performed in 110 patients with suspected lumbar-disc herniation by catheterization of the ascending lumbar and ascending sacral veins. The findings by venography and by myelography were compared with those revealed by operative exploration. Only sixty-one patients had venography, myelography, and operative exploration. In fifty of these patients with no previous disc surgery, the diagnostic accuracy of venography was 98 per cent and of myelography, 90 per cent. Venography had limited value in the other eleven patients who had had one or more prior disc operations because it did not distinguish between scarring and recurrent disc herniation at the levels previously explored. Selctive ascending lumbosacral venography is indicated both in patients who have not had a prior disc operation, as a guide to whether myelography should be performed when the clinical picture is ambiguous, and in patients whose myelogram is normal or equivocal but whose signs and symptoms are strongly suggestive of disc herniation."

To control for the maximum number of potentially confounding variables, pairs of identical twins highly discordant for cigarette smoking were selected as study subjects. Data analyses revealed 18% greater mean disc degeneration scores in the lumbar spines of smokers as compared with nonsmokers. The effect was present across the entire lumbar spine, implicating a mechanism acting systemically. This investigation demonstrates the efficiency of using carefully selected controls in studying conditions of multifactorial etiology, such as disc degeneration."
CD007431,0,9715669,0,"Muscle strength, task performance and low back load in nurses.","Poor muscle strength, relative to the physical demands of specific jobs, is considered a risk factor for low back pain. To gain an understanding of the underlying mechanisms, this study questioned whether muscle strength was related to task performance and low back load in nursing tasks. Trunk extension, elbow flexion and knee extension strength were therefore measured in 17 nurses. The independent effects of muscle strength on task duration, jerkiness of effort and L5-S1 torque were investigated as the nurses performed several patient handling tasks. Despite a large variation in muscle strength within the subject population, no effect of strength on task duration, jerkiness or L5-S1 torques was observed. In conclusion, poor muscle strength was found not to be related to increased low back load. If 'weaker' nurses were to be at a higher risk, it would be due to a reduced capability to withstand the mechanical load, rather than to an increased mechanical load."

The most intricate problem was the differential diagnosis between a recurrent hernia and a postoperative epidural cicatrix. Criteria to distinguish between these two conditions are suggested. The authors emphasize that the optimal variant for examination of the patients operated on is a combination of magnetic resonance tomography and computer-aided tomography.

The diagnosis of a prolapsed disc was confined by amipaque myelography, carried out in 9 patients, and finally verified at operation. In none of the 10 cases could accumulation of radioactivity in the bony structures of the affected lumar segment be demonstrated. Consequently this method has not been adopted for the diagnosis of prolapsed lumbar discs. However it was demonstrated that 99m technetium methylene diphosphate scintillography is useful in the differential diagnosis of anchylosing spondylitis and discitis."

We hypothesise that the electrophysiological recordings, especially SSEP, indicate a lumbar nerve involvement that is complementary to the neurological examination and can provide confirmatory information in less obvious clinical cases. In a prospective cohort study, 54 patients scheduled for surgery due to LSS were enrolled in an unmasked, uncontrolled trial.

CD007431,0,9582228,0,Facilitation of a nociceptive flexion reflex in man by nonnoxious radiant heat produced by a laser.,"Electromyographic recordings were made in healthy volunteers from the knee-flexor biceps femoris muscle of the nociceptive RIII reflex elicited by electrical stimulation of the cutaneous sural nerve. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce a moderate pricking-pain sensation. The test responses were conditioned by a nonnoxious thermal (</=40 degrees C) stimulus applied to the receptive field of the sural nerve. This stimulus was delivered by a CO2 laser stimulator and consisted of a 100-ms pulse of heat with a beam diameter of 20 mm. Its power was 22.7 +/- 4.2 W (7.2 mJ/mm2), and it produced a sensation of warmth. The maximum surface temperature reached at the end of the period of stimulation was calculated to be 7 degrees C above the actual reference temperature of the skin (32 degrees C). The interval between the laser (conditioning) and electrical (test) stimuli was varied from 50 to 3, 000 ms in steps of 50 ms. It was found that the nociceptive flexion reflex was facilitated by the thermal stimulus; this modulation occurred with particular conditioning-test intervals, which peaked at 500 and 1,100 ms with an additional late, long-lasting phase between 1,600 and 2,300 ms. It was calculated that the conduction velocities of the cutaneous afferent fibers responsible for facilitating the RIII reflex, fell into three ranges: one corresponding to A delta fibers (3.2 m/s) and two in the C fiber range (1.3 and 0.7 m/s). It is concluded that information emanating from warm receptors and nociceptors converges. In this respect, the present data show, for the first time, that in man, conditioning nonnociceptive warm thermoreceptive A delta and C fibers results in an interaction at the spinal level with a nociceptive reflex. This interaction may constitute a useful means whereby signals add together to trigger flexion reflexes in defensive reactions and other basic motor behaviors. It also may contribute to hyperalgesia in inflammatory processes. The methodology used in this study appears to be a useful noninvasive tool for exploring the thermoalgesic mechanisms in both experimental and clinical situations."
CD007431,0,8184498,0,[Postoperative rehabilitation of patients operated for lumbar disk prolapse.

The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the social economic consequences (cost-effectiveness analysis) of the introduction of this new program as a general offer for all patients undergoing first time discectomy for a herniated lumbar intervertebral disc in Denmark. Ninety-six consecutive patients operated on at the Dept. of Neurosurgery. Copenhagen County Hospital of Glostrup were randomized into two intervention groups. One group was offered intensive back training and the other group was offered traditional back training. A historical control group was also selected. The effectiveness of the training programmes was evaluated by a ""Low Back Pain Rating Scale"" and by the number of patients out of employment one year after operation. The social economic evaluation showed that the new intensive training programme was more effective. Savings in medical expenditure are to be expected if the new programme is offered. Further, as more people are to be expected to keep their employment, a production gain for the society can be expected as well as reduced public expenditures on social benefits."

CD007431,0,12691388,0,A new endoscopic technique to decompress lumbar nerve roots affected by spondylolysis. Technical note.,"The authors describe a new endoscopic technique to decompress lumbar nerve roots affected by spondylolysis. Short-term clinical outcome was evaluated. Surgery-related indications were: 1) radiculopathy without low-back pain; 2) no spinal instability demonstrated on dynamic radiographs; and 3) age older than 40 years. Seven patients, four men and three women, fulfilled these criteria and underwent endoscopic decompressive surgery. Their mean age was 60.9 years (range 42-70 years). No subluxation was present in four patients, whereas Meyerding Grade I slippage was demonstrated in three. For endoscopic decompression, a skin incision of 16 to 18 mm in length was made, and fenestration was performed to identify the affected nerve root. The proximal stump of the ragged edge of the spondylotic lesion, and the fibrocartilaginous mass compressing the nerve root were removed. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 22 months (mean 11.7 months). Clinical outcome was evaluated using Gill criteria; in three patients the outcome was excellent, and in four it was good. This new endoscopic technique was useful in the decompression of nerve roots affected by spondylolysis, the technique was minimally invasive, and the clinical results were acceptable."

The compound muscle action potentials were recorded bilaterally by surface electrodes applied to the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles. The latencies to the affected muscles were significantly prolonged. The appropriate root dysfunction was confirmed at operation or by the imaging techniques. It was concluded that surface stimulation of the lumbosacral roots by a magnetic coil is a potentially useful technique for the non-invasive evaluation of the function of the lumbosacral roots.

This prospective study was carried to see the outcome of Posterolateral fusion with instrumentation without decompression. Eight consecutive patients, aged between 43 to 55 years, underwent primary surgery for isolated L4, L5 lumbar isthmic Spondylolisthesis of less than grade II that presented with radicular pain and exhibited instability on dynamic radiograph. The surgical procedure consisted of instrumentation with pedicle screws and rods (Moss Miami System) and posterolateral fusion in situ by placement of autogeneous bone graft, harvested from posterior iliac crest. Postoperatively Clinical and Radiological status were assessed and were graded according to Stauffer and Coventry method. The patients were followed up for one to three years. Radiological evidence of fusion was clearly evident by six months in all cases. Symptomatically all were relieved of radicular pain completely. One patient had recurrent backache due to causes unrelated to the illness of surgical procedure requiring occasional analgesic. No serious complication was encountered. This lead to conclusion that in adults of our population with low grade isthmic spondylolisthesis and radicular pain Instrumentation with Posterolateral fusion without decompression was sufficient to relieve symptoms."
CD007431,0,158315,0,Normative data on low back mobility and activity levels. Implications for neuromuscular reeducation.,"Low back mobility and electromyographic movements were performed in 121 normal subjects, grouped by age and sex. Women tended to show greater ranges of motion for straight leg raising, trunk rotation and lateral bending while vertebral separation (forward flexion) was greater in men. A sex-age interaction was observed only in lateral bending, thus implying that for other mobility measurements, data within the age groupings employed in this study can be combined for men and women. Electromyographic data were integrated and quantified using EMG biofeedback equipment for unilateral or bilateral recordings made primarily from the erector spinae muscle between lumbar 3-4 and lumbar 4-5 levels, three centimeters lateral to the spinous processes. Dynamic (trunk flexion-extension, lateral rotation-standing, stooping) and static (quiet sitting, rotation-sitting) movements were performed over a ten second interval. Data analyses verified previous electromyographic studies by demonstrating the trunk extensor function of the erector spinae and the relatively greater unilateral activity when turning to the opposite direction in the erect posture. EMG silence was seen during full trunk flexion. Noticeable sex-age interaction were observed for all dynamic movements but not for static activities. Therefore, it is suggested that EMG data during dynamic movements in a normal population cannot be grouped for men and women within a specified age distribution. These data represent one series of baselines to which mobility and movement patterns in a back pain patient group can be compared. Suggestions are offered for the use of EMG biofeedback during dynamic lower back movements as a possible method of alleviating the pain state, perhaps by altering the patient's posture."

The clinical symptoms, usually emerging in the middle-aged, may be characterized by either simple radicular pain with or without neurological deficit or by exercise-dependent transient functional disturbance of the cauda equina, namely, the so-called neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC). In most cases, NIC is due to mechanical compression of the cauda fibers as a result of extension of the patient's lumbar spine. In some patients, exercise-induced ischemic radiculopathy is assumed to be the main factor.

Changes in lumbar spinal motion after surgery were also correlated with the clinical results. The clinical and myelographic predictions were similar to previously published studies. The present study showed that patients with a sequestrated or prolapsed disc lesion (as opposed to bulging disc) had an abnormally large lateral bend or axial rotation during flexion and extension at the level above, which reduced after surgery. Primary lumbar spinal motions (flexion and extension) were generally reduced to half of the normal value and were not significantly altered by surgery. The restriction of lumbar spinal motion was not significantly reflected in the clinical results, which were satisfactory in most cases. Discectomy by fenestration and minimal resection of the lamina did not produce instability."

CD007431,0,1514885,0,Intrathecal baclofen in hereditary spastic paraparesis.,"Intrathecal baclofen has not been previously evaluated for the treatment of the disabling hypertonia associated with hereditary spastic paraparesis. Muscle tone and deep-tendon reflexes were evaluated in three patients with hereditary spastic paraparesis after a double-blind, cross-over bolus injection of intrathecal baclofen. Patients underwent placement of a subcutaneous pump for continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen. Three months after implantation the muscle tone decreased 2.04 points (p less than .0001) and the reflex score decreased 2.25 points (p less than .001). Patients initially reported subjective weakness, but muscle testing revealed either an increase or no change in voluntary motor function. Baclofen doses of 60 to 264 micrograms per day were required for effective control of muscle tone and spasticity. Much of the disability in familial spastic paraparesis may be related to the loss of suprasegmental inhibition of spinal reflexes overwhelming the residual voluntary motor function."

CD007431,0,8849475,0,[Spondylodiscitis after operation for lumbar disc herniation].,"Postoperative spondylodiscitis (POD) is a rare but severe complication of lumbar disc surgery. There were five patients with POD among 875 patients undergoing surgery for herniated lumbar discs, in the last 16 years. For detecting risk factor of discitis, a POD group of 5 patients was matched to a control group of 870 patients with respect to sex, age, disc type and operation. In five patients with POD follow-up evaluation of clinical symptoms, laboratory data were obtained, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed. A significant difference between the POD group and the control group was confirmed in sex, operation time and the volume of bleeding during operation. However, there was no significant difference confirmed due to age, disc type, disc level and operative procedure. In the case of males or prolonged operation time or increase of the volume of bleeding, POD may be more frequently observed. All five patients had a period of pain relief after their operations and then reported increasing low back pain with no focal signs. At diagnosis of POD all patients had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 30 per hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) higher than 2.5. After treatment by antibiotics, low back pain gradually receded along with decrease of ESR and CRP. About 40 days later, these patients were almost free of back pain and ESR and CRP were within normal range. MRT1-weighted image during the acute phase demonstrated remarkably decreased signal intensity with loss of distinction between vertebral body and disc space. T2-weighted image showed increased signal intensity in the adjacent vertebral bodies and end-plates. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image had homogenous enhancement of vertebral body and disc space. During the subacute phase, however, T1-weighted image demonstrated moderately decreased signal intensity noted in the posteroinferior portion of the L5 vertebral body and the narrowed L5/S1 disc space. T2-weighted image showed iso signal intensity in L5 and S1 vertebral bodies. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image had mild homogenous enhancement in the posteroinferior portion of the L5 vertebral body. Three months after treatment of POD, there was major signal change in neither T1 nor T2 weighted images, though T2 showed subtle abnormalities with decreased signal intensity adjacent to the L5/S1 disc space."
CD007431,0,343479,0,Double blind evaluation of extradural methyl prednisolone for herniated lumbar discs.,"A double blind study was carried out in 51 patients suffering from lumbar root compression syndrome of 12 days to 36 weeks duration. All patients had signs, symptoms and radiological abnormalities related to a herniated lumbar disc. Each patient received an extradural injection of either 2 ml (80 mg) methyl prednisolone or 2 ml normal saline solution. Neurological examination and interview of the patients with the aid of a questionnaire before and after extradural injection failed to demonstrate any statistically significant difference in outcome between the two groups. At follow-up 14 +/- 6 months after extradural injection 58.3 per cent of the patients in the control group and 51.9 per cent of the patients in the treatment group had undergone surgical treatment with laminectomy. Our results indicate that a single extradural injection of methyl prednisolone (80 mg) is no more effective than a placebo injection in relieving chronic symptoms due to myelographically demonstrable lumbar disc herniation."

It has been used with lumbar microdiscectomy to facilitate management of surgical pain, shorten patient recovery time, and increase patient satisfaction with the procedure and the hospital stay. Adcon-L (Gliatech, Inc., Cleveland, OH) (adhesion control in a barrier gel) has been demonstrated to act as a barrier to the development of epidural fibrosis after lumbar procedures, minimizing the formation of fibrotic scar and improving the long-term outcome. In this study, we used Adcon-L as a vehicle to administer 1 mg of morphine epidurally to patients who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy. Our objective was to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy of this compound."

Analysis of serial 24 hour urine collections showed a significant increase in urinary glycosaminoglycan after chemonucleolysis. This was not detected in four patients undergoing routine discography. Enzymic analysis of urinary glycosaminoglycan after chemonucleolysis suggested that the increase in levels was largely due to an increase in the amounts of chondroitin sulphate present, probably resulting from proteoglycan breakdown in the intervertebral disc. Eight of the patients treated by chemonucleolysis underwent serial computed tomography (CT). One month after the injection the only change seen was a loss of definition of the disc prolapse, which could be interpreted as a loss of turgidity in the disc as a result of proteoglycan breakdown by chymopapain. By six months the CT of those patients whose symptoms had improved showed that the degree of disc prolapse was usually less marked and the disc margin more clearly defined, suggesting that by this stage anatomical remodelling had occurred."
CD007431,0,531621,0,A comparison of radiographic findings in fusion and nonfusion patients ten or more years following lumbar disc surgery.,"Ninety-six patients who had undergone disc excision and midline spinal fusion and 36 patients who had had simple disc excision had spinal radiographs made 10 or more years postoperatively. Claw spurs were found most commonly at the L2-3 and L3-4 levels in fusion patients, particularly male laborers. Traction spurs with segmental hypermobility were found more commonly at the L4-5 level in patients whose spines were not fused, particularly women. Total lumbar flexion-extension was greater in nonfusion than in fusion patients, but the L1-3 mobility was greater in those who had undergone fusion, suggesting a compensatory increase in the range of lumbar motion. Segmental mobility at levels of surgery in nonfusion patients was similar in those with good and those with poor clinical results. Disc space narrowing was common at levels of operation, but did not correspond to the clinical result. Pseudarthrosis was demonstrated in 26% of fusion patients, but was of no clinical significance. Although complex radiographic changes follow lumbar disc surgery, with or without failure, it is concluded that the plane radiograph is of little aid in determining the source of postoperative pain. The sole exception is that of acquired spondylolysis, which was found in 2.5% of this group of fusion patients, and was clearly associated with a poor clinical outcome. Symptomatic degenerative disc disease at levels above lumbar spinal fusions appears to be an uncommon clinical problem."

CD007431,0,10085392,0,Muscle force and bone mineral density after parathyroidectomy and subcutaneous autotransplantation for secondary hyperparathyroidism.,"The object of this study was to determine the muscle force and bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism before and 3 months after operation. Thirty-nine patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and regular dialysis were operated. Their ages were 47 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD) years and duration of dialysis was 70.5 +/- 35.8 months. The clinical symptoms included bone pain in 23 patients (59%), skin itching in 21 (53.8%), general weakness in 13 (33.3%), conscious disturbance in 2, chest tightness in 1, and failure to thrive in 1. Total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation of 60 mg of parathyroid gland into subcutaneous tissue was done routinely. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and left proximal femur, expressed as grams per square centimeter and as fracture risk. The extension force of the quadriceps muscle was measured at 60 degrees of right knee flexion, expressed as newtons (N) in a peak force and an average force. Three months after operation the BMD of the study group increased (in g/cm2) from 1.063 +/- 0.181 to 1.148 +/- 0.149 (p < 0.001) in L2-4 (n = 25), from 0.792 +/- 0.14 to 0.875 +/- 0.161 (p < 0.001), in femoral neck (n = 25), from 0.672 +/- 0.171 to 0.754 +/- 0.21 (p < 0. 001) in Ward's triangle (n = 25), and from 0.69 +/- 0.149 to 0.738 +/- 0.143 (p < 0.001) in trochanter (n = 25). Fracture risk also was reduced significantly 3 months after operation at L2-4 (p = 0.003), femoral neck (p = 0.001), Ward's triangle (p= 0.003), and trochanter (p = 0.005). Muscle force (in newtons) increased from 264.8 +/- 110. 5 to 326 +/- 110.9 (p = 0.023) in peak force (n = 18) and from 195.3 +/- 90.4 to 258 +/- 99 (p = 0.012) in average force (n = 18). The patients with general weakness had improved muscle force more prominently than those without general weakness. In addition to skin itching, bone pain, and soft tissue calcification, general weakness that causes disability is an indication for surgery in secondary hyperparathyroidism. After parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation, the muscle force tends to increase, especially in those with general weakness. An increment of BMD and reduction of fracture risk are also found after surgery."

CD007431,0,9703438,0,True neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: electrophysiological diagnosis in six cases.,"We report 6 patients with true neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. All were female and presented unilateral severe atrophy of the thenar muscles. Pain in the affected upper limb was frequently reported, but sensory deficit was slight or absent. Reduced amplitude of ulnar and median compound muscle action potential associated with a normal amplitude of median sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and a reduced amplitude of ulnar SNAP was indicative of a chronic axon loss in the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. The absence of the medial antebrachial cutaneous SNAP in 5 patients and a reduction in amplitude compared to the unaffected side in the other patient indicated a C8-T1 postganglionic radicular lesion or a lower brachial plexus neuropathy. Radiography showed a rudimentary bilateral cervical rib or an elongated C7 transverse process in all cases. Surgery was performed, and in each case the lower part of the brachial plexus was found to be stretched and angulated over a fibrous band, which was removed. Pain was relieved after 1-4 weeks, but at 1 year, there was only minimal motor improvement and the electrophysiological results were unchanged."
CD007431,0,16523129,0,Surgical treatment of spinal brucellosis.,"We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients with spinal brucellosis of the thoracic and lumbar spine who were treated successfully with a combination of surgery and antibiotics. All patients had back pain; six patients had radiculopathy and one patient had paraparesis. Patients with spondylodiscitis without epidural abscesses (n = 3) had transpedicle discectomy and drainage. Epidural abscesses in the lumbar area caused by spondylodiscitis (n = 3), spondylitis (n = 2), and discitis with infected disc herniation (n = 1), were drained using a posterior approach combined with posterolateral fusion in two patients with spondylodiscitis and discectomy in the patient with a herniated disc. One patient presented with a pathologic fracture and neural compression and was treated with anterior corpectomy and reconstruction. Antibiotic treatment was given for 3 to 9 months. Mean followup was 3 years. Back pain improved soon after surgery. Recovery from radiculopathy and paraparesis was complete. One patient had recurrence of infection 9 months after initial treatment. Clinical manifestation of spinal brucellosis can include spondylitis, spondylodiscitis, discitis, epidural abscess, paraspinal abscess, and vertebral collapse. Transpedicle drainage allows tissue diagnosis and facilitates treatment. Because brucellosis usually responds to antibiotics, surgery is considered as the last resort in treating spinal brucellosis, but severe neurologic deficit and incapacitating back pain often necessitate surgical intervention."

Clinical characteristics were compared in patients with compression of the radiculo-medullar artery (n = 100) and of the large radicular vein (n = 100). Significant for the differential diagnosis are the rate of myeloischemia evolution, characteristics and the time-course of the pain syndrome, the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid and the topography of ischemia in the transverse section of the spinal cord. The necessity of differentiating between arterial and venous radiculomyeloischemia is dictated by the advisability of the inclusion into the therapeutic complex of special vasoactive drugs (improving the arterial blood flow) or venotonics.

CD007431,0,15744815,0,Surgical treatments for lumbar disc disease in adolescent patients; chemonucleolysis / microsurgical discectomy/ PLIF with cages.,"The herniated lumbar disc (HLD) in adolescent patients is characterized by typical discogenic pain that originates from a soft herniated disc. It is frequently related to back trauma, and sometimes it is also combined with a degenerative process and a bony spur such as posterior Schmorl's node. Chemonucleolysis is an excellent minimally invasive treatment having these criteria: leg pain rather than back pain, severe limitation on the straight leg raising test (SLRT), and soft disc protrusion on computed tomography (CT). Microsurgical discectomy is useful in the cases of extruded or sequestered HLD and lateral recess stenosis due to bony spur because the nerve root is not decompressed with chymopapain. Spinal fusion, like as PLIF, should be considered in the cases of severe disc degeneration, instability, and stenosis due to posterior central bony spur. In our study, 185 adolescent patients, whose follow-up period was more than 1 year (the range was 1-4 years), underwent spinal surgery due to HLD from March, 1998 to December, 2002 at our institute. Among these cases, we performed chemonucleolysis in 65 cases, microsurgical discectomy in 94 cases, and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with cages in 33 cases including 7 reoperation cases. The clinical success rate was 91% for chemonucleolysis, 95% for microsurgical disectomy, and 89% for PLIF with cages, and there were no non- union cases for the PLIF patients with cages. In adolescent HLD, chemonucleolysis was the 1st choice of treatment because the soft adolescent HLD was effectively treated with chemonucleolysis, especially when the patient satisfied the chemonucleolysis indications."

The results demonstrated a 98% success rate in the microsurgical group as compared to a 95% success rate in the standard laminectomy group. Of microdiscectomy patients, 95% had an excellent result, as compared to 89% of the standard laminectomy group. Patients with pending compensation cases did only slightly poorer than those with no secondary gain regardless of what procedure was used. The postoperative hospital stay of the microsurgical patients averaged 3.7 days as compared to 7.1 for the standard technique.

CD007431,0,1951193,0,Overbite and overjet characteristics of refined diagnostic groups of temporomandibular disorder patients.,"Overbite and overjet were studied as continuous variables to examine for any relationship to diagnostic groups of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) compared with symptom-free controls. This avoided the bias of arbitrary definitions of normal and abnormal for these occlusal variables and also avoided the masking effect of studying symptoms rather than diagnostic entities. Incisal overbite in primary osteoarthrosis (OA) was shifted toward the minimal and open bite ranges as compared with the controls (p less than 0.02). Open bite occurred in only the two OA classes studied and in a few cases with myalgia only but was absent in the symptom-free controls. Overbite in myalgia was slightly skewed to the lower range. Deep bite was not more common in the myalgia, disk displacement (with or without reduction), or the OA groups. Increased overjet characterized OA groups, especially when there was a history of derangement (p less than 0.004), but did not characterize the other diagnostic groups. Except for open bite, overbite and overjet characteristics as isolated variables did not distinguish TMD patient groups. It is hypothesized that open bite in OA can be the result of joint changes rather than a predisposing occlusal cause."

CD007431,0,11888226,0,Clonidine for treatment of postoperative pain: a dose-finding study.,"The aim of this double-blind randomized study was to evaluate the optimal intravenous dose of clonidine administrated during the peri-operative period, after lumbar hemilaminectomy for herniated disk repair. The ""optimal intravenous dose"" was defined as that providing minimal analgesic request, stable haemodynamic profile and a minimal sedation score during 12h after extubation. Eighty adult patients, ASA physical status I-II, undergoing lumbar hemilaminectomy for herniated disk (L(4)-L(5), L(5)-S(1)) were included in the study. All the patients were randomly assigned to one of four study groups (A, B, C, D), 20 patients each. The same standardized general anaesthesia was performed for each group. Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, group A, B and C patients received three different loading doses of intravenous clonidine (5 microg/kg, 3 microg/kg, 2 microg/kg respectively), followed by the same infusion of intravenous clonidine (0.3 microg/kg per hour). Group D patients received a bolus dose and a continuous infusion of NaCl 0.9%. In the recovery unit, postoperative pain was treated by a patient-controlled analgesia device, containing morphine. Pain relief was evaluated by the total morphine requirement during the postoperative period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate and sedation were also noted during the first 12h postoperatively. Intravenous clonidine decreased morphine requirements in a dose-dependent manner. Group A, B, C and D patients requested 5 +/- 2, 11 +/- 3, 19 +/- 4 and 29 +/- 8 doses of morphine respectively. Clonidine also affected SBP in a dose-related manner. Group A, B and C patients had an SBP decrease respectively of 26 +/- 3%, 7 +/- 4% and 2 +/- 2% compared with basic values while, at the same time, in group D patients no SBP variation was registered. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, when sedation and analgesic effect of clonidine is required, 3 microg/kg bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion of 0.3 microg/kg per hour has to be considered the optimal intravenous dose. The higher dose of intravenous clonidine (5 microg/kg) produced better analgesia but the degree of hypotension and sedation was more severe and longer lasting; it required ephedrine administration and careful monitoring of the patient. On the other hand, the bolus of intravenous clonidine 2 microg/kg (group C) was less effective in terms of pain relief but with similar side-effects to the 3 microg/kg dosage (group B)."
CD007431,0,12027817,0,Possible role of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament in women with peripartum pelvic pain.,"To enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology of women with peripartum pelvic pain, it is necessary to couple anatomical insights with relevant clinical research. In this context, the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament is especially of interest because it was noticed that women diagnosed with peripartum pelvic pain frequently experience pain within the boundaries of this ligament. Njoo (1) found a high intertester reliability and a high specificity for long dorsal sacroiliac ligament pain.

CD007431,0,8367787,0,Straight leg raising. Anatomical effects on the spinal nerve root without and with fusion.,"Straight leg raising (SLR) is a useful clinical test to demonstrate an inflammatory compressive process across a spinal nerve root. Several previous studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of SLR on nerve root motion, but the exact direction and amount of this motion is still unclear. Components of the SLR test that have not been adequately addressed include the effect of SLR on the intact dural-nerve root system, motion of the nerve tissues as distinct from the dura, and nerve root strain. Separately, spinal fusion is occasionally used as an adjunct to discectomy to decrease instability and subsequent ""nerve root irritation."" The effect of a one-level fusion on in situ nerve root biomechanics, however, has not been evaluated. Ten fresh human cadavers underwent posterior lumbar laminectomies. Spinal nerve root motion was studied while a SLR maneuver was performed. Data was recorded photographically and statistically analyzed. The results were as follows: 1) SLR induced both linear motion (0.5-5 mm) and strain (2-4%) in spinal nerves L4, L5, and S1; 2) The dura moved less than the intrathecal nerve root at the pedicle and experienced more strain (P < .05). 3) The nerve roots moved laterally toward the pedicle and thus would move into a posterolaterally herniated disc. 4) Rigid anterior stabilization did not decrease nerve root motion or strain."
CD007431,0,11284597,0,Treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain with epidural steroid injections.,"Fifty patients with an average age of 47 years received epidural steroid injections for lumbosacral radicular pain due to disk herniation or spinal stenosis. All patients had failed previous conservative treatment. Mean follow-up was 24 months (range: 12-36 months). Immediately after injection, all 50 patients reported various degrees of relief from leg and back pain. At the last follow-up examination, 68% of patients were asymptomatic, 20% had no change in preinjection radicular symptoms, and 12% had various degrees of relief. No significant correlation was found between pain relief, age, or number of injections. Early pain relief may be anticipated after epidural steroid injections in 80% of patients with radicular symptoms due to disk herniation or spinal stenosis."

Among the patients spinal pain is the constant clinical complaint, while radicular pain and scoliosis are present in half of the patients. Whereas radiograms and tomograms of the spine are sometimes inadequate for diagnosis, bone scanning is positive in 100% of patients and is useful for directing spinal computed tomography at the exact level of the lesion. Complete removal of the tumoral nidus produces remission of pain in more than 95% of cases. The possibility of an erroneous diagnosis of a lumbar protruded disk and the necessity of a bone scan in young patients with spinal or radicular pain are emphasized."
CD007431,0,8836692,0,Changes in motor activity and biomechanics during balance recovery following cutaneous and muscular deafferentation.,"The effects of lower limb deafferentation were examined during execution of a balance recovery step following a forward fall induced by release of an initial inclined posture. The subjects were healthy control subjects and patients with a unilateral loss of the Achilles tendon reflex following S1 radiculitis. Deafferentation of healthy subjects was obtained by unilateral leg ischemia (four subjects) and by foot anesthesia (five subjects). The balance recovery step was characterized by the surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of right and left soleus and tibialis anterior muscles and the kinetics of the center of gravity and center of foot pressure. Experimentally induced and pathological deafferentation decreased the EMG activity of the ipsilateral soleus and lowered the vertical ground reaction force. The lower limb motor activity was more affected by loss of muscle proprioceptive afferents than by loss of plantar cutaneous afferents. Patients showed early and bilateral changes in soleus and tibialis activities, whichever side was affected. The step length of patients was also shorter than that of controls, but it remained similar before and after deafferentation in the healthy subjects. The results are discussed in terms of ipsilateral and crossed pathway connections and functional adaptive strategies."

Included were 28 (62%) woman and 17 (38%) men, with a mean age of 46 years. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 2 years. Intra-operatively, disc herniation was graded as a protrusion in 23 (51%) patients and as a prolapse in 22 (49%) patients. During the follow-up, sciatic pain completely recovered or markedly diminished in 38 (84%) patients and 35 (78%) patients returned to work. The occupational outcome of the patients operated on for a protrusion was inferior to that of the patients operated on for a prolapse: only 22% of the patients who underwent surgery for a protrusion reported to manage their work well, while as many as 41% of those with a prolapse managed well (p = 0.04). Pre-operatively, clinical examination revealed segmental instability of the lumbar spine in 11 (24%) patients. There was a significant association between instability and unsatisfactory long-term outcome: of the patients with pre-operative instability, 45% were postoperatively retired or on sick leave because of the back, as compared to 15% of the 34 patients without instability (p = 0.03). Furthermore, patients with instability suffered from sciatica and low back pain significantly (p = 0.02) more often than those without instability. Surgical complications were infrequent. There were no nerve root lesions and no vascular injuries. Postoperative discitis developed in 2 (4%) patients. Of all patients, only 1 (2%) has been re-operated on for a recurrent disc."

Nine had normal CT scans but abnormal EMGs, and five patients had normal EMGs but abnormal CT scans. Thirteen of the 80 patients were further investigated with myelography, 22 patients underwent surgical exploration, and the remainder received conservative therapy. In the majority of cases, surgery confirmed the abnormal CT and EMG findings; in some instances, however, myelography and/or surgery confirmed the abnormality only at the level demonstrated on EMG. The CT and EMG often agree. However, an abnormal EMG seems to correlate better with the demonstrated course of radiculopathy than CT."

Twenty patients (median age 29.5, 16 women) with operatively verified neurovascular compression by a cervical rib or band were examined. All complained of pain and paraesthesias in the hand. In 12 vasomotor disturbances (pallor or lividity, low skin temperature, Raynaud's phenomenon) were also observed. Clinical diagnosis was supported by the provocative tests (Adson, Wright, costoclavicular) in 14persons. Neurologic signs were present in 2 patients in ""pseudoulnar"" distribution. Anterior scalenectomy was performed with success in 15 cases, 4 remained unchanged and 1 worsened. Electrodiagnostic tests were normal in all 18 patients without neurologic signs. We note a tendency for the digital nerves sensory action potentials in patients with TOS to be higher than usual It is concluded that electrodiagnosis is useless in confirming the presence of TOS, but it is very useful to exclude other painful conditions that require other treatments (carpal and cubital tunnel syndromes, cervical radiculopathies etc)."
CD007431,0,16768220,0,[Therapeutic effect of dexalgin on disturbances of vertebrogenic and nonvertebrogenic mechanisms in back pain].,"To evaluate the effect of Dexalgin on dysregulation mechanisms in the complex therapy of dorsalgia, 39 patients have been studied. They were divided into 2 groups: with vertebrogenic (23 patients) and without vertebrogenic (16 patients) pain syndrome. Dexalgin was prescribed in dosage 75 mg daily during 5 days. Its efficacy was measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire, OBPDQ in case of low back pain. Electromyographic (EMG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed in radiculopathic patients receiving dexalgin. The results revealed a statistically significant decrease of the VAS values at the control examination in both groups of patients (p<0,001) with background RI values being 18,4 +/- 9,7 and 21,2 +/- 11,7, respectively. The considerable reduction of RI to 14,6 +/- 9,2 was observed in the second group (p=0,044) on day 5. Dynamic examination showed the predominant decrease of OBPDQ percentage values in patients with myofascial back pain (p=0,038). The EMG data demonstrated a tendency to reduction of spontaneous activity in muscular fibers and normalization of the H-reflex latency during the tibial nerve conduction study in patients with vertebrogenic dorsalgia (p=0,058 and p=0,064, respectively). Dexalgin is the new generation of nonsteroid analgesics possessing potential in treatment of both, acute and exacerbations of chronic dorsalgias.

Part I: Etiology, pathogenesis, pathomorphology, and clinical features.","The authors analyze the clinical features and the results of various imaging studies in 77 patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. The most commonly olisthetic vertebra was L-4, followed by L-3. The extent of the olisthesis ranged from 8-43%. Forty-two percent of the patients with L-3 or L-4 olisthesis had reduced mobility of the underlying vertebra. Five different clinical pictures were present: no symptoms except occasional low back pain; chronic low back pain with no radicular symptoms; radicular symptoms and no signs of nerve root compression, with or without low back pain; radicular symptoms with neurologic deficit; intermittent claudication. Various pathological conditions were identified: slight narrowing of the central spinal canal without compression of neural structures; isolated stenosis of the nerve root canal; stenosis of both the nerve root canal and the central spinal canal. The onset of degenerative spondylolisthesis seems to be connected to excessive shear forces on the olisthetic vertebra. The extent of neural structure compression, and thus the clinical picture, depends on three factors: the primitive size of the spinal canal, the extent of degenerative changes in the zygapophyseal joints, and the extent of olisthesis."
CD007431,0,2718865,0,The anatomic basis of vertebrogenic pain and the autonomic syndrome associated with lumbar disk extrusion.,"Extruded lumbar intervertebral disks traditionally have been classified as posterior or central in location. A retrospective review of 250 MR imaging examinations of the lumbar spine that used mid- and high-field imagers revealed 145 positive studies, which included a significant number of extrusions extending anteriorly. With the lateral margin of the neural foramen/pedicle as the boundary, 29.2% of peripheral disk extrusions were anterior and 56.4% were posterior. In addition, a prevalence of 14.4% was found for central disk extrusions, in which there was a rupture of disk material into or through the vertebral body itself. The clinical state of neurogenic spinal radiculopathy accompanying posterior disk extrusion has been well defined; however, uncomplicated anterior and central disk extrusions also may be associated with a definite clinical syndrome. The vertebrogenic symptom complex includes (1) local and referred pain and (2) autonomic reflex dysfunction within the lumbosacral zones of Head. Generalized alterations in viscerosomatic tone potentially may also be observed. The anatomic basis for the mediation of clinical signs and symptoms generated within the disk and paradiskal structures rests with afferent sensory fibers from two primary sources: (1) posterolateral neural branches emanating from the ventral ramus of the somatic spinal root and (2) neural rami projecting directly to the paravertebral autonomic neural plexus. Thus, conscious perception and unconscious effects originating in the vertebral column, although complex, have definite pathways represented in this dual peripheral innervation associated with intimately related and/or parallel central ramifications. It is further proposed that the specific clinical manifestations of the autonomic syndrome are mediated predominantly, if not entirely, within the sympathetic nervous system. The directional differentiation of lumbar disk extrusions by MR, together with a clarification and appreciation of the accompanying clinical somatic and autonomic syndromes, should contribute both to understanding the specific causes as well as to establishing the appropriate treatment of acute and chronic signs and symptoms engendered by many nonspecific disease processes involving the spinal column."

CD007431,0,11793155,0,[Discogenic low back pain and degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis - how appropriate is surgical treatment?].,"Surgery in acute and/or chronic low back pain is still a matter of intensive and controversial discussions. A vast number of minimally invasive or so called semi-invasive procedures have been published in the last 3 decades, but evidence-based data on efficacy and benefit of most of these techniques are still lacking. However, empirical data suggest good or at least satisfactory clinical results for a limited number of procedures if they are applied under restrictive indication criteria. Discogenic low back pain and lumbar spinal stenosis belong to the most frequent diagnoses associated with low back pain. This article gives a survey on definitions, indication criteria and modern surgical or semi- invasive techniques used for the treatment of these two pathologic entities. Discogenic low back pain: This clinical and morphological entity is defined as low back pain arising mainly from disc degeneration. Pain generators are usually nociceptors in the cartilaginous endplates, in the outer anulus fibrosus as well as in the periosteum of the vertebral bodies. Clinical symptoms correlate with morphologic changes detected with MR-imaging (modic type I) or with contained disc protrusions mainly without neurological symptoms. Surgery is rarely indicated, spontaneous remissions occur in more than 60% of all cases. Spinal fusion has been the only surgical option in cases which did not respond to conservative therapy. Recently, electro-thermal modulation of the posterior anulus fibrosus has been published as a semi- invasive technique to relieve low back pain generated by fissures in the outer anulus and ingrowing nociceptors (intradiscal electro-thermal therapy, IDET(TM)). First results are promising, however, prospective randomised studies comparing this technique with conservative therapy are still lacking. The same is true for artificial nucleus pulposus replacement using hydrogel cushions implanted in the intervertebral space after removal of the nucleus pulposus from posterior or through an anterior approach (PDN, prosthetic disc nucleus(TM)). In cases with severe disc degeneration total disc replacement is another innovative option (ProDisc(TM)). Two metal endplates with titanium surface coating are implanted through a minimal invasive anterior approach (mini-laparotomy). A polyethylene inlay anchored in the caudal endplate holds the distance between the endplates and preserves the physiological range of motion between the two vertebral bodies. Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis: Narrowing of the spinal canal due to degenerative changes of the disc, the facet joints and thickening of the yellow ligament is a geriatric disease which is diagnosed in increasing numbers within the last 10 years. More than 80% of the patients present with low back pain in association with neurogenic claudication. Neurological symptoms at rest are less frequently found. The spontaneous course shows progressive symptoms in more than 50% of all patients. More than 35% of the patients have associated diseases which might influence the perioperative course, complication rates and outcomes of surgery. Surgery is indicated in patients with progressive neurological symptoms, unacceptable decrease of quality of life or progressive intractable pain. In patients with mainly ""leg symptoms"" microsurgical mono- or multisegmental decompression is the procedure of choice. If low back pain is predominant and associated with degenerative instability such as degenerative spondylolisthesis or lumbar scoliosis, decompression must be combined with instrumented spinal fusion. In general a restrictive indication for surgery must be recommended especially for spinal fusion procedures. Non-fusion techniques such as intradiscal electro thermal therapy or spine arthroplasty with replacement of nucleus pulposus or total disc show promising early results; however, little is known about the long-term effect. It should be a principle to apply surgery in the least invasive way."
CD007431,0,11793154,0,[Relevance of nerve blocks in treating and diagnosing low back pain--is the quality decisive?].,"Diagnostic nerve blocks: The popularity of neural blockade as a diagnostic tool in painful conditions, especially in the spine, is due to features like the unspecific character of spinal pain, the irrelevance of radiological findings and the purely subjective character of pain. It is said that apart from specific causes of pain and clear radicular involvement with obvious neurological deficits and corresponding findings of a prolapsed disc in MRI or CT pictures, a diagnosis of the anatomical cause of the pain can only be established if invasive tests are used [5]. These include zygapophyseal joint blocks, sacroiliacal joint blocks, disc stimulation and nerve root blocks. Under controlled conditions, it has been shown that among patients with chronic nonradicular low back pain, some 10-15% have zygapophyseal joint pain [58], some 15-20% have sacroiliacal joint pain [36, 59] and 40% have pain from internal disc disruption [60]. The diagnostic use of neural blockade rests on three premises. First, pathology causing pain is located in an exact peripheral location, and impulses from this site travel via a unique and consistent neural root. Second, injection of local aneasthetic totally abolishes sensory function of intended nerves and does not affect other nerves. Third, relief of pain after local anaesthetic block is attributable solely to block of the target afferent neural pathway. The validity of these assumptions is limited by complexities of anatomy, physiology, and psychology of pain perception and the effect of local anaesthetics on impulse conduction [28]. Facet joints: The prevalence of zygapophyseal joint pain among patients with low back pain seems to be between 15% and 40% [62], but apparently only 7% of patients have pure facet pain [8, 29]. Facet blockade is achieved either by injection of local anaesthetic into the joint space or around the medial branches of the posterior medial rami of the spinal nerves that innervate the joint. There are several problems with intraarticular facet injections, mainly failure to enter the joint capsule and rupture of the capsule during the injection [11]. There is no physiological means to test the adaequacy of medial nerve block, because the lower branches have no cutaneous innervation. Medial ramus blocks (for one joint two nerves have to be infiltrated) are as effective as intraarticular joint blocks [37]. Reproducibility of the test is not high, the specifity is only 65% [61]. For diagnosis of facet pain fluoroscopic control is always necessary as in the other diagnostic blocks. Sacroiliacal joint: Definitely the sacroiliacal joint can be the source of low back pain. Stimulation of the joint by injection in subjects without pain produces pain in the buttock, in the posterior thigh and the knee. There are many clinical tests which confirm the diagnosis, but the interrater reliability is moderate [53]. Intraarticular injection can be achieved in the lower part of the joint with fluoroscopic guidance only, but an accurate intraarticular injection, which is confirmed by contrast medium, even at this place is often difficult. It is not clear whether intraarticular spread is necessary to achieve efficacy. Discography: Two primary syndromes concerning the ventral compartment have been described: anular fissures of the disc and instability of the motion segment. In the syndrome of anular tear, leakage of nucleus pulposus material into the anulus fibrosus is considered to be the source of pain. The studies of Vaharanta [71] and Moneta [41] show a clear and significant correlation between disc pain and grade 3 fissures of the anulus fibrosus. intervertebral discs are difficult to anaesthetize. Intradiskal injections of local anaesthetics may succeed in relieving the patient's pain, but such injections are liable to yield false negative results if the injected agent fails to adequately infiltrate the nerve endings in the outer anulus fibrosus that mediate the patient's pain. In the majority of cases MRI provide adaequate information, but discography may be superior in early stages of anular tear and in clarifying the relation between imaging data and pain [71]. Selective spinal nerve injection: In patients with complicated radiculopathy, the contribution of root inflammation to pain may not be certain, or the level of pathology may be unclear. Diagnostic root blocks are indicated in the following situations: atypical topography of radicular pain, disc prolapses or central spinal stenosis at more than one level and monoradicular pain, lateral spinal stenosis, postnucleotomysyndrome. Injection of individual spinal nerves by paravertebral approach has to be used to elucidate the mechanism and source of pain in this unclear situations. The premise is that needle contact will identify the nerve that produces the patient's characteristic pain and that local anaesthetic delivered to the pathogenic nerve will be uniquely analgesic. Often, this method is used for surgical planning, such as determining the site of foraminotomy. All diagnostic nerve root blocks have to be done under fluoroscopic guidance. Pain relief with blockade of a spinal nerve cannot distinguish between pathology of the proximal nerve in the intervertebral foramen or pain transmitted from distal sites by that nerve. Besides, the tissue injury in the nerve's distribution and neuropathic pain (for instance as a result of root injury) likewise would be relieved by a proximal block of the nerve. Satisfactory needle placement could not be achieved in 10% of patient's at L4, 15% at L5 and 30% at S1 [28]. The positive predictive value of indicated radiculopathy confirmed by surgery ranged between 87-100% [14, 22]. The negative predictive value is poorly studied, because few patients in the negative test group had surgery. Negative predictive values were 27% and 38% of the small number of patients operated on despite a negative test. Only one prospective study was published, which showed a positive predictive value of 95% and an untested negative predictive value [66]. Some studies repeatedly demonstrated that pain relief by nerve root block does not predict success by neuroablative procedures, neither by dorsal rhyzotomy nor by dorsal gangliectomy [46]. Therapeutic nerve blocks - facet joints: Intraarticular injection of steroids offer no greater benefit than injections of normal saline [8, 15] and long lasting success is lacking. In this case, a denervation of the medial branches can be considered. To date three randomized controlled studies of radiofrequency facet denervation have been published. One study [20] reported only modest outcomes and its results remained inconclusive, another study [72] with a double blind controlled design showed some effects in a small selected group of patients (adjusted odds ratio 4.8) 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, concerning not only reduction of pain but alleviating functional disability also. The third study (34a) showed no effect 3 months after treatment. Discogenic pain: Intradiscal radiofrequency lesions, intradiscal injections of steroids and phenol have been advocated, but there are no well controlled studies. Just recently, intradiscal lesion and denervation of the anulus has been described with promising results, but a randomized controlled study is lacking up to now [31, 55]. Epidural Steroids: Steroids relieve pain by reducing inflammation and by blocking transmission of nociceptive C-fiber input. Koes et al. [33] reviewed the randomized trials of epidural steroids: To date, 15 trials have been performed to evaluate the efficacy, 11 of which showed method scores of 50 points (from 100) ore more. The trials showed inconsistent results of epidural injections. Of the 15 trials, 8 reported positive results and 7 others reported negative results. Consequently the efficacy of epidural steroid injections has not yet been established. The benefits of epidural steroid injections seem to be of short duration only. Future efficacy studies, which are clearly needed, should take into account the apparent methological shortcomings. Furthermore, it is unclear which patients benefit from these injections. In our hands the injection technique can be much improved by fluoroscopic guidance of the needle, with a prone position of the patient, and lateral injection at the relevant level and with a small volume (1-2 ml) and low dose of corticosteroid (20 mg triamcinolone in the case of a monoradicular pain, for example). In the case of epidural adhesions in postoperative radicular pain [50], the study of Heafner showed that the additional effect of hyaloronidase and hypertonic saline to steroids was minimal. In our hands there was no effect in chronic radicular pain 3 months after the injection."
CD007431,0,1570708,0,[Regression of motor symptoms after intervertebral disk displacement-induced spinal nerve root lesion. Clinical study].,"Ever since the causal relationship between backache, radicular pain and intravertebral disc herniation was established [25], there have been different opinions about the degree of recovery of motor lesions of the nerve root caused by disc herniation. Of 123 patients with a severe motor deficit of the L5 nerve root, 95 patients were available for a follow up examination 4 to 8 years after the operation. The statistical evaluation showed that the degree of recovery of the root lesion was mainly dependent on the age of the patient and the time interval until operation. Even a prior herniation of the disc without much compression of the nerve root can cause chronic damage to the nerve through traction at the trilamellar nerve root fixation. So even in the case of only a small disc hernia with a corresponding nerve root lesion, we would recommend immediate operative therapy."
CD007431,0,1387977,0,Percutaneous laser disc decompression. A new therapeutic modality.,"The authors present a new advance in the treatment of herniated disc disease using percutaneous Nd:YAG laser to vaporize a small portion of nucleus pulposus, thereby decompressing the disc. In vitro and in vivo animal data are presented. Three hundred seventy-seven magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan-documented, herniated, nonsequestered lumbar intervertebral discs with corresponding clinical findings in 333 patients were so treated in an outpatient setting. The longest follow-up was 62 months, with a mean of 26 months. According to the Macnab criteria, there was a good to fair response in 261 patients (78.4%), and a poor response in 72 (21.6%); 166 patients experienced relief of pain during the procedure. One-third of repeat magnetic resonance imaging scans at 4-6 months postlaser treatment showed modest to moderate decrease of disc herniation."
CD007431,0,8915639,0,Determination of trunk motion patterns associated with permanent or transient stenosis of the lumbar spine.,"Dynamometric devices used to assess back function are becoming increasingly used in research as well as in clinical practice. These devices provide values for a variety of movement variables such as torque, displacement, and velocity, but they also enable the study of movement patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the movement patterns of patients presenting with specific spinal pathologies. Thirteen patients with spinal stenosis and 14 patients with degenerative changes and a borderline spinal canal diameter, as well as a control group of 30 symptom-free subjects, were studied. An isoinertial trunk-testing dynamometric device was used. Sagittal velocity and position were measured against a resistance set to 50% of the subject's maximum isometric torque. A phase plane analysis (velocity against position) was performed for each subject. An ensemble averaging technique was used to average the repetitions of every subject and a normalization technique was employed to draw an average graph for each group. This graph showed distinct patterns of movement for the three groups. The differences appeared mostly during the extension phase of movement, as confirmed by statistical analysis. The spinal stenosis group showed lower velocities than the controls during the entire extension phase (P < 0.05), while the borderline spinal canal group demonstrated a significant decrease in velocity at the end of the extension phase (P < 0.01). These findings can be related to the increase in disk bulge and decrease in the diameter of the spinal canal during extension. This study shows the relation between some spinal pathologies and movement patterns. This type of functional assessment may be a valuable tool for assessing the relation between anatomical lesions and function and for determining the responsibility of findings such as bulging disk and/or facet syndrome in causing a patient's complaints."
CD007431,0,8441936,0,Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of percutaneous discectomy. A preliminary report.,"Twenty-one consecutive patients (27 lumbar discs) were treated by percutaneous discectomy for lumbar herniated disc disease from July 1988 through March 1989. Twenty-six discs in 20 patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance images graded by a neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical and prior imaging results. Fifteen patients were treated by one-level percutaneous discectomy and six patients by two-level percutaneous discectomy. The disc herniations were graded with respect to size, type, location, and hydration status on the magnetic resonance image scans. The postoperative magnetic resonance images were obtained 2-6 months after percutaneous discectomy. Early clinical outcomes after percutaneous discectomy were compared with the various magnetic resonance imaging parameters. Overall, treatment for thirteen patients (62%) was considered clinically successful (decrease or elimination of pain) after percutaneous discectomy, whereas treatment for eight (38%) patients was considered to clinically fail (persistence of pain) with follow-up ranging from 1 to 6 months postoperatively. Three of the patients in whom treatment failed have been subsequently treated successfully by laminotomy and discectomy. On the average, there is a small absolute decrease (5% of the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal) in the size of disc herniations when treated by percutaneous discectomy. Although this study is limited by a small sample size and lacks statistical significance, it appears that an early clinical success after percutaneous discectomy may be related to a few magnetic resonance imaging parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,8915635,0,Lumbar disc herniation in patients with developmental spinal stenosis.,"Lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation are usually regarded as two pathogenetically different conditions, but in the literature lumbar disc herniation in patients with developmental spinal stenosis has been rarely documented. In a clinical retrospective study, 42 lumbar disc herniations with developmental spinal stenosis were reported and analyzed. Discectomy was performed after laminotomy. The patients were followed-up for an average of 4.4 years (range 2-7 years). The preoperative symptoms disappeared completely in 28 patients, in 13 patients some degree of backache remained although their nerve root pain had been relieved, and in 1 patient intermittent claudication reappeared after 6 years resolution of their preoperative pain. We conclude that when developmental spinal stenosis is combined with disc herniation, discectomy through laminotomy rather than laminectomy is usually sufficient for decompression."

Before surgery, all patients had disabling pain and limited function. Overall significant improvement in pain and function was obtained in 66% of the patients. Thirteen of 16 patients (81%) who had successful fusion of pseudarthrosis had a satisfactory outcome, whereas only 3 of 13 patients (23%) who had failed pseudarthrosis repair had a satisfactory outcome. Successful pseudarthrosis repair is the key to a high clinical success rate in revision surgery for failed back surgery syndrome. Pseudarthrosis repair by conventional posterolateral fusion with postoperative lumbosacral corset immobilization showed a high failure rate. The success rate of reoperation on failed back surgery syndrome patients is low."
CD007431,0,8594287,0,Diagnosis and management of lumbar disk disease.,"Acute low-back pain is one of the most common problems encountered by primary-care physicians. A few patients have severe neurologic impairment or evidence of cancer or other serious underlying systemic illness. For such patients, a broad differential diagnosis must be considered, and a prompt work-up and specialty consultation may be necessary. For most patients with acute low-back pain, extensive laboratory and imaging tests are unnecessary, and rapid improvement can be expected with only simple treatment measures. Physical therapy is useful in patients with refractory symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging and other sophisticated spinal imaging should usually be reserved for patients who are being considered for an operation. Surgical referral should be considered for the patient with a documented lumbar disk herniation that correlates precisely with clinical findings. Surgical treatment is usually elective in patients with persistent radicular pain and a mild to moderate neurologic deficit, urgent in patients with severe or progressive monoradiculopathy, and emergent in patients with the cauda equina syndrome. Lumbar diskectomy with magnified vision is the surgical procedure of choice, and success rates of 80 to 90% can be expected in properly selected patients."
CD007431,0,15830972,0,Percutaneous cervical nucleoplasty using coblation technology. Clinical results in fifty consecutive cases.,"Conventional open cervical discectomy, with or without bony fusion, in common neurosurgical knowledge is considered the standard treatment for cervical disc herniation. Percutaneous procedures are minimally invasive and offer decreased morbidity, require no bone graft and promise shorter recuperation time. Nevertheless, candidates for a percutaneous procedure as inclusion criteria must complain of symptoms related to contained herniated disc or focal protrusion. It does not substitute conventional open procedures required for extruded discs. We used the coblation technology for nucleoplasty of the cervical intervertebral discs. Early and long-term effects and/or complications observed with this procedure have not been reported yet. Fifty consecutive patients presenting with contained herniated cervical disc or focal protrusion causing compression of the cervical roots or cervical pain underwent a nucleoplasty procedure on the pathological disc. A randomized control group of twenty patients was treated conservatively with medical and physical therapy in the same period and completed the identical follow-up form. In the nucleoplasty group results were complete resolution of symptoms in 80% of cases, only 10% referred some residual cervical or radicular pain and are still under follow-up with a wait-and-see prospective. Patients who did not have a clinical resolution were treated with alternative traditional methods (10%). Despite the relative low cases number and the limited follow-up the encouraging results induce us to utilize this technique in well-selected cases."
CD007431,0,6456101,0,The present status of spinal fusion in the treatment of lumbar intervertebral joint disorders.,"Every type of fusion has its enthusiastic supporters. Unfortunately, the literature includes comparative analyses of various fusion procedures. Much of the effort spent in the clinical assessment of spinal fusion must be reinvested; neither the indications for diskectomy nor spinal fusion have been sufficiently clear-cut and accurately recorded. Moreover, spinal fusions often have not been applied to treat the disorder or to correct the deformity. It is essential at the outset to establish the mechanical fault; this is achieved only by a thorough understanding of the underlying pathologic lesion. Diagnosis follows a careful history and physical examination assisted by plain radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension, radiographs (anteroposterior in left and right lateral bending), and by information obtained from the CAT scan. We have designed a protocol for a prospective investigation wherein a specific fault with a specific etiology and pathologic anatomy is identified and submitted to a surgical procedure in a specified sequence. In future reviews, emphasis must be paid to selection of patients, the individual joint requiring stabilization and the type of fusion performed. Only then can we put this theoretically effective procedure to the acid test of objective clinical evaluation."

The survey of 50 reviewed cases after evaluation of the subjective and objective clinical pictures according to the Cabot method allowed us to come to the conclusion that this percutaneous methodology is suitable to relieve damaged discs from compression. It is also well accepted by patients because it is not too traumatic, it requires short-term hospitalisation, presents no risk of post-operative fibrosis and does not create complications for the eventual traditional operation when unsuccessful. It is extremely important to accurately select the candidates keeping in mind the original indications given by Onik for percutaneous discectomy for which--in case of contained disc herniation--leg pain (sciatalgia) is more severe than low back pain affecting the lumbar region."

CD007431,0,16552534,0,In vivo quantification of human lumbar disc degeneration using T(1rho)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.,"Diagnostic methods and biomarkers of early disc degeneration are needed as emerging treatment technologies develop (e.g., nucleus replacement, total disc arthroplasty, cell therapy, growth factor therapy) to serve as an alternative to lumbar spine fusion in treatment of low back pain. We have recently demonstrated in cadaveric human discs an MR imaging and analysis technique, spin-lock T(1rho)-weighted MRI, which may provide a quantitative, objective, and non-invasive assessment of disc degeneration. The goal of the present study was to assess the feasibility of using T(1rho) MRI in vivo to detect intervertebral disc degeneration. We evaluated ten asymptomatic 40-60-year-old subjects. Each subject was imaged on a 1.5 T whole-body clinical MR scanner. Mean T(1rho) values from a circular region of interest in the center of the nucleus pulposus were calculated from maps generated from a series of T(1rho)-weighted images. The degenerative grade of each lumbar disc was assessed from conventional T(2)-weighted images according to the Pfirmann classification system. The T(1rho) relaxation correlated significantly with disc degeneration (r=-0.51, P<0.01) and the values were consistent with our previous cadaveric study, in which we demonstrated correlation between T(1rho) and proteoglycan content. The technique allows for spatial measurements on a continuous rather than an integer-based scale, minimizes the potential for observer bias, has a greater dynamic range than T(2)-weighted imaging, and can be implemented on a 1.5 T clinical scanner without significant hardware modifications. Thus, there is a strong potential to use T(1rho) in vivo as a non-invasive biomarker of proteoglycan loss and early disc degeneration."

CD007431,0,15681269,0,The impact of neurodynamic testing on the perception of experimentally induced muscle pain.,"Neurodynamic tests such as the straight leg raising (SLR) and slump test are frequently used for assessment of mechanosensitivity of neural tissues. However, there is ongoing debate in the literature regarding the contributions of neural and non-neural tissues to the elicited symptoms because many structures are affected by these tests. Sensitizing manoeuvres are limb or spinal movements added to neurodynamic tests, which aim to identify the origin of the symptoms by preferentially loading or unloading neural structures. A prerequisite for the use of sensitizing manoeuvres to identify neural involvement is that the addition of sensitizing manoeuvres has no impact on pain perception when the origin of the pain is non-neural. In this study, experimental muscle pain was induced by injection of hypertonic saline in tibialis anterior or soleus in 25 asymptomatic, naive volunteers. A first experiment investigated the impact of hip adduction, abduction, medial and lateral rotation in the SLR position. In a second experiment, the different stages of the slump test were examined. The intensity and area of experimentally induced muscle pain did not increase when sensitizing manoeuvres were added to the SLR or throughout the successive stages of the slump test. The findings of this study lend support to the validity of the use of sensitizing manoeuvres during neurodynamic testing."
CD007431,0,2534593,0,[Anomalies of the lumbosacral nerve roots with low backache and sciatica].,"Nine patients with lumbosacral nerve root anomalies (NRA) were reported. 36 cases were collected from reported papers in addition, seven types of NRA were classified by the author.

The rate of finding of NRA by operation was 0.34%, that was far lower than by myelography and autopsy. Careful exploration can increase the finding rate. NRA can induce backache and sciatica by itself. Its clinical distinguishing features were severe symptoms, compression of multiple nerve roots slight or negative Lasegue sign. The principle of treatment of NRA was adequate decompression, but should be careful to avoid injury of displaced and tensile nerve roots. In this paper, the matters needing attention in operation was discussed as well."

CD007431,0,17460175,0,Lumbar spinal stenosis in elderly patients.,"Over a 3-year period in our clinic, surgeons operated on 32 persons over 65 years old with lumbar spinal stenosis. This article presents the retrospective analysis of the clinical, radiological, and short-term surgical outcomes. The stenosis seen most commonly among the elderly develops focally at the intervertebral junctions as a result of a complex process of disc degeneration, facet arthropathy, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, spondylosis, and sometimes spondylolisthesis. All patients underwent a midline decompressive laminectomy with foraminotomies at the affected levels, and discectomy was performed in persons with lumbar disc hernia. Average age was 71.15 +/- 5.09 (65-80); 50% (16) were women, and 50% (16) were men. The most frequent symptoms were pain (96.9%) and neurological claudication (90.6%). The average preoperative duration of the symptoms was 139.87 +/- 115.03 weeks. The most frequent neurological symptoms were reflex disturbances (62.5%), Lasèques's sign (SLR) (+)(53%), and motor deficit (50%). The anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal was less than 11.5 mm in 71.9% of the cases. In 62.5% of the patients, partial recovery was observed in the short term; 68.8% of the patients underwent laminectomy. Of those, 87.5% had total and 12.5% had partial laminectomies. In addition to laminectomy, discectomy was performed in 31.3% of the patients. Total laminectomy was more likely to be performed on patients older than 65 years, because the anteroposterior diameter was more likely to be below 11.5 mm in this cohort of patients. In lumbar stenosis, surgical treatment-decompression-is an effective method. Surgery has been demonstrated to be effective even in patients over the age of 75 years."

The characteristic symptoms of pain, sensory changes, and intermittent pseudoclaudication in connection with the extent of nerve root compression confirmed by laboratory examinations and the operative findings allow the author to stress the following points. (1) In Greece, lumbar spinal stenosis syndrome is not a very common entity. (2) Spinal stenosis cases of acquired type are the most common while those of developmental character are very rare, only two in this series, (3) Surgical intervention, which is the treatment of choice, includes a generous decompressive procedure that must free all the neural elements. Sometimes it is necessary to remove part or all of the facets in one or more levels. (4) The rate of complications is low, and complications are of minor character. (5) The results on the whole are very satisfactory and lasting, provided the planning and execution of the operation are based on sound preoperative assessment using both clinical examination and laboratory investigation. (6) Development of the acquired form of stenosis of the spine seems not to be preventable. The pathogenesis of the syndrome has not been fully established."

Soleus muscles were used for S1, tibialis anterior (TA) for L5, and rectus femoris (RF) muscles for L4 roots. According to the clinical or radiological diagnosis (CAT, MRI and/or myelography) conventional needle EMG was capable to localise the root lesion in 16 of 20 patients (80%) and ES localised the root involvement in 18 of 20 patients (90%); the diagnostic value of MCS was lower, about 65% (13 of 20 patients). Although ES is uncomfortable and invasive, it is superior to needle EMG in localising unilateral or multiple lumbosacral root involvement.

Due to their predominant frequency, attention was almost entirely devoted to the L-4 and L-5 prolapses. As clinical accuracy still remains a very important target, specially in departments where myelography is not used for the diagnosis of this entity, the authors thought it of interest to describe the clinical picture of the L-3-herniated disc. Special stress is placed on the motor involvement. Fourteen cases form this series. They were all central soft herniations. Cases of spondylotic narrow spinal canal were excluded. The special features were their predominance in people above 50 years old and the compromise of the hip abductors and internal rotator muscle groups making it impossible for the patient to stand on the affected limb (Trendelenburg sign). An abnormal knee jerk was a frequent accompaniment. Contrary to common knowledge the quadriceps muscle strength was almost unaffected. Sensory disturbances were not useful for location. The L-3 section of the lower lumbar spine is the narrowest explaining the reason why 3/4 of the patients had a more or less complete cauda equina syndrome. It was therefore a very dangerous herniation that crippled quickly, needing usually an emergency operation with all the risks involved in this older age group of patients."
CD007431,0,3004115,0,Intradiscal collagenase for treatment of lumbar disc herniations. A comparison of clinical results and computed tomography follow-up.,"In a series of 34 patients with herniated lumbar discs, treated by intradiscal injection of highly purified collagenase, the post-treatment course has been followed-up clinically and by repeated computed tomographies (CT). Good or excellent results have been achieved in 17 patients. An only slight improvement of pain was noted in 2 patients. Fifteen patients had to be operated on due to not improved or worsened clinical symptoms. The most striking result of our CT follow-up was a tendency of the disc herniation to increase initially after collagenase injection. About two thirds of the patients had such an increase at the one week after injection control. After 6 weeks this rate had decreased to only about one quarter, but in the meantime 13 patients had to be operated. Only after 6 months most hernias of the up till then not operated patients were smaller and none were larger than before treatment. There was also a transient density decrease of the treated disc, most pronounced one week after collagenase injection. At controls 6 months later density had reached again pre-treatment levels. It is likely that the volume increase tendency of the disc material after collagenase injection is responsible for a worsening of the clinical symptoms, which not seldomly occurs during the initial post-treatment period, and in some patients makes an operation necessary."

The patient will have leg pain as the dominant symptom and a 50% reduction in straight-leg raising with or without bowstring discomfort and crossover pain. Neurologic symptoms and signs are usual, as are abnormal results of contrast studies, which will verify the level of involvement. In 220 randomly selected patients who met criteria for the diagnosis of sciatica due to a herniated intervertebral disc and did not have psychogenic or nonorganic spinal pain, a spinal stenosis or a history of a previous, unsuccessful operation to relieve the sciatica, chemonucleolysis had a success rate of 80%. The only complications were a severe anaphylactic reaction in two patients and lesser, delayed reactions in five others. All of the reactions were successfully treated. Of the 45 patients in whom chemonucleolysis was unsuccessful, 38 underwent a laminectomy. In 3 of the 38 the results of chemonucleolysis were initially good, but later the disc herniation recurred; thus, the long-term treatment failure rate was 1.4%."

These findings support the ability of the triflexometer to depict disease courses of spinal disorders as well as the effect of therapy and rehabilitation."

A prospective study of back pain in young men during their military service.,"Muscular tightness and the therapeutic effect of stretching has been widely discussed during the last few years in sports training and physiotherapy. Within a prospective study of back function and pain before and after compulsory military service, tightness of hamstring- and psoas muscles was assessed. Around 600 young men were examined three times over a period of four years. Tight hamstring muscles were found to be very common in this group. Only 43% of the right and 35% of the left legs reached an angle of at least 80 degrees from the couch during the straight-leg-raising test (Lasegue's test). The test of muscular tightness showed a significant test-retest reliability over all examinations. Tight hamstring- or psoas muscles could not be shown to correlate to current back pain or to the incidence of back pain during the follow-up period."

The patients were divided into three groups according to the CT findings: group 1-normal imaging: 26 patients: group 2 -spinal stenosis: 20 patients; group 3 -posterior bulging, protrusion, extrusion or sequestration of disc: 27 patients. The clinical improvement was almost the same (approximately 50%) in the three different groups. In spite of the small number of cases, the results were statistically significant.

CD007431,0,3296236,0,Chemonucleolysis versus surgery in lumbar disc herniations: correlation of the results to preoperative clinical pattern and size of the herniation.,"A prospective study was carried out on the results of chemonucleolysis or surgery in 156 patients who had lumbar disc herniations. All patients were considered as potentially good candidates for chemonucleolysis. Seventy-two received a chymopapain injection and 84 underwent surgery. Based on computerized tomography (CT) scan and/or myelography the herniations were distinguished as small, medium, and large. Also distinguished were three types of preoperative clinical patterns, Type A, Type B and Type C, corresponding to slight, moderate, and severe nerve root compression, respectively. Follow-up evaluations were made 1 month, 3 months, and an average of 2.8 years after treatment. The patients with a small disc herniation, who underwent chemonucleolysis, did slightly better as a group than those treated surgically. At 1 month, the proportions of satisfactory results were 75% in the chemonucleolysis group and 62% in the surgery series. At final follow-up, the proportions were 84% and 82%, respectively, but the ratio of excellent-to-good results was higher in the chemonucleolysis group. In the latter, most patients with satisfactory outcomes had a Type A or Type B clinical pattern. In medium-size herniations the results of surgery were slightly better than those of chemonucleolysis. At 1 month, 55% of patients in the chemonucleolysis group had satisfactory results compared with 74% of those in the surgery series; at final follow-up the proportions were, respectively, 76% and 86%. In the chemonucleolysis group most satisfactory outcomes were found in patients with a Type A or Type B clinical pattern. The results of chemonucleolysis in patients who had large herniations were significantly inferior to those of surgery: at final follow-up the results were satisfactory in 50% of patients in the chemonucleolysis group and 89% of those in the surgery series. Chemonucleolysis appears to be the treatment of choice in most patients with small disc herniations and an effective alternative to surgery in most patients with medium-size herniations when the preoperative clinical pattern indicates a slight or moderate nerve root compression. In all large herniations and in small- or medium-size herniations causing a severe nerve root impingement, surgery should be preferred to chemonucleolysis."
CD007431,0,3464087,0,On assessment of shoulder exercise and load-elicited pain in the cervical spine. Biomechanical analysis of load--EMG--methodological studies of pain provoked by extreme position.,"Biomechanical analyses of load on locomotor structures are essential parts of physical therapy. Load moments of force, compressive and shear joint forces are associated with the risk of eliciting pain or causing excessive load during work and leisure activities as well as during rehabilitative training exercises. Two common therapeutic exercise movements were analysed with special emphasis on the effects of patient positioning on the load relations. Resistance was provided by an ordinary pulley apparatus. A computerized static model was developed, where positioning angle, pulley cord force and pulley distance could be varied. The best adaptation between the curves for induced load moment about the shoulder joint and maximum isometric muscle moment through joint angles was obtained when the subject during internal rotation exercises sat with the pulley located 40 degrees anterior to, and during external rotation exercises 20 degrees posterior to, a frontal plane through the shoulders at a distance of 1.3 m from the joint. EMG was recorded from the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and anterior deltoid muscles during internal rotation exercises, and from infraspinatus, deltoid and trapezius during external rotation. Pectoralis major and infraspinatus were the most active muscles during internal and external rotation respectively. Two methodological studies were made concerning pain provoked by loading joints in maintained extreme positions (i.e. positions at the limit of the motion sector). Sensations of discomfort/pain from healthy elbow and knee joints maintained in an extreme position increased with duration of provocation and decreased slowly after removal of loading weight. Using such joint loadings, a comparison of the Visual Analogue Scale with Borg's category-ratio scale showed that both be can be used for reliable assessments of load-elicited pain intensity. In one study cervical spine extreme position was found to be associated with sitting work postures where the thoraco-lumbar spine was slightly inclined backwards or where the whole spine was flexed. Healthy subjects participated in an experimental study in which a position involving extreme flexion of the lower-cervical-upper-thoracic spine (similar to a common work posture) was maintained. Pain was experienced by all ten subjects within 15 minutes, disappeared 15 minutes after the end of provocation, but was again experienced by nine subjects the same evening or the next morning and lasted up to four days. Neck extensor muscle activity was low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Diagnostic value of a skin test before and after chemonucleolysis].,"Chemonucleolysis with Chymopapain (Chymodiactin, Disease) bears the risk of unpredictable anaphylactic reactions. The rate of anaphylaxis is reported to be between 0.35 and 1.5%. Serological in vitro tests such as RAST (Radio Allergo Sorbent Test) or ChymoFAST (Fluorescent Allergo Sorbent Test) are used to determine increased specific IgE antibody titres against chymopapain in patients submitted to chemonucleolysis for lumbar disc disease. Alternatively skin prick tests have also been applied in clinical trials. A skin prick test including Discase, Chymodiactin and Solutrast 250 M, which is a radiopaque dye used for discography, has been performed in a total of 208 patients. One-hundred and seventy-seven patients were tested before, 31 patients were tested after chemonucleolysis with chymopapain. From the group tested before chemonucleolysis, 2.3-3.5% had positive skin testes. After chemonucleolysis, the overall allergy rate to chymopapain increased to 41.9%. Positive skin reactions seem to be time-dependent: Between the 3rd and 12th week after chemonucleolysis more than 70% of the patients had positive skin tests. There was no correlation between a history of previous allergy and the skin test result. Patients with positive skin tests should be excluded from chemonucleolysis. This procedure increases the safety for patients submitted to chemonucleolysis. No anaphylactic reaction has been observed hitherto in nearly 350 patients who were treated with the intradiscal injection of chymopapain following a negative skin prick test."

Each subject took part in two series of experiments, one in which the step was performed with the unaffected leg and a second in which the affected leg was used. A unilateral deficiency of peripheral proprioceptive afferents affected ankle muscles EMG activities bilaterally, except for the EMG activity of the soleus of the starting foot. The tibialis anterior of both the affected and the unaffected side, showed either a normal pattern (i.e. a phasic contraction after soleus contraction stopped), or an early contraction. On the stance side, the early contraction was associated with a depressed soleus EMG activity. Some abnormal motor patterns could be due to the ipsilateral deficiency of the Ia inhibitory projection from soleus to tibialis anterior. The presence of abnormal patterns on the unaffected side indicates that the motor activity in one lower limb can be modified by a loss of peripheral afference in the contralateral limb. This suggests that crossed pathways between lower limbs are involved in balance recovery movement."

A sequestrated fragment was found in 59% of cases, a subligamentous disc sequestration in 25% and a disc protrusion in 16%. The levels operated on were L4/5-36%, L5/S1-62.5%, and one at L3/4; 71% were laterally placed, 10% lay intraforaminal and 10% medial. The diameter of the protrusion was 4 mm to 13 mm for the craniocaudal extension, and 5 mm to 18 mm for the anteroposterior extension. No correlation could be found between a neurological deficit and the size of the prolapse. A positive correlation was present between the increasing degree of canal obstruction and the degree of disc degeneration determined by imaging for extrusions, subligamentous disc sequestrations and free sequestrations. Nerve root inflammation and enlargement was seen in 36% of the images, corresponding to an operative finding of 32%. Magnetic resonance imaging is a helpful pre-operative diagnostic investigation which shows structural changes in the disc and the correct localisation and size of the disc sequestration, but there was no correlation between the imaging findings and the clinical symptoms."

To investigate if low-dose chymopapain could reduce this adverse reaction, without modifying the efficacy, 118 patients with persistent low-back and radicular pain due to a lumbar disc herniation underwent chemonucleolysis. 60 patients were randomly selected to receive 2 mL of standard-dose chymopapain (4,000 units) and 58 to receive 2 mL of low dose (2,000 units). The clinical outcome was assessed on study days 1, 30, and 60, and after 1 year by physicians who were unaware of the treatment, and on the basis of the patients' self evaluation. At day 60, Chemonucleolysis was rated as successful in 81% of the cases by the investigator and in 80% by the patient's self assessment. The percentage of good results was remarkably similar in the two treatment groups and this finding was confirmed after 1 year. There was some evidence that the low-dose treatment resulted in less frequent postoperative back pain but the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, a comparable incidence of acute low-back pain and spasm was observed in the two treatment groups. Low-dose chemonucleolysis appears to be as effective as the standard dose, but the use of 2,000 units does not significantly lower the postoperative back pain."

There is almost general agreement that neither neurosurgical treatment nor chemonucleolysis is appropriate in patients with this clinical pattern. We used chemonucleolysis in 19 patients with recurrent episodes of isolated low back pain and one patient with severe permanent isolated low back pain dating back to a conservatively-treated episode of sciatica. All 20 patients had disk herniation documented by imaging studies. A very good or satisfactory outcome was recorded in ten patients after three months, 11 after six months and 12 in March 1993 after a mean follow-up of 72 months. The treatment was well tolerated, even in those patients who were not improved; a single patient developed an episode of acute low back pain that required surgical treatment. In patients with low back pain and disk herniation, there is currently no means of determining whether a causal relationship links these two abnormalities. Nevertheless, we believe that chemonucleolysis can be proposed in severe forms, provided the patients are apprised of current success rates."

There was no identifiable factor which predisposed this subgroup of patients to cauda equina compression. The mean duration of bladder paralysis prior to operation was 3.6 days. Ultimately almost 79% of patients claimed full recovery of bladder function, but only 22% were left without sensory deficit in the limbs or perineum. There was no correlation between recovery and the duration of bladder paralysis before surgery, except in three patients in whom there was no sciatica and where the correct diagnosis was delayed for many days. Retention developing less than 48 h after an acute prolapse was associated with a poorer prognosis. Despite claims that bladder paralysis should be treated with the same urgency as an extradural haematoma, there is no evidence in this study or in the literature to support the view that emergency surgery has any bearing upon the degree of clinical recovery. The exception may be if decompression can be undertaken within 6 h, the time estimated for axonal ischaemia to become irreversible. This should not however engender complacency in the management of this condition, which still requires prompt treatment. Whilst any apparent delay to surgery may have medicolegal implications should the patient fail to recover completely, in the majority of cases the die is cast at the time the prolapse occurs."

CD007431,0,7679625,0,"Tibialis anterior R-1 response: physiological behaviour, normative data and clinical utility in L4-L5 radicular compression.","A modified H-reflex, known as R-1 response, was recorded in healthy subjects by averaging 200 responses from the moderately contracting tibialis anterior muscle (TA) after repetitive submaximal stimulation of common peroneal nerve. Physiological changes to different modes of stimulation and recording were studied and normative data obtained at the most reliable parameters. Subsequently, the test is applied to 36 patients with clinical and myelographic evidences of L5 or L4-L5 radicular compression (with or without S1 radicular compression). Increasing the force of muscle contraction resulted in increase in amplitude up to a certain limit, with no change in latency. Increasing the current from subliminal to submaximal stimulation caused initial increase and subsequent fall in the amplitude without change in the latency. The change in the stimulus frequency from 0.5 to 3 Hz did not alter latency or amplitude but the higher frequencies sometimes did. On changing the position of the foot from plantarflexed to dorsiflexed, an increase in amplitude and reduction in duration of the response was noted. Fifty subjects were studied using stimulus intensity just enough to produce 200-400 microV M-response, stimulus duration of 1.0 msec, stimulus rate of 3 Hz and the muscle force sufficient to keep the foot in complete dorsiflexion. The tibialis anterior R-1 response (TAR-1) could be recorded reliably from both legs in all the subjects. The take-off point was sharp and in no subject was there any difficulty in measuring the latency to onset point. On repeating the test, the onset point of the response was superimposable. Latency showed linear correlation with height and age. Among the patients, 21 out of 25 cases of unilateral (84.0%) and 10 out of 11 cases of bilateral (90.9%) radicular compression had abnormal findings. Abnormalities included significant a right-left latency difference within the normal range of absolute latencies, unilateral or bilateral prolongation of latency to onset point and attenuation or absence of the response. It was concluded that the TAR-1 is an important and reliable test for the study of functional integrity of L4-L5 spinal segments in lumbo-sacral sensorimotor root lesions."
CD007431,0,11734957,0,CT-guided injection of botulinic toxin for percutaneous therapy of piriformis muscle syndrome with preliminary MRI results about denervative process.,"Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is a cause of sciatica, leg or buttock pain and disability. The pain is usually increased by muscular contraction, palpation or prolonged sitting. The aim of our paper was to evaluate the feasibility of CT-guided percutaneous botulinic toxin (BTX) injection for the purpose of PMS treatment. Thirty patients suffering from PMS, suspected with clinical and electrophysiological criteria, after imaging examinations excluding other causes of sciatic pain, resulted positive at the lidocaine test and were treated by intramuscular injection of BTX type A under CT guidance. The follow-up (12 months) was performed with clinical examination in all cases and with MR 3 months after the procedure in 9 patients to evaluate the denervative process entity of the treated muscle. In 26 cases relief of symptoms was obtained after 5-7 days. In 4 patients an insufficient relief of pain justified a second percutaneous treatment which was clinically successful. No complications or side effects were recorded after BTX injection. The MR examination showed a signal intensity change of the treated muscle in 7 patients due to the denervative process of PM, whereas in the remaining 2 cases only an atrophy of the treated muscle was detected. Larger series are necessary to confirm these MRI preliminary results. The CT-guided BTX injection in the PMS is an emergent and feasible technique that obtains an excellent local therapeutic effect without risk of imprecise inoculation."

CD007431,0,2802059,0,[Complications of thromboembolic prophylaxis with heparin-dihydroergotamine].,"In a prospective study the complications of Heparin-Dihydroergotamine (HDHE) [2,500 units Heparin + 0.5 mg DHE] s c. twice daily as thromboembolic prophylaxis have been studied in patients undergoing a lumbar disc operation. During a two year period 616 patients were operated, 47 patients had to be excluded, 107 patients did not receive HDHE desired by the surgeon; 462 patients received HDHE as described in the protocol. Because the distribution of age, sex, duration of hospitalisation of the 107 patients without HDHE is the same as in the HDHE group, this group can be used as control group. Increased intraoperative bleeding--written down in the operation report--66 patients (14.3%) in HDHE group and 6 patients (5.6%) in the control group. There is no statistic significance between the both groups in superficial and deep wound hematomas, deep vein thromboses or pulmonary embolism. In the HDHE group two death appears. Both patients [a 37 year old, asymptomatic woman and a 65 year old man with mild ischemic symptoms 11 months prior to operation] died because of an acute myocardial infarction. The clinical course and the missing of stenosis or occlusion at autopsy let us think at the possibility of coronary arterial spasm, presumably caused by DHE, as the cause of myocardial infarction.

Surgery and chemonucleolysis compared: a prospective study.,"A group of patients were matched for clinical diagnosis, severity of symptoms, and duration and type of preoperative management. The patients all had intractible sciatica. They were submitted to this study by nine participating authors working independently in various centers in North America. Of these patients, those with spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis or those who had had previous surgery were excluded. The patients were treated by chemonucleolysis or by surgery. The information in the various parts of the protocol allowed: (1) identification of the joint at risk, (2) the generic type of injury (torsion or compression), and (3) the procedure of choice for each patient. The outcome was predicted from the operation report using a demerit system for each deviation from the procedure of choice. It was possible to predict from this information only, with a high degree of accuracy (94%), the outcome 2 years later. It was also possible to compare the efficacy of the various types of intervention, especially chemonucleolysis versus a variety of surgical procedures."
CD007431,0,366087,0,Double-blind evaluation of chemonucleolysis for herniated lumbar discs. Late results.,"Sixty-six patients with symptomatic herniated lumbar discs refractory to the usual conservative management were allocated at random into one of two treatment groups according to a double-blind protocol: 31 received chymopapain intradiscally (chemonucleolysis) and 35 received a placebo intradiscally. Symptoms remained significantly improved 1 year or more after injection for 55% of those treated with chymopapain and for 46% of those treated with placebo. The difference is not statistically significant. However, to discard chemonucleolysis on the basis of this one small clinical trial may be premature. Since continuing controversy has re-established a climate in which another double-blind study of chemonucleolysis is ethically feasible and scientifically desirable, we favor additional clinical trials under a tightly controlled protocol to help resolve the issue."
CD007431,0,3833967,0,The multiply operated lumbar spine.,"In conclusion, it needs to be stressed that the physician should take an organized approach in evaluating the multiply operated spine patient. The origin of the problem in most patients is a faulty decision to perform the original procedure. Further surgery on an ""exploratory"" basis is not warranted and will lead only to further disability. Another operation is indicated only when there are objective findings to justify it. Multiply operated back patients need a total assessment. The cause of each patient's complaints must be accurately localized and identified. In addition to the orthopaedic evaluation, the patient's psychologic and general medical status must be thoroughly investigated. Once the spine is identified as the source of his symptoms, specific features should be sought in the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and roentgenographic studies. The number of previous operations, characteristics of the pain-free interval, and predominance of leg versus back pain are the major historical points. The neurologic examination and the presence of a tension sign are the important physical findings. Plain roentgenograms, motion films, metrizamide myelography, and computerized axial tomography have a specific place in the work-up. When all the information is integrated, the physician can separate patients with mechanical problems from those with arachnoiditis. If repeat surgery is undertaken, the approach must be a new level because the dura has no osseous protection at the previous laminectomy site. The midline scar tissue should be left intact and the nerve roots exposed laterally. Finally, the surgeon should be prepared to repair a dural tear, for this is the most common complication of a repeat laminectomy."

CD007431,0,8948251,0,Neurologic signs in lumbar disc herniation. Preoperative affliction and postoperative recovery in 150 cases.,"We studied prospectively 165 consecutive patients operated on for lumbar disc herniations. Neurologic examination was performed preoperatively and at 4, 12, and 24 months postoperatively according to a protocol. Preoperatively 69% of the patients showed a neurological disturbance corresponding to the level of disc herniation and 62% a corresponding sensory deficit. Recovery of the neurological deficit was seen in half of the cases at 2 years postoperatively, the main part of this improvement occurred within 4 months after the operation. Neurologic recovery correlated to a good surgical outcome, and a short history of disc herniation prior to the operation correlated to postoperative neurologic improvement. The straight leg raising test correlated to preoperative neurologic deficit, but not to postoperative recovery. Motor power disturbance of the extensor hallucis longus muscle recovered in more patients than reflex disturbances. Sensory disturbances had the lowest recovery rate. Our study demonstrates a correlation between routine postoperative neurologic findings and the patient's self-assessed outcome of surgery."
CD007431,0,8948252,0,Pain patterns in lumbar disc hernia Drawings compared to surgical findings in 159 patients.,"We compared preoperative pain-drawing patterns of 159 patients with findings at lumbar disc surgery. Disc pathology was classified into 2 groups: intact anulus (negative exploration and protruding disc) and ruptured anulus (subligamentary perforation and sequestrated hernia). Patients with intact anulus drew fewer modalities, but more often marked pain in the trunk, neck and upper extremities, than those with ruptured anulus. Certain pain-drawing patterns--e.g., extra text, arrows and nonanatomical pain distribution--have previously been shown to correlate to unfavorable pathological traits in psychometric tests in populations of patients with chronic low back pain. In our study, most of these so-called nonorganic pain-pattern items occurred equally often in the 2 groups. In fact, one third of the patients with ruptured anulus produced pathological drawings according to the scoring system designed by Ransford et al. (1976). Although pain drawings help the investigator to obtain a rapid overview of the patient's pain pattern, the use of penalty points as a preoperative psychological screening instrument in patients with pain that is not chronic may be questioned."
CD007431,0,6719256,0,The relationship of structural pathology to the nerve root.,"Lumbar spinal nerves may be entrapped (a) at the back of the disc (b) laterally in the central canal, (c) in the cauda equina, (d) more laterally in the nerve canal, and (e) posteriorly in the zygapophyseal joints. There is a spectrum of degenerative change in both joints and disc. Changes at these three sites can produce (a) dysfunction, (b) disc herniation, (c) instability, (d) lateral entrapment, and (e) central stenosis. The clinical significance is that many patients become symptom free on nonoperative treatment. Some with nerve entrapment require decompression. Those with instability may need a fusion. The pain from a disc lesion or from stenosis may come from irritation and inflammation of the dura. The motor loss in these lesions may be due to reflex inhibition and vascular insufficiency rather than from nerve compression. It is vitally important to identify accurately the nerve that is entrapped."

CD007431,0,6719254,0,Anatomic and clinical studies of radicular symptoms.,"Anatomic studies using cadavers showed that three factors are responsible for radicular symptoms. The first is congenital or acquired abnormalities of nerves and nerve roots--the intradural segmental arrangement of rootlets, congenital anomalies of the nerve roots, and the furcal nerve. Another factor is changes of bone and soft tissue around nerves and nerve roots--indentation of nerve roots and extremely transverse courses of nerve roots. The third factor is a correlation of two other factors--spatial relationship of the nervous tissue to osseous and nonosseous elements of the spinal canal and the intervertebral foramen. In the intervertebral foramen, the nerve root is surrounded by a rather thick membranous structure, an epiradicular sheath, which is responsible for a tubular form obtained in nerve root infiltration. Anatomic abnormalities can be observed in contrast studies, but the defects revealed do not correspond necessarily with neurologic symptoms. In such cases, nerve root infiltration is very useful for a functional diagnosis. The analysis of radicular symptoms with nerve root infiltration showed that radicular pain and/or claudication are caused mainly by single nerve root involvement, irrespective of the findings obtained by contrast studies. Furthermore, therapeutic effect of nerve root infiltration can be expected in any disease and it can be applied as a final trial of conservative treatment."
CD007431,0,1830437,0,[Pain in chronic arterial occlusive disease--the effect of improved macrocirculation on pseudo-radicular irritation].,"In chronic obliterating arteriopathy the maximum walking distance does not correlate well with the ankle arm index of arterial pressure measured by Doppler ultrasound. Beside reduced macrocirculation and microcirculatory maldistribution in skeletal muscle, pseudoradicular irritation was established as a relevant factor for the onset of pain during walking. The present study investigates the influence of the macrocirculation on hyperalgesia at rest in intermittent claudication. In 35 patients with chronic obliterating arteriopathy of the lower limbs (stage II according to Fontaine) the ankle/arm index of arterial pressure and the walking tolerance, as well as the pain at rest on applying pressure to the calf muscles were determined before and 3 weeks after percutaneous transluminar angioplasty (PTA). All 3 parameters improved after dilatation. Improved macrocirculation leads not only to a decreased production and improved clearance of pain-inducing metabolites in muscle tissue, but also--through a decrease of sympathetic stimulation of the muscle--to an elevation of the pain threshold. Apart from the reduction in pain-inducing metabolites, an absence of booster effects on pseudoradicular irritation and the regeneration of sensitive cutaneous afferents with resultant inhibition of reflex pain development are considered as possible factors in the achievement of pain relief following PTA."

Thirty patients, 18 female, 12 male, mean age 43.1 years, with primary BPS have been studied. In 83% of patients, BPS was caused by muscle tonic syndrome and in 17% the latter was combined with radiculopathy. Meloxicam therapy was conducted using intramuscular injections of 15 mg daily during 5 days with following oral drug intake (1 tablet daily). Treatment duration was 2 weeks. This treatment regime proved to be highly effective. The subjective meloxicam efficacy was the following: moderate--7%; good--30%; very good--33%; excellent--30%. Side effects, such as transient stomach pain, was observed only in 6.6% of patients. The main factors reducing meloxicam efficacy were affective disorders, namely, a level of depression and anxiety, and radiculopathy."

Forty patients with sciatica due to this diagnosis (confirmed by imaging) were treated either by chemonucleolysis or manipulation. Outcomes (leg pain, back pain and self-reported disability) were measured at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 months. The mean values for all outcomes improved in both groups. By 12 months, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome between the treatments, but manipulation produced a statistically significant greater improvement for back pain and disability in the first few weeks. A similar number from both groups required additional orthopaedic intervention; there were no serious complications. Crude cost analysis suggested an overall financial advantage from manipulation. Because osteopathic manipulation produced a 12-month outcome that was equivalent to chemonucleolysis, it can be considered as an option for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation, at least in the absence of clear indications for surgery. Further study into the value of manipulation at a more acute stage is warranted."
CD007431,0,6458028,0,Conservative management of low back pain.,"Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain may well have seen more progress in the past five years than in the previous 50. Specific diagnoses can be made by history and physical examination and can often be objectively documented by modern high-resolution computed tomographic scanning of the lumbar spine. A number of innovative conservative treatment modalities show great promise in decreasing the need for surgical intervention. Surgery is indicated only when appropriate conservative measures have failed. However, the greatest changes are yet to come.

Although careful clinical selection of patients reduces the frequency of treatment failure, some patients do not achieve satisfactory relief of pain with chemonucleolysis. In an attempt to identify objective pretreatment radiographic findings that might refine selection criteria and further reduce the failure rate of chemonucleolysis, a retrospective correlation of pretreatment radiographs and clinical responses was made of 200 consecutive chemonucleolysis patients. Marked improvement in sciatica occurred in 79.9% and 79.3% of patients at early and late follow-up, respectively. There was a significantly higher response rate, however, in patients who had definite radiographic evidence of focal disk herniation and in those patients with definite radiographic evidence of nerve-root compression (marked nerve-root deviation, nerve-root flattening or edema, root-sleeve amputation) by disk material. Those patients with a preinjection disk height greater than the mean had a slightly better response rate (91.1%) than those whose disk height was smaller than the mean (80.0%). Most cases of treatment failure could be attributed to an incorrect radiographic diagnosis, treatment of patients with equivocal diagnostic studies, the presence of ""free"" disk fragments, and causes of nerve-root compression unresponsive to chymopapain."

Although anatomy of the lumbar intervertebral foramen (including static and dynamic pathologic compression of the exiting nerve root) has been described, few studies have focused on the clinical and radiographic features of foraminal stenosis requiring surgical intervention. We retrospectively studied 65 patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis for presenting clinical and radiographic features and intraoperative findings. Symptoms included leg and back pain (100%), paresthesias (45%), and subjective weakness (31%). Examination revealed lumbar tenderness (71%), limited lumbar extension (57%), focal motor weakness (48%), and positive tension signs (42%). The L5 nerve root was most often involved (75%). Almost 50% of patients had already undergone spinal decompression surgery. Surgical procedures included laminectomy and foraminotomy (52 patients) and laminotomy and foraminotomy (23 patients). A concomitant arthrodesis was performed in 63 patients. There were 29 excellent, 25 good, 6 fair, and 5 poor results based on a modified outcome scale at 32.5-month follow-up. Findings suggest that foraminal stenosis is a frequent cause of persistent symptoms after surgery, is most common at the lumbosacral junction, is best identified on parasagittal magnetic resonance images or on images reconstructed with computed tomography, and may be static or dynamic in etiology."

Of the 22 patients in this study, 14 had midline lumbar disk herniations at L4-5. Their presenting symptoms including back pain with sciatica, were similar to those of lateral disk herniations. On physical examination, however, patients commonly had only positive root tension signs with few nerve root deficits. The incidence of cauda equina syndrome was 27%. The results of treatment were much poorer in these patients than results reported with lateral herniations; 41% were good, 27% fair, and 32% poor. Surgical decompression yielded the best results.

The diagnoses were established by one or more of myelography, CT, MRI and nerve-root block, and all were confirmed at operation. The preoperative duration of symptoms was significantly shorter in patients with disc herniation. Pain at rest, at night, and on coughing was as common in lateral stenosis as in disc herniation, but regular consumption of analgesics was more common in patients with disc herniation. Positive straight-leg-raising tests were more common in disc herniation than in lateral stenosis and were uncommon in central stenosis. Motor disturbances were seen most often in central spinal stenosis, especially patellar reflex changes. Sensory disturbances were most common in patients with complete disc herniation."

One patient had too extensive disease for surgery so 54 were treated by 55 spinal stabilisations; 49 obtained complete relief of pain and two had partial relief. There were three failures. Twenty-eight of the patients had clinical evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and were decompressed at the time of stabilisation. Of these, 20 had major recovery of neurological function. Patients with pre-operative evidence of extradural tumour had 'prophylactic' decompression at the time of stabilisation; none of these patients later developed signs of cord or cauda equina compression. The results suggest that alleviation of pain and restoration of mobility are best achieved by segmental spinal stabilisation; a few patients require a combined anterior and posterior stabilisation. Postoperative radiotherapy should be given whenever possible, and the causative tumour should be treated by endocrine or chemotherapy, as indicated."

CD007431,0,16421746,0,Magnetic resonance image findings in the early post-operative period after anterior cervical discectomy.,"If early neurological deterioration occurs following anterior cervical discectomy, the patient should be evaluated by urgent MRI scanning. In order to interpret such a scan it is essential to know what the normal post-operative MRI appearance is following an uncomplicated procedure. In the lumbar spine it is well recognized that early post-operative imaging following discectomy is difficult to interpret with a high rate of false positive scans. The normal appearance of MRI in the early post-operative period was evaluated prospectively in 15 patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy without fusion for either cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy. MRI was performed on the first post-operative day, at 6 weeks and 6 months. The successful outcome of the procedure was validated by uniform improvement of Visual Analogue Scale measurement for neck and arm pain, the Neck Disability Index and European Myelopathy Score as appropriate. In contrast to the established findings following lumbar discectomy, only two cases showed a persistent epidural mass in the first post-operative scan and this had completely resolved at 6 months. All patients had foraminal narrowing and root or cord compression pre-operatively. Sixty six percent of cases showed persistent foraminal narrowing on sequential imaging up to 6 months despite showing good symptomatic improvement. All cases demonstrated high signal in the operated disc space on T2 weighted imaging on the first post-operative day and this finding persisted in 13 of 15 scans performed at 6 weeks. Post contrast imaging demonstrated no enhancement of operated disc space and adjacent vertebral body on the first post-operative day, whereas all scans at 6 weeks showed enhancement and such enhancement persisted at 6 months in 50%. Persistent epidural filling defects are uncommon following successful anterior cervical discectomy but persistence of foraminal narrowing is common despite successful outcome. Enhancement of the disc space is also common and does not in itself imply infection."
CD007431,0,9402567,0,The slump test: the effects of head and lower extremity position on knee extension.,"Maitland's slump test is a widely used neural tissue tension test. During slump testing, terminal knee extension is assessed for signs of restricted range of motion (ROM), which may indicate impaired neural tissue mobility. A number of refinements that modify hip and ankle position has been added to the basic slump test procedure, but no research to date has measured the effects of ankle and hip position on knee extension ROM during testing. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of neural tension-producing movements of the cervical spine and lower extremity on knee extension ROM during the slump test. Thirty-four males with no significant history of low back pain were tested in the slump position with the cervical spine flexed and extended in each of three lower extremity test positions: neutral hip rotation with the ankle in a position of subject comfort (neutral), neutral hip rotation with ankle dorsiflexion (ankle dorsiflexion), and medial hip rotation with ankle dorsiflexion. Results showed significant decreases in active knee extension ROM (F1,198 = 29.53, p < 0.0001) in the cervical flexion compared with the cervical extension conditions. Subjects also exhibited significant decreases in active knee extension ROM (F2,198 = 56.76, p < 0.0001) as they were progressed from neutral to the ankle dorsiflexion to the medial hip rotation with ankle dorsiflexion positions of the lower extremity. The results of our study indicate that limitations in terminal knee extension ROM may be considered a normal response to the inclusion of cervical flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, or medial hip rotation in the slump test in young, healthy, adult males.

CD007431,0,9313730,0,The value of lumbar spine MRI in the assessment of the pars interarticularis.,"The aim of this study is to assess the ability of conventional lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate the pars interarticularis. The right and left L4 and L5 pars in 50 patients undergoing lumbar spine MRI for low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, were assessed and classified into four types. Based on their appearance, 59 (29.5%) were classified as normal (Type 1), 59 (29.5%) as hypointense (Type 2), 53 (26.5%) could not be demonstrated (Type 3) and 29 (14.5%) were thought to have defects (Type 4). The gold standard was set by the consensus opinion of two consultant musculoskeletal radiologists on the available plain radiographs of the lumbar spine. MRI was found to have a sensitivity of 57% to 86%, specificity of 81% to 82%, positive predictive value of 14% to 18% and negative predictive value of 97% to 99% for the diagnosis of a pars defect."
CD007431,0,12544950,0,Incidence of intravascular penetration in transforaminal cervical epidural steroid injections.,"STUDY DESIGN A prospective, observational, human, study was conducted. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence of vascular penetration during fluoroscopically guided, contrast-enhanced transforaminal cervical epidural steroid injections, and to determine whether the observation of blood in the needle hub can be used to predict a vascular injection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Incorrectly placed intravascular cervical spinal injections result in medication flow systemically and not to the desired target. A recently published study demonstrates a high incidence of intravascular injections in transforaminal lumbosacral epidural injections. No studies so far have evaluated the incidence of vascular injections in transforaminal cervical epidural steroid injections, nor have they calculated the ability of observed blood in the needle hub to predict a vascular injection in the cervical spine.METHODS The incidence of fluoroscopically confirmed intravascular uptake of contrast was prospectively observed in 337 patients treated with cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections. The ability of observed blood in the needle hub to predict intravascular injection was also investigated. For each subject, the injection level was chosen on the basis of the clinical scenario including history, physical examination, and review of imaging studies. Some patients had multilevel injections. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the authors placed a 25-gauge needle into the epidural space using a transforaminal approach according to accepted standard technique. Needle tip location was confirmed with biplanar imaging. The presence or absence of blood in the needle hub spontaneously (""flash"") and after attempted aspiration by pulling back on the syringe's plunger was documented. Contrast then was injected under real-time fluoroscopy to determine whether the location of the needle tip was intravascular. The results were recorded in a prospective manner indicating the presence or absence of blood in the needle hub and whether a vascular pattern was noted with contrast injection, and these were correlated. Relevant epidemiologic data also were recorded. RESULTS The study included 504 transforaminal epidural steroid injections. The overall rate of fluoroscopically confirmed intravascular contrast injections was 19.4%. Use of observed blood in the needle hub to predict intravascular injections was 97% specific, but only 45.9% sensitive. There was no significant difference in intravascular rates related to age or gender. CONCLUSIONS As compared with a previous study of lumbosacral epidural steroid injections, there is an overall higher incidence of intravascular injections with cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections. Use of observed blood in the needle hub to predict an intravascular injection is not sensitive, and therefore the absence of blood in the needle hub despite aspiration is not reliable. The reported sensitivity and specificity rates are similar to lumbar data. Fluoroscopically guided procedures without contrast confirmation instill medications intravascularly, and therefore not in the desired epidural location. This study confirms that there is a need not only for fluoroscopic guidance, but also for contrast instillation in cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections."

Discomfort and changes of the neurological status, emerging during the walk, were accepted as test results. They were noted in a decision matrix and the positive and the negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) calculated. The PPV of any symptom or any deterioration of the neurological status, resulting from this test as signs of a myelographical abnormality, was calculated to be 86 and 89 per cent, respectively, the corresponding NPV's being 50 and 40 per cent, respectively. The NPV of these parameters as signs of a myelographically verified lumbar spinal stenosis was calculated to be 100 per cent, the corresponding PPV's being 38 and 44 per cent, respectively. The development of ""symptom-march"" or of bilateral neurological signs during the walk was found to be of approximately the same diagnostical value. We conclude, that this function test may serve as a screening procedure in patients complaining of neurogenic intermittent claudication."

CD007431,0,10547954,0,Lumbar vertebral angles and back muscle loading with belts.,"The study examined belt effects on the change of lumbosacral angle (LSA) and back muscle activity in postures of standing, erect sitting, and slump sitting. We thought that the resulting changes of LSA and back muscle activity when wearing belts with different mechanical characteristics should be different. Eighteen healthy male subjects participated in this study. Though we failed to identify a significant belt effect on the back muscle EMG, the radiographic data revealed an interactive effect of postures and belts on the change of LSA. In standing, the belts increased LSA by increasing almost every lumbar vertebral angle. In erect sitting, the lumbar belt had no effect but the pelvic belt decreased LSA through a decrease in the L1/L3. While sitting slump with a trunk flexion of 15 degrees, both belts increased LSA by restricting the movement of the pelvis. Belt effect on LSA was accompanied with a change of pelvic angle. Significant correlation was found between the backward rotation angles of the pelvis and the angles of LSA (r = 0.692, p < 0.0001), also between the decrease of pelvic angles and the increase of back muscle EMG (r = -0.4, p = 0.017). A change in LSA and pelvic angle after wearing a belt along with posture change seems lead to an increase of the myoelectric activities on the back."
CD007431,0,12585585,0,The knee-spine syndrome. Association between lumbar lordosis and extension of the knee.,"Degenerative changes of the knee often cause loss of extension. This may affect aspects of posture such as lumbar lordosis. A total of 366 patients underwent radiological examination of the lumbar spine in a standing position. The knee and body angles were measured by physical examination using a goniometer. Limitation of extension of the knee was significantly greater in patients whose lumbar lordosis was 30 degrees or less. Lumbar lordosis was significantly reduced in patients whose limitation of extension of the knee was more than 5 degrees. It decreased over the age of 70 years, and the limitation of extension of the knee increased over the age of 60 years. Our study indicates that symptoms from the lumbar spine may be caused by degenerative changes in the knee. This may be called the 'knee-spine syndrome'."
CD007431,0,8586909,0,[Clinical study of cervical radiculopathy after laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy].,"We have retrospectively determined the preoperative risk factors in cervical radiculopathy after laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy using preoperative neuroradiographical findings and electrophysiological studies. Of the 67 patients who underwent laminoplasty, 10 patients (14.9%) postoperatively showed cervical radioculopathy. The preoperative radiographical findings had included cervical lordosis, intraspinal cord centering, and anterior protrusion of the apex of the superior articular process. Needle electromyography, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) were preoperatively examined in 42 cases. There was no relationship between the postoperative radiculopathy and the preoperative radiographical findings. Six (100%) of 6 cases preoperatively diagnosed as C5 radiculopathy (postganglionic type) with Erb-P 14 interpeak latency of dermatomal SEPs and SNAP, developed postoperative C5 radiculopathy. One (25%) of 4 cases preoperatively diagnosed as C6 radiculopathy developed postoperative C6 radiculopathy. No case preoperatively diagnosed as C7 or C8 radiculopathy developed postoperative radiculopathy. This study suggested that an important risk factor for postoperative radiculopathy was subclinical C5 radiculopathy (postganglionic type) that could be preoperatively evaluated using electrophysiological studies."

A 95% long-term follow-up result was obtained at a mean duration of 8.6 years. At the 7-11-year assessment, 88% of patients had an excellent result, 5% a good result and 7% had either a poor result or new symptoms. Ten patients (10.5%) underwent repeat MLD during the course of the study; nine of the ten reoperations were performed at the same level as the original surgery. The percentage with an excellent result remained relatively constant (88-89%) throughout the study. No reliable predictors of long-term outcome were identified.

In addition to bilateral median and ulnar SEPs, evoked potentials were recorded after stimulation of C6 and C8 dermatomes from the first and fifth digits, respectively. The patients were classified into 3 groups according to the nature of their clinical condition. The abnormality rate for both ulnar and C8 dermatomal SEPs was 100% in a small group of patients with severe neurological signs like atrophy. In groups of patients with lesser degrees of neurogenic damage, abnormality rates for ulnar and C8 dermatomal SEPs on affected limb(s) were 67 and 50%, respectively. Same abnormality rates were 25 and 18% in patients with only subjective symptoms. In patients with objective neurological signs, the major increase in sensitivity was with electromyography (EMG). Abnormalities of routine nerve conduction studies and F-wave latency were observed in patients with severe neurogenic damage. We concluded that the most useful tests in the diagnosis of neurogenic TOS are needle EMG and ulnar SEPs."

When used alone each method achieved virtually the same degree of accuracy (87.8% and 87.4%). Particular attention was paid to 70 ""problem"" cases in whom the initial CT diagnosis suggested herniations at different levels which were not in keeping with the clinical symptoms or signs. The operative findings showed that CT had produced 10.4% false positives and 4.4% false negatives. The corresponding results for myelography were 5.9% and 8.9%. Myelography is, therefore, a more exact method of diagnosis for segmental and lateral herniations.

No one study was consistently abnormal; however, epidural venography was diagnostic in 74% of cases. CT scanning and electromyographic examination, when used in combination, were found to be reliable in confirming the diagnosis of lumbar disk rupture in 84% of cases. In no instance were all preoperative diagnostic studies normal when a diagnosis of herniated nucleus pulposus was proven surgically.

Seventy-nine patients (34 women, 45 men) with a unilateral, single-level lumbar disc herniation were included in this study. Forty-one patients in whom closed-suction drainage was implanted were compared with 38 patients in whom the drain was not implanted. We have used a new grading system for the extent of epidural fibrosis, on the basis of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging findings. Pain intensity was evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS), and the patients' function and working ability were measured according to the Prolo functional-economic scale. We conclude that, in patients operated on for unilateral, single-level lumbar disc hernias, implantation of closed-suction drainage into the operation site results in less formation of EF radiologically and yields better clinical outcome."

However, no such investigation has yet been done in middle-aged patients. Trunk muscle strength and the effect of trunk muscle exercises were investigated in patients with CLBP aged more than 40 years. Trunk muscle strengths were measured in a LBP group (52 patients) and a control group (60 volunteers) and the results for the two groups were compared. The LBP group was divided into three subgroups. Group A had only age-related spondylosis and group B had disk herniation and spondylolisthesis with age-related spondylotic change. Both these groups were able to continue exercises. Group C was made up of patients who had abandoned the exercise program. Trunk muscle strength and symptoms were assessed in each group. Both flexion and extension strength were decreased in the LBP group compared with the control group, with the reduction in extension strength being most marked. In both groups A and B, muscle strength increased and clinical symptoms improved. In contrast, no change was seen in group C. In older patients with CLBP, reduction of muscle strength was more marked in the spinal extensors than in the spinal flexors. It was confirmed that trunk muscle strengthening exercises are useful for increasing muscle strength and improving symptoms in such patients."

The surgery was done by the senior one of us (J.M.) between 1972 and 1982. The duration of symptoms ranged from two months to three years. Pain in the lower limb was the predominant symptom in forty-eight patients. Reduction of the amount of straight leg-raising by 50 per cent or more, with or without pain in the ipsilateral hip when the asymptomatic limb was lifted (cross-over pain) and with or without pain radiating up or down the lower limb when the tibial nerve was pressed in the popliteal fossa (bowstring discomfort), was considered evidence of tension on or irritation of the nerve root and was present in all patients. Chemonucleolysis was considered as an alternative to discectomy and was performed only after the patient failed to respond to conservative management. An anaphylactic reaction occurred in one patient and was treated successfully. The most common symptom after injection was increased back pain, and it was controlled with medication. One patient had transient weakness of the extensor hallucis longus after injection. The length of follow-up ranged from two to twelve years (average, four years and six months), excluding one patient who was killed in an accident six months after injection. Chemonucleolysis did not relieve the symptoms in eleven of the fifty-five patients. These eleven patients all subsequently had surgical excision of the disc, and in them the chemonucleolysis was considered to have failed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

These ruptures were classified into two categories: radial and circumferential. This identification was possible only in CTD and was obscure in the usual discogram. Not all the ruptures could be dyed in a severe degenerative disc, and a rupture which was not communicated with nucleus pulposus was not dyed in a mild degenerative disc. In the preoperative CTD of lumbar disc herniation, the posterior radial ruptures representing the route of herniated nuclei were characteristic and the circumferential ruptures were found complicated."

Indications for and limitations of the technique were investigated by retrospective data analysis in a series of 106 patients (30 females and 76 males). These underwent single or multiple level Cloward fusion in a total of 145 levels. Neuroradiological investigations included lateral and antero-posterior cervical spine X-rays, axial CT scans, and MRI. The presence of postoperative ossification and stable bony fusion in the fused segments was confirmed by X-rays and, when necessary, by CT. The median postoperative follow-up period was 6.5 years (range 4-10.5 years). Short term outcome in RP patients was good in 26 cases (92.9%) and fair in 2 cases (7.1%). A good short term outcome was seen in 55 MRP patients (70.5%), a fair outcome in 20 patients (25.6%), and a poor outcome in 3 patients (3.8%). Patients having myelopathy signs for less than 1 year had a significantly better outcome than those with clinical signs for more than 1 year (p < 0.05). MRP patients below the age of 40 years had a significantly better outcome than those above the age of 40 (p < 0.05). In the long term, radiculopathy was cured or significantly improved in 92.8% of cases, and myeloradiculopathy in 64%. One year after surgery, there were 139 stably fused segments (96%) and 6 segments showing osseous non-union (4%). Plain lateral radiographs demonstrated, besides the bony fusion in the respective segment, relatively frequent graft collapse with slight to severe correction losses and kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine. However, these findings did not necessarily correlate with the clinical outcome. Autologous bone graft harvesting caused a rather high short-term morbidity with donor site pain and/or wound haematoma in 33% of the cases. These surgery-related complications, however, were of a temporary nature, as long-term complications (cutaneous hypaesthesiae) were found in 2 patients (1.8%) only. In conclusion, Cloward anterior cervical fusion for degenerative spinal disease is a relatively simple and safe surgical procedure with favourable short and long term results. In our hands, graft donor site complications dominate the side effects of surgery, and the percentage of non-unions is rather low. Because of the relatively frequent bone graft collapse and the late loss of postural correction of the spine, we cannot recommend the Cloward type fusion for multisegmental procedures. In such cases, an instrumented plate fusion should be carried out in order to prevent graft collapse and non-union, and to allow for a shorter convalescence period."

A total of 106 (33.0%) had never experienced low-back symptoms; 144 (44.9%) had or were having moderate low-back pain (LBP); and 71 (22.1%) had or were having severe low-back symptoms. These three subgroups showed no significant differences in height, weight, Davenport Index, lumbar lordosis, or leg length inequalities. LBP patients had less flexor and extensor strength and were flexor overpowered, had diminished range of motion for spinal extension and axial rotation (P = 0.003, P = 0.0005), and diminished straight leg raising capacity (P = 0.04). A multivariate correlation matrix demonstrated no typical pattern of associated abnormalities except a diminished spinal range of motion in one plane was associated with the anticipated diminishment in all other planes of motion, and often with greater restrictions of straight leg raising tests."

Comparison of pain responses from suspected symptomatic discs with pain responses from asymptomatic negative discs is routine. However, the ability of discography to distinguish asymptomatic morphologically abnormal discs from those that are symptomatic has been understudied. In addition, the discographic characteristics of negative discs in patients with chronic discogenic LBP have not been reported.

Comparison between before and after surgery.,"The aim of this study is to explore the clinical value of follow-up examinations of F-wave in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy. Postoperative changes in the initial abnormalities and their relationship with improvement in clinical findings were examined. Results from conventional motor nerve conduction study at knee-ankle segment are also discussed. The subjects were 30 patients with unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy caused by herniated disc. F-waves were obtained from abductor hallucis and extensor digitorum brevis by supramaximal stimulation to tibial and peroneal nerves, respectively, at the ankle. Minimal latency (Fmin), maximal latency (Fmax), chronodispersion (Fdif) and duration (Fdur) were used as the parameters. No subject had abnormal motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) throughout the course of this study, and there was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative levels. Peroneal Fmin, Fmax, Fdif and tibial Fdur all showed significant (p < 0.05 in Wicoxon signed-rank test) improvement after surgery. Moreover, these overall improvements significantly (p < 0.05 in chi 2 test) correlated with recovery in muscle weakness. However, normalization of F-wave was not always associated with full recovery in muscle weakness at that time. These findings suggested that follow-up examination of F-wave was of value for objective assessment after operation."
CD007431,0,10413345,0,The value of MR imaging in differentiating between hard and soft cervical disc disease: a comparison with intraoperative findings.,"The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of MRI alone in the differentiation of soft cervical disc protrusion from osteophytic compression in cervical disc disease. In a retrospective study, the MRI scans of 41 patients with cervical disc disease, who had previously undergone surgery, were presented to three independent observers, randomly on two different occasions, to identify the accuracy of the diagnosis of the presence of hard or soft disc or both as a cause of compression. The observers (two neurosurgeons and one neuroradiologist) were not involved with the treatment of the cases at any stage and were unaware of the surgical findings. Their observations were compared with those of the surgeon recorded at operation. The intra-observer agreement was poor for diagnosis into three categories as hard or soft disc or both. In distinguishing between the presence or absence of hard disc, there was moderate to good (Kappa = 0.6) intra observer and fair to moderate (Kappa = 0.4) interobserver agreement. The sensitivity of diagnosis of a hard disc was high (87%) but specificity was low (44%), due to the overestimation of the presence of hard disc. There was a significantly higher incidence of hard disc in the elderly age group (76% over the fifth decade, P = 0.0073). It is concluded that MRI alone is not a very efficient diagnostic tool in distinguishing between hard and soft disc in the cervical disc disease."

The first favourable clinical experiences with analysis of the LT in sitting position stimulated our previous anatomical, biometrical and clinical investigations (Mandić and col. 1970.). There has been established the stretching of the ischial nerve in classical LT to 12.7 cm, in sitting position to 4.8 cm, and the changing of position from supine to sitting to 6.4 cm. That means that the stretching in sitting LT is greater then in classical way/i.e. 13.26 cm/. The stretching forces in both ways were equal (0-3.7 kp/. The multicentric investigation included 330 patients of both sexes, aged 15-62 years. In 57 patients/17.3%/was LT in sitting position positive and in supine negative. That demonstrate the higher degree of reliability 17.3%. These quantitative results will be continued in qualitative investigation of statistical correlation of relative flexion degrees. The advantages of sitting LT are:more simple, more quick, the taking off patient's clothes is not needed, and the result is more suitable for the objective evaluation of psychogenic complaints superposition or simulation."

Since 1934, surgical treatment has consisted of hemilaminectomy and removal of the herniated material. Many authors believe that these procedures may cause degenerative spondylosis and vertebral instability. Several surgical methods have been proposed, but the long-term effects are still being debated. In addition there appear to be few well-designed outcome studies on the management of this disease. In the present study, 150 patients were selected for surgery with strict criteria and all treated with the standard technique. The series was evaluated by subjective analyses (Roland questionnaire; 120 patients), objective examinations (68 patients - 56.6%) and radiographic studies including dynamic views (analyzed by the Taillard and Boxall methods) to establish the presence of vertebral instability (50 patients - 41.6%). The subjective and objective analyses showed a high rate of good results. Radiographic studies showed vertebral instability in 30 cases, but only 9 were symptomatic.

The space can be examined clinically by a peridurographic technique in which the epidural space is filled with an iodine contrast medium. In patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), this examination is useful to determine the location of the prolapsed nucleus pulposus and the pathological adherent condition by the filling defect of contrast medium. For the purpose of determining the pathology of the prolapsed nucleus pulposus, peridurographic examinations were performed on 40 patients with IDH and the following results were obtained: 1) The existence and location of the IDH were shown by the peridurograms. 2) Adhesion around the involved and uninvolved nerve roots was shown in proportion to clinical symptoms."

The validity was investigated regarding radicular pain, neurologic signs, and root compression signs in myelography. All tests were highly specific for the validity parameters. However, the sensitivity was low; it ranged from 26 to 50% for the three single validity parameters in roots C6-8, and from 40 to 64% for combined neurologic and radiologic signs.

CD007431,0,7142502,0,Computed tomography of herniated and extruded nucleus pulposus.,"Computed tomography (CT) is an accurate method of diagnosing herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) in patients with back pain and radiculopathy. We evaluated 188 patients with 244 disk space explorations for the treatment of back pain and radiculopathy. In predicting HNP, CT was 92% accurate and myelography was 88% accurate. The only significant difference between the two modalities is at L5-S1. Here CT was 92% accurate in predicting HNP and myelography was 70% accurate, a difference that is statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The dural sac separation reduces the myelogram accuracy at L5-S1. In detailed evaluation of 188 patients with both CT-diagnosed and surgically confirmed HNPs, these HNPs were classified by location, calcification, size, and extrusion. If the maximum anteroposterior diameter of the HNP was less than one-half the anticipated normal sagittal diameter of the dural sac, the incidence of extrusion was less than 10%. If it occupied one-half or more of the anticipated normal sagittal diameter of the dural sac, the incidence of extrusion was greater than 90%. This difference is highly statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Thirty-five percent of the HNPs exhibited some degree of migration with the cephalic direction more common than the caudal direction. Computed tomography and myelography are both satisfactory methods of diagnosing HNP. The noninvasive CT gives direct anatomical information and is more accurate at L5-S1. If the physical examination correlates with the CT examination, then myelography may be bypassed and the patient treated with a high degree of confidence."
CD007431,0,3813219,0,Differentiation of vascular and neurogenic claudication.,"Lower extremity pain caused by exercise but relieved by rest is usually a reliable symptom of chronic arterial insufficiency. However, similar discomfort often occurs in patients who have neurospinal compression. Furthermore, both arterial occlusive disease and neurogenic causes of lower extremity discomfort may present simultaneously. Forty patients with symptoms that suggested intermittent claudication comprised our study group. All had non-arterial cause of their complaint. The nonvascular origin of the symptoms was suggested initially by clinical evaluation in 30 patients and by noninvasive evaluation in 25 patients. The neurospinal origin of symptoms was obscured in 15 patients because of the concomitant presence of significant arterial occlusive disease as demonstrated by noninvasive arterial testing. Twelve of these 15 patients underwent arterial reconstruction, which did not relieve their symptoms. Subsequently, the neurospinal origin of their symptoms was proven by appropriate evaluation and therapy. Forms of evaluation that proved helpful in the differential diagnosis were lumbosacral spine x-rays, electromyography, nerve conduction velocity studies, computerized tomography, Doppler noninvasive assessment and, at times arteriography and contrast myelography."

CD007431,0,11166937,0,Imaging the pain of low back pain: functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with monitoring subjective pain perception allows the study of clinical pain states.,"Most brain imaging studies of pain are done using a two-state subtraction design (state-related design). More recently event-related functional magnetic reasonance imaging (fMRI) has also been used for studying pain. Both designs severely limit the application of the technology to clinical pain states. Recently we demonstrated that monitoring time fluctuations of perceived pain could be used with fMRI to identify brain regions involved in conscious, subjective perception of pain. Here we extend the methodology to demonstrate that the same approach can be used to study clinical pain states. Subjects are equipped with a finger-spanning device to continuously rate and log their perceived pain during fMRI data collection. These ratings are convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function to generate predictor waveforms with which related brain activity can be identified. Chronic low back pain patients and a normal volunteer were used. In one series of fMRI scans the patient simply lies in the scanner and indicates spontaneous fluctuations of the subjective pain. In other fMRI scans, a straight-leg raising procedure is performed to exacerbate the back pain. In the normal volunteer, fMRI scans were done during painful and non-painful straight-leg raisings. The results indicate the feasibility of differentiating between different pain states. We argue that the approach can be generalized to identify brain circuitry underlying diverse clinical pain conditions."

We think emulsified Duroliopaque myelography to be the best investigation to make sure the diagnosis and to forecast the operative tactics: we gave up Dimer X myelography which occasioned serious complications in 2 cases and gas myelography which seems to us inadequate to this radicular pathology. Total-Body Scanner is rather an elegant method but a discontinuous one. The radiographic and operative findings have shown the stenosis of the lumbar canal to be congenital in 5 cases, development in 20 cases, degenerative in 27 cases (with 15 pseudo-spondylolisthesis) and tabetic in one case. A disc herniation was found in 25 cases over 53. The extent of the bone resection has been in relation with clinical picture, myelography and mainly operative findings, aiming at a ""cut-to-measure costum"". In every case the initial laminectomy was made easier by trenching the thickened laminae on each side of the spinal process prior to remove it. Only soft disc hernations were removed; the dura was never opened; no vertebral fusion was performed; for 2 years we have tried to avoid the ""laminectomy membrane"" by interposing an autogenous fat and aponevrotic graft between the dura and the overlying paraspinal muscles. The operative results are satisfactory with 75% of excellent and good; they are much better in patients with intermittent claudication than in those with permanent radicular pain. It is a question of functional surgery in one case, of pain surgery in the other. The major trick seems to us to be that of the associated disc hernation with the risk of missing the narrow canal."
CD007431,0,4089482,0,"[Diagnosis of lumbar intervertebral disk prolapse by computed tomography. A comparative clinical study between myelographic, computed tomographic and the surgical research results with 158 patients].","The diagnostic accuracy of CT in cases of lumbar disk prolapse was investigated on the basis of a group of 158 of our own patients who were divided into three separate groups. CT findings were compared on the one hand with myelograms and on the other with results of surgery. Simultaneously performed myelographic and CT examinations produced different diagnostic findings in 7 out of 80 lumbar disks (approx. 9%). These deviating findings ranged from gradual differences (in 3 cases) to completely contradictory findings (in 4 cases). In 31 patients who underwent surgery, approximately the same amount of false-positive and false-negative findings were obtained in preoperative diagnosis using CT as with myelography. The overall accuracy calculated for non-invasive computerized tomography was 93.7%, while for myelography it was 90.7%. Out of a further 91 patients in whom myelography was not performed and whose condition was checked surgically, the diagnosis had been established correctly by CT in 88. This represents a degree of accuracy of 96%. The vertical and lateral location of the disk prolapses as determined by CT corresponded with findings at surgery in every case. It is concluded from the results of these investigations that CT should be given absolute priority over myelography in the diagnosis of lumbar disk prolapse and that if there is a correlation between clinical history, neurological deficiency symptoms, and CT findings, myelography is unnecessary, even for surgery. Only if there are discrepancies between the findings myelography is indicated as a supplementary examination.

CD007431,0,11753769,0,[Operative treatment of symptomatic nerve root cysts].,"Nerve root cysts are often asymptomatic and show a predilective manifestation for the lumbo-sacral spine. Depending on their size and the anatomic relationship to the nerve roots they may cause symptoms such as pain or even neurological deficits. From the therapeutical point of view, different moldalities of intervention are controversially discussed because the clinical importance of this entity is still unclear. There are curative as well as symptomatic therapeutic options. The curative therapy includes surgical excision of the cyst and duraplasty whereas the symptomatic therapy is limited to drainage of the cyst. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of surgical excision of the cyst with duraplasty using microsurgical techniques."

Patient selection and role in various treatments.,"Patients in percutaneous nucleotomy who met our new criteria for patient selection in 1992 showed 73% successful results. The success rate was not satisfactory in comparison with that (88%) in the open surgery through posterior approach (herniotomy), however. The purpose of this report is to re-evaluate 70 patients with follow-up more than 2 years based on imaging and clinical findings before percutaneous nucleotomy. In results, supplementary criteria such as two types of the combination of computed tomography discogram and computed tomography myelogram, continuation of the contrast medium in lateral view of discogram, and clinical findings characterized by sciatic pain were obtained to improve the success rate. Eighty-one percent of patients who met the new criteria in 1992 and the supplementary criteria were identified in the successful group. The authors believe that percutaneous nucleotomy should be considered as an independent operative procedure with results similar to open surgery, if the patient is selected strictly based on these criteria and supplementary criteria."

The test results were noted in a decision matrix, and the positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The positive predictive value of disturbed sensation in the L5 dermatome, paresis of dorsiflexion of the foot and extension of the 4 lateral toes as signs of a herniation from the fourth lumbar disc was calculated to be 76 per cent, 69 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively, and the negative predictive value in each case to be approximately 50 per cent. The positive predictive value of altered sensibility in the S1 dermatome as a sign of a herniation from the fifth lumbar disc was found to be 50 per cent and the negative predictive value to be 62 per cent. It is concluded, that these tests very often give diagnostically specific information in patients with a herniation from the fourth lumbar disc and should therefore be performed if a lumbar root compression is suspected. They are, however, of limited value in the case of a protrusion from the fifth lumbar disc."

Their clinical and myelographic differentiation is difficult, yet important because reoperation is not always beneficial for scar removal. This article examines the usefulness of intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography for this problem. Forty-five postsurgical patients were studied; eight had subsequent surgery. In the four with hypertrophic scars, intravenous contrast enhancement of the scar allowed its recognition in each case; in the four with recurrent disk herniation, nonenhancement of the extruded disk allowed its recognition in three. In the other 37 patients who were not reoperated, 33 were believed to have scar on the basis of contrast enhancement. Continuous contrast infusion during scanning, absolute avoidance of patient movement, and careful consideration of other structures in the spinal canal are important in interpretation. The method seems promising for more accurate evaluation of failed back surgery, including the recognition of diskitis."

Inclusion criteria include symptomatic disc prolapse diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging scan, disc prolapse of 1 level only either L4-5 or L5-S1, leg pain for more than 4 wk and age more than 18. Exclusion criteria include multiple disc levels, spondylolithesis, spinal stenosis, cauda equina, and progressive neurologic deficits. Outcome Measures include Oswestry score and patient satisfaction and final outcome patient satisfaction either excellent (complete pain relief), good (minimal symptoms), moderate (some symptoms), no relief (symptoms unchanged), and worse (symptoms deteriorated). The final outcome is excellent (more than 6 mo pain relief), very good (3 to 6 mo pain relief), good (6 wk to 3 mo pain relief), fair (4 to 6 wk pain relief), brief (less than 4 wk pain relief), and no relief postal questionnaire sent and telephone interview done with the nonresponders.

However, the association between sciatica and compression of lumbar nerve roots was not realized until the 1920s. Back surgery for herniated nucleus pulposus then became fashionable, and plain radiography and myelography enabled preoperative mapping. Recently other imaging techniques have emerged, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. This has increased the knowledge of the etiology of lumbar root compressions, and invasive therapies for sciatica have become more diversified. It is easy to lose perspective among the available imaging procedures and therapeutic techniques. The aim of this paper is to present the current status from a historical point of view, with special emphasis on the most common imaging methods for the investigation of lumbosacral radiculopathies."

Patient characteristics, surgical methods, and postoperative course were reviewed. The most common preoperative symptom, painful radiculopathy, occurred in all cases, followed by motor weakness in five, sensory loss in four, and intermittent claudication in four. All patients underwent bilateral total (n = 6) or partial laminectomy (n = 4), with minimal (n = 3) or no (n = 7) facetectomy. Cysts were gross totally resected in eight cases and partially resected in two. Concomitant fixation was not performed. Painful radiculopathy, motor weakness, and sensory disturbance all resolved, resulting in good or excellent outcome in all patients. Postoperative symptomatic spondylolisthesis had not been noted at mean 52.1 months postoperatively. However, new juxtafacet cysts were later detected on the contralateral side to the initial lesion in two patients. Surgical removal of juxtafacet cysts is recommended for immediate symptomatic relief. Concomitant spinal fixation to prevent progression of spinal spondylolisthesis or cyst recurrence depends on cyst size, involvement of surrounding structures, degree of preoperative spondylolisthesis, and facet joint destruction."

Two hundred and thirty eight patients were operated on by APLD between 1988 and 1990. The questionnaire returned by 182 patients (76.4%) was suitable for evaluation. The mean follow-up was 2.5 years. Overall, 60% reported pain relief and 52% were satisfied with APLD. Conventional operations were carried out subsequently on 45 patients (25%). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done for preoperative (age, gender, neurological deficit, Lasegue's sign, sports activity), perioperative (weight of disc material removed, level of APLD) and post-operative (conventional nucleotomy, change in condition, pain relief, satisfaction, sports activity, return to work, compensation claims) parameters. The only significant parameters for improvement in condition and pain relief was age, where patients younger than 41 do better. Risk factors for reoperation were a positive Lasegue's sign and over 41 years of age. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher for patients without sensory deficit preoperatively."

The effect of experimental muscle pain on maximal voluntary contraction torque and peripheral contractile properties was therefore assessed. Experimental muscle pain reduced the torque produced by isometric knee extension, but the contractile properties assessed by twitch interpolation were not affected. This indicates that force inhibition by muscle pain is centrally mediated. This has clinical implications for rehabilitation and training of patients with musculoskeletal pain."

The findings obtained included changes in the interferential EMG and reciprocal reflexes and decreased reflectory activity of alpha-motoneurons predominantly on the side of radicular involvement with the simultaneous intensification of gamma-loop effect. Acupuncture was followed by pain alleviation and normalization of the functional activity of the segmentary apparatus of the spinal cord mainly at the expense of this activity reduction on the healthy side. Clinical recovery was observed following the compensation of neuroreflectory activity of the segmentary centres on a new functional level. The advisability of the use of acupuncture in the treatment of the radicular syndrome of lumbar osteochondrosis is justified.

A radiothermometer adjusted to a wave length of 30 cm was utilized. The accuracy of measurements was +/- 0.1 degree C. The findings showed an elevation of the in-depth temperature of lumbar tissues by 0.3 degree C as compared with the temperature of the mid-thoracic portion of the vertebral column. The elevation was maximal at the site of the involved intervertebral disc imaging. In the tissue of the leg on the side of pain the in depth temperature was 0.4-0.6 degrees C lower. The authors consider that temperature elevation in the lumbar tissue of the vertebral column is a manifestation of the attendant reactive inflammatory process while a decrease in the temperature of tissue on the side of pain is due to the neurodystrophic process with thermal disturbances. Decimetric radiothemometry may be used for the preoperative localization of intervertebral disk hernias."
CD007431,0,1533326,0,"Is there a role for diskography in the era of magnetic resonance imaging? Prospective correlation and quantitative analysis of computed tomography-diskography, magnetic resonance imaging, and surgical findings.","We herein report the results of a prospective study to define the role of diskography in the diagnosis of low back pain in an emerging era of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study involved 32 patients (78 disks) with a clinical diagnosis of lumbar disk herniation; all were studied by computed tomography-diskography (CT-D), and 25 (51 disks) were also examined using MRI. The disks were graded on these studies according to a staging scheme modified from Modic. Ten of the patients (13 disks) having both CT-D and MRI underwent exploratory surgery, and the staging at surgery served as the standard against which the evaluative studies were judged. Surgical staging was compatible with the CT-D and MRI results in five disks, while in another five disks it was compatible only with the CT-D results. In the remaining three disks, both CT-D and MRI misidentified the stages. In six disks, CT-D more accurately defined the stage of disease than did MRI, whereas MRI was more precise than CT-D in only one disk. While having documented the value of CT-D as a source of information, particularly when surgery is contemplated, and as an effective means of staging disk herniation, we recommend MRI as the ideal screening test for lumbar radiculopathy and low back pain, reserving diskography for problematic cases."

All patients were examined clinically before of instrumental devices. CT-scan was performed on 113 patients, 62 underwent myelography and 36 electromyography. The authors verified reliability of clinical and instrumental devices on the basis of surgical results. Clinical examination was reliable in 83% of cases, electromyography in 78%, myelography in 83% and CT-scan in 87%. The percentage of false positive was 11% for the clinical examination, 9% for CT-scan, 8% for myelography and 11% for electromyography. The percentage of false negative was 6% for the clinical examination, 4% for CT-scan, 9% for myelography, and 11% for electromyography.

CD007431,0,2943255,0,On the usefulness of somatosensory evoked responses for the evaluation of lower back pain.,"Electrodiagnostic and concurrent computed tomographic (CT) scan data were reviewed from 30 patients with lower back pain and unilateral radicular symptoms. Electrodiagnostic examination included somatosensory evoked responses (SSEPs) of the L-4, L-5, and S-1 roots stimulating specific sensory nerves. In three patients with normal CT scans, electrophysiologic studies were unrevealing. In the remaining 27 patients, CT scans were consistent with root injury, as were 15 of 17 myelograms. In 21 of these 27 patients, SSEP abnormalities consistent with focal root dysfunction and the radiographic findings were present. Other electrodiagnostic abnormalities (ie, electromyographic F response or H reflex) were limited to the six patients with clinical signs. These data indicate that SSEPs are valuable for evaluating root injury in patients with lower back pain, particularly where focal sensorimotor or reflex signs are absent."
CD007431,0,12920567,0,Diagnosing tuberculous spondylitis: patients with back pain referred to a rheumatology outpatient department.,"The onset of tuberculous spondylitis is insidious in nature, with various clinical presentations, slow development of radiographic abnormalities, and nonspecific constitutional symptoms. This lack of specific symptoms causes delays in diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates osteitis, intraosseous abscesses, paravertebral and epidural soft tissue extensions and abscesses, discitis, multilevel involvement of spinal cord or nerve root compression, and scoliosis. We present six patients with tuberculous spondylitis referred to our outpatient department with back pain resistant to medical therapy. All of them were women aged from 25 to 58 years (mean 44.6). The diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis was based on clinical presentation, radiographic and/or MRI evidence of focal destructive vertebral lesions (with paravertebral mass), and positive bacteriological findings of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The combined antituberculous chemotherapy consisted of 1.0 g/day streptomycin for 1 month, 25 mg/kg ethambutol or 25 mg/kg pyrazinamide, 600 mg/day rifampicin, and 300 mg/day isoniazid. The duration of therapy was 12 months. All the patients recovered without any sequelae. The mean follow-up period was 28 months (range 12-48). Magnetic resonance imaging is considered the main imaging modality for patients with suspected tuberculous spondylitis; it must be included in differential diagnosis of back pain and, if it is diagnosed in early stages, antituberculous chemotherapy enables satisfactory outcome."

The responses were recorded by means of surface electrodes. The TA reflex was examined in 70 healthy subjects and in 18 patients with L5 radicular compression. In 58 (83%) of the healthy subjects the reflex could be recorded bilaterally, in eight (11%) subjects no reflex was found on either side, and in four (6%) it was absent in one leg. Simultaneous recordings from the gastrocnemius-soleus showed that TA responses were not caused by volume conduction from that muscle. In the 18 patients with L5 radicular compression the TA reflex was absent on the affected side 13 times (72%) and present bilaterally in the other five cases. If asymmetry of the reflex (unilateral absence) is considered as a test for the presence of L5 radicular compression, the likelihood ratio for a positive test is 12.0, and for a negative test 0.3. The examination of the TA reflex is easily performed and can be useful in the diagnosis of L5 radicular compression."

Pain in the leg was the predominant symptom, with evidence of motor involvement in half of the patients. Signs of nerve root tension were found in only one-third of the patients.

CD007431,0,9755620,0,[Sciatica--diagnosis and surgical management].,"Sciatica (a term used synonymously with lumbar radiculopathy) is usually caused by lumbar disc herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis. Mechanical compression of nerve roots is a predominant factor, and decompression the surgical goal. Emphasis should be placed on clinical identification of the nerve roots causing the complaint. Although computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most important diagnostic tools used today, plain x-ray may be required for correct identification of the lowest mobile segment, and the functional myelography combined with CT may be required if lumbar spinal stenosis is suspected, or if the clinical findings are unclear--especially if the patient has already undergone surgery for sciatica. The proper selection for candidates for surgery seems to be a more important determinant of successful outcome than whether macro- or micro-surgery is used, or whether one or more segments are operated upon (12, 13). Clear clinical identification of the roots affected and corresponding pathological findings at imaging are the best predictors of successful surgical outcome, an additional factor of positive predictive value being psychosocial stability. Impaired fibrinolysis, occurring in smokers and in the sedentary and obese, may be a negative predictive factor (10, 11). Published findings suggest that, unlike the case with disc surgery (9), neither long duration of symptoms nor long preoperative sick leave is associated with poor outcome of surgery for spinal stenosis (14)."

CD007431,0,10758122,0,EMG activities of two heads of the human lateral pterygoid muscle in relation to mandibular condyle movement and biting force.,"Electromyographic (EMG) activities of the superior (SUP) and inferior heads (INF) of the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPT) were recorded in humans during voluntary stepwise changes in biting force and jaw position that were adopted to exclude the effects of acceleration and velocity of jaw movements on the muscle activity. The SUP behaved like a jaw-closing muscle and showed characteristic activity in relation to the biting force. It showed a considerable amount of background activity (5-32% of the maximum) even in the intercuspal position without teeth clenching and reached a nearly maximum activity at relatively lower biting-force levels than the jaw-closing muscles during increment of the biting force. Stretch reflexes were found in the SUP, the function of which could be to stabilize the condyle against the biting force that pulls the condyle posteriorly. This notion was verified by examining the biomechanics on the temporomandibular joint. The complex movements of the mandibular condyle in a sagittal plane were decomposed into displacement in the anteroposterior direction (Ac) and angle of rotation (RAc) around a kinesiological specific point on the condyle. In relation to Ac, each head of the LPT showed quite a similar behavior to each other in all types of jaw movements across all subjects. Working ranges of the muscle activities were almost constant (Ac <3 mm for the SUP and Ac >3 mm for the INF). The amount of EMG activity of the SUP changed in inverse proportion to Ac showing a hyperbola-like relation, whereas that of the INF changed rather linearly. The EMG amplitude of the SUP showed a quasilinear inverse relation with RAc in the hinge movement during which the condyle rotated with no movement in the anteroposterior direction. This finding suggests that the SUP controls the angular relationship between the articular disk and the condyle.

Biological restoration through the use of autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation offers a potential to achieve functional integration of disc metabolism and mechanics. Chondrocytes that have been removed from damaged cartilaginous tissues maintain a capacity to proliferate, produce and secrete matrix components and respond to physical stimuli such as dynamic loading. Nucleus regeneration using autologous cultured disc-derived chondrocytes (ADCT) has been demonstrated in a canine model and in clinical pilot studies. In 2002 a prospective, controlled, randomised, multi-center study, EuroDISC, comparing safety and efficacy of autologous disc chondrocyte transplant, chondrotransplant DISC, plus discectomy (ADCT), with discectomy alone was initiated. A dog model was used to investigate the hypothesis that autologous disc chondrocytes can be used to repair damaged intervertebral disc. Disc chondrocytes were harvested and expanded in culture under controlled and defined conditions, returned to the same animals from which they had been sampled (autologous transplantation) via percutaneous delivery. The animals were analyzed at specific times after transplantation by several methods to examine whether disc chondrocytes integrated with the surrounding tissue, produced the appropriate intervertebral disc extracellular matrix, and might provide a formative solution to disc repair. The clinical goals of the EuroDISC study, were to provide long-term pain relief, maintain disc height and prevent adjacent segment disease. Interim analysis was performed after 2 years; Oswestry (low back pain/disability), Quebec Back-Pain Disability Scale, as well as Prolo and VAS score were used for the evaluation. Disc height was assessed by MRI. In the context of degenerative changes in an injury model: () autologous disc chondrocytes were expended in culture and returned to the disc by a minimally invasive procedure after 12 weeks; () disc chondrocytes remained viable after transplantation as shown by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and maintained a capacity for proliferation after transplantation as depicted by histology; () transplanted disc chondrocytes produced an extracellular matrix that displayed composition similar to normal intervertebral disc tissue. Positive evidence of Proteoglycan content was supported by accepted histochemical staining techniques such as Safranin O-Fast Green; () both Type II and Type I collagens were demonstrated in the regenerated intervertebral disc matrix by immunohistochemistry after chondrocyte transplantation; and () when the disc heights were analyzed for variance according to treatment a statistically significant-correlation between transplanting cells and retention of disc height was achieved. A clinically significant reduction of low back pain in the ADCT-treated group was shown by all three pain score systems. The median total Oswestry score was 2 in the ADCT-treated group compared with 6 in the control group. Decreases in the disability index and VAS score in ADCT-treated patients correlated strongly with the reduction of low back pain. Decreases in disc height over time were only found in the control group, and of potential significance, intervertebral discs in adjacent segments appeared to retain hydration when compared to those adjacent to levels that had undergone discectomy without cell intervention. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation is technically feasible and biologically relevant to repairing disc damage and retarding disc degeneration."

CD007431,0,12699367,0,Treatment of chronic discogenic low back pain with intradiskal electrothermal therapy.,"The treatment of chronic, nonradicular, discogenic low back pain remains controversial. The posterior anulus fibrosus appears to be a potential site of origin of the pain, which is mediated by nociceptors in the inner layers of the anulus. Diagnosis requires a thorough history, physical examination, and imaging protocol; provocative diskography is key. Nonsurgical treatment options have been limited to physical therapy and pharmacotherapy. Success rates of spinal fusion range from 39% to 96%. Reported therapeutic success rates of intradiskal electrothermal therapy, a possible intermediate treatment, range from 60% to 80%. Despite this apparent therapeutic effect, however, a more precise quantification of clinical benefits remains to be proved in randomized prospective trials."

Data were collected on 24 patients who received spinal cord injuries 2 months to 31 years previously. The recording sites were below the level of spinal injury. The lumbosacral evoked potentials (LSEPs) were compared with the results of measurements obtained from 19 neurologically healthy subjects. Additional data were collected on each patient to characterize segmental reflex responses and preservation of sensory and motor functions associated with the L5 through S2 segments of the spinal cord. Assuming that the LSEP reflects the activity of spinal cord interneurons, the results demonstrate a degree of spinal cord dysfunction caudal to the area of injury in a substantial number of the patients with spinal cord injury which we studied."
CD007431,0,12745445,0,Sensory function above lesion level in spinal cord injury patients with and without pain.,"Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) may or may not develop central neuropathic pain despite having cord lesions of apparently the same site, extension and nature. The consequences of the cord lesion in the central nervous system and the mechanisms underlying pain are unclear. In this study, we examined sensory detection and pain thresholds above injury level in 17 SCI patients with central neuropathic pain, in 18 SCI patients without neuropathic pain, and in 20 control subjects without injury and pain. The SCI pain group had significantly higher cold and warm detection thresholds compared with the SCI pain free group and controls and higher tactile detection thresholds compared with the SCI pain free group. No difference in pain or pain tolerance thresholds was seen among pain and pain free SCI patients. These data suggest changes in somatosensory function in dermatomes rostral to the segmental injury level linked to the presence of central neuropathic pain in SCI patients. The results are discussed in relation to current concepts of pain inhibitory and facilitating systems."
CD007431,0,9743129,0,Lateral cephalometric analysis of asymptomatic volunteers and symptomatic patients with and without bilateral temporomandibular joint disk displacement.,"Few studies of dentofacial and orthodontic structural relationships relative to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction have been reported. We undertook this investigation to determine any correlation of orthodontic and dentofacial characteristics with TMJ bilateral disc displacement. The population of patients was selected from a TMJ clinic where a control group of asymptomatic volunteers had been previously established and standardized. Differences in skeletal structural features were determined among three study groups: (1) asymptomatic volunteers with no TMJ disk displacement, (2) symptomatic patients with no TMJ disc displacement, and (3) symptomatic patients with bilateral TMJ disk displacement. Thirty-two asymptomatic volunteers without disk displacement (25 female, 7 male) were compared with the same number each of symptomatic patients without TMJ disk displacement and symptomatic patients with bilateral TMJ disk displacement. All subjects had undergone a standardized clinical examination, bilateral TMJ magnetic resonance imaging, and lateral cephalometric radiographic analysis. The groups were matched according to sex, TMJ status, age, and Angle classification of malocclusion. Seventeen lateral cephalometric radiographic cranial base, maxillomandibular, and vertical dimension variables were evaluated and compared among the study groups. The mean angle of SNB, or the intersection of the sella-nasion plane and the nasion-point B line (indicating mandibular retrognathism relative to cranial base), of the symptomatic patients-with-displacement group was significantly smaller than that in the asymptomatic volunteers and symptomatic patients without bilateral disk displacement (p < 0.05). Female subjects showed smaller linear measurements of mandibular length, lower facial height, and total anterior facial height than male subjects in all three groups (p < 0.05). The mean angle of ANB, or the intersection of the nasion-point A and nasion-point B planes (indicating retrognathism of mandible relative to maxilla), was significantly greater in female than in male subjects, in all groups (p < 0.05). Symptomatic patients with bilateral disk displacement had a retropositioned mandible, indicated by a smaller mean SNB angle compared with that in asymptomatic volunteers and symptomatic patients with no disk displacement on either side. Lateral cephalometric radiographic assessment may improve predictability of TMJ disk displacement in orthodontic patients but is not diagnostic; nor does the assessment explain any cause-and-effect relationship."

Timing, surgical findings, and outcome in 92 patients.","Ninety-two patients who underwent microsurgical reoperation for persistent or new complaints following initial lumbar intervertebral disc surgery were evaluated retrospectively. Sixty percent of all pain relapses occurred within 1 year following the first operation; thereafter, the probability of a relapse declined steadily and was as low as 0.1% per year between 5 and 20 years. The results of microsurgical reoperation in terms of pain relief and working capability were considered ""excellent"" in 22% of patients, ""good"" in 30%, and ""satisfactory"" in 29%. Thus, 81% of the patients could be considered as treated successfully and in 19% the result was not successful. The most common intraoperative findings were: a true recurrence at the same level in 43% of cases, a new herniation at another level in 15%, and a small recurrent fragment embedded in epidural fibrosis in 23%. Five percent of patients had severe epidural fibrosis as the only pathology. In 15%, reoperation was performed within 1 month to treat persisting pain, and either a missed disc fragment, an inadequately decompressed lateral recess, or an unrecognized second-level disc protrusion was found. The clinical outcome is affected predominantly by the intraoperative pathology and the time interval between the first and second operation. An excellent or good outcome was usually achieved in patients with a recurrence of pain after 1 year resulting from a true recurrent disc or a new herniation at another level. In contrast, very unfavorable results were noted with most reoperations performed during the 1st year when extensive epidural fibrosis (or fibrosis with a small recurrence) was present."

The following associations were significant: low P0 and P60 in advanced annular degeneration and disruption; low P60 and great LOP in large hernias and narrow disks. P0 and P60 were not associated with the pain response at diskography, magnetic resonance signal intensity, or patient age, sex, weight, body mass index, type of occupation, or duration of symptoms.

Contrasted to the typical disc herniation, foraminal and extraforaminal disc herniations involved the upper nerve root mainly. The dominent symptoms and signs were severe anterior thigh and lower leg pain, positive femoral nerve strech test, impairment of knee jerk reflex and weakness of the quadriceps muscle. Sequestration and extrusion were the most common type of disc pathology. CT/MRI showed the protruded disc in and outside of the foramen clearly. It was thought to be ideal method for the precise diagnosis and guidance of surgery. However the variations of the nerve root or other diseases related to it should be identified. All of the 10 cases underwent surgical treatment with the approach by outer edge of pars interarticularis in 8. The result was encouraging with complete improvement in 8 cases, obvious improvement in 1 case, and partial improvement in another case. It was found that the approach had the advantage of good exposure and effect with the minimal destruction of pars interarticularis and facet joint which would not give rise to lumbar instability."
CD007431,0,1830247,0,The older athlete after lumbar spine surgery.,"Surgery consists of spinal decompression for predominately leg pain problems. The most commonly performed surgery in older patients is the lumbar laminectomy. Total laminectomy is the procedure recommended for central canal stenosis. More commonly, central canal, lateral recess, and foraminal stenosis occur in the same patient. Lateral recess stenosis may be the major offending blockage in the canal. This may be treated with a total laminectomy or a bilateral medial facetectomy performed through the microscope with excellent decompression of the lateral recess. Foraminal stenosis can also be decompressed from a paraspinous position with the foraminotomy performed from the outside in. This can be combined with a microscopic medial facetectomy. Essentially, all these operations remove bone and redundant tissue to allow the nerve adequate freedom in the spinal canal and/or intervertebral foramina. Fusions are performed predominantly for degenerative spondylolisthesis to prevent the recurrence of radiculopathy. Internal fixation may be indicated in any situation in which the surgeon feels that the fusion rate is potentially compromised, but he or she must be aware that internal fixation does not guarantee spine fusion. Spinal instrumentation certainly increases the complication rate. The number of levels fused and the inclusion of the sacrum are important in predicting the fusion rate."

CD007431,0,9597294,0,Suspecting lumbar spondylolysis in adolescent low back pain.,"Spondylolysis in the athletic adolescent and preadolescent is common enough that primary care practitioners should be familiar with its frequency and its progression from pars interarticularis stress fracture to spondylolysis and to spondylolisthesis. One-half of all pediatric back pain in athletic patients is related to disturbances of the posterior elements including spondylolysis, which presents as low back pain aggravated by activity, frequently with minimal physical findings. Failure to suspect, hence to diagnosis, a pars stress fracture or early spondylolysis is common and a misdiagnosis of lumbosacral strain is often made. A complicating factor in early diagnosis is the fact that plain radiographs, even with oblique films, may not be helpful at the stress fracture stage, and other imaging techniques (bone scan possibly with single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) must be used early in the diagnostic process. In the primary care setting, an early diagnosis of posterior element involvement in low back pain either at the stage of pars stress fracture or early spondylolysis can prevent progression of the disease and the need for aggressive intervention for a more significant defect. We present three adolescent and preadolescent athletes with low back pain in whom a high index of suspicion led to the early diagnosis of pars stress fracture or spondylolysis. All three had different stages of spondylolysis, and one illustrates the clinical utility of the one-legged hyperextension test. The ease with which early disease may be treated further supports efforts by primary care practitioners to suspect and diagnose pars stress fracture and early spondylolysis."

The analgesic effect of treatment in the two groups was assessed with the aid of a visual analogue scale and also the amounts of supplementary analgesics necessary. No significant difference in the pain experienced or employment of supplementary analgesics in the two groups could be registered.

CD007431,0,6854345,0,Chronic asymmetrical spinal muscular atrophy.,"The clinical and neurophysiological features of 18 cases of chronic asymmetrical spinal muscular atrophy are described. These were patients presenting with asymmetrical neurogenic atrophy involving one or more limbs who had no evidence of pyramidal tract dysfunction after 3 or more years of symptoms. There were twice as many males as females and the mean age of onset of the disorder was about 32 years. None of the patients had bulbar involvement. The tendon reflexes tended to be depressed. The distribution of muscle weakness in the limbs was very variable, and only slowly progressive. In 5 cases symptoms and signs were confined to the hands and forearms. Motor nerve conduction velocities to wasted muscles were slightly reduced but there was no evidence of generalised neuropathy. A diagnosis of chronic asymmetrical spinal muscular atrophy, as opposed to that of classical motor neurone disease, is favoured by an age of onset under 40 years, an absence of pyramidal signs or bulbar involvement after 3 years or more of symptoms, and depressed or absent tendon reflexes. The 2 conditions appear to be clinically distinct and prognosis is considerably better in chronic asymmetrical spinal muscular atrophy. The aetiology of this condition in unknown; it may be of relevance that 2 patients in this series had close relatives with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease."

A prospective study with clinical and independent radiologic follow-up.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the natural history of sciatica due to lumbosacral nerve root compromise and to evaluate the pathomorphologic changes that accompany the natural resolution of the disease. One hundred sixty-five consecutive patients, 114 males and 51 females, with an average age of 41 years (range, 17-72) and an average duration of symptoms of 4.2 months (range, 1-72) presenting with sciatica thought to be due to lumbosacral nerve root compromise were admitted to the study. The cornerstone of treatment was the serial epidural administration of steroid and local anesthetic by the caudal route on an outpatient basis. Lumbar epidural injection or periradicular infiltration at the appropriate level, confirmed under image intensifier, was the next step before considering surgical decompression. An average of three injections (range, 0-8) was received by each patient. Patients underwent clinical examination and computed tomography. Twenty-three patients (14%) underwent surgical decompression. The remainder were clinically assessed at 1 year after presentation, and 111 were rescanned at the appropriate levels. All conservatively managed patients made a satisfactory clinical recovery: average reduction of pain on the visual analog scale was 94% (range, 45-100), and 64 (76%) of the 84 disc herniations and 7 (26%) of the 27 disc bulges showed partial or complete resolution (chi-square = 20.27, P = 0.0001). Thus a high proportion of patients with discogenic sciatica make a satisfactory recovery with aggressive conservative management, and this recovery is accompanied by resolution of disc herniations in a significant number. Only a small proportion of patients needed surgical decompression."

CD007431,0,7822353,0,Lumbar foraminal stenosis: critical heights of the intervertebral discs and foramina. A cryomicrotome study in cadavera.,"One hundred lumbar intervertebral foramina from eighteen spines of fresh cadavera were studied to assess the relationship between compression of the nerve root and the height of the intervertebral disc and the morphological characteristics of the intervertebral foramen as determined on cryomicrotome sections. The critical posterior disc height and the critical foraminal height that were associated with entrapment and compression of the nerve root were determined. Significant positive correlations were demonstrated between compression of the nerve root and the posterior disc height, the foraminal height, and the foraminal cross-sectional area for the four intervertebral levels between the second lumbar and first sacral vertebrae. Nerve-root compression was evident in twenty-one of the 100 foramina, in eight of the ten foramina in which the posterior disc height was four millimeters or less, and in four of the five foramina in which the foraminal height was fifteen millimeters or less. These critical dimensions may be indicators of foraminal stenosis in the lumbar spine. However, compression of a spinal nerve root does not always cause sciatica, and the clinical findings must always be taken into account when a diagnosis of stenosis is considered."
CD007431,0,10214570,0,Association between peridural scar and activity-related pain after lumbar discectomy.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between activity-related pain six months after first surgery for herniated lumbar disc, and the extent of lumbar epidural fibrosis present at the surgical site, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. The 298 patients who underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation were studied in a randomized, controlled, double-blind multicenter clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the scar-inhibiting device ADCON-L. Clinical assessments were conducted pre-operatively and at 1, 3, and 6 month intervals post-operatively, and included wound examination, magnetic resonance imaging scar assessment, and the Johns Hopkins activity-related pain questionnaire. In addition, a longer-term follow-up assessment was conducted at 12 months post-operatively. The association between the presence of epidural scar and activity-related pain was analyzed at the 6-month interval, when successful surgical excision of protruding disc material should have eliminated chronic pain. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association (p = 0.02, odds ratio = 0.7) whereby the odds of extensive scar decreased by 30% for every 31% decrease in activity-related pain score. In addition, those patients receiving ADCON-L at surgery developed significantly less scar in the months following operation (p = 0.01, 6 and 12 months post-operatively). Repeated measures analysis demonstrated that patients who received treatment with ADCON-L at the time of surgery experienced less activity-related pain through the 12-month assessment (p = 0.05). A significant association between extensive epidural scar and activity-related pain is demonstrated. Patients with less scar had less activity related pain, confirming the finding that the use of the scar inhibitor ADCON-L has a positive effect on surgical outcome."

The 298 patients who underwent first-time, single-level unilateral discectomy for lumbar disc herniation were evaluated in a controlled, randomized, double-blind multicenter clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the scar-inhibiting device ADCON-L. Clinical assessments were conducted pre-operatively and at 1, 3, and 6-month intervals post-operatively, and included MRI scar assessment and the assessment of low back pain by visual analog scales. There were 267 patients available for low back pain assessments. The data obtained at the 6-month follow-up visit were statistically analyzed for the association between the presence of peridural scar and the persistence of low back pain. Those patients treated with ADCON-L at surgery had significantly less scar than did control patients (p = 0.007), and had less low back pain than did control patients when the pain was most severe (p = 0.047) and when the pain was assessed at the end of the day (p = 0.044). Patients with extensive scar reported continuing and debilitating low back pain more frequently than those with no or minimal scar. These findings demonstrate a direct correlation between persistent low back pain and extensive scar, since patients with increased amounts of scar had increased low back pain, regardless of their treatment group (p = 0.0003)."

CD007431,0,10214573,0,Inhibition of epidural fibrosis with ADCON-L: effect on clinical outcome one year following re-operation for recurrent lumbar radiculopathy.,"In a prospective multicenter study, 20 patients underwent re-operation for recurrent radiculopathy after lumbo-sacral discectomy, and were treated with ADCON-L (Adhesion Control in a Barrier Gel) to inhibit epidural fibrosis following secondary surgery. Outcomes after re-operation were assessed at six and 12 months using: Visual Analog Scales to measure radicular and back pain, straight leg raising exams, and self-assessment of activity-related radicular pain. Each parameter was compared to baseline values, obtained immediately prior to the re-operation. The long term clinical results at 12 months after re-operation (summarized below) demonstrate a significant improvement of all clinical parameters, and correlated with the results seen at six months. Radicular pain, measured when most severe, was reduced from an average pre-operative score of 8.1-3.7 (p < 0.005). The straight leg raising angle increased from an average pre-operative value of 41 degrees-67 degrees (p < 0.005). Activity-related pain mean score was 4.6, vs. 17.0 pre-operatively (p < 0.005). Low back pain, measured when most severe, was reduced from an average pre-operative score of 6.1 to 3.1 (p < 0.012). These clinical findings compare very favorably with data reported in the literature. There were no adverse events or complications related to the use of ADCON-L."
CD007431,0,17103230,0,Dermatomal laser-evoked potentials: a diagnostic approach to the dorsal root. Norm data in healthy volunteers and changes in patients with radiculopathy.,"We conducted a cross-sectional study of 40 radiculopathy patients in comparison with norm data from healthy subjects using a new electrophysiological method. Early manifestations of dorsal root impairment escape objective diagnosis by conventional somatosensory-evoked potentials due to the overlapping innervation of the affected dermatome by thickly myelinated mechanoreceptive afferents projecting to adjacent intact roots. Evidence suggested less intersegmental overlap for thermonociceptive afferents rendering laser-evoked potentials (LEP) sensitive to monosegmental dorsal root damage. Therefore we used this new method to study acute manifestations of monosegmental dorsal root pathology. Dorsal root function was tested in 12 healthy subjects and 40 sciatica patients by intraindividual interside comparison. Mechanosensibility and thermosensibility were clinically investigated. LEP were induced by moderately painful laser stimuli. The LEP were evaluated by amplitude and latency of the averaged electroencephalogram. Normal interside differences of LEP for amplitude were +/-22% (lower limb) and +/-35% (upper limb) and +/-15 to +/-16% for latency. Twenty-six patients (65%) showed significant LEP changes, mainly amplitude decreases. Six of these patients exhibited latency prolongations. Clinical testing yielded more frequent pathological results for pain compared to mechanosensibility. The study confirmed our preliminary evidence of LEP sensitivity to objectively document dorsal root impairment in patients suffering from acute monosegmental radiculopathy. This result opens the perspective of electrophysiologically differentiating the presence or absence of dorsal root pathology in patients with similar clinical symptoms but possibly different prognoses, which require different therapies."

Report of nineteen cases (author's transl)].,"Nineteen patients with plexus lesions following radiation therapy were investigated: fifteen with brachial plexus, 4 with lumbar or sacral plexus involvement. Symptoms at onset are usually sensory. Motor disturbances occur either simultaneously or after some delay, their course is generally gradual and unfavourable. Areflexia appears early and was present in every case. Important cutaneous lesions (radiodermitis) and considerable induration of soft tissues were observed in every patient. Diagnosis is a relapse of the mitotic process. Severity of prognosis makes imperative a definite technique of radiation therapy. In all the patients included in this study, dosage had exceded 1,600 rets. Patients were tentatively treated with D-penicillamine, an inhibitor of collagen synthesis."

CD007431,0,15953751,0,The relationship beween posture and back muscle endurance in industrial workers with flexion-related low back pain.,"This preliminary cross-sectional study was undertaken to determine if there were measurable relationships between posture, back muscle endurance and low back pain (LBP) in industrial workers with a reported history of flexion strain injury and flexion pain provocation. Clinical reports state that subjects with flexion pain disorders of the lumbar spine commonly adopt passive flexed postures such as slump sitting and present with associated dysfunction of the spinal postural stabilising musculature. However, to date there is little empirical evidence to support that patients with back pain, posture their spines differently than pain-free subjects. Subjects included 21 healthy industrial workers and 24 industrial workers with flexion-provoked LBP. Lifestyle information, lumbo-pelvic posture in sitting, standing and lifting, and back muscle endurance were measured. LBP subjects had significantly reduced back muscle endurance (P < 0.01). LBP subjects sat with less hip flexion, (P = 0.05), suggesting increased posterior pelvic tilt in sitting. LBP subjects postured their spines significantly closer to their end of range lumbar flexion in 'usual' sitting than the healthy controls (P < 0.05). Correlations between increased time spent sitting, physical inactivity and poorer back muscle endurance were also identified. There were no significant differences found between the groups for the standing and lifting posture measures. These preliminary results support that a relationship may exist between flexed spinal postures, reduced back muscle endurance, physical inactivity and LBP in subjects with a history of flexion injury and pain."

CD007431,0,1870667,0,Computed tomography of the postoperative intervertebral disc and lumbar spinal canal: serial long-term investigation in 19 patients after successful operation for lumbar disc herniation.,"The first part of this work, published in 1988, included 25 patients who had computed tomographic (CT) scans without contrast enhancement and plain x-rays of the lumbar spine before, 1 week after, and 6 to 7 weeks after a successful operation for lumbar disc herniation. The present study extends the follow-up period to 3 years in 19 of the 25 original patients. Clinical examinations, lateral plain x-rays, and CT scans without contrast enhancement of the operated disc were repeated. The results indicate a decrease or even a disappearance of the hyperdense extradural material thought to represent fibrosis. An image suggestive of persistent disc herniation was still present in 5 of 8 patients with this finding on early postoperative CT scans. Persistent intradiscal gas was seen in nearly half of the patients. Total normalization of the posterior extraspinal structures was the rule. There was no correlation between CT appearance and residual complaints of the patients. CT scans without contrast enhancement may be sufficient to guide the surgeon in postoperative patients with massive signs and symptoms of recurrent root compression in whom a second operation is indicated on clinical grounds. In all other cases, myelography followed by CT scans is considered appropriate to investigate failed back surgery syndrome."

Fifty-eight were treated by placing them in spine-decompressing position, traction and therapeutic exercises. The group of 45 patients had additionally paravertebral blockade (steroid + a local anaesthetic). In the blockade group the therapeutic effects were better, with rapid reduction of acute pain, with wellbeing improvement and better comfort, which facilitated further stages of the treatment. This made possible shortening of hospital stay by 20%, on average, as compared with the group without blockade. In patients with shorter lasting radicular pains (below 2 months) the results after paravertebral blockade were significantly better than in cases with longer duration of pains (2-6 months)."

CD007431,0,6495025,0,A study of computer-assisted tomography. II. Comparison of metrizamide myelography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of herniated lumbar disc and spinal stenosis.,"One hundred twenty-two patients with surgically confirmed pathology consisting of either herniated lumbar disc, spinal stenosis, or both were included in this investigation. For each of these patients, preoperative metrizamide myelography and computerized tomography were performed. Each myelogram and CT scan was read blindly so that the neuroradiologist interpreting the study had no knowledge of the patient's surgical pathology, clinical examination, nor any knowledge of the interpretation of the other preoperative test. A painstaking attempt was made to describe precisely both the exact nature of the preoperative myelogram and CT scan interpretations. The correlations between the preoperative interpretation of each test and the observed surgical findings then were analyzed statistically. Based upon this analysis, myelography was found to be more accurate than computed tomography in the diagnosis of herniated lumbar disc (83% vs. 72%). In the diagnosis of spinal stenosis, myelography was slightly more accurate than computed tomography (93% vs. 89%). Based upon the results of this study, the authors conclude that metrizamide myelography is more accurate than computed tomography in the diagnosis of both herniated lumbar disc and spinal stenosis and remains the diagnostic study of choice for these conditions. Furthermore, metrizamide myelography gives the added advantage of visualizing the thoracolumbar junction and, thus, affords the opportunity to diagnose occult spinal tumors."
CD007431,0,17977204,0,Discal cysts.,"Discal cysts are rare lesions that can result in refractory sciatica. Because they are so rare, their exact origin and details of the clinical manifestations are still unknown. The authors report on five men treated for discal cysts. The mean age of the patients at the time of the surgery was 32 years (range 25-38 years). All patients suffered from lower-extremity pain and the results of the straight leg-raising test were positive in all cases. Three patients reported motor weakness and four had sensory disturbance--symptoms similar to those found in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated spherically shaped extradural lesions of various sizes with low and high signal intensities on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. Discography revealed obvious communication between the cyst and the intervertebral disc with reproducible leg pain in all patients. All patients underwent posterior decompression and excision of the cysts either with or without additional discectomy. The radicular symptoms were remarkably improved in all patients immediately after surgery, and no recurrent lesions were noted during follow up."
CD007431,0,10823430,0,Outcome scores in degenerative cervical disc surgery.,"Forty-six consecutive patients with neck pain and arm radiculopathy were treated with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. All patients had neurological symptoms corresponding to a herniated disc and/or spondylosis at one or two cervical levels, verified by magnetic resonance imaging. The patients were stabilized with an anterior graft and randomized to either fixation with a CSLP plate or no internal fixation. Preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively the patients filled in a questionnaire that included a modified Million Index, a modified Oswestry Index and the Zung Depression Scale. They were also asked to register their pain in the arm and in the neck on a vertical visual analogue scale (VAS). At the 2-year follow-up, an unbiased observer graded the patients' clinical outcome using Odom's criteria. A test-retest procedure was carried out to examine the questionnaire reproducibility. In the group that was operated at one level, there was no significant improvement in any of the scores. Nevertheless, 81% of the patients were satisfied with the outcome of the surgery. All scores improved in the group operated at two levels. The pain in the neck and arm, as measured on a VAS, decreased in both groups. The improvement in arm pain was significantly more pronounced in patients operated with a plate at two levels compared to those who were operated without a plate. At the 2-year follow-up, patients with an excellent or good result according to Odom's criteria had a lower Million Index (P < 0.0005), Oswestry Index (P < 0.0005), and Zung (P = 0.024) score, than the group classified as fair or poor. There was a significant correlation (P < 0.0001 for all scores) between the test and retest results. We conclude that the modified Million Index and Oswestry Index are clinically useful tools in the evaluation of outcome after degenerative cervical disc surgery. The clinical benefits of plate fixation were minimal. The outcome after surgery, measured with the Oswestry Index, Million Index and VAS for arm and neck pain, seems to correlate well with the classification of outcome by Odom."

CD007431,0,9520891,0,Common peroneal nerve block for sciatica.,"The effectiveness of common peroneal nerve block for lumbar disc herniation was evaluated in a double blind study. Common peroneal nerve block was performed near the fibular head in nine patients using 2% lidocaine and in 10 patients using saline. The average pain scale score decreased from 3.1 to 0.6 in the lidocaine group, whereas it decreased from 3.0 to 2.6 in the placebo group. The average result in the straight leg raising test increased from 61 degrees to 84 degrees in the lidocaine group, but from 44 degrees to 50 degrees in the placebo group. Lower leg pain lessened more in the lidocaine group than in the placebo group. The finding that lower leg pain disappeared or decreased with a lidocaine block at a site far distal to the lumbar lesion suggests that impulses that are transmitted distal to the lesion may be important for the generation of sciatic radicular pain."

The multidimensional pain inventory (MPI) has previously identified 3 cognitive-behavioral profiles in TMD and chronic pain patients. Our aims were to replicate these findings in another cultural setting and relate the profiles to the diagnosis and to the treatment demand and outcome. The MPI was administered to 112 referrals comprising 6 categories of patients diagnosed with TMD or intractable orofacial pain. Dysfunctional profiles (high in pain and distress) were most common in patients with orofacial pain of obscure origin and more common in myofascial pain patients than in patients with other TMD diagnoses. Interpersonally-distressed profiles were found in all categories. Among patients with disk displacement, the 3rd profile (adaptive copers with low pain and distress and high control and activity) was most common in earlier successfully diskectomized patients and least common in those about to undergo invasive interventions. A dysfunctional profile was associated with treatment failure, conservative or surgical, and with the demand for radical therapy. Some support for a cyclical causality between pain and psychological factors was found. It is concluded that the robustness of the MPI as a relevant assessment instrument was further strengthened."

The objective of this study was to determine the association between clinical data and urodynamic diagnosis, in order to reveal whether bladder dysfunction can be assessed on the basis of urological symptoms and signs. We prospectively studied 122 patients with lumbar intervertebral disk protrusion. Detrusor areflexia was found in 32 of these patients, while in the remaining 90 detrusor activity was normal. All patients with detrusor areflexia reported difficulty voiding by abdominal straining. The patients with normal urodynamic findings were either free of voiding disturbances (77 patients) or complained of frequent voiding (13 patients). In conclusion, there are cases of lumbar intervertebral disk protrusion in which the presence of bladder dysfunction can be predicted on the basis of clinical urodynamic testing, i.e. clinical neurological alterations, decreased bladder sensation, voiding by straining, increased bladder capacity, residual volume, and intermittent or continuous low flow curve on free uroflowmetry."

CD007431,0,8153806,0,Anatomic and radiographic study of dorsal root ganglia.,"Anatomic and radiographic studies were made to investigate normal variation of dorsal root ganglia in lumbosacral roots. The spinal nerves could be divided into two groups, with and without bifurcation of ventral nerve root and dorsal root ganglion. The bifurcated group was further classified into three types. L4 and L5 nerve roots were all bifurcated, and S1 were all nonbifurcated. The positions of dorsal root ganglia were classified into three types: intraspinal, intraforaminal, and extraforaminal. At L4 and L5 nerve roots, they were mostly intraforaminal, whereas at S1, they were mostly intraspinal. Proximally placed ganglia had a high frequency of ganglionic indentation. The incidence of intraspinal dorsal root ganglia was much higher clinically than in anatomic studies. Variations in connecting patterns or positions of dorsal root ganglia may be related to the occurrence and variety of radicular symptoms. The dorsal root ganglia is clinically important, and its location may correspond to clinical symptoms."

Pain distribution and physical findings were positive for discogenic involvement of long duration prior to chemonucleolysis. Eighteen patients were treated under worker's compensation. Postoperation, significant back pain persisted less than 24 hours in seven patients, less than six days in 133, less than 21 days in 178, from one to three months in nine, and between three and six months in two patients. Leg pain remained less than 24 hours in 32 patients, between one and five days in 212, between six and 21 days in 96, between one and three months in seven, and between six and 12 months in three patients. Similar improvement in extensor hallucis longus weakness and straight leg raising was also noted. Pain relief in the long term showed none persisting in the 158 patients or 44%, mild remaining pain in 107 or 30%, moderate pain in 71 or 20% and some pain in 21 or 6%. Thus the result was graded satisfactory in 74%.

CD007431,0,3449307,0,The medial hamstring reflex in the level-diagnosis of a lumbar disc herniation.,"Evaluation of the medial hamstring reflex (MHR) was included in the routine neurological examination of 52 hospitalized patients with a suspected lumbar disc protrusion. The MHR was tested in the supine patient with the hip slightly flexed, externally rotated and abducted. The ipsilateral knee was semiflexed and supported by one of the examiner's hands. The reflex muscle contraction was elicited by striking the index finger of the supporting hand placed on the tendons in question with a reflex hammer. The positive predictive value of an abnormal MHR as a sign of herniation from the fourth lumbar disc was found to be 85-89 per cent and the negative predictive value to be 51-61 per cent. The corresponding values when considering an abnormal Achilles tendon reflex as a sign of herniation from the fifth lumbar disc were calculated to be 67-84 per cent and 79-84 per cent, respectively. It is therefore recommended to include the MHR in the neurological examination of patients with a suspected lumbar disc protrusion."
CD007431,0,7584187,0,Arthroscopic treatment of the flexed arthritic knee in active middle-aged patients.,"Twenty patients (22 knees) treated by arthroscopic removal of the anterior tibial osteophyte were selected for review from more than 150 arthroscopic debridements of the knee over a 5-year period (1986-1991). All the patients were middle-aged active individuals with competitive sports activity in their past. Their main complaint was flexion deformity of the knee (5 degrees-20 degrees) associated with pain and discomfort in recreational sporting activities and/or in activities of daily living. Roentgenographic examination in all cases showed an anterior tibial osteophyte located just anterior and medial to the anteromedial tibial spine of the intercondylar eminence. No varus or valgus malalignment or subchondral necrosis was detected. Arthroscopic treatment consisting of removal of the anterior tibial osteophyte by shaving and extraction of the bone, followed by a moderate notchplasty, was sufficient to improve the active extension of the knee and to decrease the pain and stiffness of the joint."

In seven patients the history of pain and abnormalities on examination suggested a possible neurological disorder. Fourteen of 29 patients (48%) with femoral or tibial osteomas had localised muscle atrophy, and 10 patients (34%) had diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes in the affected limb. Two patients had painless lesions. Six patients had normal plain radiographs. Delay in the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma may be prevented by the knowledge that pain may be referred or radicular, that the concomitant occurrence of muscle atrophy and depressed deep tendon reflexes are relatively common findings, and that the characteristic radiological features may only appear late in the course of the disease."

A long-term follow-up.,"In a retrospective study, we examined twenty-eight patients who had had an arthrodesis seventeen to fifty years previously (average, thirty-five years). Hip and knee ratings were obtained, as well as anteroposterior and flexion-extension radiographs of the lumbar spine and standing anteroposterior radiographs of the knees and hips. About 60 per cent of the patients had pain in the ipsilateral knee (average time to onset, twenty-three years after arthrodesis), and a similar percentage had back pain (average time to onset, twenty-five years after the operation). Pain in the contralateral hip occurred in approximately 25 per cent of the patients (average time to onset, twenty years after arthrodesis). Only one patient was unemployed due to disabling pain in the back or knee. Seventy per cent of the patients could walk more than one mile (1.6 kilometers), and a similar percentage could sit comfortably for at least two hours. Seventy-five per cent of the patients had anteroposterior laxity of the ipsilateral knee, and 80 per cent had mediolateral laxity. The patients whose hip was fused in some abduction more frequently had pain in the ipsilateral knee and the back, and they had greater degenerative changes in the ipsilateral knee than the patients whose hip was fused in adduction or in the neutral position. Six patients had undergone total hip arthroplasty for pain in the back or the ipsilateral knee, or both, and all had marked relief of back pain, while two of four had relief of pain in the knee. Two patients had a total knee arthroplasty for relief of pain in the ipsilateral knee."
CD007431,0,16825999,0,The effect of lumbar total disc replacement on the spinopelvic alignment and range of motion of the lumbar spine.,"A lumbar total disc replacement (TDR) is a type of motion-preserving surgery, which aims to restore and maintain the normal range of motion (ROM) and the sagittal balance of the spine. However, little is known regarding how the spinopelvic alignment and ROM of the lumbar spine are influenced by the lumbar TDR with ProDisc. This study retrospectively analyzed the sagittal alignment and ROM of the lumbar spine in 26 consecutive patients who had undergone the TDR with ProDisc with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. A standing lateral radiograph, which included the femoral heads and dynamic flexion-extension lateral radiographs of the spine were taken before surgery and at the follow-up visit. The radiological parameters included the sacral tilt, the pelvic tilt, and the lumbar lordosis. The segmental lordosis and ROM were also measured at each operative level. Nineteen patients underwent a single-level TDR and 7 patients underwent a double-level TDR. The mean lumbar lordosis increased significantly from 30.5 degrees to 40.8 degrees in all patients who underwent TDR without any significant changes in the sacral tilt and pelvic tilt at the latest follow-up (P<0.05). In the patients who underwent single-level TDR, the mean segmental lordosis at the L5-S1 and L4-5 operative levels increased significantly from 15.8 degrees to 23.2 degrees and from 14.1 degrees to 24.9 degrees, respectively. The mean ROM at L5-S1 and L4-5 increased significantly from 7.1 degrees to 11.2 degrees and from 11.4 degrees to 14.6 degrees, respectively.

CD007431,0,9174445,0,Clinical history in lumbar disc herniation. A prospective study in 160 patients.,"In a prospective study of 160 consecutive patients who underwent primary surgery for lumbar disc herniation, we investigated the value of clinical history for diagnosing the degree of herniation-the main prognostic factor for the postoperative outcome. At surgery, the patients were classified into two groups: intact anulus (negative exploration or protruding disc) and ruptured anulus (subligamentary perforation or complete perforation). The strongest variables predicting the degree of herniation were duration of leg pain, progressive leg pain, educational level and whether or not the patient had previously undergone non-spinal surgery. In patients with ruptured anulus, the median durations of low back pain and sciatica were 16 and 10 weeks, respectively. The corresponding figures for the group with intact anulus were 79 and 50 weeks. 18% of those with ruptured anulus and 39% of those with intact anulus were undergoing medical or psychiatric treatment for other diagnoses; 32% and 55% had previously undergone non-spinal surgery. Thus the two groups differed not only in disc pathology but also in medical, behavioral and social factors that must be taken into account in the preoperative assessment and that may explain discrepancies between impairment and disability."
CD007431,0,8277752,0,"Direct and indirect methods for the quantification of leg volume: comparison between water displacement volumetry, the disk model method and the frustum sign model method, using the correlation coefficient and the limits of agreement.","Volume changes can be measured either directly by water-displacement volumetry or by various indirect methods in which calculation of the volume is based on circumference measurements. The aim of the present study was to determine the most appropriate indirect method for lower leg volume calculation using water displacement volumetry as a 'golden standard'. For 20 male volunteers, age range: 20-35 years, the volume of both lower legs was determined directly by water-displacement volumetry, and indirectly by the frustum sign model method and the disc model method. Calculation of the correlation coefficient and the limits of agreement showed that water-displacement volumetry and the disc model method are interchangeable (r = +0.99, mean +/- 2s = -45 +/- 78 ml), whereas this does not hold for the frustum sign model (r = +0.93, mean +/- 2s = 521 +/- 238 ml). In the clinical situation volume measurement can be valuable for monitoring of the severity of oedema or haematoma occurrence after surgery or severe trauma. This non-invasive diagnostic aid may be a valuable adjuvant means of diagnosis for several volume dependent disorders of the extremities."
CD007431,0,8233471,0,[Clinical significance of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (Bertolotti syndrome)].,"500 lumbosacral plain x-ray injured patients and 1000 myelography of patients suffering from low back pain and nerve root sign were reviewed to evaluate the rate of transitional lumbosacral vertebra. This anomaly appeared in 4.6% in the normal population. The rate of the transitional vertebra in patients with nerve root syndrome was double (8.4%) whereas that with lumbar disc herniation four time as many as in the normal population. The data demonstrate that the asymmetrical anomalies have more clinical significance. The authors consider, that the role of the transitional vertebra is twofold: it can be consider primary in low back and sciatic pain, but in the formation of lumbar disc herniation is secondary. They find the analysis of the lumbosacral plain x-ray is necessary even in cases with CT and MRI."

Starting from day-to-day practice, criteria and attributes to guide decisions for a systemisation of the sociomedical assessment of performance in discopathy or associated diseases were compiled. The guidelines aim at standardising the sociomedical assessment of performance and help to make the decision-making process more transparent -- e. g. for the assessment of applications for decreased earning capacity benefits. The guidelines summarise typical manifestations of discopathy or associated diseases and describe the necessary medical information for the sociomedical assessment of performance. Relevant assessment criteria for the medical history, clinical examination, and for diagnostic tests are illustrated. The assessment of the individual's capacity is outlined, taking occupational factors into account. Following the determination of dysfunctions the remaining abilities and disabilities, respectively, are deduced and compared with occupational demands. Finally, inferences are drawn regarding the occupational capacity of the individual. Guidelines for the sociomedical assessment of performance in coronary heart disease (CHD) have been published in Gesundheitswesen 2002, 64: 451-465."

CD007431,0,17308763,0,Clinical-epidemiological profile of children with schistosomal myeloradiculopathy attended at the Instituto Materno-Infantil de Pernambuco.,"The most critical phase of exposure to schistosomal infection is the infancy, because of the more frequent contact with contaminated water and the immaturity of the immune system. One of the most severe presentations of this parasitosis is the involvement of the spinal cord, which prognosis is largely dependent on early diagnosis and treatment. Reports on this clinical form of schistosomiasis in children are rare in the literature. We present here the clinical-epidemiological profile of schistosomal myeloradiculopathy (SMR) from ten children who were admitted at the Instituto Materno-Infantil de Pernambuco over a five-year period. They were evaluated according to an investigation protocol. Most of these patients presented an acute neurological picture which included as the main clinical manifestations: sphincteral disorders, low back and lower limbs pain, paresthesia, lower limbs muscle weakness and absence of deep tendon reflex, and impairment of the gait. The diagnosis was presumptive in the majority of the cases. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the diagnosis of SMR in pediatric patients coming from endemic areas who present a low cord syndrome, in order to start the appropriate therapy and avoid future complications."

CD007431,0,10369992,0,Evaluation of the role of magnetic resonance myelography in lumbar spine imaging.,"The purpose of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of MR myelography in depicting disc herniation in the lumbar spine when compared with conventional MRI in patients presenting with clinical evidence of disc herniation. One hundred patients referred for conventional MR imaging of the lumbar spine also had coronal MR (TR 9000 ms, TE 272 ms eff, NEX 3, echo train length 32) myelography performed. Three experienced observers compared magnetic resonance myelography (MRM) with conventional lumbar spine MR using the following variables: visibility of thecal sac and nerve roots, and the presence, location and severity of disc herniation. Disc protrusions were seen at 110 disc space levels on conventional MR images as opposed to 93 on MRM. However, only 72 % of lesions seen on conventional MR were diagnosed by MRM. Similarly, only 63.8 % of nerve root compression abnormalities seen at conventional MR were visualized when compared with conventional MRM. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MRM when compared with conventional MR was 72, 93 and 85 %, respectively. The MRM technique yields images that resemble conventional myelography and may be used to help confirm abnormalities seen on conventional MR in selected cases; however, the large number of false-positive and false-negative examinations indicates that caution should be used in interpreting MRM images."

Preliminary data.,"Penetration of prednisolone across the blood-brain barrier was studied in 17 patients (ten women and seven men) with a mean age of 64 +/- 17 years admitted for nerve root pain warranting a lumbar puncture. One blood sample and one cerebrospinal fluid sample were obtained concomitantly from each patient, two hours (n = 7), four hours (n = 5) or six hours (n = 5) after an oral dose of 40 mg of prednisone. Prednisolone was assayed in all samples using high performance liquid chromatography and its binding to plasma proteins was determined using ultrafiltration. Total plasma prednisolone levels declined over time from 597 +/- 174 ng/ml two hours post-dose to 422 +/- 106 ng/ml four hours post-dose and 250 +/- 85 ng/ml six hours post-dose. Plasma levels of free prednisolone were 95 +/- 21 ng/ml, 59 +/- 17 ng/ml, and 18 +/- 14 ng/ml, respectively, at the same time points. Prednisolone was detectable in all cerebrospinal fluid samples, in levels of 14 +/- 2 ng/ml after two hours, 29 +/- 9 ng/ml after four hours and 17 +/- 7 ng/ml after six hours. These data demonstrate that equilibration of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels is achieved after six hours."
CD007431,0,10029752,0,TMJ static disk: correlation between clinical findings and pseudodynamic magnetic resonance images.,"The aim of this study was to analyze the position and mobility of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) articular disk by means of pseudodynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to compare: clinical features, osseus and muscular degenerative changes, the different types of static and their signs and symptoms. The study was performed on 101 patients with clinical and MRI diagnosis of TMJ internal derangement with closed lock (permanent or episodic). On the MRI survey the following was evaluated: disk displacement, disk mobility, condylar translation, bone, and muscular fatty atrophy. Pain was more frequent in static disks (SD) than in mobile disks (MD) in all types of disk displacements (p < 0.01). Condylar translation was always lower in SD than in MD, independently from the position of the articular disk (p < 0.01). Localized sclerosis was more frequent in joints with SD. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of fatty atrophy considering disk mobility. The results of the study indicate that clinical diagnosis of closed lock with high frequency is related to the presence of a static disk. Clinical diagnosis of SD can be confirmed with a pseudodynamic MRI survey."

All patients had chronic low back pain after failed conservative treatment. We were able to review 54 patients with a mean follow-up of 51 (24-97) months. The mean Oswestry low back pain disability score improved from 56.8 preoperative to postoperative 29.8 and 31.2 at follow-up (p<0.05).

Sixty patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent posterior nucleotomy at the Chiba University Hospital from October, 1954 to December, 1968 were completely reviewed. Fifty-six patients were clinically examined personally, and four patients by questionnaire. Their follow-up period ranged from 10 to 25 years, with an average 17.8 years. They consisted of 41 light, 9 moderate, and 10 heavy manual laborers. The results were as follows: 1) Over-all clinical results were excellent in 19 (32%), good in 32 (53%), fair in 5 (8%), and poor in 4 cases (7%). 2) Preoperative sciatica was completely relieved in 80 percent and straight leg raising test became negative in 88 percent. However, backache was completely relieved only in 38 percent, sensory disturbance in 43 percent, and numbness in 45 percent. 3) Generally, the follow-up X-rays showed stable narrowed intervertebral space at operated level in patients with satisfactory clinical results, while unstable and severely narrowed intervertebral space was seen in some patients with unsatisfactory clinical results. 4) Lumbar adhesive arachnoiditis was found in one fair and two poor cases. Operative trauma was thought to be one of their etiologic factors. Residual symptoms after posterior nucleotomy appeared to be correlated with this operative trauma."

In 32 patients, operated upon because of lumbar disc diseases without cauda equina syndrome, micturition symptoms were registered, and bladder function was investigated. Intravesical pressure/volume relations (water cystometry) and simultaneous intravesical pressure/urinary flow relations (urodynamic examination) were recorded preoperatively together with anal sphincter surface EMG. In almost half of the patients cystometry revealed bladder hyposensibility (late first sensation), and a quarter voided mainly by straining (detrusor paresis). These findings were unrelated to the neurosurgical pathology. Pronounced micturition symptoms or abnormal preoperative urodynamic examinations indicated evaluation two months after lumbar disc operation. Two-thirds tended towards recovery, one third remained unchanged."
CD007431,0,1538885,0,Nonoperative management of herniated nucleus pulposus: patient selection by the extension sign. Long-term follow-up.,"We have previously reported that the ability of patients with herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) and radiculopathy to achieve full passive lumbar extension (negative extension sign) is a useful predictor of favorable response to conservative management. Of 154 patients with back pain and radiculopathy seen between 1979 and 1985, 73 were selected for conservative management based on this criterion. We also reviewed results of electromyography (EMG), computed tomography (CT), myelography, straight leg raise, crossed straight leg raise, deep tendon reflex, and dermatomal-sensory and motor deficits. Ninety-four percent of the subjects achieved full extension within 5 days of hospital admission. Although some patients who had full extension on admission subsequently underwent chemonucleolysis or surgery, none of those who could not extend initially and who later gained full lumbar extension required surgery. Of the 33 patients who were available for long-term follow-up, 94% were satisfied with the results, 82% were able to resume working, 73% required no analgesics, and 9% later required chemonucleolysis or surgery. Positive findings on admission EMG (5 of 7 patients), myelography (5 of 8 patients), or CT (9 of 11) did not preclude good results with conservative management. Female patients without complaint at follow-up (53%) outnumbered their male counterparts (25%). Patients (19 of 33) whose extension sign was initially positive on admission and became negative within 5 days of hospitalization (average, 1.6 days) had better outcomes with 95% satisfied, 90% without job changes, 74% not requiring analgesia, and none requiring surgery. At long-term follow-up, the extension sign effectively predicted a favorable response to nonoperative therapy of HNP in 91% of cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,6864036,0,[Anatomical and clinical study on the femoral nerve lesion].,"Neuralgic and paralytic symptoms due to lesions of the femoral nerve or its related nerve roots are not infrequently encountered and therefore, clinically important. In order to clarify their pathomechanism the author has done anatomical, kinesiologic, and clinical studies. The topographic course of the femoral nerve was carefully observed in 40 cadavers (80 nerves) and transverse sections of 4 cadavers cut horizontally at various levels. The interrelation between the nerve and its surrounding organs was thus analysed. The 81 cases (87 nerves) of femoral nerve lesion, including lumbar radiculopathy, femoral neuropathy, and saphenous nerve lesion, were clinically followed up and the mechanism of their production was analysed. Besides, kinesiologic studies using electromyograms of the trunk and lower extremity muscles were performed in 8 cases (9 lesions) and 20 normal male controls. The main results obtained are as follows: 1. From the embryologic and morphologic points of view, the femoral nerve runs a peculiar course and has characteristic shapes in its transverse sections at various levels. 2. As the nerve lies closely adjacent to several pelvic organs, it can easily be influenced by their pathological conditions. 3. When the adjacent organs are treated surgically, it may be rare that the nerve is injured, constituting a complication. 4. The pathomechanism of the femoral neuropathy occurring at the inguinal ligament is quite similar to that of entrapment neuropathy of the peripheral nerve that occurs at a fibro-osseous tunnel. 5. Even if the quadriceps femoris muscle is totally paralysed, extention of the knee joint is possible to some extent because of a compensatory action of the tensor fasciae latae muscle."
CD007431,0,8266201,0,Clinical experience with automated percutaneous discectomy.,"This study was performed to evaluate a group of patients undergoing automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy. All patients had disc pathology at L4/L5 and L5/S1 documented on CT scan and/or MRI. The range of follow-up was between 3 months and 20 months. The average hospital stay was 2 days (range 1-3 days). A total of 21 patients underwent the procedure and 18 were available for assessment. Of these, 12 patients improved. Of the patients that did not, two subsequently underwent surgical discectomy. There was one failed procedure but no other intra- or post-operative complications. The results of the study indicate that percutaneous discectomy has a demonstrable low morbidity and can be performed under local anaesthesia. However, proper patient selection is important for successful results."
CD007431,0,3192567,0,Diagnosis of lumbar disc protrusion. A comparison between magnetic resonance imaging and radiculography.,"Forty-two consecutive patients with suspected lumbar disc protrusions were studied prospectively to compare the diagnostic accuracy of low-field strength MRI with that of radiculography. Thirty patients subsequently underwent surgical exploration at 33 levels and the operative findings were compared to both methods of diagnostic imaging. All patients had MRI studies, whilst 29 patients also had radiculography. Both studies were evaluated without prior knowledge of the clinical signs, operative findings or the results of other imaging techniques. MRI predicted the correct diagnosis in 29 of the 33 levels explored, an accuracy of 88%. All discs proven to be abnormal demonstrated a reduced signal from the nucleus pulposus. There were two false positive results and two doubtful cases but no false negatives. Radiculography predicted the correct diagnosis in 24 of 32 levels explored, an accuracy of 75%. There were two false positive results, five doubtfuls and one false negative. The overall accuracy when both tests were considered rose to 94%. Of the remaining 12 patients all except one showed good correlation between the MRI and radiculographic findings. These results indicate that low field strength MRI is slightly better than radiculography in diagnosing lumbar disc protrusions."
CD007431,0,17952276,0,Is preoperative occupation related to long-term pain in patients operated for lumbar disc herniation?,"Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common cause of back and sciatic pain. When clinical treatment fails, surgery may be indicated in selected patients. Although surgery is effective in most cases, some of these patients may have a poor outcome. Different factors may influence these results and poor adaptation at work is one well-known cause of treatment failure. This study examines 350 patients on long-term follow-up after surgery for first-time LDH. The relationship was analyzed between occupation before surgery and outcome (maintenance of lumbar and leg pain, satisfaction with the surgical treatment and return to work). The preoperative occupation (employed in public or private services, autonomous, unemployed, housewife, retired or student) and the exertion at work were analyzed as prognostic factors for different clinical outcomes. Although unemployed people had higher numerical analog scale for lumbar pain and retired patients had a higher leg pain, this difference was not statistically significant. Retired people were significantly less satisfied with the surgical result. Higher exertion at work showed a statistically insignificant higher level of pain and lower degree of satisfaction. The authors conclude that preoperative occupation was not a statistically significant factor in this series of patients."
CD007431,0,8826493,0,"Specificity of diagnostic nerve blocks: a prospective, randomized study of sciatica due to lumbosacral spine disease.","Temporary nerve blocks using local anesthetic are employed extensively in the evaluation of pain problems, particularly lumbosacral spine disease. Their specificity and sensitivity in localizing anatomic sources of pain have never been studied formally, however, and so their diagnostic and prognostic value is questionable. There have been anecdotal reports of relief of pain by temporary blocks directed to areas of pain referral, as opposed to areas of documented underlying pathology; but there has been no study to define the frequency or magnitude of this effect. We have examined the specificity and sensitivity of a battery of local anesthetic blocks in a series of 33 patients with a chief complaint of sciatica, attributable in all cases to spinal disease (radiculopathy, with some clinical features of arthropathy). As determined by blinded patient analog ratings in randomized sequence, three different nerve blocks were significantly more effective than control lumbar subcutaneous injection of an identical volume of 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (P < 0.05). Not only paraspinal lumbosacral root blocks and medial branch posterior primary ramus blocks (at or proximal to the pathology), but also sciatic nerve blocks (distal or collateral to the pathology) produced temporary relief in a majority of patients. This confirmed the study hypothesis that false positive results are common, and specificity is low. For sciatic nerve blocks, specificity was between 24% and 36%. Patterns of responses specific to the established diagnosis of radiculopathy (i.e., root block most effective) had sensitivities between 9% and 42%. Statistical analysis of clinical and technical prognostic factors revealed that the only association with pain relief by any block were the effects of other blocks. The strongest association was between relief by sciatic nerve block and relief by medial branch posterior primary ramus (facet) block (P = 0.001, odds ratio 16.0). There were no associations between the results of blocks and clinical findings (history, physical examination, diagnostic imaging) in these patients, chosen for their homogeneous clinical presentation and absence of functional signs. Our findings indicate a limited role for uncontrolled local anesthetic blocks in the diagnostic evaluation of sciatica and referred pain syndromes in general. Negative blocks or a pattern of responses may have some predictive value, but isolated, positive blocks are non-specific. This lack of specificity may, however, be advantageous in therapeutic applications."

The L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs were investigated by both techniques in all patients. In addition, the L3-L4 disc was investigated in 20 patients. The 220 investigated discs were sorted out into 6 CT categories according to morphologic and technical criteria. They were also classified into 3 discographic groups according to morphologic and clinical criteria. Based on morphologic considerations alone, the false-negative CT rates varied from 0 to 64% and the false-positive rates varied from 0 to 19%, depending on the category under consideration. Based on both morphologic and clinical consideration, the false-negative CT rates varied from 34 to 57% and the false-positive CT rates varied from 23 to 50%. Thus, high-resolution CT does not constitute an adequate means of investigation for this category of patients and discography appears justified before considering any form of radical therapy."

The study population consisted of 240 subjects with knee pain aged 19 to 93 years. A total of 309 knees had a weight bearing AP in extension, lateral, skyline and tunnel view radiographs. Each radiograph was reported with respect to features related to osteoarthritis, modified from the Ahlback system. Each feature was assessed using the tunnel radiograph alone and then the AP, lateral and skyline views in combination without, and blind to, the information from the tunnel view. On the basis of Bowker's test, the tunnel view was more likely to pick up abnormal intercondylar notch and tibial spine osteophytes but not loose bodies. We conclude that the tunnel view is a valuable addition in the routine assessment of the knee joint in osteoarthritis but not for the diagnosis of loose bodies alone."

The study was carried out with 8 inpatients affected with a unilateral sciatica resulting from an X-ray identified dorsal root compression from discal origin. The sural nerve was electrically stimulated at the ankle level while BEPs were recorded monopolarly from the vertex. The stimulus intensity eliciting a liminal nociceptive reflex response in a knee-flexor muscle associated with a liminal pain was selected for this study. Both normal and affected side were alternatively stimulated during several conditions of controls and of Lasègue's manoeuvres performed on the normal and on the affected side. Results show that the Lasègue manoeuvre performed on the affected side induced a significant increase in the amplitude of N150-P220; performed on the normal side, this same manoeuvre resulted in a significant decrease of the N150-P220 amplitude. These variations were observed whatever was the side (normal or affected) under sural nerve stimulation.

Ranges of SLR and SLR with dorsiflexion (SLR/DF) to onset of lumbar or leg symptoms (P1) were independently measured using a gravity goniometer by pairs of different physiotherapists at two clinics. Dorsiflexion significantly reduced SLR range by a mean of 9 degrees across both samples. Similar high inter-rater reliability was found for SLR and SLR/DF in both pairs of physiotherapists. These data show that SLR and SLR/DF are reliable procedures when measured to P1 in the clinical environment and support previous findings that dorsiflexion reduces range of SLR.

No complications were seen. The result was not influenced by the amount of disc material removed, age, duration of symptoms or the size of the disc hernia. Reduced size of disc hernia was found in 13 out of 14 satisfied patients followed by CT. All unsatisfied were conventionally operated on. The percutaneous treated patients had 1 day of hospitalisation and on average 11 weeks of sick-leave compared to an average of 6 days and 16 weeks following conventional discectomy."

Objective and subjective criteria were analyzed before treatment and after five sessions of acupuncture. The study was double blind. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 15 were treated on electrically detected points and 15 on ""placebo"" points. In the ""placebo"" group, no significant improvement was recorded. Conversely, in the treated group, study of objective criteria showed improvement of the Lasegue sign. Among subjective symptoms, positive responses were recorded in the duration of improvement, degree of improvement in decubitus and after ten minutes standing, and use of analgesics. Compared to the ""placebo"" group these changes are statistically significant."
CD007431,0,9615139,0,[Long-term outcome at adjacent levels of lumbar arthrodesis].,"Posterolateral lumbar fusion is commonly recognized to have a significant effect upon the more proximal unfused segments. Wether these effects are clinically significant remains unclear. Long term studies with standardized follow-up are scarce. The purpose of this study was to examine the long term roentgenographic and clinical effects of posterolateral fusion upon the 3 cephalad unfused segments. The levels below a floating fusion were also examined. The factors promoting the occurrence of degenerative changes on standard or dynamic x rays were also investigated with a multivariate analysis model. 102 patients who underwent a posterolateral fusion were retrospectively reviewed with an average follow-up of 8.9 years. 39 patients (group I) were fused for low back pain caused by isthmic lysis spondylolisthesis, 15 (group II) for degenerative disc disease and 48 (group III) in addition to a posterior decompression for a lumbar spinal stenosis. Pre and postoperative standard and dynamic roentgenograms were compared in order to study: evolution of the disc space height, modifications in the angular and antero-posterior mobility, modifications in the antero-posterior displacement of the vertebral bodies. Degenerative changes were frequent. 49 per cent of the patients demonstrated a severe disc space narrowing, 30 per cent developed a degenerative spondylolisthesis, 32 per cent an angular hypermobility and 35 per cent an antero-posterior hypermobility. Only one factor was found to increase significantly the occurrence of degenerative changes: the indication of lumbar fusion. Degenerative changes were significantly more frequent in group III's patients. However, no significant correlation was found between the roentgenographic findings and the final functional results and only 8 patients required a new surgery. These results may suggest that posterolateral fusion accelerates the development of degenerative changes in adjacent discs if the fusion is performed on a degenerative spine."
CD007431,0,3155669,0,Back injuries in gymnastics.,"The complaint of low back pain in the adolescent must never be taken lightly. A high index of suspicion should be particularly entertained in a child participating in gymnastic training or competition. As noted in this article, steps can now be taken, particularly if a specific diagnosis is made early, to institute specific treatment with a high likelihood of success. Young gymnasts complaining of back pain must never be passed off as having sustained a back strain or ""muscle spasms"" and treated symptomatically. Persistent back pain beyond two weeks warrants, in our opinion, a complete evaluation, careful history and physical examination, a four-view radiographic assessment of the spine, and, if necessary, bone scans or other more advanced techniques to make a specific diagnosis of the cause of the pain."

CD007431,0,1827051,0,[Periradiculographic and CT examination in the differential diagnosis of pain after intervertebral disk surgery].,"Between February 1, 1982 and December 31, 1988 at the Neurosurgical Clinic of the Faculty Hospital and Policlinic in Kosice on account of justified suspicion of a relapse of discogenic compression of the lumbosacral spinal roots 102 patients were re-operated (38 women, 64 men) aged 18 to 65 years (mean 39.5 years). Of these three who were hypersensitive to iodine were reoperated at a time when the hospital did not yet possess a CT based on clinical symptoms. In 61 patients the indicated re-operation was supported by the conclusions of periradiculographic, in 21 of native CT and in 17 based on both mentioned examinations. Comparison of the surgical findings with the X-ray findings revealed that on periradiculography the conclusion was in complete agreement in 31 patients, in another 27 partial agreement (a total of 73.3% patients examined in this way), in those examined by CT there was complete agreement in 16 and partial agreement in 11 (i.e. 71.1% on this sub-group).

CD007431,0,3665231,0,A revised objective rating system for patient selection for chymopapain chemonucleolysis.,"A revised objective rating system, previously found useful for patient selection for lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, was evaluated in patient selection for chemonucleolysis by intradiscal chymopapain. Based on the severity of findings within each of four categories (neurologic signs, root tension signs, myelogram or computed tomography (CT) findings, and psychosocial environment), numerical scores are derived. A maximum score of 25 points is available in each of four categories for a total of 100 points. The objective rating score was determined in a series of 101 patients prior to treatment of lumbar disc herniation by chemonucleolysis. The patients were evaluated at least one year after injection. The objective rating score was predictive of the result of chemonucleolysis, and was even more strongly predictive of the ultimate surgical outcome, which included the results in 22 patients who were treated by laminectomy after chemonucleolysis failure."
CD007431,0,8278829,0,Scapulohumeral reflex (Shimizu). Its clinical significance and testing maneuver.,"Searching for a muscle stretch reflex that is innervated by the high cervical cord, the authors discovered the scapulohumeral reflex (Shimizu)--SHR (Shimizu). The testing maneuver, localization of the reflex center, its clinical significance, and the designation of the SHR (Shimizu) are dealt with in this report. The SHR is elicited by tapping the tip of the spine of the scapula and acromion in a caudal direction. The SHR is classified as hyperactive only when an elevation of the scapula or an abduction of the humerus have been clearly defined after tapping at these points. Two hundred twenty-five patients with cervical spine disorders, 90 normal individuals, and 17 patients with cerebrovascular strokes were examined. The incidence of hyperactive SHR was highest among several neurologic abnormalities in spastic cases with craniovertebral or high cervical lesions, and all cases with hyperactive SHR in the cervical spine disorder group exhibited neural compressive factors at the high cervical region. The major muscles participating in the SHR are considered to be the upper portion of the trapezius, the levator scapulae, and the deltoid. According to the anatomic level of compressive factors and the postoperative course of the activity in hyperactive SHR cases, the reflex center of the SHR is clinically presumed to be located between the posterior arch of C1 and the caudal edge of the C3 body. Hyperactive SHR provides useful information about dysfunctions of the upper motor neurons cranial to the C3 vertebral body level."
CD007431,0,8297630,0,The clinical diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy.,"Lumbar radiculopathy may be caused by, or confused with, many different conditions. The nature of the patient's pain--its quality, intensity, location, and profile over time--is an important guide in the evaluation. A careful but directed physical examination is necessary for the clinical evaluation of patients with lumbar spine disease. Evaluation involves inspection of the back and limbs, palpation, and observation of the patient. A careful neurological evaluation, examination of strength, deep tendon reflexes, sensation, and muscular function is necessary. Electromyography is often useful. The most commonly involved nerve roots are L3, L4, L5, and S1. Lesions of each produce distinct symptoms, and other conditions can mimic the radiculopathies. Specific investigation is necessary for an accurate diagnosis."
CD007431,0,16850291,0,Clinical experience in cell-based therapeutics: intervention and outcome.,"Disc herniation treated by discectomy results in a significant loss of nucleus material and disc height. Biological restoration through the use of autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation (ADCT) offers a potential to achieve functional integration of disc metabolism and mechanics. Nucleus regeneration using autologous cultured disc-derived chondrocytes has been demonstrated in a canine model and in clinical pilot studies. In 2002 a prospective, controlled, randomized, multicentre study comparing safety and efficacy of ADCT plus discectomy, with discectomy alone was initiated. The clinical goals were to provide long-term pain relief, maintain disc height, and prevent adjacent segment disease. Interim analysis was performed after 2 years; Oswestry (Low Back Pain/disability), Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale, as well as Prolo and VAS Score were used for the evaluation. Disc height was assessed by MRI. A clinically significant reduction of low back pain in the ADCT-treated group was shown by all three pain score systems. The median total Oswestry Score was 2 in the ADCT group compared with 6 in the control group. Decreases in the Disability index in ADCT-treated patients correlated with the reduction of low back pain. Decreases in disc height over time were only found in the control group, and of potential significance, intervertebral discs in adjacent segments appeared to retain hydration when compared to those adjacent to levels that had undergone discectomy without cell intervention."

The subjects consisted of 56 young conscripts with LDH and 76 controls. All subjects completed Beck's Depression Inventory and Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. To evaluate pain intensity and functional disability, the Visual Analogue Scale and the Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire were used. LDH conscripts had more depression and anxiety than the controls. The functional disability of the LDH conscripts was significantly related to the four variables: pain intensity, depression, state anxiety, and trait anxiety. Pain intensity and state anxiety significantly contributed to the functional disability in the LDH conscripts. This study suggests that LDH conscripts have some psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety, in comparison to healthy controls. Furthermore, the pain intensity and state anxiety predict the functional disability in LDH conscripts."

CD007431,0,9686398,0,Selective abnormality of the N13 spinal SEP to dermatomal stimulation in patients with cervical monoradiculopathy.,"Scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) to dermatomal stimulation have so far proved to be only partially useful in the diagnosis of monoradiculopathy, mostly in cases without motor impairment. The aim of our study was to test the sensitivity of the spinal N13 potential in uncovering lesions of single cervical roots. We studied five patients suffering from cervical monoradiculopathy, using a recording technique allowing specific recording of the genuine N13 potential which is probably generated by dorsal horn cells. No patient showed signs of muscle impairment and needle EMG was always normal. In four patients, the N13 SEP was absent following stimulation of the dermatome corresponding to the damaged root, while both the lemniscal P14 and the cortical N20 components were normal. SEP recorded after stimulation of upper limb troncular nerves showed no abnormality in all patients. Our findings suggest that the N13 potential, the loss of which after dermatomal stimulation could be due to deafferentation of dorsal horn neurones, is particularly sensitive to initial root compression. Therefore, our montage allowing analysis of the genuine N13 SEP can improve the sensitivity of dermatomal SEP recording in patients with cervical monoradiculopathies."

CD007431,0,15940017,0,Evaluation of the changes in the muscle sympathetic nerve activity and anterior tibial muscle blood flow caused by the Valsalva maneuver in patients with lumbago and healthy subjects.,"Clinical symptoms affecting the lower extremities are common among lumber spinal disorder patients. Pain, numbness and sensory disturbance are major signs of these symptoms, and have been suggested to be related to sympathetic nerve disturbance. This study was designed to examine whether these patients experience a difference in sympathetic nerve flow in terms of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA) compared to healthy subjects. Five patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation of the spine (LIDH) and four patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS) were examined along with six healthy volunteers. Basic MSAs for IDH and SCS patients that were introduced from a common peroneal nerve were found to be statistically higher than those of the control subjects. MSA behavior and muscle blood flow introduced from the tibialis anterior muscle over 30 seconds while performing the Valsalva maneuver, a well-known technique used to artificially facilitate MSA, were examined for all subjects, and showed relatively slower changes for LIDH and LSCS patients compared to the normal subjects. Muscle blood flow was inversely proportional to MSA for the normal subjects, and this relationship was observed for IDH patients as well as SCS patients. However, MSA and the muscle blood flow of patients gradually changed while performing the Valsalva maneuver relative to the control subjects. This suggests that the systemic physiological response to the maneuver is maintained, but that, some local modification mechanisms exist."

CD007431,0,2303870,0,Posterolateral microdisectomy for cervical monoradiculopathy caused by posterolateral soft cervical disc sequestration.,"The controversy over whether to use a posterior or anterior approach for surgical treatment of soft cervical discs is still largely unsettled. However, although the posterior approach may be underutilized, it has distinct advantages when there are specific indications. Out of a large pool of cases, 53 patients presented with acute monoradiculopathy caused by soft cervical disc herniation. In 36 of these, the disc was sequestered (nonconfined) and was posterolateral to the disc space as seen on computerized tomography-myelography. Distinct motor weakness was a common clinical finding in all 36 cases. These patients were treated by using a 2- to 3-cm skin incision for the posterolateral microsurgical approach. The extent of the lateral facetectomy depended upon the relationship between the nerve root and the disc. All fragments were lateral to the dural sac and were sequestered through the anulus fibrosus and the posterior longitudinal ligament. Sequestrations were removed under direct microscopic vision, but the disc space was not entered. Pain relief and motor-power improvement in the affected radicular distribution were immediate in all patients. Sensory deficit and residual motor loss improved dramatically with normalization at approximately 6 months. No complications occurred and the mean hospital stay was 2 days. The follow-up period varied from 4 to 42 months with a mean of 26 months. Thus far, there have been no recurrences or other associated complications. By using strict selection criteria and a microsurgical posterolateral approach with removal of the sequestered disc fragment, excellent results with normalization of the monoradiculopathy can be obtained. The ease of this technique, low risk, minimal complications, and excellent results make it an attractive alternative to the anterior approach. The clinical presentations, specific indications, surgical technique, and clinical results are discussed; and a prototype of a small cervical self-retaining retractor is described."
CD007431,0,2303871,0,Diagnosis and microsurgical approach to far-lateral disc herniation in the lumbar spine.,"Lumbar-disc herniations that occur beneath or far lateral to the intervertebral facet joint are increasingly recognized as a cause of spinal nerve root compression syndromes at the upper lumbar levels. Failure to diagnose and precisely localize these herniations can lead to unsuccessful surgical exploration or exploration of the incorrect interspace. If these herniations are diagnosed, they often cannot be adequately exposed through the typical midline hemilaminectomy approach. Many authors have advocated a partial or complete unilateral facetectomy to expose these herniations, which can lead to vertebral instability or contribute to continued postoperative back pain. The authors present a series of 25 patients who were diagnosed as having far lateral lumbar disc herniations and underwent paramedian microsurgical lumbar-disc excision. Twelve of these were at the L4-5 level, six at the L5-S1 level, and seven at the L3-4 level. In these cases, myelography is uniformly normal and high-quality magnetic resonance images may not be helpful. High-resolution computerized tomography (CT) appears to be the best study, but even this may be negative unless enhanced by performing CT-discography. Discography with enhanced CT is ideally suited to precisely diagnose and localize these far-lateral herniations. The paramedian muscle splitting microsurgical approach was found to be the most direct and favorable anatomical route to herniations lateral to the neural foramen. With this approach, there is no facet destruction and postoperative pain is minimal. Patients were typically discharged on the 3rd or 4th postoperative day. The clinical and radiographic characteristics of far-lateral lumbar-disc herniations are reviewed and the paramedian microsurgical approach is discussed."

CD007431,0,7498070,0,Human root and cord potentials evoked by Achilles tendon tap.,"Lumbosacral root potentials and sacral spinal cord segmental responses were recorded epidurally in 24 normal adult subjects by tapping the Achilles Tendon with the electronic hammer (mechanical). The averaged responses were also recorded from the same epidural levels after the electrical stimulation of the Posterior Tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa (electrical). While the dorsal and reflexively evoked ventral root responses were easily obtained by the electrical stimulation; by the mechanical stimulation only a late and small ventral root response with two negative deflections could be evoked at the L4-5 or L5-S1 I.V. (intervertebral) epidural levels. The ventral root responses elicited by mechanical stimulation appeared 4.0 msec later than those elicited by the electrical stimulation. This time interval was exactly the same when the latencies of the Soleus reflexes to both stimuli were compared that for the Achilles tendon reflex being 4.0 msec delayed. When the sums of their afferent and the efferent conduction times (to and from Th12-L1 I.V. levels) were extracted from the total conduction times of the Soleus H and Achilles tendon reflex obtained by the EMG recordings, the sacral cord conduction delay was found 1.8 msec for the H-Reflex and 4.1 msec for the Achilles tendon reflex. It was suggested that the twice longer time delay along the sacral cord to Achilles tendon tap might be due to the oligosynaptic linkage of the Achilles tendon reflex or it may result from highly dispersed afferent volley producing a slowly rising wave or excitation that takes longer to reach threshold for the soleus motoneurone discharges."
CD007431,0,2775595,0,Lumbar spinal canal size of sciatica patients.,"Seven measures at the three lowest lumbar interspaces were recorded from conventional radiographs of the lumbar spines of 160 consecutive patients with low back pain and sciatica admitted for myelography and possible surgery. Eighty-eight patients were operated upon for disc herniation, and of the conservatively-treated 72 patients, 18 had a pathologic and 54 a normal myelogram. The results were evaluated after one year using the occupational handicap scales of WHO. Correlations of radiographic measures to stature were moderate and to age small. After adjusting for stature and age, only the male interpedicular distances and the antero-posterior diameter of intervertebral foramen at L3 were greater than those of females. The males with a pathologic myelogram had smaller posterior disc height at L3 and a smaller interarticular distance at L3 and L4 than those with normal myelogram, likewise the midsagittal diameter at L3 and L4 in females. In all patients other measures besides posterior disc height were smaller than those for low back pain patients (p less than 0.001) or for cadavers (p less than 0.001). The only correlation between measures and clinical manifestations was between pedicular length at L3 and limited straight leg raising. Where the disc material had been extruded into the spinal canal, the interpedicular distance was significantly wider. Only anterior disc height at L3 revealed differences between good and poor outcome one year after surgery, as did the interarticular distance at S1 in patients with normal myelogram after conservative treatment."
CD007431,0,1308095,0,Objective clinical evaluation of physical impairment in chronic low back pain.,"The aim of this study was to investigate physical impairment in patients with chronic low back pain, to develop a method of clinical evaluation suitable for routine use, and to consider the relationship between pain, disability, and physical impairment. Twenty-seven physical tests were investigated. Permanent anatomic and structural impairments of spinal deformities, spinal fractures, surgical scarring, and neurologic deficits were excluded as not relevant to the patient with low back pain in the absence of nerve root involvement or previous surgery. Three consecutive 20-patient reproducibility studies were used to develop reliable methods of examination for 23 of the tests. Only four tests were excluded as unreliable: sacral angle, pelvic tilt, and separate lumbar and pelvic extension, none of which are part of routine clinical examination or have any proven relationship to disability. The remaining 23 physical tests were evaluated in 70 asymptomatic subjects and 120 patients with chronic low back pain. Passive knee flexion, passive hip flexion, hip flexion strength, hip abduction strength, pain reproduction on each of these tests, and the prone extension strength test were excluded because they were too closely related to nonorganic and behavioral responses to examination. Eight tests successfully discriminated patients with low back pain from normal subjects and were significantly related to self-report disability in activities of daily living: pelvic flexion, total flexion, total extension, lateral flexion, straight leg raising, spinal tenderness, bilateral active straight leg raising, and sit-up. Factor analysis failed to demonstrate an underlying statistical dimension of physical impairment. However, an empirical combination of total flexion, total extension, average lateral flexion, average straight leg raising, spinal tenderness, bilateral active straight leg raising, and sit-up provided an equally satisfactory alternative. Simple cut-offs from normal subjects made the scale simple and quick to use. This final scale successfully discriminated 78% of patients and normal subjects and explained 25% of the variance of disability, with a specificity of 86% and sensitivity of 76%. This scale provides an objective clinical evaluation that meets the criteria for evaluating physical impairment, yet is simple, reliable, and suitable for routine clinical use. It should, however, be emphasized that all the tests included in the final scale are measures of current functional limitation rather than of permanent anatomic or structural impairment. This raises questions about the physical basis of permanent disability due to chronic low back pain."

CD007431,0,2483632,0,[Radiculopathy and the organization of health services: applicability verification of a technic for analyzing time factors in diagnostic procedures].,"The PERT is a SPR (Reticular Programation System) based on statistic-mathematic models. Since some years they are applied to productive processes to increase the efficiency and effectiveness. They all have a same base structure which is the net that is composed by the logical succession of the event and the activity which has the part of the project. Determining the minimum time (to), the maximum one (tp) and the more frequent time (tm) of each activity and applying the statistic method PERT, one gets the probable duration (te) of every activity and the critical path of the net is placed in evidence. This is formed by the chain of those activities whose duration determines the total duration of the project. The Authors have desired to verify the applicability of SPR even to the ""medical industry"" and, more precisely, to the diagnostic process for the verification of radiculoneuropathy. Such pathology affects a large part of the active population. The diagnostic process in this case comprises besides an accurate neurological and clinical examination of the patient, also the x-ray exam, the electromyography, the Computed Tomography (CT) and the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) exam. These last two investigations gives an increase of diagnostic accuracy. With the collaboration of the physicians of the diagnostic Service, the Authors have measured in every step of the diagnostic procedure the waiting time of 48 patients with low back pain. Applying the PERT method, it has been possible to put in evidence in the net the critical activities. They are such that their duration time determines the probable duration of the whole diagnostic process. Such duration in this case it corresponds to 91 days with a standard deviation of 33 days. The delay of any critical activity causes a lealy of the whole route. This delay influences negatively on the patient's health. Besides it determines an economic damage to the system because a relation cost/time exists. The systems of reticular programmation have as objective not only the one of improving the programmation and the control of the processes, but also the attainment of an optimum cost/time ratio, varying in a way that the total cost of the realization of the process is minimum. They represent a useful criterion to direct Quality Assurance (Q.A) in the local political sanitary context, within the bounds of organization of technical - scientific quality. An accurate application of the Q.A. should modify besides the duration of the critical activities."

Adult and elderly lumbar spine deformities are often symptomatic, because the degenerative changes of deformed spine and the progression of the deformity. Patients with such a clinical picture need surgical correction of the deformity in order to improve their symptoms. Sometimes these patients undergo disc herniation surgical procedures, because of wrong interpretations of CT scans or MR images.

CD007431,0,10204736,0,"The impact of clinical, morphological, psychosocial and work-related factors on the outcome of lumbar discectomy.","In a prospective controlled trial on 46 patients undergoing lumbar discectomy, three classes of variables (medical data including MRI-identified morphological abnormalities, general psychological factors and psychosocial aspects of work) were analyzed with regard to their predictive value for the outcome of lumbar disc surgery at 2 year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify the best predictor variables of four different outcome measures (i.e. pain relief, reduction of disability in daily activities, return to work and surgical outcome). MRI-identified nerve root compromise and social support from the spouse were independent predictors of pain relief 2 years after surgery (R2 = 0.40, P < 0.01). Return to work 2 years after surgery was best predicted by depression and occupational mental stress (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). MRI-identified extent of herniation and depression were significant predictors of a good surgical outcome after lumbar discectomy (R2 = 0.61, P < 0.001). This study has demonstrated that the outcome of discectomy is critically dependent on which outcome variables are selected and that different sorts of predictor variables have a distinct influence on the various outcome variables. Obvious morphological alterations (i.e. disc extrusions, nerve root compromise) proved to be significant predictors of postoperative pain relief and improvement of disability in daily activities justifying a surgical treatment approach in these cases. The most important finding of this study was that return to work was not influenced by any clinical findings or MR-identified morphological alterations, but solely by psychological factors (i.e. depression) and psychological aspects of work (i.e. occupational mental stress)."

A prospective, controlled study.","We analysed prospectively 26 patients who had revision operations for ipsilateral recurrent radicular pain after a period of pain relief of more than six months following primary discectomy. They were assessed before the initial operation, between the two procedures and at a minimum of two years after reoperation. MRI was performed before primary discectomy and reoperation. Fifty consecutive patients who had a disc excision during the study period but did not have recurrent radicular pain, were analysed as a control group. Of the study group 42% related the onset of recurrent radicular pain to an isolated injury or a precipitating event, but none of the control group did so (p < 0.001). T2-weighted MRI performed before primary discectomy showed that patients in the study group had significantly more severe disc degeneration compared with the control group (p=0.02). Intraoperative findings revealed recurrent disc herniation in 24 patients and bulging of the disc in two, one of whom also had lateral stenosis. Epidural scarring was found to be abundant, intraoperatively and on MRI, in eight and in nine patients, respectively. At the last follow-up, the clinical outcome was satisfactory in 85% of patients in the study group and in 88% of the control group (p > 0.05). Work or daily activities had been resumed at the same level as before the onset of symptoms by 81% of the patients in the study group and 84% of the control group. No correlation was found between the amount of epidural fibrosis, as seen intraoperatively and on MRI, and the result of surgery. The recurrence of radicular pain caused no significant changes in the psychological profile compared with the assessment before the primary discectomy."

In a prospective cohort study of 277 patients undergoing surgery for lumbosacral radicular syndrome, the predictive value of preoperatively measured cognitive-behavioral factors (fear of movement/(re)injury, passive pain coping, and negative outcome expectancies) for disability and pain intensity at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery was investigated, taking into account the effect of possible confounding variables. Higher levels of cognitive-behavioral factors were found to be associated with a worse outcome at both 6 weeks and 6 months. These associations remained significant after controlling for possible confounding variables (preoperative disability and pain intensity, age, gender, educational level, duration of complaints, neurological deficits, and intake of analgesics) and pain intensity 3 days postoperatively. In multiple regression analyses, the cognitive-behavioral factors independently predicted different outcomes. Fear of movement/(re)injury predicted more disability and more severe pain at 6 weeks and more severe pain at 6 months; passive pain-coping strategies predicted more disability at 6 months; and negative outcome expectancies predicted more disability and more severe pain at both 6 weeks and 6 months. The findings support the potential utility of preoperative screening measures that include cognitive-behavioral factors for predicting surgical outcome, as well as studies to examine the potential benefits of cognitive-behavioral treatment to improve surgical outcome."

In one of the series (30 patients) symptoms of cauda equina compression, with bladder and rectal disturbances, were present, and in the other series (28 patients) these symptoms were absent. The observation period was five years (median value). The late results are evaluated in relation to the time interval between the onset of symptoms and operation. In the series with caudal compression syndrome, sphincter disturbances persisted in 10 patients, six of whom underwent operation during the first week after the onset of symptoms. The prognosis was most favourale when the symptoms developed slowly. Seventeen patients have returned to work. The importance of early operation in patients with classical compression syndrome of the cauda equina is emphasized. In the series without caudal compression syndrome, the symptomatalogy varied. The duration of symptoms was strikingly long. Only 19 patients are able to work. The others are prevented from working by persistent backache and leg pains, and in four cases by pareses of the extremities. In these cases also the importance of early operation is stressed."

It is postulated that measurements of endurance, kinematics, postural stability, and coordination, in addition to strength, are necessary to fully document the patients' functional capabilities. This research study was conducted in order to understand the effects of fatigue on the above factors. Twelve healthy male subjects performed a repetitive lifting test in which a submaximal load was lifted at a maximal rate. Knee, hip, and trunk motion was measured using videography and electrogoniometry, postural stability was measured using a forceplate, and coordination parameters were determined using phase-plane analysis. Fatigue was documented by a 31% reduction in lifting power. At the end of the endurance test, there was less knee and hip range of motion and greater spine peak flexion, while the coordination measures demonstrated that there was greater hip and lumbar spine extension earlier in the lifting phase. The postural stability declined as the test endured. Utilization of these measures may guide physical therapists in their rehabilitation of low back pain patients."

CD007431,0,16912888,0,Changes in the total Oswestry Index and its ten items in females and males pre- and post-surgery for lumbar disc herniation: a 1-year follow-up.,"To study the characteristics and changes in the total Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and in its ten component items in female and male patients pre- and post-surgery for lumbar disc herniation. Ninety-eight patients [mean (SD) age 43 (13), 61% males] undergoing lumbar disc herniation surgery were selected for this clinical 12-month follow-up. Subjective disability and back and leg pain were assessed by ODI version 1.0 and the visual analog scale. Pre-operatively females had a significantly higher mean (SD) total ODI [59(3)] than males [51(2)] (P = 0.030). Females were more disabled in the walking, sex life, social life and travelling items of the ODI compared to males. The total Oswestry decreased by 38 (95% CI - 44 to - 31) in females and by 34 (- 39 to - 30) in males at the 1-year follow-up. Most of the improvement (88% in females and 80% in males) occurred during the first 6 weeks; thereafter the changes were minor. In males the changes were greatest in pain, social life and travelling and in females in walking, social life and travelling. Internal consistency value of ODI was 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.91). Item analysis of the ODI showed that all the items except pain had high corrected item correlation. As recovery following lumbar disc surgery occurred to a great extent during the first 6 weeks, the early post-operative outcome appears to be quite a reliable indicator of the overall post-operative outcome over the 1-year follow-up. The ODI proved to capture a wide range of disability in these lumbar disc surgery patients, thereby supporting the future use of the index. The ""pain intensity"" component, which collects data on the use of painkillers in version 1.0 of the ODI did not support the item structure of the index in this study. The use of ODI version 2.0 might remove this problem."
CD007431,0,16293153,0,The effect of delayed-onset muscle soreness on stretch reflexes in human low back muscles.,"The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of moderate delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) on the short latency stretch reflex (SLR) and long latency stretch reflex (LLR) response i.e. electromyographic (EMG) onset latencies and EMG amplitudes in erector spinae (ES). Nine males with muscle soreness (DOMS group) were tested 24, 48 h, and 7 days post-exercise. Eight males (control group) were tested likewise. EMG was measured from ES bilaterally at the level of L3/L4. The SLR was elicited by mechanically tapping the ES at L3/L4, and the LLR was elicited by sudden loadings of the spine. Significant reductions in force during maximal voluntary contractions and range of motion, and a significant increase in muscle soreness (measured by pressure algometry) and subjective experience of soreness in the low back indicated DOMS 24, and 48 h post-exercise in the DOMS group. No changes were observed in the control group. The SLR and LLR response were unaffected by DOMS, i.e. no changes in EMG latencies and amplitudes were observed. In conclusion, despite changes in DOMS indicators, the reflex system protecting the stability of the lumbar spine is apparently capable of maintaining an appropriate triggering of SLR and LLR."
CD007431,0,7810252,0,[Predictors of treatment success after microsurgical operation of lumbar intervertebral disk displacement].,"As far as medical decision making is based on weighing up individual risks and chances of a certain patient receiving a certain treatment, some knowledge is required about signs and symptoms which are associated with a certain outcome: they are called risk factors, or predictive factors. In lumbar intervertebral disc surgery, the most frequent undesired effect of the treatment is unsuccessfulness. Reviewing the literature about risk factors for unsuccessfulness, one recognizes a lot of unconfirmed or even contradictory findings. This inconsistency can possibly be attributed to the common use of a very simplified, unidimensional definition of the target variable ""success of treatment"". That is why we performed a prospective observational trial on 109 patients in whom the success of lumbar intervertebral disc microsurgery was assessed after half a year using six different target variables. The rate of treatment success varied considerably, from 44% (when ""return to previous occupation"" served as the target variable) to 91% (with regard to ""subjective contentedness""). Further target variables were intensity of sciatica, intensity of low back pain, activities of daily living, and postoperative paresis, giving intermediate success rates. We were able to identify some risk factors (for instance, duration of sick leave and of the recent pain episode, preoperative paresis, intensity of psychosomatic complaints), each of them being relevant to some of the target variables, but none of them associated with all of the target variables. We conclude that the multidimensional rating of treatment successes seems to promote risk research in multidimensional diseases."

CD007431,0,12477697,0,Sensory function in spinal cord injury patients with and without central pain.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) frequently results in neuropathic pain. However, the pathophysiology underlying this pain is unclear. In this study, we compared clinical examination, quantitative sensory testing (QST) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in SCI patients with and without pain below spinal lesion level, with a control group of 20 subjects without injury. All patients had a traumatic SCI with a lesion above T10; 20 patients presented with spontaneous central neuropathic pain below lesion level, and 20 patients had no neuropathic pain or dysaesthesia. Patients with and without pain had a similar reduction of mechanical and thermal detection and pain thresholds, and SEPs. SCI patients with central pain more frequently had sensory hypersensitivity (brush- or cold-evoked pain, dysaesthesia or pinprick hyperalgesia) in dermatomes corresponding to lesion level than SCI patients without pain. There was no difference in intensity of pain evoked by repetitive pinprick at lesion level between patient groups. There was a significant correlation between intensity of brush-evoked dysaesthesia at lesion level and spontaneous pain below lesion level of SCI. These data suggest that lesion of the spinothalamic pathway alone cannot account for central pain in SCI patients, and that neuronal hyperexcitability at injury or higher level may be an important mechanism for pain below injury level."

In 59 cases (38%) a recurrent hernia was found, and in 8% a new hernia. In 81% of patients epidural fibrous scars were demonstrated, in a rough 50% of cases associated with recurrent/new hernia: posterior fibrosis was found in 81% of cases, while unilaterally, bilaterally, or anteriorly extended fibroses were present in 20%, in 4.7%, and in 29% of cases respectively. In 72% of the patients injected with contrast medium, various kinds of fibrosis contrast enhancement were detected. In 8% neither fibrosis nor recurrent herniation was found. In 22% of cases lateral and/or central bony canal stenosis was present, in 26% vacuum disk, in 9% intracanalar calcifications, in 39% and in 19.5% dural sac stretching and compression respectively. In 5 cases a pseudomeningocele was found, and in 3 only a postoperative diskitis. Fibrosis is an almost inevitable postoperative consequence (4 out of 5 cases); it can be demonstrated by CT with high sensitivity and good specificity. A series of diagnostic criteria, such as the post-contrast media reaction, allow fibrosis to be discriminated from recurrent hernia. However, the possible association must be kept in mind of both diseases and/or of included roots in the scar. Myelography is hardly ever able to supply further resolutive diagnostic elements, while Myelo-CT is sometimes more useful. The importance of bone changes is questionable, with the exception of evident cases of canal stenosis, also because in most cases the radiologist cannot count on a preoperative CT study. Furthermore, the correlation between CT and clinical findings (possible asymptomatic fibrosis) is often difficult, which gives way to contrasting therapeutic attitudes."

Contrast-enhanced imaging studies were performed, in all 16 patients of our series, before surgery, and at the third postoperative day and, two months after surgery. Postoperative paraspinal muscles enhancement was present in all patients. In the postoperative period, nerve root enhancement was present in 5/16 patients at the early survey and persisted in one after two months. A pseudohernia depicted as epidural intermediate signal intensity tissue, was seen in 13 patients at the third day MRI, and only in eight after two months. This pseudohernia enhanced peripherally in 8/13 patients and enhanced homogeneously in the remaining five at the first postsurgical examination; in the late MRI the peripheral enhancement was appreciable in only two patients while a homogeneous enhancement was observed in six. Clinical symptoms resolved completely in 14/16 patients on clinical evaluation at the third postoperative day, while the remaining two patients showed residual symptoms and signs of radicular compression. At the early MRI these two patients showed intradural nerve root enhancement. Two months later, one patient did not show the previously described nerve root enhancement and improved clinically, while the other had a positive Straight Leg Raising Sign with persistent intradural nerve root enhancement. In conclusion, no correlation between clinical course and contrast-enhancement of pseudohernia and extradural nerve root was appreciable, although intradural nerve root enhancement seems to represent a clinically relevant finding."

Using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) to quantify the pain experience and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) to quantify functional disability, a study was undertaken to determine the efficiency with which the MPQ and ODQ were capable of enhancing the differential diagnosis of three broad categories of low back syndromes. Three discriminative models were employed. The combined discriminant model (MPQ/ODQ) yielded the highest accuracy, 0.90, and it was the only model with acceptable predictive power. The greatest utility of the discriminant models was found to be ruling out nonspecific low back pain and ruling in radiculopathy, with and without neurological deficits. Subjective pain and disability appear to have the potential for successfully differentiating broad categories of low back pain. Further studies need to be performed to assess the discriminant power of the MPQ and ODQ for specific diagnostic entities."

Among the males, two subgroups (i.e., disc excision or spinal fusion) were evaluated. All patients reported subjective indices of pain/disability and completed quantified tests of lumbar motion, sagittal trunk strength, lifting capacity, and bicycle ergometry. In general, true lumbar motion was markedly restricted to 50%-60% and trunk strength means were below 50% of gender-specific normative values. There were similar deficits for lifting capacity. Those who had spinal fusions tended to perform poorly, with a relatively high incidence of pain/disability. There were no differences found between the male group and subgroups who were gainfully employed or had a brief period of disability prior to surgery or had low subjective pain/disability. These results indicate that a patient's subjective pain/disability were not a reliable measure of functional capacity by three months postoperatively.

The normative values from L3 to S1 were defined, as were the parameters of abnormality. In seven patients with pseudoradicular or referred leg pain, a negative neurological examination and images indicative of protrusion or paramedian disc hernia, the DSEPs were normal in six cases and slightly altered in one. In eight patients with deafferentation leg pain, clinical signs of root damage and images indicative of an intraforaminal hernia, the DSEPs showed varying degrees of alteration which could generally be correlated to the severity of the clinical picture. This method can therefore be useful in differentiating pain due to stimulation of the receptors of the osteoarticular structures or the root sheath, in which the DSEPs are normal, from pain due to direct root damage, in which the DSEPs are altered. This functional evaluation of anatomical damage provides further information which may help to achieve a better therapeutic approach."
CD007431,0,125864,0,The straight leg raising test: its relevance to possible disc pathology.,"The records of 40 patients who had suffered from low back pain, and who had a marked restriction of straight leg raising (SLR) have been studied. Thirty-four of these cases had referred pain down the lower limb. They were all treated, at least in the first place, by manipulation. The response to manipulation demonstrates that, in the absence of evidence of interference with nerve root conduction, limitation of SLR is an unreliable sign of possible disc pathology. Furthermore, the immediate response to manipulation, particularly in the known disc protrusions, strongly suggests that muscle spasm plays a major role in limiting SLR. These points are discussed."
CD007431,0,2230187,0,[Neuralgia of the pudendal nerve. Anatomo-clinical considerations and therapeutical approach].,"The anatomic study of the pudendal nerve and its relation allows an approach of the mechanisms of compression likely to engender perineal neuralgia. Two conflictual zones are isolated: the first is linked to the clamp which is produced by the insertion of the sacro-epinous ligament on the ischial spine and the sacro-tuberal ligament; the second is linked to the falciform process of the sacrotuberal which threatens the nerve by its sharp upper edge. This conflict is particularly acute in a sitting position. The relation between the trunk of the nerve, its branches and these zones of conflict may explain the clinical observations. The electrophysiological investigations (detection of neurogenic muscles of the perineal floor. Increased sacral latency, pudendal nerve terminal motor latency) confirm the diagnosis. The anesthetic blocks of the pudendal nerve on the ischial spine only have a complimentary diagnostic value. The peridural blocks may also have an interesting therapeutic action (60% of good results 3 months later). In some persistent cases, the nerve has been decompressed firstly by perineal approach, but latterly by transguteal approach."
CD007431,0,11712494,0,[Medical imaging of low back pain].,"The indication for a radiological examination of a patient with low back pain by CT or MRI scans is based on age, medical history and clinical findings. The result of morphological (and possibly structural) tests should be consistent with the clinical findings. In fact, the scans often do not provide very powerful evidence. The elderly patient frequently has permanent deformations or primary or secondary malignant bone lesions and therefore requires special tests."
CD007431,0,12538197,0,Epidural injections of indomethacin for postlaminectomy syndrome: a preliminary report.,"Since there have been side effects reported with the administration of corticosteroids epidurally, their application has been limited. Because some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have central and spinal antinociceptive actions, we have compared the effects of indomethacin (INM) given by the epidural route to methylprednisolone (MTP). This was a prospective, comparative study in an ambulatory pain care center. Two hundred six patients with recurrent low back pain (Visual Analog Scale >7) and radiculopathy after they had had 2 or more lumbar laminectomies with the diagnosis of ""postlaminectomy syndrome"" were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group I (64 patients) was given 2 epidural injections of lyophilized INM 1 mg. Group II (60 patients) received 2 injections of 2 mg of INM at the same intervals. Group III (82 patients) was treated by 2 epidural injections of MTP 80 mg. In every case, the medication was diluted in 3 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine. Reductions of pain were assessed by changes in the Visual Analog Scale; physical activities, attitude, and medication intake were graded by the Pain Progress Score recorded before each treatment and 2 wk after the last. After each injection, all patients had pain relief to Visual Analog Scale <3. Increased analgesia (P < 0.05) was noted when a double dose of INM was used (Group II) or when 80 mg of MTP was given. The total average scores of the Pain Progress Score showed significant differences at the second injection in Groups II and III only. Physical activity, emotional attitudes, and medication intake were also improved but the changes were not statistically significant. In conclusion, in this group of patients, INM produced adequate analgesia in Groups I and II, with evidence suggesting that 2 mg of INM may produce a similar degree of pain relief as 80 mg of MTP after the second injection. Other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be explored in the future for the same purpose."
CD007431,0,162546,0,A more precise diagnosis for low-back pain.,"Five common syndromes productive of low-back and leg pain are presented as the basis for clinical investigation to arrive at an early and definite diagnosis in low-back pain problems. The five are posterior facet syndromes, sacroiliac-piriformis syndrome, herniated nucleus pulposus, central spinal stenosis, and nerve entrapment in the lateral recess. All may present with a common symptom complex of low-back, buttock, trochanteric, and posterior thigh pain. Specific details from history, physical, and radiographic examination may allow separation of these entities, but proof of diagnosis requires data from response to treatment, facet and nerve injection, myelography, discography, and computerized tomography (CT) scan."
CD007431,0,162548,0,Biomechanical testing as an aid to decision making in low-back pain patients.,"Frequently, the diagnosis of disease of the low back is a difficult matter due to the multitude of factors affecting the patient's symptoms. In this report an attempt is made to use biomechanical testing to objectify certain aspects of the diagnostic process. Our philosophy is that a biomechanical assessment is one of the disciplines that should be brought to bear on the low-back pain patient. A group of biomechanical tests has been developed by adding quantitative measurement techniques to certain standard clinical maneuvers: muscle testing, range of motion testing, and straight leg raising testing. Moire fringe topography is employed for studying posture. Results of application of these techniques to 117 patients and 10 controls indicate potential utility in the method for epidemiologic and clinical research."

Most patients had been treated for a long time for lumbar discopathy with sciatic pains. Most symptoms and neurological signs were in many cases suggestive rather of lumbar disc prolapse than spinal tumour. Radiological examinations of the spine failed in a overwhelming majority of cases to provide clues for correct diagnosis, only the type of tendon jerks loss, results of Queckenstedt's test and protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid suggested spinal tumor as a cause of the disease. Contract radiological examination of the vertebral canal gave definite answer in all cases."

Any changes of motor or reflex signs or of straight leg raising were accepted as test results. They were noted in a decision matrix and the positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV, respectively) calculated. The PPV of any deterioration of the neurological status resulting from the test as a sign of abnormal myelographical findings was calculated to be approximately 85 per cent, the corresponding NPVs being approximately 50 per cent.

The Achilles tendon reflex was elicited manually with a metal hammer. There was a high correlation between the H-M interval and the Achilles tendon reflex-M interval. The usefulness of the Achilles tendon reflex was evaluated in a selected sub-group of 61 patients with proven L5 or S1 root compression. Neither the H-reflex nor the Achilles tendon reflex appeared to be of any value in detecting L5 root compression. Both the H-reflex and the Achilles tendon reflex proved to be useful for diagnosis of S1 root compression syndromes, the latter being the more sensitive method."
CD007431,0,8712430,0,Ilioinguinal iliohypogastric nerve blocks--before or after cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia?,"Preoperative local anesthetic blockade of somatosensory pathways involved with skin incision and other noxious perioperative stimuli may ""preempt"" or attenuate the postoperative pain response. Since the Pfannenstiel incision lies within the L1 dermatome, bilateral ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric nerve blocks (IINBs) should provide analgesia after low transverse cesarean section. We designed this study to compare the analgesic effect of IINBs placed before or after cesarean delivery. Forty-six patients undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Before, After, or None. Bilateral IINBs were placed with 0.5% bupivacaine, 10 mL to each side. Twenty-two patients had IINBs placed before surgery (11 failed blocks), 12 had blocks placed after surgery, and 12 had no block. Morphine, through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, provided additional postoperative analgesia. A blinded observer assessed 24-h morphine use as well as patient satisfaction and pain scores (""incisional"" and ""overall"") for 96 h. Although there were no consistent differences in pain scores among the groups, patients in the After group occasionally reported more pain than those in the Before and None groups. Patient satisfaction and morphine use did not differ among the groups. We conclude that there is no benefit to ilioinguinal nerve blocks, either before or after surgery, in patients who receive spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery. Our finding of increased pain in the After group is perplexing and requires confirmation."
CD007431,0,6617177,0,High resolution computed tomography in the diagnosis of laterally herniated lumbar discs.,"Fourteen patients presenting with lumbar radiculopathy had normal or nondiagnostic plain radiographs, myelograms and polytomes of lumbar spine. The high resolution computed axial tomography (HR CAT) demonstrated laterally herniated discs in all cases. The CAT findings correlated well with the clinical presentations and were proven at surgery to be the cause of lumbar nerve entrapment. The preoperative accurate localization of the lesion resulted in complete postoperative relief of lumbar radiculopathy and back pain in 12 cases with two cases, though relieved of the radiculopathy, had residual mild nondisabling low back pain. In cases presenting with sciatica and having nondiagnostic myelograms and other conventional radiological studies, HR CAT of spine is the only reliable radiological test that can be used to rule out laterally herniated lumbar discs."
CD007431,0,13500222,0,Bursitis; often and inexact diagnosis.,"The word bursitis is like arthritis in that it must be modified by another before it has meaning precise enough for useful medical description and communication. It is used loosely and generally to describe a number of clinical and pathological entities, among which are true primary bursitis, cystic degenerations, calcareous deposits in ligaments and tendons, and so-called ""chronic sprains"" where a calcified deposit cannot be demonstrated. It is possible to differentiate between these four entities in the light of present-day knowledge and to make a more accurate statement of diagnosis. Bursitis is often a symptom... not a primary disease and hence not a proper diagnosis. Calcareous deposits in ligaments and tendons with evident inflammatory reaction have been described in many locations. No area seems to be immune but the rotator cuff and supraspinatus tendon of the shoulder show the greatest incidence. The term inflammatory tendinitis appears to be a reasonably useful one for describing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For further accuracy it can be modified by saying that it is with calcification or without calcification as the case may be. There might be serious consequences from confusing the pain radiation of inflammatory tendinitis (with or without calcification) around the trochanteric region of the hip with true sciatic neuritis arising from a herniated intervertebral disk."

Arachnoidal diverticula are a rare complication of operations on the lumbar spine. Spinal computed tomography scanning is very useful, especially in the investigation of large diverticula and in the radiologic visualization of the arachnoidal stalk. Surgical treatment, which is required in symptomatic cases, results in remission of pain and prevents neurological complications."

CD007431,0,11792473,0,The validity of upright myelography for diagnosing lumbar disc herniation.,"Although computed tomographic (CT) myelography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for assessing lumbar disc herniations (LDH), they cannot provide images when patients are standing or walking, whose CT myelograms and MRI images show only slight disc bulging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of upright myelography. We examined by myelography in both an upright and a lying position for 50 patients with LDH at L4-5 and L5-S1 to assess the difference in disc bulge size. Lateral myelogram was used for evaluating the difference quantitatively. In 29 patients with damage at L4-5, 21 (72.4%) had increased disc bulging when upright, and 22 (75.9%) showed subligamentous LDH. In 21 patients with damage at L5-S1, fewer patients showed increased disc bulging when upright than showed unchanged disc bulging. This upright myelographic technique could show increased disc bulging in patients with mild compression at L4-5 whose sciatica increased in an upright position. Upright myelography seems to be the only method for assessing patients with LDH, especially at the L4-5 level, whose neurological symptoms develop during standing or walking."

Hernia size was expressed as an index relating it to the size of the spinal canal. The limitation of the straight leg raising test was not related to size or position of the hernia. Before treatment, straight leg raising was equally restricted in patients with sharply pointed or blunt hernias, but after 3 months straight leg raising was less limited in patients with sharply pointed hernias, whereas after 24 months straight leg raising was regularly normalized. Size index was lower for sharply pointed hernias at all three computed tomography scans. A decrease in hernia size over time, irrespective of shape, was not correlated to a concomitant improvement in straight leg raising. It must be presumed that additional factors, such as inflammatory reactions affecting the nerve roots, are of importance for the magnitude of straight leg raising."
CD007431,0,2151646,0,[Percutaneous nucleotomy: the indications and limits].,"The authors report the results of automated percutaneous diskectomy in the treatment of the herniated disk. During an 18-month period this procedure was used on 39 patients with both evident radicular pathology that had not regressed even after 4-6 weeks of medical and physical therapy as well as clear disk herniation revealed by diagnostic imaging. The level of the herniated disk was L4-L5 in 30 cases. L5-S1 in 7 cases, and L3-L4 in 2 cases. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan in 20 cases, by both CAT scan and x-ray of the spinal region in 14 cases, and by x-ray only in 5 cases. The patients were reviewed 2, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The results were classified according to Watters' criteria based on both the relief of pain and the resumption of everyday work activity. The satisfactory results (excellent and good) totaled 59% at the 6-month follow-up, with no substantial variation at the 1-year follow-up. Hemilaminectomy was performed in 12 cases with unsatisfactory results, confirming the diagnosis of disk herniation in 10 cases (extruded in 9 cases and protruded in 1 case). Diskectomy is a non-invasive, atraumatic method which is indicated for both protruded (non-sequestrated) and subumbilical hernias and allows rapid functional recovery. The rate of success can be increased with more accurate selection of patients based on imaging diagnosis (CAT scan and MRI)."
CD007431,0,1535430,0,The effect of chymopapain on low back pain.,"One hundred and fifteen patients underwent chymopapain treatment for acute disc protrusion between 1980 and 1988. Sixty-six patients who were treated with single-level injection were reviewed retrospectively with clinical follow-up from 2 to 10 years (mean, 4.6 years). All patients met modified McCulloch criteria (not all patients had leg pain greater than back pain). The presence of pre-existing chronic low back pain (LBP) was recorded in 33 patients and compared to their present low back symptomatology and functional limitations. Patients with pre-existing chronic LBP had a success rate of 52%, whereas patients meeting all the McCulloch criteria without chronic LBP had a success rate of 52%, whereas patients meeting all the McCulloch criteria without chronic LBP had a success rate of 85%. The overall effect of chemonucleolysis on LBP demonstrated no change in 18% and a mild increase in 45% of the patients (even though they had a successful outcome). The pre-existing disc space narrowing and the postoperative change of disc space height of 33 patients assessed on lateral roentgenograms showed no correlation to the clinical response. Temporal sequential computed tomography scan assessment of 56 patients following chemonucleolysis demonstrated little change of disc herniation in the first 3 months, with only a gradual and incomplete resolution in the ensuing 12 months."
CD007431,0,17337916,0,Lumbar disc herniation in adolescence.,"Lumbar disc herniation very rarely occurs in adolescence. The aim of this study was to assess the radiological, clinical and surgical features and case outcomes for adolescents with lumbar disc herniation, and to compare with adult cases. The cases of 17 adolescents (7 girls and 10 boys, age range 13-17 years) who were surgically treated for lumbar disc herniation in our clinic between 1998 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. The mean follow-up time for these cases was 60 months. The collected histories revealed that 14 (82%) of the 17 cases involved trauma or intense sports activity. Low back pain was the most common complaint (15 cases, 88%). None of the 17 patients had major symptoms during follow-up, and most were engaged in intense sports or heavy work-related activities during this period. The main features of lumbar disc herniation in adolescents are different from those seen in adults. Careful assessment is vital to avoid misdiagnosis and prevent undesirable results from inappropriate surgery. When surgery is indicated and patients are carefully selected, the results of lumbar discectomy in adolescence can be satisfactory."
CD007431,0,2818155,0,Natchev's auto-traction for lumbago-sciatica: effectiveness in lumbar disc herniation.,"In Lind's auto-traction (LAT) for lumbago-sciatica, the patient provides traction force by pulling with the arms on a specially designed table, which also allows painless mobilization of the lumbar spine and passive traction. Two studies reported that one to 15 one-hour sessions on successive days might be sufficient to relieve pain in 25% to 90% of cases with verified lumbar disc herniation. Unfortunately, the technique imposes tiring manual efforts on the therapist and requires that the patient be transported by ambulance and confined to bed for a long time. These inconveniences were removed in a new version of the treatment proposed by Natchev. The effectiveness of Natchev's auto-traction (NAT) was evaluated in an open prospective trial on 77 patient with chronic lumbago-sciatica refractory to previous therapies, and herniation of one or more lumbar discs verified by computed tomography (CT) or myelography. Thirty-six of the 77 patients (47%) responded to the treatment in three to ten (median = 5) half-hour sessions. Pain intensity dropped to 27% (median) of the pretreatment intensity. Six months after treatment, 28 of the 36 responders were stable; only four had undergone surgery. By contrast, 20 of the 41 nonresponders had been operated on. The severity of either the radiologic or the neurologic picture was not predictive of the outcome. NAT was as effective as LAT: thus, due to its greater convenience it appears to be suitable as a routine approach in lumbar disc herniation and as a screening technique before surgery."

The reflexes were tested in twenty normal subjects. There were found an intraindividual constancy of the respective reflex time with a maximum deviation of 2 ms as well as a lateral variability up to 1.3 ms. Radicular compressions resulted in an increase in reflex time by 2 to 66 ms or failure of the reflex potential to be recorded. The pathological cases were compared with clinical and neurological studies, positive myelographies using radiopaque substances, and results of surgical operations. Compared with the results of surgical operations, changes in reflex time indicated damage to the reflex arc in ninety percent of the cases."

CD007431,0,2527938,0,Chiropractic distractive decompression in treating pelvic pain and multiple system pelvic organic dysfunction.,"No data are available on the incidence of pelvic pain and organic dysfunction (PPOD) in patients suffering from low back pain. PPOD is not an uncommon finding in the low back pain patient. Women appear to be more frequently involved than men. The results of recent electrophysiologic investigations indicate that many patients with urological, bowel or anorectal dysfunction demonstrate evidence of denervation neuropathy in muscles innervated by the branches of the pudendal nerve. Six patients with low back pain meeting predetermined criteria, indicating the presence of PPOD as a result of suspected lower sacral nerve root compression (LSNRC) secondary to a mechanical disorder of the low back were treated with chiropractic distractive decompressive manipulation of the lumbar spine. Symptoms of PPOD, and indicators of LSNRC were assessed prior to the onset, and following the termination of treatment. It appears that selected indicators of LSNRC represent the most sensitive clinical signs of identifying the presence of PPOD which may respond to manipulative treatment, and may also provide the most sensitive measure of overall PPOD response. These findings, although preliminary suggest a possible etiology of PPOD in the low back pain patient with evidence of LSNRC. Further work in this area is encouraged."
CD007431,0,6460310,0,Low back pain and its treatment by spinal manipulation: measures of flexibility and asymmetry.,"Nineteen low back pain patients and eight patients not suffering from low back pain were given several tests of flexibility and asymmetry by two different examiners. Three criteria of reliability and validity were used: (1) significant agreement between independent observers, (2) significantly different scores in the groups with and without low back pain, and (3) significant improvement following a successful spinal manipulation. Tests of anterior flexion and asymmetry of foot eversion met only the first and second criteria while tests of hamstring tightness and asymmetry of voluntary straight leg raising met only the first and third criteria. Passive and voluntary straight leg raising tests were the only measures that met all three criteria. Therefore, of the objective tests investigated here, only passive or voluntary straight leg raising can be strongly recommended for use in the evaluation of spinal manipulative therapy for low back pain."
CD007431,0,11795726,0,Sensorimotor and balance function in older adults with lumbar nerve root compression.,"The purpose of this study was to determine how sensorimotor status and balance control would be affected by lumbar nerve root compression in older adults. The vibration sense, joint motion sense, and strength of the lower legs of healthy older adults and older patients with lumbar nerve root compression (n = 17 each group) were tested for sensorimotor function. The motion of the center of pressure during quiet standing, center of pressure during forward reach, and the score on Berg's functional balance test were examined for static, dynamic, and functional balance control abilities, respectively. It was found that the patient group had significantly weaker strength, greater center of pressure motion during quiet stance, slower center of pressure motion, shorter distance during forward reach test, and lower functional balance ability. No significant sensory deterioration was found. Older patients with lumbar nerve root compression had weaker leg muscle strength and poorer balance control than healthy older adults. A thorough examination of strength and balance should be included in the clinical treatment for patients with lumbar nerve root compression."
CD007431,0,2326703,0,Diurnal changes in straight leg raising.,"Diurnal changes in straight leg raising were measured in 28 patients with criteria of lower lumbar disc protrusion, having first established an acceptable intra-observer repeatability using an oil-filled precision goniometer. Eight patients showed little change between the straight leg raising after a night of recumbancy, and after 180 minutes in the upright posture. Twenty patients, however, had 10 or more degrees of improvement in straight leg raising, with a mean improvement of 16.9 degrees (SD 7.1 degrees); most of the increase occurred in the first hour of being upright. The measurement returned again to the base level after 120 minutes of further recumbancy. Five of the eight patients who showed little diurnal change had discectomy, and four had a complete annular tear. Only one of the 20 patients with more than 10 degrees of diurnal change required surgery. Diurnal change in straight leg raising is probably related to the disc's proteoglycan content, its hydration, the tension of the protrusion and the presence of intact peripheral annular fibers."

The method proved appropriate for clinical use and gave a more correct picture of the operative result than methods relying on the patients' own opinion or the radiographic assessment as the only criterion. Sixty per cent of the patients were subjectively improved, 40 per cent had returned to their previous or a corresponding occupation and 24 per cent had a good operative result, assessed by the method applied. A statistical analysis was performed in order to find the factors influencing the operative results. Age over 40 years, heavy or moderately heavy preoperative work and over 6 months' preoperative disability had a statistically significant, unfavourable effect on the results. In the case of labourers in heavy occupations, working capacity was seldom restored to a degree sufficient for return to their previous work. The operative technique proved reliable with 91 per cent successful fusions, assessed from functional radiographs. Successful fusion did not imply a good operative result, although it did so more often than non-fusion. On the basis of this study, operative fusion of the lumbosacral spine seems to be of relatively little value in the treatment of patients suffering from low back pain, and factors other than purely medical or surgical have a considerable influence on the operative results."

CD007431,0,8777910,0,MR-myelography: a comparison with conventional myelography.,"After creating a MR pulse sequence, called MR-myelography, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the value of this sequence in comparison to conventional myelography. Twenty consecutive patients were examined with conventional and MR-myelography concerning the clinical questions of chronic lumbago, spinal canal stenosis, herniated disc, spondylolisthesis and instability. Six observers assessed both examinations independently for subjective criteria such as pictorial quality, depiction of the dural sac, the nerve roots and their sheaths, artifacts, and the usefulness of single MR-myelography slices. Furthermore the number and extent of stenoses had to be judged as an objective criteria. The employed MR-myelography technique is not able to concur with the quality of conventional myelography. A high-grade stenosis is usually overestimated and low grade stenosis underestimated by MR-myelography. But it is easier to depict further relevant stenoses in a preexisting high grade stenotic spinal canal with MR-myelography. Artifacts of the introduced MR-technique do not disturb pictorial and diagnostic quality very much. In conclusion MR-myelography cannot replace conventional myelography. But together with conventional MR-sequences, MR-myelography can be helpful in the assessment of spinal canal stenosis."

Provided the examination is carried out correctly, CT has always supplied a precise anatomic diagnosis in cases where the myelogram was ambiguous. In particular, it was possible to differentiate between discogenic, cicatrized, haematoma-conditioned and osseous compression. However, two facts have to be reiterated: 1. The reference method in the cases under report was exclusively the surgical finding, representing a relatively clearly defined part of the patient material. 2. It goes without saying that the indication for a repeat operation must be based on the clinical findings as well."

A randomized multicenter trial.,"A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the results of automated percutaneous discectomy with those of chemonucleolysis in 141 patients with sciatica caused by a disk herniation; 69 underwent automated percutaneous discectomy and 72 were subjected to chemonucleolysis. The principle outcome was the overall assessment of the patient 6 months after treatment. Treatment was considered to be successful by 61% of the patients in the chemonucleolysis group compared with 44% in the automated percutaneous discectomy group. At 1-year follow-up, overall success rates were 66% in the chemonucleolysis group and 37% in the automated percutaneous group. Within 6 months of treatment, 7% of the patients in the chemonucleolysis group and 33% in the discectomy group underwent subsequent open surgery. The complication rates of both treatment groups were low, with the exception of a high rate of low-back pain in the chemonucleolysis group (42%). The results of this trial confirm previous controlled studies on chemonucleolysis and suggest that controlled studies should be carried out before automated percutaneous discectomy can be considered a useful intervention."

Patients with displacement of the articular disc or bone destruction of the joints had a decrease in pain, an enhanced mobility of the mandible, and a decrease in temporomandibular joint sounds. Patients with pain of muscular genesis as a result of bruxism suffered after 3 years from the same pain and did not show an improvement of muscle or joint sensitivity."

We now report our experience of the first 100 patients with lumbar disc prolapse treated by day-case microdiscectomy. Post-operative assessment was in the out-patient clinic and by subsequent postal questionnaire (average follow-up 37 months, range 3-64 months). Complications were few and are described. Only three patients developed a recurrent disc prolapse. Patient feedback was favourable and the majority (85%) said that, if necessary, they would be prepared to have the operation again on a day-case basis. For selected patients, lumbar microdiscectomy is a suitable procedure for day-case surgery."

At the 6-month follow-up assessment, 14 obese patients vs. 80 nonobese patients rated their surgical results good or excellent.

It was possible to combine the results from these assessments to provide a global subjective index. Repeated measurements by the same observer showed a high degree of reproducibility, but when performed by separate observers discrepancies arose in certain questions. By improving certain questions and standardizing their presentation to the patient, a considerable improvement in the correlation of results between observers was obtained. Objective assessments of spinal motion and straight leg raising and a global objective index showed a high degree of intraobserver reproducibility. This technique was applied to a study of relief of back pain by lumbar corsets when it was found that there was significantly greater relief of back pain by a corset with a lumbar support than one without a spinal support. We conclude that the emphasis in assessing the progress of the back-pain patient must be on the subjective parameters, and the technique developed offers a useful method for reliably assessing patients and following their progress."
CD007431,0,18196407,0,Measurement of hip range of flexion-extension and straight-leg raising.,"We believe there is a degree of inaccuracy in the usual methods of evaluation of range at the hip in the sagittal plane, ie, flexion-extension. We describe a simple method of measuring more accurately the range of hip flexion-extension, presuming such ranges of motion should relate to the anatomic position of the pelvis. We used this technique for the measurement of flexion and extension of the left hip in a cohort of 200 healthy individuals; we found a wide range of both flexion (80 degrees-140 degrees ) and extension (5 degrees-40 degrees ). Especially with respect to extension, we believe more conventional methods underestimate the ranges of motion. As a corollary to this study, we suggest some reappraisal of the straight-leg-raising test by which pain from nerve root tension can be distinguished from a source of pain arising locally in intervertebral joints for mechanical reasons or from the hip itself. We recommend the method described as being useful in the consulting office."

CD007431,0,7256161,0,[Value of tomodensitometry in the diagnosis of lumbar disk hernias].,The authors relate their experiences concerning tomodensitometric examination to evaluate the herniation of a disk. 45 patients and 50 herniations of a disk have been studied. 39 herniations have sustained surgical procedures. The tomodensitometric examination and the radiculosaccography have been performed among these patients in order to compare the findings. The fact that there has only been 3 failures prove the reliability of tomodensitometric examination; among these failure there is 2 post-operative recurrences and one L4 L5 herniation. The radiculosaccography fails 5 times (1 L4 L5 herniation and 4 L5 S1 herniations). There is not any common negative in the two methods. Because of its total innocuity (no injection of any kind) the tomodensitometric examination seems to be the first exploration to prescribe when an herniation of a disk is resistant to clinical treatment and when a surgery is planned.
CD007431,0,6233709,0,Physical measurements as risk indicators for low-back trouble over a one-year period.,"Of all 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-year-old inhabitants of Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, 82% (449 men and 479 women) participated in a general health survey, which included a thorough physical examination relating to the lower back. The examination was constituted of anthropometric measurements, flexibility/elasticity measurements of the back and hamstrings, as well as tests for trunk muscle strength and endurance. The reproducibility of the tests was found to be satisfactory. Twelve months after the physical examination 99% of the participants completed a questionnaire sent by mail concerning low back trouble (LBT) in the intervening period. The prognostic value of the physical measurements was evaluated for first-time experience and for recurrence or persistence of LBT by analyses of the separate measurements and discriminant analyses. The main findings were that good isometric endurance of the back muscles may prevent first-time occurrence of LBT in men and that men with hypermobile backs are more liable to contract LBT. Recurrence or persistence of LBT was correlated primarily to the interval since last LBT-episode: the more LBT, the shorter the intervals had been. Weak trunk muscles and reduced flexibility/elasticity of the back and hamstrings were found as residual signs, in particular, among those with recurrence or persistence of LBT in the follow-up year."
CD007431,0,9216488,0,Reflexes evoked in human erector spinae muscles by tapping during voluntary activity.,"We studied the stretch reflexes, an early R1 and a late R2, by tapping the voluntarily contracted erector spinae muscles and recording from the same spinal level with the subject in the prone position. The onset latencies increased progressively towards the caudal level from 8.8 +/- 0.7 ms at T5-6 to 15.9 +/- 1.1 ms at L4-5 for R1, and from 33.3 +/- 2.7 ms at T5-6 to 49.1 +/- 2.8 ms at L4-5 for R2. The latency changed significantly (P < 0.05) between two adjacent segments from T5-6/T6-7 through L1-2/L2-3 for R1 and T5-6/T6-7 through L3-4/L4-5 for R2. When recorded remote from the stimulus site, R1, considered segmental in origin, showed, as expected, only a small latency change consistent with the time required for the mechanical event to propagate to the recording site. In contrast R2 was shorter in latency with more rostral stimulation irrespective of the distance to the recording sites. This finding implies a centripetal propagation of the afferent impulse along the central pathway, which shortens with more rostral site of stimulation. Of the two components, the more reproducible R1 has a potential diagnostic value for segmental evaluation of thoracic nerve root compression and truncal neuropathies."
CD007431,0,2463743,0,Automated percutaneous nucleotomy--initial experience in twenty-five cases of contained lumbar disc herniation.,"The posterolateral percutaneous approach using the automated nucleotome system has been used to treat twenty-five patients presenting with lumbar radiculopathy refractory to conservative care. The procedures were performed on an outpatient basis and under local anaesthesia and sedation. The patients were either worked up with the MRI, (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or intra-thecal enhanced CT scan and/or lumbar myelography. All the patients were shown to have a contained central or lateral disc herniation that correlated well with the clinical findings. The overall results within a short-term follow-up period (mean of six months) were comparable to those obtained with standard lumbar discectomy. A low postoperative morbidity was associated with this procedure and no significant intraoperative complications have occurred. The indications as well as the pitfalls and potential complications of this surgical technique are emphasized in this report. This preliminary study suggests that in carefully selected patients and in experienced hands this procedure offers a viable alternative to conventional discectomy."

We have operated on 16 patients with juxta facet cysts during the last 3 years. One cyst was located in the thoracic spine, causing a transverse syndrome; 15 cysts were located in the lumbar spine, causing nerve root compression. Diagnosis was established preoperatively by MR in 10 and CT in 3 cases, respectively. The definite classification of the cystic processes was made by histopathologic examination. Surgical treatment consisted of resection of the cyst. Postoperatively, all but 2 patients were free of complaints and no recurrence was observed in the mean follow-up period of 15.5 months. Juxta facet cysts are an uncommon finding, but must be considered in the differential diagnosis of epidural compressive syndromes of the spine."

Part 2: position changes in pressure on the cauda equina in central lumbar spinal stenosis.,"To define the site, degree, and dynamics of mechanical compression of the spinal nerve roots, pressure was measured in 42 patients with clinical symptoms and myelographic findings indicating central lumbar spinal stenosis. Pathological pressure on the cauda equina was found in 67% of the patients. The pressure in the region of the spinal block was high during standing and walking, and in several patients exceeded mean arterial blood pressure. The block pressure was the main mechanical factor in the central part of the spinal canal causing pain and paresis. Elevated fluid pressure caudal to the block was an additional but usually subordinate factor. In 33% of the patients, normal pressure on the cauda equina was found, and lateral compression of multiple nerve roots seemed to be the only mechanical symptom-causing factor. Clinically, these patients could not be distinguished from patients with central compression. After laminectomy with decompression of the cauda equina, the field should be inspected for lateral narrowing which, if present, should be treated."

Degenerative disk disease or pain was the reason for technical failures. Four other procedures were discontinued because of pain and moderate hemorrhage. Except for one case of diskitis, no serious complications occurred. Of the patients in a prospective study, 63 had a follow-up period of 4 months or more. The overall clinical success rate was 62%, and was not significantly influenced by patient sex or age, duration of symptoms, level treated, disk degeneration or amount of nucleus material removed.

CD007431,0,16896838,0,Modic changes and their associations with clinical findings.,"It is believed that disc degeneration (DD) is, in general, only mildly associated with low back pain (LBP). MRI-identified Modic changes (MC), probably a late stage of DD, are relatively strongly associated with LBP but it is not known if people with MC also have a specific clinical profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the clinical findings differ in people with Modic changes (MC) as compared to those with only degenerative disc findings or none at all. In a population-based sample of 412 40-year-old Danes, information was collected independently with MRI, questionnaires and clinical examination. Three subgroups of people were created: those with both DD and MC, those with only DD, and those with neither DD nor MC. The clinical pattern was investigated for each subgroup in order to test the assumption that the clinical picture differs in the three groups. It was expected that people with both DD and MC would have a more pronounced clinical profile than those with only DD who, in turn, would differ from those with neither of these two MRI findings. Our findings were generally in concordance with our expectations. MC constitutes the crucial element in the degenerative process around the disc in relation to LBP, history, and clinical findings. People with DD and no MC only vaguely differ from those without. People with LBP and MC may deserve to be diagnosed as having specific LBP."

Eighteen hundred and sixty-one laminectomy procedures are reviewed, the majority of these for simple lumbar disc protrusion and spinal canal stenosis but also 204 cases where patients required a surgical procedure for failed back surgery syndrome. Surgical technique and technology will fail when an inappropriate patient is selected for surgical intervention; failure also occurs particularly in lumbar disc protrusion if lateral recess stenosis is undiagnosed and untreated at the time of surgery. The patient's motivation status also has a significant effect on surgical outcome and the optimum patient to submit to surgery for failed back surgery syndrome has sciatica, more severe than backache, a recurrent or residual disc protrusion associated with the stenosis and excellent motivation which is not affected by workers' compensation or other insurance claims or benefit."

Fifty-one consecutive patients (m 6, f 45; average age 74.8 years) with diagnosed osteoporotic vertebral fractures between T8 and L2 were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were fractures above T8 and below L2, spondylolisthesis, disc herniations, tumors, infections, and instability. Pain location was assessed by pain drawing, subdivided into thoracic, lumbar, and thoracic plus lumbar pain areas, and pain intensity using a 101 numeric rating scale. Furthermore, the onset of back pain and the lack or the indication of a trigger event at the onset of pain were documented. Only four of 20 patients with thoracic fractures reported thoracic pain, while the other 16 (80%) reported only lumbar pain. The location of the fracture and the patient's pain report were not related (Cohens Kappa=0.046; P=0.438). Patients with thoracic or lumbar osteoporotic fractures report pain mainly in the lumbosacrogluteal area. Therefore, the complaint of low back pain (LBP) in persons at risk for osteoporotic fractures may require both thoracic and lumbar X-rays. LBP patients with a suspect history of an osteoporotic vertebral fracture should also be given an X-ray of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Patients with a thoracic vertebral fracture had more severe pain than patients with a lumbar vertebral fracture.

CD007431,0,163892,0,Study of sensitivity to curare in certain neurological disorders using a regional technique.,"A regional technique for the study of curare sensitivity has been applied to patients with Duchenne type muscular dystrophy, myotonic disorders, certain lower motor neurone disorders, to patients with weakness in the arm after hemiplegia, to patients with hyper-reflexia and hypertonia without weakness, and to Parkinsonism. In the dystrophy patients, sensitivity to curare differs from normal controls in that the neuromuscular block persists. The possibilities that this latent defect of neuromuscular transmission is the result of acetylcholine deficiency due to a prejunctional defect or the result of alterations in the property of the postjunctional membrane are discussed. In the myotonic and lower motor neurone disorders, curare sensitivity was similar to that of normal controls. After hemiplegia, the affected side shows resistance to curare when compared with the unaffected side. In states of hyper-reflexia and hypertonia, however, the sensitivity to curare is greater than in normal controls. In Parkinsonism, sensitivity is similar to that of the controls. The results in upper motor neurone lesions are discussed in relation to the dependence of neuromuscular transmission upon the motor neurone, which, in turn, is dependent upon descending impulses."

Sixty-nine patients (34 men and 35 women) with the diagnosis of lumbar slipped disc who underwent surgery were followed up. The main inclusion criterion was the surgical finding of hernia. The aim of the study was to obtain a clearer insight into the values of the myelography and CT scan by observing a sufficiently large number of patients with surgically verified hernia of lumbar disc. The characteristics of neurological and EMG findings were surveyed, as well. Thirty-one patients were at the age of 40-49 years and 21 were at 30-39 years of age. Only 5 hernias were at the level L3L4, 28 at the level L4L5, and 46 at the level L5S1. Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of the observed parameters were estimated for 41 leftwards and 30 rightwards located hernias. Myelographic finding, regardless of the observed level of slipped disc, showed excellent sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of diagnosis. CT finding was slightly less sensitive at the level L4L5, it was 0.93, and specific at the level L5S1, amounting to 0.90. Its accuracy was not substantially lower than that of myelography. The pathological EMG was 0.88 sensitive, 0.83 specific and 0.84 accurate. The accuracy was excellent at the level L3L4, it was 0.96, but only very good at the level L5S1, amounting to 0.76. A t-test of linked pairs was used to compare surgical reports and diagnostic findings. There was a great similarity between a CT finding and surgical one in all three levels (t-values 1.00, 0.21 and 0.36). Myeolography was more congruent with the surgical finding in the middle level (t-values 1.65, 0.93 and 1.52). An EMG finding was significantly different from that found by surgery (t-values 1.71, 1.76 and 2.71). The existence of Lasègue's sign for the diagnosis of hernia was 0.93 sensitive, 0.07 specific (remarkably low) and 0.36 accurate. It was particularly inaccurate at the level L3L4, moderately accurate at the level L4L5, and rather accurate at the lowest level L5S1. The weakened Achilles tendon reflex was less sensitive than Lasègue's sign, amounting to 0.80. Its specificity was 0.19 and accuracy 0.40. The highest accuracy was in hernias of the lower two levels L4L5 and L5S1. The existence of weakened sense was 0.91 sensitive, specificity was remarkably low, amounting to 0.08, and accuracy was 0.36. It was most inaccurate at the level L3L4 and slightly better at the levels L4L5 and L5S1. Disturbance of leg movements showed sensitivity of only 0.60, but specificity was 0.39 and accuracy 0.46. It was most precise at the level L4L5. Neurological symptoms and signs were insufficiently sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of lumbar disc hernia. On the basis of these parameters, the level of hernia could not be exactly determined."
CD007431,0,2549451,0,The role of thermography in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"We studied 27 normal subjects and 30 patients with low back pain to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thermography in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Thermographic abnormality was defined as the presence of either interside temperature difference exceeding 3 standard deviations from the normal mean, or an abnormal heat pattern overlying the lumbosacral spine. In patients with clinically unequivocal radiculopathy, thermography and electrophysiologic study were similar in diagnostic sensitivity, and the 2 methods agreed on the presence or absence of abnormality in 71% of cases. However, the thermographic findings had limited localizing value. Relative limb warming was often seen in patients with acute denervation on EMG, and limb cooling in those with more chronic lesions, but the side of the root lesion could not be identified confidently by thermography alone. Moreover, thermographic abnormalities appeared not to follow a dermatomal distribution and failed to identify the clinical or electrophysiologic level of radiculopathy in most cases. Thus, the thermographic findings are nonspecific, of little diagnostic value, and of uncertain prognostic relevance."

Enhanced CT images demonstrated postoperative herniated discs more accurately than clinical criteria, myelography, or plain or postmetrizamide CT.

Stimulation sites were over the dorsum of the foot at the distal fifth metatarsal for the S1 dermatome and at the web space of the first and second toe for the L5 dermatome. Recordings were made at PZ reference to FZ. Spinal cord or cauda responses could not be detected. Both EMG and DSEP were contrasted to myelography or lumbar computerized tomography results on 31 patients. Side-to-side amplitude differences proved too variable to be of use. Sixty-five percent of abnormal DSEP results were on the basis of side-to-side latency criterion, and 35% were on the basis of an absent unilateral response. When compared to EMG and anatomic studies DSEP showed less accuracy and sensitivity. The specificity of the two tests was similar. Using both positive EMG and anatomic studies to define radiculopathy, there were 27% false negative tests and 9% false positive tests. An 86% root level correlation was found between EMG and DSEP. Dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential studies add little to the diagnosis of radiculopathy."

CD007431,0,6269444,0,Stress reactions involving the pars interarticularis in young athletes.,"A stress reaction involving the pars interarticularis of the lumbar spine was confirmed in seven young athletes with a positive technetium pyrophosphate bone scan. No pars defects were detectable on their lumbosacral roentgenograms, which included oblique views. The return to normal levels of radioactive uptake on repeat bone scans correlated closely with their clinical course. If the bony reaction is recognized early, it may heal at a subroentgenographic level and prevent the development of lumbar spondylolysis. These early lesions usually show unilateral increased uptake at one lumbar level on the bone scan and, initially, the athlete localizes the pain to the corresponding unilateral lumbar paraspinous area. The ""one-legged hyperextension test"" is positive on the ipsilateral side and aggravates the pain. Treatment consists of avoiding the aggravating activities and resting. The average time for return to pain-free competition was 7.3 months. These developing defects may be the source of considerable prolonged disability in the young athlete, particularly if undiagnosed and untreated."
CD007431,0,1750007,0,A quantitative evaluation of sensory dysfunction in lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"A quantitative evaluation of sensory disturbance of the foot was attempted in 94 cases of lumbosacral radiculopathy using the biothesiometer, the Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer, light touch, tuning fork, and dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials. Dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials was the most sensitive of these tests, and reflected the duration of the lumbosacral radiculopathy better than the biothesiometer and the Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer. The biothesiometer and Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer reflected the clinical severity of sensory dysfunctions, the extent of numbness, and the immediate change in sensory function better than the dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials. It is important to understand the characteristics of each test and to choose informative tests for clinical use. Grades of sensory disturbance in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy were classified into three categories in combination with the findings of dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials and the values recorded with the biothesiometer and Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer."

Twenty-four female and 53 male postmen with an occupational seniority of more than 2 years took part in the investigation. The cumulative lifetime prevalence, the one-year and the point prevalence of LBT were 67%, 62%, and 4% in females and 55%, 52%, and 0% in males. The rates are higher than in a representative Danish population 40 years old. Anthropometrical measurements and isometric strength (MVC) in trunk flexors and extensors were recorded. The flexibility of the spine, hip and knee joints, the fingertip-floor distance, and the restricted extension of the knee were evaluated. The isometric endurance in the trunk extensors was measured by two methods: 1) prone with the unsupported trunk in a horizontal position and the legs and hips fixated to a couch; and 2) standing, at 60% MVC. The participants were divided into three groups according to the extent of previous LBT, Group I: LBT to a degree that made work impossible, Group II: LBT experienced but not to such a degree that work was hindered, and Group III: LBT never experienced. The main findings were that the isometric endurance time of the trunk extensors was shorter in group I than in II and III, while the trunk muscle strength, anthropometrical measures and joint flexibility were independent of the persons' earlier low-back episodes. Differences in the distribution of ST and FT muscle fibres are suggested as an explanation of the endurance difference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,17121249,0,[Sacral staged reflexes to localize the pudendal compression: an anatomical validation of the concept].,"Pudendal neuropathy is common. The diagnosis is clinical and the confirmation is electrophysiological. Distal pudendal nerve latencies have been used but they are unspecific and do not allow to localize the site of compression. A preliminary electrophysiological study has suggested separate innervations of the anterior and the posterior anal sphincter quadrants, so diverging from what main anatomy textbooks teach. By detailed dissections of pudendal nerve region we can confirm a dichotomy in the innervation of the two quadrants. Therefore, it seems feasible, by using the differences of staged sacral reflexes, to better localize the compressive neuropathy, with a stimulation of the clitoris and by recording latencies of different muscles."

The efficacy and safety of etodolac were evaluated based on the changes of symptoms and signs of the patients, including the following parameters: low back pain, leg pain and tingling, gait, the straight-leg-raising test, sensory disturbance, motor disturbance, restriction of activities of daily living (ADL), urinary bladder function, and patients' impressions at each hospital on the initial day, and at one week and two weeks after the start of administration of etodolac, in a total of 88 patients. The overall improvement was noted as a 'marked' in 5% and 13%, 'moderate' or better in 31% and 54%, 'slight' or better in 82% and 84%, 'no change' in 12% and 9%, and 'aggravated' in 6% and 7%, at one and two weeks after administration, respectively. The only adverse drug reaction reported was stomach pain in one of the 81 patients. It can be concluded that etodolac is an effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation."

CD007431,0,7487754,0,MRI of intraspinal nerve sheath tumours presenting with sciatica.,"The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of 14 intraspinal nerve sheath tumours (NST) presenting with sciatica were reviewed. The group comprised seven schwannomas, six neurofibromas and one perineuroma. The tumours were either iso- or hypointense with respect to spinal cord on T1-weighted (T1W) images; almost all tumours were hyperintense compared with spinal cord on T2-weighted (T2W) images. The tumours were all detectable on unenhanced T1W images. Nine NST were scanned following Gadolinium-Diethylenetriamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) injection and all showed intense enhancement. This aids differentiation from sequestrated disc fragments. Tumours were more likely to show homogeneous enhancement unless they were recurrent tumours. Rim enhancement occurs more commonly in schwannomas and this can be used to differentiate these from neurofibromas. However, on unenhanced images, schwannomas cannot be distinguished from neurofibromas. Four tumours occurred at T11-T12. There was poor correlation of the site of the lesion with the clinical findings. MRI studies in patients with sciatica should include the lower thoracic region especially if no protruded disc was found in the lumbar region."

The 105 patients were divided into three groups: a treatment group, an alternative group which underwent 1/5 of the treatment group's exercise program per session, and an alternative group in which the treatment consisted of thermotherapy, massage and mild exercise. Regardless of whether the outcome of treatment is assessed qualitatively or quantitatively, a statistically significant, favourable difference was found between the results for the treatment group and those for the alternative groups. The therapy was found to be without risk, but patients with clinical signs of current lumbar nerve root compression or radiological signs of spondylolysis or halisteresis of the column were excluded from the study. The authors recommend the introduction of this form of treatment as a general offer in the primary and secondary health sector. Back exercises can advantageously be conducted in a group; thus, the resources required for this treatment do not differ significantly from those required for many of the other forms of treatment generally employed, which often require individual attention."

Thirty-nine patients (11 male, 28 female; mean age=43.49 yrs) were requested to perform two movements twice, i.e. bending forward and straight leg raising. During each of the four trials, baseline pain, expected pain and experienced pain were recorded. Analyses revealed that patients initially overpredicted pain, but after exposure the overprediction was readily corrected. This exposure effect did not generalize towards another dissimilar movement. The above pattern of results was only characteristic for patients reporting a high frequency of catastrophic thinking about pain. Low pain catastrophizers did not overpredict pain. The results are discussed in terms of the view that exposure may be better conceived of as the learning of exceptions to a general rule."
CD007431,0,6716336,0,[The value of tomodensitometric studies in the diagnosis of the herniated lumbar disk. Apropos of 155 operated disks].,"Correlation of radiological and pathological findings in 155 cases of operated herniated discs emphasizes the value of a CT scan in the diagnosis of these lesions. Imaging by the scanner is a safe and relatively low-cost procedure and its reliability is identical to that of other conventional exploratory methods. It should, therefore, become the initial examination conducted during investigation of sciatica thought to be of discal origin. Reliability of results has varied between 85 and 90 p. 100, according to the author, for this essentially simple and atraumatic method. Confirmation of the presence of a hernia requires the observance of clear signs: material of discal density amputating the spinal canal and spreading over the dural sheath. False negatives or positives usually occur in borderline cases or in previously operated patients. Differences in clinical and computed tomography findings, with undoubted absence of signs on the scan image, require further investigation by radiculography."
CD007431,0,10905440,0,"Relationships between epidural fibrosis, pain, disability, and psychological factors after lumbar disc surgery.","Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is an important complication of lumbar disc surgery. Epidural fibrosis is one of the major causes of FBSS. However, most patients with epidural fibrosis do not develop symptomatic complaints from scarring. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the relationships among the severity of epidural fibrosis, psychological factors, back pain and disability after lumbar disc surgery. Twenty-nine surgically managed patients (13 women, 16 men) were included in this study. In all patients, the presence and severity of epidural fibrosis was determined with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A pain visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) were completed before and after surgery. Subjects were grouped by their type of herniation (protrusion, free fragment), MRI findings and results of the mini form of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and the groups were compared for their VAS and ODQ scores. Our results disclosed that neither the postoperative VAS scores nor the postoperative ODQ scores differed significantly among the epidural fibrosis severity groups. Moreover, postoperative VAS scores were positively correlated with the scores of the mini MMPI. These findings indicate that epidural fibrosis may be considered as a radiological entity independent of patients' complaints. Furthermore, the mini MMPI should be included in the assessment and planning of the reoperations in FBSS patients, because of the importance of psychological factors in postoperative pain and disability."

Selective nerve root block is a useful test to indicate whether the pain is neural in origin and/or whether nerve root is pain producing in these patients with equivocal clinical and imaging studies. Over 8 years, the author performed selective nerve root blocks in 215 patients. Of this group, 78 patients underwent surgery. Following surgery, 71 patients were available for a minimum 12-month follow-up. The preoperative diagnoses included previously unoperated-upon lumbar disc herniation, previously unoperated-upon spinal canal stenosis, and prior lumbar surgery. The average follow-up was 34 months (range, 12-96 months). Overall, there were 38 good (53%), 16 fair (23%), and 17 poor (24%) surgical results. The results for those patients who had had prior surgery were disappointing (52% poor). These data reaffirm that surgical intervention should only be recommended for previously operated-upon patients with unequivocal findings."

However, as these procedures become more common, the long-term consequences are becoming more evident. One such consequence is degeneration of an adjacent segment, which can occur in up to 17% of patients undergoing cervical fusion.

CD007431,0,10523425,0,Voluntary and reflex control of human back muscles during induced pain.,"1. Back pain is known to change motor patterns of the trunk. The purpose of this study was to examine the motor output of the erector spinae (ES) muscles during pain in the lumbar region. First, their voluntary activation was assessed during flexion and re-extension of the trunk. Second, effects of cutaneous and muscle pain on the ES stretch reflex were measured, since increased stretch reflex gain has been suggested to underlie increased muscle tone in painful muscles. 2. The trunk movement and electromyographical (EMG) signals from the right and left ES during pain were compared with values before pain. Controlled muscle pain was induced by infusion of 5 % saline into the right lumbar ES. Cutaneous pain was elicited by mechanical or electrical stimulation of the dorsal lumbar skin. The stretch reflex was evoked by rapidly indenting the right lumbar ES with a servo-motor prodder. 3. The results from the voluntary task show that muscle pain decreased the modulation depth of ES EMG activity. This pattern was associated with a decreased range and velocity of motion of the painful body segment, which would normally serve to avoid further injury. Interestingly, when subjects overcame this guarding tendency and made exactly the same movements during pain as before pain, the EMG modulation depth was still reduced. The results seem to reconcile the controversy of previous studies, in which both hyper- and hypoactivity of back muscles in pain have been reported. 4. In the tapped muscle, the EMG response consisted of two peaks (latency 19.3 +/- 2.1 and 44.6 +/- 2.5 ms, respectively) followed by a trough. On the contralateral side the first response was a trough (26.2 +/- 3.2 ms) while the second (46.4 +/- 4.3 ms) was a peak, similar to the second peak on the tapped side. Cutaneous pain had no effect on the short-latency response but significantly increased the second response on the tapped side. Surprisingly, deep muscle pain had no effect on the stretch reflex. A short-latency reciprocal inhibition exists between the right and left human ES. 5. It is concluded that deep back pain does not influence the stretch reflexes in the back muscles but modulates the voluntary activation of these muscles."

Even straight leg raising and diminished reflex signs can be obliterated by precise local anesthetic injection into the facet joint. The use of radiographically localized injection of steroids and local anesthetic into the facet joint has been presented as a diagnostic-therapeutic procedure. Clinical experience with a group of 100 consecutive patients suggests that this treatment alone can achieve long-term relief in one-fifth of the patients with lumbago and sciatica and partial relief in another one-third of these patients. This information suggests that the structures related to the facet joint can be a persistent contributor to the chronic pain complaints of individuals with low back and leg pain."

CD007431,0,130219,0,Clinical features of lumbar spinal stenosis.,"In contrast with patients with herniations of the nucleus pulposus, those with spinal stenosis experience onset of symptoms at a slightly older age; more males are affected than females. The symptoms tend to be somewhat more chronic, and therefore, the patients will have symptoms of back pain for a longer period of time before developing radiating root pains and will not come to surgical treatment until relatively late. Bilateral root symptomatology is more common although examination shows multiple nerve root involvement only slightly more frequently as well as involvement of the L1 to L4 nerve roots. The spinal movements tend to be somewhat better and straight leg raising tests are usually symmetrical and somewhat less restricted in those patients than in the acute disk syndrome. Postfusion and post-chemonucleolysis spinal stenosis will, of course, have the symptomatology of the initial problem, but their recurrent problems would tend to parallel those of spinal stenosis rather than disk herniation."

CD007431,0,6466060,0,Myelographic versus clinical diagnostics in lumbar disc disease.,"The series consisted of 200 patients on whom lumbar myelography was performed for sciatica. After myelography, a disc operation was carried out on 95 patients. The episode of sciatica was the first for 90 patients. Objective neurologic signs were present in 185 patients, while 15 had only subjective symptoms. Definite or possible disc herniation was revealed by myelography in 66%. Most positive findings were located at the L4-L5 interspace. The clinical diagnostic accuracy rate was assessed from the patients' histories. As confirmed by operation, the accuracy of the clinical diagnostics was 52%, and the accuracy rate of myelography was 90%. The rate of false positive findings in myelography was 4%, that of false negative findings 6%. When the clinical or myelographic diagnosis was definitive, a disc herniation or protrusion was always found at operation. Almost one fourth of the clinically diagnosed definite herniations were not treated surgically because myelography proved negative. One fifth of those patients in whom myelography revealed an unequivocal disc herniation were not operated on because these patients had clinically improved before being admitted to myelography. The results of this study justify the following conclusions: the clinical level diagnostics of a disc herniation is rather unreliable, and myelography is therefore always indicated before operation; myelography should only be performed in those cases in which there is a clear clinical indication for surgery; myelography ought to be performed within 1 week; an unequivocal positive finding in myelography predicts a good operative result."

The perspective presented is that their symptom presentation is not as straightforward as the classic descriptions of brachialgia would have us believe. This clinical commentary presents a series of observations and reasoning models that are relevant to patient symptom presentations believed to be of cervical nerve root origin. Clinicians are urged to consider low cervical nerve root assessment in the light of our current understanding of neural sensitivity, pain science, nerve root biomechanics and the presence and effect of degenerative changes. This particularly relates to thoughts about cervical movements and postures being able to bring forces to bear on nerve roots via compressive as well as elongation forces."

Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed at 1 week, 5 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery for 28 patients of 34 consecutive patients who underwent single-level disc resection. Enhancement/thickening of the affected root was found to be 100%/89% at 1 week, 50%/57% at 3 months, and 32%/37% at 6 months after surgery. Patients with root enhancement and thickening at 3 and 6 months after surgery had less clinical improvement than patients without it. There was consistent correlation between postoperative clinical developments and nerve root enhancement/thickening in enhanced MR imaging. To use enhanced MR imaging as an evaluation tool after disc surgery might increase the diagnostic accuracy and reduce failed back surgery syndrome."

The surface field strengths of the magnets were 200 and 50G. Phase I included four random periods of two-week duration: two periods with 200G, one period with 50G, and one period of ""no treatment."" The magnets were positioned either vertically or horizontally in standard lumbosacral elastic corsets. Phase II consisted of two five-week periods with the most effective magnet from Phase I and its corresponding 50 or 200G device. The primary outcome was average daily leg pain score (0-10 scale) in each period of Phase II. Thirty-eight of 40 randomized patients completed Phase I, and 28 of 31 Phase II participants completed the study. In Phase I, pain scores did not differ significantly between 200 and 50G magnets. Phase II average leg pain scores tended to be lower with 200 vs. 50G magnets (3.2+/-2.1 for 200G vs. 3.9+/-2.2 for 50G magnets [P=0.08]) after excluding one unblinded patient. The relative treatment effect of the 200G magnets appeared to increase throughout the five-week period. Although these data cannot rule out a chance effect, the positive trends suggest that larger, longer-duration, sham-controlled trials with 200G magnets be considered in patients with chronic lumbar radicular pain."

Fitness and strength is postulated to protect an individual from disc rupture. The objective of our study was to determine the pain levels and differences of functional and economic situations of patients who had undergone one or more than one operation due to lumbar disc herniation and to put forward the effect of risk factors that may be potential, especially from the aspect of undergoing reoperation. Patients who had undergone one (n=46) or more than one operation (n=34) due to lumbar disc herniation were included in the study. It was a prospective study with evaluation on the day the patients were discharged and at second and sixth months after lumbar disc operation. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used in determining the functional disability associated with back pain; the Prolo Functional Economic Rating Scale (Prolo scale) was used in determining the effect of back pain on functional and economic situations. In the ODI measurements made in the postoperative second and sixth months, significant differences appeared in favor of patients who had undergone one operation (p<0.05). According to the Prolo scale, it was found that the economic situation was better in the sixth month and the functional situation was better in the second and sixth months in patients having undergone one operation (p<0.05). The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the lack of regular physical exercise was a significant predictor for reoperation (OR, 4.595; CI, 1.38-15.28), whereas gender, age, BMI, occupation, or smoking did not indicate so much significance as regular exercise."

The aim of the present study was to determine whether generalized deep-tissue hyperalgesia could be demonstrated in a group of patients with chronic low-back pain with intervertebral disc herniation. Twelve patients with MRI confirmed lumbar intervertebral disc herniation and 12 age and sex matched controls were included. Subjects were exposed to quantitative nociceptive stimuli to the infraspinatus and anterior tibialis muscles. Mechanical pressure (thresholds and supra-threshold) and injection of hypertonic saline (pain intensity, duration, distribution) were used. Pain intensity to experimental stimuli was assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients demonstrated significantly higher pain intensity (VAS), duration, and larger areas of pain referral following saline injection in both infraspinatus and tibialis anterior. The patients rated significantly higher pain intensity to supra-threshold mechanical pressure stimulation in both muscles. In patients, the pressure pain-threshold was lower in the anterior tibialis muscle compared to controls. In conclusion, generalized deep-tissue hyperalgesia was demonstrated in chronic low-back pain patients with radiating pain and MRI confirmed intervertebral disc herniation, suggesting that this central sensitization should also be addressed in the pain management regimes."

CD007431,0,3571310,1,Significance of the straight-leg-raising test in the diagnosis and clinical evaluation of lower lumbar intervertebral-disc protrusion.,"The cases of 113 patients who had protrusion of a lumbar intervertebral disc were analyzed to determine the relationship between the findings at operation and the location of the pain that resulted from the straight-leg-raising test. The study showed a close relationship between the location of the pain and the position of the protrusion of the disc. The degree of limitation of straight-leg raising was also found to have a direct relationship to the size and position of the protrusion and to its relationship to the spinal nerve. The protrusions were classified into three types according to position in relation to the dura mater and to the pattern of pain that was induced by passive straight-leg raising. On straight-leg raising, central protrusions tended to cause pain in the back, lateral protrusions caused pain in the lower extremity, and intermediate protrusions caused both. On this basis, the distribution of pain on straight-leg raising allowed an accurate prediction of the location of the lesion in 100 (88.5 per cent) of the 113 patients."

CD007431,0,11485360,0,Relationship between the cervical component of the slump test and change in hamstring muscle tension.,"SUMMARY. The slump test has been used routinely to differentiate low back pain due to involvement of neural structures from low back pain attributable to other factors. It is also said to differentiate between posterior thigh pain due to neural involvement from that due to hamstring injury. If changes in cervical position affect the hamstring muscles, differential diagnosis is confounded. Posterior thigh pain caused by the cervical component of the slump could then be caused either by increased tension on neural structures or increased tension in the hamstrings themselves. The aim of this study was to determine whether changing the cervical position during slump altered posterior thigh pain and/or the tension in the hamstring muscle. Asymptomatic subjects aged between 18 and 30 years were tested. A special fixation device was engineered to fix the trunk, pelvis and lower limb. Pain levels in cervical flexion and extension were assessed by visual analogue scale. Fixation was successful in that there were no significant differences in position of the pelvis or knee during changes in cervical position. Averaged over the group, there was a 40% decrease (P < 0.05) in posterior thigh pain with cervical extension. There were no significant differences in hamstring electromyographic readings during the cervical movements. This indicated that: (1) cervical movement did not change hamstring muscle tension, and (2) the change in experimentally induced pain during cervical flexion was not due to changes in the hamstring muscle. This conclusion supports the view that posterior thigh pain caused by the slump test and relieved by cervical extension arises from neural structures rather than the hamstring muscle.

CD007431,0,7941067,0,[Anterior lumbar intercorporal spondylodesis. Radiological and functional therapeutic results].,"The purpose of this investigation was to identify risk factors in relation to non-union following lumbar intercorporal spondylodesis and to correlate this result with the functional outcome as assessed by the Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DPQ). This comprises questions concerning daily activities, work-leisure activities, anxiety-depression and social interest, measured on visual analog scales. During the period 1979-87 a total of 132 patients were operated with spondylodesis, diagnosed as suffering from spondylolisthesis or disc degeneration. Minimal follow-up was one year. Radiological graft incorporation was complete in 52% of the cases, partial in 24% and lacking in 24%. The rate of functional outcome follow-up was 72%. Seventy percent claimed an improvement in three out of four categories. Thirty percent claimed no improvement or worsened condition. The DPQ showed signs of poor prognosis for age groups above 45 (p < 0.04) and those with former spine surgery (p < 0.02). The questionnaire showed significantly better results for the group with perfect or doubtful union compared to the group with non-union (p < 0.006). In conclusion this investigation demonstrates a success rate of 70% for anterior lumbar interbody fusion. There is a tendency to poorer prognosis for patients with previous spine surgery and age above 45 years. The Dallas Pain Questionnaire correlates significantly to X-ray analysis and seems to be a useful tool for the description of individual biopsychosocial changes following spine surgery."
CD007431,0,956228,0,Tenderness at motor points. A diagnostic and prognostic aid for low-back injury.,"In patients with low-back injury the motor points of some muscles may be tender. Of fifty patients with low-back ""strain"", twenty-six had tender motor points and twenty-four did not, while forty-nine of fifty patients with radicular signs and symptoms suggesting disc involvement had tender motor points, and the one without such tender points had a hamstring contusion which limited straight leg raising. Of fifty controls with no back disability, only seven had mild tender points after strenuous activity, while forty-six of another fifty controls with occasional back discomfort had mild motor-point tenderness. In all instances the tender motor points were located in the myotomes corresponding to the probable segmental levels of spinal injury and of root involvement, when present. Patients with low-back strain and no tender motor points were disabled for an average of 6.9 weeks, while those with the same diagnosis but tender motor points were disabled for an average of 19.7 weeks, or almost as long as the patients with signs of radicular involvement, who were disabled for an average of 25.7 weeks. Tender motor points may therefore be of diagnostic and prognostic value, serving as sensitive localizers of radicular involvement and differentiating a simple mechanical low-back strain from one with neural involvement."

A 10-year longitudinal study.,"Percutaneous nucleotomy is a relatively new technique for treating lumbar disc herniation. There is no agreement as to the volume of disc material to be removed. A long-term study of clinical and radiological data from patients treated by percutaneous nucleotomy was designed to identify the factors associated with favourable and unfavourable outcomes. We studied 42 patients for at least ten years; the mean follow-up was 10.9 years. They were divided into two subgroups to assess the value of preserving the nucleus pulposus in the central area of the disc. The overall success rate for both subgroups was 50%. A decrease in disc height on plain radiography and a decrease in signal intensity on MRI were observed more infrequently in patients in whom the nucleus pulposus in the central area of the disc had been preserved, than in those in whom it had been extensively removed. These adverse radiological findings correlated closely with increased low back pain during the first one to two years after operation and a poorer overall outcome. We conclude that percutaneous nucleotomy is most likely to be successful when the central area of the disc is preserved."

CD007431,0,9706933,0,The effect of thoracic paravertebral blockade on intercostal somatosensory evoked potentials.,"The paravertebral nerve blocks used in upper abdominal or thoracic surgery provide excellent pain relief and can inhibit some aspects of the neuroendocrine stress response to surgical trauma, which suggests that a very high-quality afferent block can be effected. To confirm this, we evaluated intercostal somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in 10 patients undergoing paravertebral nerve blocks as a treatment for chronic pain. SSEPs were recorded before and after ipsilateral thoracic paravertebral deposition of 1.5 mg/kg bupivacaine 0.5%. Sensory loss to temperature was demonstrated in all patients at the level of injection and had a mean superior spread of 1.4 (range 0-4) dermatomes and a mean inferior spread of 2.8 (range 0-7) dermatomes. SSEPs were abolished (the normal waveform was rendered unrecognizable with unmeasurable latencies and a mean amplitude of zero) in all patients at the level of injection. In addition, a two-dermatome SSEP abolition was found in four patients and a three-dermatome abolition was found in two patients. SSEPs were modified, but not significantly, at all other test points. We conclude that cortical responses to thoracic dermatomal stimulation can be abolished at the block level and adjacent dermatomes by thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade. Equivalent results have not been demonstrated with more central forms of afferent blockade, which suggests that thoracic paravertebral nerve blocks may be uniquely effective."

CD007431,0,9835099,0,[Surgery of lumbar disk hernia: historical perspective].,"Although the clinical picture of discogenic sciatica is well known already in the ancient world, it is not until 1933 that WJ Mixter and JS Barr provide the correct pathogenetic interpretation and suggest surgery as the treatment of choice. The work of the American Authors was however based on the knowledge acquired during the previous centuries starting with Domenico Cotugno, who first suggested the neurogenic nature of sciatica (1764) and later with the neurologists of the french school Valleix, Lasègue, Dejerine, Sicard who elucidated the semeiology and debated in detail the etiopathogenesis of the condition. The german pathologists Schmorl and Andrae (1927-29) are to be credited for their contribution to the pathology of intervertebral disc, recognizing the frequency and degenerative (not neoplastic) nature of nucleus pulposus herniation. Surgery of disc herniation starts with Oppenheim and Krause (1909). Mixter and Barr used laminectomy and a transdural route although a more limited approach to the spinal canal had already been proposed by the italian Bonomo (1902), unknown to many. Love, of the Mayo Clinic (1937-39) introduced the extradural/interlaminar approach while Caspar and Yasargil (1977) applied the concepts of microsurgery to the procedure.

Serum and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid were studied in 62 patients and 47 age-matched controls. Patients were grouped according to neurologic status, duration of symptoms, and findings in magnetic resonance imaging. Statistically significant elevations in cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase activity, and total protein concentration were observed in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Patients with neurologic deficits did not exhibit significant differences in cerebrospinal fluid parameters compared with patients lacking neurologic signs. No significant differences were detectable between lateral and medial compression. Acute disk herniation led to practically the same biochemical changes as chronic compression. Biochemical analysis of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid offers additional diagnostic information in patients suffering from back or leg pain associated with degenerative changes of the spine. Pathological damage to meningeal and neural tissues can be demonstrated even if neurologic signs or obvious spinal compression are missing in the radiological examination. An elevated cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio reflects alteration of the blood/cerebrospinal fluid barrier status. Increased acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity point to pathophysiological impairment of neural tissues or meninges."

Potentials of the X-ray computerized and magnetic/resonance tomographies were given a comparative analysis. As was established, the two methods are not mutually exclusive. MRI is more advantageous in the diagnosis of degenerative/dystrophic changes in soft a tissue structures.

Of the 58 men and 42 women (mean age 42, range 19-75), 47 patients had a subligamentous disc protrusion and 53 had an extruded disc fragment. Of 27 patients who presented with leg pain only, 26 (96%) were found subsequently to have an extruded fragment. Patients with an extruded fragment had a significantly higher proportion of leg:back pain (median 99:1) than those with a subligamentous disc protrusion (median 75:25, P < 0.001). Patients with leg pain only and those with a marked predominance of leg pain over back pain have a high probability of harboring an extruded disc fragment."
CD007431,0,146731,0,Reoperation after lumbar intervertebral disc surgery.,"This retrospective study includes 53 patients who underwent reoperation after failure of lumbar disc surgery to relieve pain. All patients had leg pain before reoperation, which was successful in 28% of cases. Most clinical features, such as persistence or mode of recurrence of pain, radicular quality of pain, positive straight-leg raising, and myelographic root sleeve defects, were not helpful in predicting successful and unsuccessful reoperations. However, a significantly larger percentage of women than men had successful reoperations. Patients who had past or pending compensation claims, who had sensory loss involving more than one dermatome, or who failed to have myelographic dural sac indentations resembling those caused by a herniated disc did poorly with reoperation. A very convincing myelographic defect appears to be needed to justify reoperation at a previously unoperated location. Excision of scar alone or dorsal rhizotomy was of no avail in these cases."

CD007431,0,16866027,0,Comparative morphometry of the lower lumbar vertebrae: osteometry in dry bones and computed tomography images of patients with and without low back pain.,"Various factors affect the development of the vertebral canal. The dimensions of the vertebral canal and the intervertebral foramen can be altered by these factors before or after birth. Sex differences in dimensions have also been reported. When there is a stenosis of the vertebral canal or the intervertebral foramen, neural structures confined within them can be affected easily, resulting in symptoms. Using computed tomography images, we compared vertebral canal dimensions in 100 patients with low back pain and/or radiculopathy with those in 40 healthy, non-symptomatic controls. We also measured the dimensions of 275 dry bones. We found significant correlations among the variables in the live subjects. We found significant differences between patients and controls in the variables that were measured. Stenoses were more prevalent in females. Dry bone measurements showed some sex differences, and stenosis mainly in vertebrae L4, L5 and S1."

Information has been extracted from complex data sets using a multivariate data analysis program (FCVPC-87). Superficially experienced pain may represent pronounced nerve root affliction. Pain relief in particular body positions was related to extruded discs and additional osseous stenosis, and rarely occurring relief to derangement of nerve root circulation. Neither somatosensory pain quality descriptions nor pain intensity variables were found to be of diagnostic value. Long duration of symptoms was found together with nerve root atrophy. Affliction of the L5 and S1 nerve roots showed differences with regard to pain localization and intensity and some surgical findings. Pain mapping may represent an indication of the patho-anatomical substratum in patients with herniated lumbar intervertebral discs."

CD007431,0,9202855,0,Disc protrusion in the child. Particular features and comparison with neoplasms.,"Lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, although common in adults, is infrequent in the young, and especially in patients under 17 years old. In this work we review clinical data pertaining to two pediatric groups of patients whose main complaint was low back pain and/or sciatica, trying to identify factors that might contribute to their earlier referral and to the differential diagnosis of protruded disc and spinal neoplasm in this population. Group A comprises 17 youngsters diagnosed as having lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus and group B, 16 children with neoplasms of the lower thoracic and lumbosacral regions. Both groups were similar in sex distribution and symptoms of pain and numbness. However, there was a striking difference in age at presentation. No patient in group A was younger than 11 years, while most of those in group B were in their first decade of life (P = 0.018). The classic clinical onset in the children with herniated discs started with low back pain and sciatica, as in the children with neoplasms, although in subgroup B leg pain tended to be bilateral. The usual examination findings in both groups were spinal rigidity and sensory loss, but motor weakness and impaired reflexes were found to be more frequent in the group with spinal growths (P = 0.02). Children with lumbosacral neoplasms also tended to present with atypical symptoms (acute onset, intracranial hypertension, subarachnoid hemorrhage and abdominal pain), while this was the exception in the group with herniated discs. Plain radiographs of the pediatric spine showed that X-ray examination is still a good tool for diagnosing spinal growths compared with their scant utility in disc herniations (P = 0.001). During the survey we were impressed by the children's apparent good tolerance to pain, which is probably due to the lack of the emotional component of pain in adults and explains their delayed referral for neurosurgical consultation. However, all modalities of treatment seemed to be effective in children, chemonucleolysis and surgery being extraordinarily effective in this age group. Accordingly, we see no reason for long-term conservative therapy in children with lumbar and sciatic pain; on the contrary, we believe these patients should be offered earlier neurosurgical treatment."
CD007431,0,2521444,0,Selective criteria may increase lumbosacral spine roentgenogram use in acute low-back pain.,"Eleven clinical criteria have been proposed to limit use of lumbosacral spine roentgenograms in patients with acute low-back pain who are at risk for vertebral cancer, osteomyelitis, acute fracture, or herniated disk. We retrospectively applied the criteria to 471 patients with acute low-back pain in three teaching hospital walk-in clinics. Roentgenograms were obtained at the initial visit in 99 patients (21.1%); the number would have increased to 217 (46.1%) if the criteria had been used. The following four patient characteristics were associated with actual roentgenogram use: older age, longer duration of symptoms, reflex asymmetry, and point vertebral tenderness. Adoption of the 11 criteria studied herein may inadvertently increase roentgenogram use, thereby raising health care costs and exposing more patients to gonadal irradiation. The standard of practice in these three clinics seemed to entail use of less broad roentgenogram selection criteria. Other published guidelines for roentgenograms emphasize clinical follow-up, reserving further evaluation for patients who fail to improve after a trial of bed rest and analgesics."

CD007431,0,11193500,0,The role of cyclooxygenase-2 and inflammatory cytokines in pain induction of herniated lumbar intervertebral disc.,"Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is the disease which is the major cause of radiculopathy. In terms of the pathogenesis of disease, it is reported that prostaglandinE2 (PGE2) plays an important role to induce radiculopathy. Arachidonate cascade, which is the process of PGE2 synthesis, is mainly regulated by two kinds of enzymes, phospholipaseA2 (PLA2) and cyclooxy genase (COX). Previously, PLA2 was recognized as the rate-limiting enzyme of this cascade, and some authors reported the clinical significance of PLA2 at the site of LDH concerning the radicular pain. Recently, COX was elucidated to consist of 2 types of isoform, a constitutive form of COX-1 and an inducible form of COX-2. COX-2 has been focused as a key enzyme to regulate PGE2 synthesis and plays an important role in inflammation, because COX-2 was induced in many types of cells by the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). However, it is not fully discussed whether or not, COX-2 is induced in lumbar disc tissue and if it plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of LDH. To clarify the role of COX-2 in the pathomechanism of radiculopathy of LDH, we have investigated the expression of COX-2, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in herniated lumbar disc tissue. Immunohistologically, they were detected in the cytosol of chondrocytes constituting the disc tissue. RT-PCR showed that herniated lumbar disc-derived cells expressed mRNA of COX-2, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in the presence of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. The disc-derived cells also produced much PGE2 by stimulating of inflammatory cytokines at the same time and this PGE2 production was distinctly suppressed by a selective inhibitor of COX-2, 6-methoxy-2-naphtyl acetic acids (6MNA). These results suggest that COX-2 and inflammatory cytokines might play a causative role in the radiculopathy of LDH through upregulating PGE2 synthesis."
CD007431,0,2997232,0,Lower-extremity sensibility testing in patients with herniated lumbar intervertebral discs.,"The significance of sensory changes determined by pinprick and light touch in individuals with a herniated lumbar disc has been questioned. Discrepancies may be related to the subjectiveness of the test, failure to use dermatome-specific testing sites, overlap of areas that are innervated by different nerve roots, anatomical variations, or lack of sensitivity of the testing technique. For this study, we assessed the results of sensory examinations of twenty-five patients with documented herniation of a lumbar disc. The examinations were done using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, vibrometry, pinprick, and light touch in the autonomous skin areas supplied by the fourth and fifth lumbar and first sacral-nerve roots. Right-left differences in Semmes-Weinstein pressure thresholds of more than fifteen milligrams per square millimeter enabled us to localize disc lesions to a specific root in 100 per cent of patients and differences in vibratory thresholds of more than 3.5 micrometers, to localize the correct level in 88 per cent. Lesser differences in thresholds did not help to identify the involved root. The mean sensory threshold on the side of the disc lesion was found to be significantly greater than that on the opposite side by both vibrometry and pressure aesthesiometry (p less than 0.005). These findings were not duplicated using light touch or pinprick testing. Even with the most sophisticated sensibility-testing techniques, correct identification of the nerve root that was compressed by a herniated lumbar disc was accurate in only 50 per cent of patients."

It will focus on four cases where the herniation involved the neural canal (intervertebral canal). Comparison to the 14 spinal canal central herniations will be made. The clinical findings for lateral L3/4 HNP allowed a preimaging diagnosis to be made in three of the four cases. In the central group the correct preimaging diagnosis was made one of the 14 cases (P less than 0.01). There are numerous reasons why the central L3/4 HNP preimaging diagnosis is inaccurate as well as difficult to establish and these reasons are discussed in detail. The myelographic and CT findings of the lateral L3/4 HNP are clearly elaborated. All herniations were extruded. They poorly responded to conservative management. The duration of illness, onset of pain to surgical disk removal, for the lateral herniations was 34.8 days and, 154.4 days for the central group (P less than 0.05). The myelogram is a disappointing test in the diagnosis of lateral L3/4 HNP, but highly accurate in spinal canal L3/4 HNP. CT is a preferred imaging test being virtually positive in all cases."

History of back pain and the parameters of spinal pathology were related to the highest and lowest degrees of physical loading. In multivariate analyses, history of back injury was related to the occurrence of symmetric disc degeneration, anular ruptures, and vertebral osteophytosis. Symmetric disc degeneration was associated with sedentary work, and vertebral osteophytosis was related to heavy work. History of back pain was related to occupational physical loading after control for the effects of the other covariates. The results indicate that the least pathology stemmed from moderate or mixed physical loading, but the least back pain was associated with sedentary work."

Twelve patients complained of permanent uni or bilateral sciatica. All the others had a syndrome of intermittent claudication with pain and paresthaesia. The authors stress once again the highly evocative nature of this syndrome which reflects involvement of the nerve roots in the stenosed lumbar canal. Treatment consisted of lamino-arthrectomy which resulted in the disappearance of symptoms in most of cases. In four cases, vertebral slipping worsened during the post-operative cowise with, in three cases a recurrence of symptoms necessitating a complementary arthrodesis. This risk of increased slipping is a result of the instability created by the arthrectomy, especially when it is bilateral, and has led the authors to widen their indications for routine complementary postero-lateral arthrodesis."

CD007431,0,12210362,0,Intrapartum maternal lumbosacral plexopathy.,"There are many conflicting theories regarding the mechanism and prognosis of acute foot drop during labor. We report seven women who had arrested labor and foot drop. Six had short stature and one had a large newborn. All had weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, eversion, and inversion, and sensory loss in the L-5 dermatome. Superficial peroneal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were small or absent in six patients, and the sural SNAP was attenuated in one. Peroneal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude (recording from extensor digitorum brevis) was low in five, whereas the tibial CMAP was normal in all patients. Peroneal CMAP amplitude (recording from the tibialis anterior) was normal in three and small in three. Needle electromyography revealed decreased recruitment and fibrillation potentials in L-5-innervated muscles, mostly below the knee. We conclude that intrapartum foot drop occurs mostly in short women and is caused by lumbosacral trunk compression by the fetal head at the pelvic brim. The primary pathology is predominantly demyelination and recovery is complete in up to 5 months."

Patients had a microdiscectomy, a laminectomy plus microdiscectomy, or a decompressive laminectomy with a microdiscectomy. The causes of ruptured discs were lifting (31.4%), falls (10.2%), and sports (10.0%). Almost all patients had complained of leg pain (99%), and 79% had radicular pain in a dermatomal distribution. Thirty-three percent of the patients had been involved in industrial accidents, and 6% had legal claims pending during the surgical period. Almost 11% of the patients had complications, and there was one death caused by abdominal arterial bleeding. Patients were also rated according to the Prolo Functional-Economic Outcome Rating Scale to improve the ability to compare series in the future. Almost 80% of the patients had good outcomes as defined by scores on this scale of 8 (16.2%), 9 (33.2%), and 10 (26.9%). Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of this series: 1) most patients had good outcomes; 2) patients with nonindustrial injuries had better outcomes than did patients with industrial injuries; 3) professionals with legal concerns and laborers with industrial insurance had good outcomes; and 4) the Functional-Economic Outcome Rating Scale appears to be a useful tool for comparing different procedures more objectively and for comparing the outcomes across series."

The purpose of this study is to report the clinical and radiographic outcomes of 36 consecutive patients who underwent lumbar TDR using ProDisc II, and the factors associated with a better clinical outcome after a 2-year minimum follow-up. At the time of the latest follow-up, the success rate was 94% of 36 patients according to the criteria of the US Food and Drug Administration. Of the 10 patients unable to work preoperatively, 7 patients returned to work. Moreover, mean score on the visual analog scale for low back and leg pain improved significantly from 7.5 and 4.7 to 3.0 and 1.2, respectively (P<0.001). In addition, mean Oswestry disability index scores improved significantly from 69.2 to 21.0 (P<0.001). Mean disc height at the operative level increased significantly from 9.0 to 17.6 mm, and mean range of motion increased significantly from 9.7 to 12.7 degrees (P<0.01). Statistical analysis showed that the factors associated with a better clinical outcome were single level, and a higher postoperative segmental ROM at the operative level.

Following failed conservative treatment for 6 months, eight patients with contained disc herniations were enrolled in the study. Following MR guided introduction of the laser fiber into the targeted disc space, the laser-induced temperature distribution was visualized using a color-coded subtraction technique based on a T1-weighted GRE sequence. In seven patients PLDD could be performed. In all cases laser effects were depicted by MR. In this regard the color-coded technique was found to be superior to conventional magnitude images. Whereas no apparent decrease in the extent of herniation was discovered immediately following PLDD, T2-weighted FSE images showed signal intensity alterations in two of the seven patients. Clinical evaluation, obtained 3-4 months after PLDD, revealed a fair (n = 2) or good (n = 4) response to the treatment. One patient showed no change in symptoms. MR guidance and monitoring of PLDD is feasible within an open 0.5-T system and seems to render PLDD more safe and controllable."

The videotape analysis showed that the times involved during the task performance for the bent back (more than 25 degrees ) and severe bent back (more than 45 degrees ) were 48.4 and 33.5% of the total cycle time, respectively. The upper limit from OWAS (Ovako Working Posture Analysis System) for bent back posture is 30% of the total cycle time. The bent and twisted back posture (both more than 25 degrees ) time was 10.4% compared to OWAS limit of 5%. This indicated that actions are needed in the near future to alleviate the risk of low back pain. Ergonomics redesign of the workstation was recommended for the operation."

Objective - To compare chiropractic and hospital outpatient treatment for managing low back pain of mechanical origin.Design - Randomized controlled trial. Allocation to chiropractic or hospital management by minimization to establish groups for analysis of results according to initial referral clinic, length of current episode, history, and severity of back pain. Patients were followed up for up to two years.Setting - Chiropractic and hospital outpatient clinics in 11 centers.Patients - 741 patients aged 18-65 who had no contraindications to manipulation and who had not been treated within the past month.Interventions - Treatment at the discretion of the chiropractors, who used chiropractic manipulation in most patients, or of the hospital staff, who most commonly used Maitland mobilization or manipulation, or both.Main outcome measures - Changes in the score on the Oswestry pain disability questionnaire and in the results of tests of straight leg raising and lumbar flexion.Results - Chiropractic treatment was more effective than hospital outpatient management, mainly for patients with chronic or severe back pain. A benefit of about 7 percent points on the Oswestry scale was seen at two years. The benefit of chiropractic treatment became more evident throughout the follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures also showed that chiropractic was more beneficial.Conclusions - For patients with low back pain in whom manipulation is not contraindicated, chiropractic almost certainly confers worthwhile, long-term benefit in comparison with hospital outpatient management. The benefit is seen mainly in those with chronic or severe pain. Introducing chiropractic into NHS practice should be considered.J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 1991;13(6):278-287."
CD007431,0,6646322,0,[Clinico-etiological correlations in children with sciatica].,"During a period of 30 years 21 children with sciatic pains were treated at the Developmental Age Neurology, Medical Academy in Gdańsk. The aetiological factors and clinical manifestations were analysed. Nucleus pulposus prolapse was diagnosed in 5 children, in 9 cases neoplasms were found (in 3 cases malignant tumours of the sacral bone, intraspinal tumours in 6 cases); in 4 cases obliterative intraspinal arachnitis, and in 3 cases other causes were diagnosed. With the exception of one child the other ones were in the school-age group. In nearly all cases the onset was insidious. In one-third of children with neoplastic processes the neurological symptoms appeared after injuries and caused initially considerable diagnostic difficulties. In 18 cases disturbances of spinal configuration and mobility were observed. Pain produced by stretching was present in 20 cases. Sphincter disturbances were observed in 6 cases (including 5 with tumours). Motor defects were noticed in all patients, more pronounced in cases of tumours. Patency of the subarachnoid spinal space was without any greater importance for the diagnosis of sciatic pains. Raised protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid was highest in cases of intraspinal tumours, and it was moderately pronounced in obliterative arachnitis, while in nucleus pulposus prolapse the protein level varied. Plain films were of lower diagnostic importance, with the exception of sacral bone tumours and nucleus pulposus prolapse. Of greater importance were contrast medium radiological examinations of fluid spaces."

Goniometric range of motion measurements of three hip movements, abduction, flexion with the knee extended, and extension, were taken on two subject populations, runners (N = 45), and nonrunners (n = 43), in order to determine tightness of the hip adductor, extensor, and flexor muscles, respectively. The mean score values obtained for each of the three measurements for both the right and left sides were compared for differences between the running and nonrunning populations and between male and female subjects. Runners were found to be significantly limited in the movement of hip flexion with the knee extended. The mean score values obtained for all male subjects for this movement were lower than those for all female subjects. The incidence of low back pain in runners was examined; however, no correlation could be drawn between muscular tightness in these subjects and low back pain.

CD007431,0,9379275,0,Gait compensations in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and their relationship to pain and passive hip motion.,"This study related mechanisms of gait compensations to the level of pain and to limitations in passive motion in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip. Joint motion, moments, and intersegmental forces were calculated for 19 patients with unilateral osteoarthritis of the hip (12 men and seven women) and for a group of normal subjects (12 men and seven women) with a similar age distribution. The patients who had osteoarthritis walked with a decreased dynamic range of motion (17 +/- 4 degrees) of the hip and with a hesitation or reversal in the direction of the sagittal plane motion as they extended the hip. The patients with a hesitation or reversal in motion had a greater loss in the range of motion of the hip during gait (p < 0.004) and a greater passive flexion contracture (p < 0.022) than those with a smooth pattern of hip motion. This alteration in the pattern of motion was interpreted as a mechanism to increase effective extension of the hip during stance through increased anterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis. The patients who had osteoarthritis of the hip walked with significantly decreased external extension, adduction, and internal and external rotation moments (p < 0.008). The decreased extension moment was significantly correlated with an increased level of pain (R = 0.78; p < 0.001). This finding suggests that decreasing muscle forces (hip flexors) may be one mechanism used to adapt to pain."

Forty-four calcified Type I-IV (CA I-IV) limbus fractures, interpreted as routine disc herniations on magnetic resonance imaging scans, were correctly identified as limbus fragments on computed tomographic and myelographic/computed tomographic studies, whereas 15 NC III lesions were mistaken for disc herniations alone on all three radiographic examinations. The preoperative recognition of the CA I-IV and NC III fracture types proved essential to the successful resection of five Type I, five Type II, 36 Type III, and ten Type IV fragments through extended laminotomies, hemilaminectomies, and laminectomies with the down biting curette, tamp, and mallet technique. In the absence of routine disc herniations, expanded standard dissectomies to the superior or inferior pedicular levels allowed for the identification and removal of NC III fractures."

The anterior displacement of the fifth lumbar vertebra averaged 82 per cent (range, 66 to 118 per cent). The length of follow-up averaged 5.5 years (range, two to fourteen years). All of the arthrodeses resulted in a solid fusion and excellent relief of both the back pain and the sciatica.

CD007431,0,14639665,0,A computer model of rigidity and related motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.,"This work explores the involvement of spinal circuits in the generation of parkinsonian rigidity and related motor dysfunction. A computer model of spinal proprioceptive input processing, derived from previous work on spasticity modeling, was adapted to the simulation of parkinsonian rigidity. Model parameters were varied to generate simulations reproducing experimental data obtained using the pendulum test of the leg in 10 parkinsonian patients and 3 healthy subjects. Convenient reproductions of experimental traces in rigidity were obtained by the combination of a low reflex gain and a decrease in reflex threshold. These findings are consistent with studies reporting an increase of spinal interneuron excitability and proprioception deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, as the threshold parameter was much lowered, our model generated typical features of parkinsonian resting tremor, endorsing the hypothesis of a participation of a spinal oscillator in this disorder. Finally, tuning the reflex gain during simulations of rigidity resulted in the generation of active movement, opening some hypotheses on pathophysiology of motor dysfunction in PD, and notably, of akinesia. More generally, this work accredits the hypothesis of the involvement of an aperiodic, altered supra-spinal motor drive in PD, resulting in spinal dysfunction, through specific descending motor pathways. This may lead to a search for new (spinal) pharmacological targets in PD. It emphasizes further the value of computer modeling in understanding motor control in health and disease."

Initial experience in 28 cases.,"Since November 1988, 28 patients with lumbar L5 radiculopathy refractory to conservative care and with a radiologically verified central or mediolateral disc herniation at the level of L4/L5 had had a percutaneous discectomy. Radiological verification consisted of spinal CT +/- myelography, +/- myelo-CT, +/- MRI. A short-term follow-up analysis of at least 2 months taking the clinical and functional status as well as the professional reintegration into account revealed a 64.3% (18/28 patients) satisfactory outcome and a 32.1% (10/28 patients) failure rate. Of the latter 28.6% (8/28 patients) required further open surgery. One patient whose pain had only partially in regressed was shown at open operation to have a sequestered cranial prolapse as revealed by spinal CT after the percutaneous procedure. There were no major complications. One patient developed a sequestered extraforaminal herniation through the nucleotomy canal three weeks after the procedure. One patient bled for 2 minutes. There were no major vessel injuries. One patient reported local muscular pain, and enhanced nerve root pain after introduction of the trocar sleeve."

The iodine concentration given was 250 mg I/ml or 200 mg I/ml respectively. The total iodine never exceeded 2.5 g (8-10 ml). Image quality was assessed in terms of diagnostic value having experience of more than 1,000 myelographies using metrizamide. Picture quality was similar to metrizamide of equal iodine concentration. In 35 patients electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after myelography with iopamidol 250. No changes that could be referred to the contrast medium were seen. There were no adverse reactions to lumbar myelography other than those following the lumbar puncture. In thoracocervical myelography mild and transient side effects occurred in 41 (28.3%).

CD007431,0,1534723,0,The role of vascular damage and fibrosis in the pathogenesis of nerve root damage.,"Vascular damage and fibrosis are common within the vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen. The grossest examples occur in patients who have previously undergone oil-based myelography or spinal surgery. The mechanisms of fibrosis in the latter instance may be related to persisting cotton debris from sponges used during the operation. This debris may act as a fibrogenic stimulus. However, in cadaveric studies of nonoperated spines, the author and his colleagues have found clear evidence of vascular damage and fibrosis within the spines, and this vascular damage is significantly related to the severity of degenerative disk disease. Degenerative disk disease with osteophytic proliferation and disk protrusion may lead to compression of epidural veins with dilation of noncompressed veins. There is a significant statistical relationship between the extent of the disk degeneration and prolapse and the evidence of venous compression and dilatation. The dilatated veins may contain antemortem thromboses. In turn, there is a significant statistical relationship between the evidence for venous obstruction and perineural fibrosis. Such a relationship also exists between perineural fibrosis and neuronal atrophy. If therefore appears likely that venous obstruction with resultant hypoxia is an important mechanism leading to nerve root damage. In the peripheral blood, significant defects in the fibrinolytic system correlate with the severity of the symptoms. However, it was not possible to correlate these changes with individual clinical or imaging features. These fibrinolytic changes are recognized as markers of vascular damage and may reflect the pathologic processes that the author and his colleagues have demonstrated. It is uncertain whether they play any secondary pathogenic role in the chronicity of these back problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,3235323,0,"Lumbar disc herniation: diagnosis, surgical treatment, recurrence. A review of 872 operated cases.","This review is based on 972 cases treated surgically for lumbar disc herniation between 1974 and 1984. The authors discuss several problems related to this condition. The importance of the history and clinical assessment are emphasized, as well as the role of instrumental tests such as radiculography and CT scan. The authors report what they believe to be the treatment of choice to avoid recurrence, based on an analysis of two groups of patients. The first group consisted of patients in whom lumbar and radicular pain persisted after operation. The second group consisted of patients in whom these symptoms recurred after an interval of complete relief. This analysis leads to the following conclusions: 1) clinical examination is pre-eminent; CT scan and radiculography are complementary to an accurate neurological examination; 2) hemilaminectomy is the operation of choice because it is sufficient to ensure accurate exploration of both root and disc; 3) most recurrences are due to errors in diagnosis or surgical technique."

It is emphasized that at present there is no real evidence to support preference for one or other of these instrumental tests. Only the clinical examination is capable of evaluating each case individually and thus providing the most reliable indications on which to base both diagnosis and treatment."
CD007431,0,9422900,0,Knee-chest vs horizontal side position during induction of spinal anaesthesia in patients undergoing lumbar disc surgery.,"In the prone knee-chest position the spread of plain 0.5% bupivacaine in the cerebrospinal fluid and associated haemodynamic changes may be different compared with the horizontal position. A randomized comparison was performed in 40 ASA I-II patients, aged 24-61 yr, undergoing lumbar disc surgery. Subarachnoid injection (27-gauge needle) at the L2-3 interspace with 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine was performed with the patient in the operative knee-chest position (prone knee-chest group, n = 20) or in the horizontal side position (supine side horizontal group, n = 20). Patients in the supine side horizontal group were turned into the horizontal supine position for 20 min, and subsequently they were placed in the operative knee-chest position. In three patients in the prone knee-chest group, the spinal needle was replaced by a larger needle (25-gauge). The final cephalad extension of sensory analgesia on skin tested by pinprick was T5 (median) in the prone knee-chest group and T6 in the supine side horizontal group. Recovery was also similar, on average 210 min from injection in both groups. The mean decrease in systolic arterial pressure was somewhat greater in the prone knee-chest group (30 mm Hg) than in the supine side horizontal group (13 mm Hg). The need for ephedrine occurred earlier in the supine side horizontal group (three patients, all within 10 min from local anaesthetic injection) than in the prone knee-chest group (six patients, all after 15 min). Four of the latter patients also required administration of an anticholinergic for bradycardia compared with two patients in the supine side horizontal group. Light sedation was given to five patients in the prone knee-chest group and to four in the supine side horizontal group because of numbness and aching in the shoulders. We conclude that spinal block was similar in the two groups but there was a tendency to more frequent episodes of haemodynamic deterioration in the knee-chest position."

CD007431,0,8980726,0,Contrast enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of recurrent disc herniation.,A positive result of re-operation in patients with recurrent symptoms after lumbar disc surgery is likely only if a new disc herniation is present. An improved ability to differentiate between recurrent disc herniation and scar tissue by contrast enhanced CT and MRI is suggested in earlier studies. In a prospective study 29 patients were selected for operation for suspected recurrent disc herniation. The inclusion of the patients was based on clinical symptoms and signs and myelography or non-enhanced CT. All patients were examined by CT and MRI both with and without intravenous contrast pre-operatively. The examinations were evaluated blind on a five point scale and statistical analysed by a regret function. Intravenous contrast improved the diagnostic power of both CT and MRI. MRI was superior to CT in both non-enhanced and enhanced examinations. MRI with intravenous contrast enhancement is proposed as the primary examination in patients with suspected recurrent disc herniation.

CD007431,0,6866454,0,When to operate and what to operate upon.,"It is apparent that the results of spinal surgery are less than optimal. The three major causes appear to be as follows: Patient selection. There are some patients who, owing to psychological change or secondary gain, are unable to respond to correction of a spinal problem. This is probably a very small percentage of the 25 to 35 per cent failure rate listed in the literature. Many of these patients have had the wrong operation for an unknown structural diagnosis. It is too tempting and easy for the spinal surgeon to blame poor results on the psyche. Structural diagnosis. It has been 40 years since Dandy published a report on ""the hidden disc,"" but the world of spinal surgery still has not recovered from it. Poor Dandy is also credited with introduction of the method of shaking the spinous process as a test for instability and hence fusion. It would seem obvious that any disc surgery based on a premise of exploration for a hidden problem is antiquated in the day of the CT scan. One should be further chagrined by decision making for fusion based on shaking the spine with a towel clip. It would defy any spinal surgeon to define in rational terms how much observed motion is ""abnormal."" Until a structural diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical and laboratory testing, there is no indication for surgery. This is the single most important factor in spinal surgery. The success rate will not change until this function is universally recognized. Proper operation. There is little room, in modern spinal surgery, for the surgeon who is a ""one trick pony."" Uniform application of an operative technique to a variety of deforming forces will result in a high failure rate. It is the duty of the spinal surgeon to have all the techniques available and be able to apply them with precision and skill. Specific surgical response must be made to a specific structural diagnosis. The foregoing three principles should greatly enhance surgical results."
CD007431,0,6455745,0,1980 Volvo award in clinical sciences. Assessment of patients with low-back pain by biplanar radiographic measurement of intervertebral motion.,"Abnormalities of intervertebral joint motion including hypermobility, reduced mobility, torsional abnormality, and displacement of the center of rotation have been associated with degenerative change. However, measurement of these signs in plane X-ray films is handicapped by the three-dimensional motion and geometry of the spine. This study aimed to relate three-dimensional motion of the joints to their pathological state. We have used biplanar radiography to measure intervertebral motion during voluntary movements by patients with low back pain. Primary (or intentional) and coupled motions were measured by a refined technique, along with disc shear and facet joint motion. Abnormalities were found, especially in the ""coupled"" motions which were related to narrowed disc space, and to proximity to previous fusions. There was asymmetry of motion specific to joints with herniated nucleus pulposus."

The diagnostic accuracy of the selected clinical signs and symptoms was also tested with arthroscopy as the standard, and sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Pronounced osteoarthrosis was more frequently associated with joint crepitus (P < 0.001). Adhesions were more frequently associated with reduced maximum protrusion (P < 0.001).

However, probably as a course of the improved preclinical diagnostical methods as EMG, spinal CT scan, MRT and the increased number of these examination techniques the percentage was 3.2% in our material thus a higher share of operated patients at the age of 71 and older. 50% of those patients even had a sequestered lumbar disc protrusion. Because the additional, clinical relevant bone narrowment of the spinal canal, lateral processus and the foramina intervertebralia it is necessary for this group of patients to perform a wide microsurgical decompression as modification of the normal surgery with a sufficient resection of compressing bone parts through laminotomy, hemilaminectomie and laminectomy. We did not observe serious intra- and postsurgery complications with persistent damages. The surgical mortality of 68 consecutive operated patients at the age of 71 up to 93 years was zero. The subjective valuation of the surgical longterm results was in 68% of the interviewed patients well or excellent, including the influence of the presurgical torturing pain (66%) and clinically relevant neurological deficits (72%). 10.6% of all cases judged the long term results as insufficient or bad.

Thirty women with lymphedema following axillary lymph node dissection surgery for breast cancer surgery were enrolled. In each patient, the volumes of the upper limbs were estimated by three physical therapists using circumference measurements, water displacement and optoelectronic volumetry. One of the physical therapists performed each measure twice. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), relative differences, and limits of agreement were determined. Intrarater and interrater reliability ICCs ranged from 0.94 to 1. Intrarater relative differences were 1.9% for the disk model method, 3.2% for the frustum sign model method, 2.9% for water displacement volumetry, and 1.5% for optoelectronic volumetry. Intrarater reliability was always better than interrater, except for the optoelectronic method. Intrarater and interrater limits of agreement were calculated for each technique. The disk model method and optoelectronic volumetry had better reliability than the frustum sign method and water displacement volumetry, which is usually considered to be the gold standard. In terms of low-cost, simplicity, and reliability, we recommend the disk model method as the method of choice in clinical practice. Since intrarater reliability was always better than interrater reliability (except for optoelectronic volumetry), patients should therefore, ideally, always be evaluated by the same therapist. Additionally, the limits of agreement must be taken into account when determining the response of a patient to treatment."

A clinical trial.,"Sixty-two patients with chronic low back pain occurring 14-60 months after undergoing discectomy for the first time were randomized to two physical treatment groups: 24 sessions of intensive dynamic back exercises with hyperextension or 24 sessions of intensive dynamic back exercises without hyperextension. At the conclusion of therapy and at one-year follow-up, no difference was seen between the randomized groups, with regard to the combined assessments of pain, disability and objective measurements. A difference for back exercises without hyperextension to be superior to the other treatment regimen was statistically significant at the three-month follow-up. In the patient's qualitative assessment of treatment outcome there were seen no significant differences between back exercises with or without hyperextension. There was a similar and significant improvement of the isometric endurance of back muscles in both groups, but the flexibility of the spine was significantly improved only in the group using hyperextension exercises. The overall response rate of an earlier published investigation was reproduced. It is concluded that chronic back patients after first time discectomy may benefit from an intensive rehabilitation protocol including intensive exercises. The added use of hyperextension exercises does not confer any independent benefit. Furthermore, the training had to continue for more than 2-3 months before a statistical significant decrease in back pain was reported in the patient pain diary."

CD007431,0,18038160,0,Limitation of activities of daily living accompanying reduced neck mobility after laminoplasty preserving or reattaching the semispinalis cervicis into axis.,"Although difficulties with neck mobility often interfere with patients' activities of daily living (ADL) after cervical laminoplasty, there was no detailed study on the relation between the limitations of ADL accompanying postoperative reduced neck mobility and the cervical posterior approach. The aim of this study was to compare retrospectively the frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying neck mobility after laminoplasty preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into the C2 spinous process with that after laminoplasty reattaching the muscle to C2. Forty-nine patients after C4-C7 laminoplasty with C3 laminectomy preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into C2 (Group A) and 24 patients after C3-C7 laminoplasty reattaching the muscle (Group B) were evaluated. The frequency of postoperative limitations of ADL accompanying each of three neck movements of extension, flexion and rotation were investigated. The postoperative O-C7 angles at extension and flexion was measured on lateral extension and flexion radiographs of the cervical spine, respectively. The postoperative cervical range of motion in rotation was measured in the cranial view using a digital camera. Frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying extension was lower (P = 0.037) in Group A (2%) than in Group B (17%). Frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying flexion was similar in Group A (8%) and Group B (4%). Frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying rotation was lower (P = 0.031) in Group A (12%) than in Group B (33%). Average O-C7 angle at extension was significantly larger (P = 0.002) in Group A (147 degrees ) than in Group B (136 degrees ). Average O-C7 angle at flexion was similar in Group A (93 degrees ) and Group B (91 degrees ). Average range of motion in rotation was significantly larger (P = 0.004) in Group A (110 degrees ) than in Group B (91 degrees ). This retrospective study suggested that the frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying neck extension or rotation was lower after laminoplasty preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into C2 than after laminoplasty reattaching the muscle."

CD007431,0,8446435,0,Effects and side effects of a percutaneous thermal lesion of the dorsal root ganglion in patients with cervical pain syndrome.,"Twenty consecutive patients with intractable chronic pain in the cervical region were treated with a radiofrequency lesion of the dorsal root ganglion on level C4, C5 or C6. Electromyography (EMG) and sensory evoked potentials (SEP) were recorded before and 3 weeks after the radiofrequency lesion. Side effects were studied 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months after the procedure. Pain scores were evaluated on Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) before and 6 weeks after treatment. The patient was interviewed 3, 6 and 9 months after the radiofrequency lesion. The most common side effect was burning pain in the dermatome of the treated nerve root. Hyposensibility in the dermatome was noticed in 35% of patients. Except in 1 patient, these side effects had disappeared 6 weeks after treatment. The EMG showed no signs of denervation. One SEP recording remained abnormal after treatment. There was initial pain relief in 75% of patients after 3 months and in 50% of the patients after 6 months. In conclusion, this study did not reveal any signs of motor denervation after a percutaneous partial rhizotomy. There were no long-term signs of deafferentation. Initial pain relief was found in 75% of patients, but there was a marked tendency for pain to recur in a period from 3 to 9 months after treatment."
CD007431,0,6280416,0,[Electromyography and electroneurography in peripheral nerve lesions. Part II].,"Electromyographical and electroneurographical examinations are indicated in the forefield of the surgical treatment for radicular syndromes, traumatic plexus and nerve lesions as well as compression or bottle-neck syndromes. The electrophysiological findings point out the neurogenic nature of the disturbance. They furthermore furnish statements with respect to the localisation, the extent, the kind and the prognosis of the lesions. The electromyographical and electroneurographical examination programme is determined by the anatomical innervation conditions and the questions that are of clinical interest. In case of radicular syndromes it is mainly the localisation with respect to the height of the root lesions that is of interest. In plexus lesions, the question regarding the reinnervation chance is usually to the fore. In primary nerve lesions, the question whether there is a partial or total nerve separation is above all of interest. In secondary nerve lesions and the bottle-neck syndromes it is usually necessary to determine the exact site of the lesions and the extent of the chronic compression damage. In this paper, these aspects ae discussed on the basis of the more important clinical pictures and practical hints for diagnosis and therapy are given."

The author found that in 6.15% of cases the nervus peroneus communis passes between the tendinous parts of the m. piriformis, and he considers this variation of practical significance for the development of the 'piriformis syndrome'. In unward rotation of the thigh, the m. piriformis is extended and the tendons of the divided muscle are tightly pressed together thus pinching the nerve between them. Pinching of the nerve causes the characteristic sciatic pain. In such a case, the patient can be relieved by cutting one of the tendons."

This study was undertaken to clarify the relation between morphologic changes in the herniation and the clinical course. Serial magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed an average of 4.4 times in 30 patients in a 30-month-average period. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and straight leg raising (SLR) test were improved, with the average reduction ratio of the herniation 15 and 18% on the sagittal and axial images, respectively. The JOA score and SLR test showed the most improvement within 1 year, with little change noted thereafter. In contrast, the disc herniation continued to reduce not only within 1 year, but also thereafter. Patients with progression of disc degeneration showed more marked regression of herniation than those in whom progression was not observed."

There were 48 patients in the study group and 53 normal controls. The level and type of herniation were evaluated. The clinical data including the neurological findings, the angle of straight leg raising and post-operative recovery as measured by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, were recorded. The high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) was measured by an ultrasensitive latex-enhanced immunoassay. The mean hs-CRP concentration was 0.056 +/- 0.076 mg/dl in the patient group and 0.017 +/- 0.021 mg/dl in the control group. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.006). There was no other correlation between the hs-CRP concentration and the level and type of herniation, or the pre-operative clinical data. A positive correlation was found between the concentration of hs-CRP before operation and the JOA score after. Those with a higher concentration of hs-CRP before operation showed a poorer recovery after. The significantly high concentration of serum hs-CRP might indicate a systemic inflammatory response to impingement of the nerve root caused by disc herniation and might be a predictor of recovery after operation."

Normal men and women and patients with a history of backache served as subjects. The vast majority of the subjects were able to perform the Grade 1 level, which was the highest resistance imposed by the sit-up and prone extension tests. The double leg lower was superior to the other two clinical tests but was able to identify only broad differences in strength capability. In the main, the subjective clinical tests were poor discriminators and seemed to lack the range of resistance necessary to be definitively useful as methods of assessing trunk muscle strength and may not provide appropriate resistance for improving trunk muscle strength in most patients."

CD007431,0,2964726,0,Analysis of strength tests and resistive exercises commonly used for low-back disorders.,"Using a modeling approach the conventional sit-up, the double straight-leg lowering, and prone trunk extension, the authors have shown these to have limitations as tests of maximum trunk flexion and extension strength and as modes of resistive exercise. These maneuvers are poor discriminators of trunk muscle strength, and they lack the range of resistance necessary to cover the spectrum of human trunk muscle strength capability. Use of manually handled weights can improve the above clinical tests and resistive exercise methods. As a result of selective positioning of the weights, variable resistance above and below that provided by the body segments alone can be achieved. The partial sit-up may be appropriate only for patients with significant trunk flexion weakness, and the straight head-trunk sit-up may be useful as a more strenuous test and resistive exercise. Rationale and derivations of the rigid-body equilibrium equations, as well as some of the limitations and assumptions associated with the modeling approach, are presented."
CD007431,0,9102825,0,[Neuroleukemia in adults].,"Involvement of CNS with leukemic cells is well recognized complication of acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) in childhood, but with recent improvements in systemic treatment and longer survival the incidence of this complication has increased in adults. Neurological symptomatology in patients with CNS leukemia is due to meningeal infiltration, but sometimes also to diffuse and nodular cerebral infiltration. Between January 1991 and December 1994, 36 patients suffering of acute leukemia, 28 with ALL, and 8 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were demonstrated to have neuroleukemia by the following criteria: (1) the presence at lumbar puncture (LP) pleocytosis and blast cells on CSF sediment (without positive bacteriologic and fungal cultures), and (2) the presence of neurological symptoms and signs. All 36 patients had 46 episodes of CNS involvement. All patients had neurological examinations during every episode, and according to the neurological abnormalities were classified into four categories. LP was performed in all, and CSF sediments obtained by sedimentation in Sayk's chambers, were routinely stained by MGG and cytochemical stains to detection of leukemic cells (Fig. 1). EEG was done during 21 episodes, CT scan during 15. We divided patients into four groups according to the most prominent neurological symptoms and signs. First was the group included 23 episodes (50%), (18 ALL, 5 AML), where symptoms and signs of meningeal irritation predominated, mimicking the clinical picture of meningitis. This meningeal syndrome can sometimes produce differential diagnostic problems with CNS infections, when CSF examination is of primary importance. Second was the group of 9 patients (6 ALL and 3 AML) with 10 episodes (21.74%) where cranial nerve symptoms and signs-predominated, or were exclusively present. Most frequently affected were bulbomotors, facials and opticus. Third group consisted of 8 ALL patients (8 episodes, 17.39%) with dominant spinal root symptomatology, caused by pathological infiltration of either spinal roots or meninges surrounding them. This group includes also one patient with mononeuritis multiplex and the other with painful polyneuropathy. All patients in this group had pain on straight leg raising, but we stress here that all patients from other groups had positive Lazarevitsh's sign, too. So, it can be a good differential diagnostic parameter for distinguishing toxic medicamentous polyneuropathy from leukemic poliradiculoneuropathy. Fourth group included 5 patients (5 episodes, 10.87%). 4 ALL and 1 AML, where cerebral symptoms, such as seizures, hemiparesis and psychoorganic syndromes were prominent. CSF was obtained during all episodes by lumbar puncture. The protein concentration ranged from 21-3180 mg/dl, and was above normal (45 mg/dl) during 28 episodes. Mild hypoglycoracchia was present during 16 episodes. Cell count ranged from 11-4816 cells/cm3, malignant cells were identified during all episodes with same morphological and cytochemical characteristics of identified type of leukaemia. It has been established that the most valuable diagnostic procedure in CNS leukemia is CSF examination, and detection of blasts is sufficient for diagnosis. All other procedures like EEG, myelography and CT have only supplemental diagnostic significance. Finally, in this study we showed that neurological symptomatology in patients with acute leukemia is not dependent of the type of leukemia, moreover different types of AL can have same neurological manifestations. As others, we sometimes used the term CNS leukemia in this paper, although it is clear that meninges and peripheral nervous system are most often involved. This is the reason why we suggest that neuroleukemia, or NS leukemia should be used as more appropriate expressions."

Following removal of the obstructing agent, can we be certain that liberation of the nerve root is complete? These anxieties can be dispelled by performing a straight-leg raising test bilaterally during the operation both before and after removal of the obstructing agent. The intraoperative straight-leg raising tests enable observations to be made as to the degree of nerve tension on the involved side as compared with tension on the uninvolved side; at the end of the operation, the tension on the involved side should be no more than the tension on the uninvolved side. When the straight-leg raising test is not being performed, it should be possible for the nerve root to be displaced to the midline of the spinal canal with ease."

CD007431,0,9840472,0,Comparative immunohistochemical study of group II (synovial-type) and group IV (cytosolic) phospholipases A2 in disc prolapse tissue.,"Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) has been suggested to be present in herniated disc tissue and it could possibly be involved in sciatica/ discogenic back pain mechanisms. In the present study the occurrence of two different phospholipase A2 enzymes, (1) low molecular weight (14 kDa) group II synovial-type (sPLA2) and (2) high molecular weight (85 kDa) group IV cytosolic (cPLA2), were compared. Fifty-three disc prolapses obtained at disc operations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, using anti-human monoclonal antibodies to sPLA2 and cPLA2, respectively. Only cell-associated (disc cells, hyaline cartilage chondrocytes) sPLA2 and cPLA2 immunoreactivity could be observed. The results showed that sPLA2 was more common (25/53, 47%) than cPLA2 (13/53, 25%). sPLA2 and cPLA2 were simultaneously present in 13 of 53 samples (25%). However, both PLA2 enzymes were predominantly present in hyaline cartilage cells (sPLA2: 16/53, cPLA2: 5/53), being less commonly observed in disc cells (sPLA2: 6/53, cPLA2: 3/53). In addition, three samples for sPLA2 and two samples for cPLA2 exhibited immunoreactivity in cartilage and disc cells simultaneously. sPLA2 was observed in no other locations, but in 3 of 53 samples cPLA2 was observed more diffusely in areas of granulation tissue, possibly in macrophages. No gender- or age-related dependence for either type of PLA2 enzyme immunoreactivity could be observed. Neither did their occurrence relate to clinical data such as straight leg raising or neurological deficit. The results do not support a major role for either of the two disc-cell-associated PLA2s in disc pathophysiology. For both enzymes, the major pool appears to reside in cartilage tissue cells, presumably in dislodged end-plate fragments. Disc cells are apparently unlikely candidates for major PLA2 storage."

In the present study, normal reference data were collected at two stimulus intensities for 24 volunteers, and the stimulus-effect relationship (decreasing tolerance latency with increasing stimulus intensity) was found significant (p less than 0.001) for all body sites tested. No overall sex differences were found; males behaved slightly more stoically than females, with differences significant only at the T3 site over the breasts. At the second evaluation at the higher stimulus intensity, females exhibited lower pain tolerance (greater pain sensitivity) at the right breast than males (p less than 0.05). No significant lateral asymmetry was found in cutaneous pain tolerance except at the dorsum of the hand: the right hand evinced elevated pain tolerance compared with the left hand in both right- and left-handed subjects. Eight radiculopathic pain patients with clinically involved left L5 nerve roots were evaluated and their responses were compared with the volunteer normal reference data. The radiculopathic group evinced elevated tolerance levels in both the radiculopathic dermatome and noninvolved sites compared with normal individuals (p less than 0.05)."

CD007431,0,2104701,0,Assessment of extradural degenerative disease with Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging: correlation with surgical and pathologic findings.,"To test whether gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced MR would increase the conspicuity of extradural degenerative disease in the previously unoperated patient, we prospectively studied a group of 30 patients with symptoms suggestive of disk disease. Surgical findings and pathologic correlations were used as an objective measure of accuracy. Gadolinium-DTPA increased the confidence of diagnosis at one of eight operated cervical levels (six patients) and changed the diagnosis from extradural degenerative disease to tumor in one patient. The mechanism of enhancement of the epidural space and peridiskal region appears to be related to accumulation of contrast material within the epidural venous plexus, as well as to epidural fibrosis associated with disk disruption and herniation. While the immediate clinical utility of gadolinium-DTPA for morphologic analysis seems limited to difficult cervical spine cases, the presence of enhancement as a marker of epidural fibrosis and attempted healing may prove to be of great importance in studying the natural history and basic pathophysiology of degenerative disk disease."
CD007431,0,15885385,0,A new approach for the estimation of intervertebral disc volume using the Cavalieri principle and computed tomography images.,"This study was carried out to describe a simple, accurate and practical technique for estimating the volume of intervertebral disc (ID) by the combination of the Cavalieri principle and computed tomography (CT) images. Total eight lumbar IDs from two cadavers were CT scanned in axial, sagittal and coronal sections. The consecutive sections with 5 and 3mm thickness were used to estimate the volume of the IDs by the Cavalieri principle. Three investigators estimated the volume of IDs independently to evaluate inter-observer differences. When the results were compared to the real volumes of IDs measured by the fluid displacement technique, there was no significant difference between the real volume measurements and the Cavalieri estimation results of ID volumes (P > 0.05). Moreover, findings of three investigators did not show significant variations (P > 0.05). Our results indicate that the section thickness and the section planes did not affect the accuracy of the disc volume estimation. Thus the combination of CT scanning with the Cavalieri principle may be used as a direct and reliable technique to estimate the volume of IDs with a mean of 4 min workload per ID."

Clinical and pulse sequence considerations.,"Sixty-five patients were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MR) to determine what combination of operator-selectable controls would result in a thorough examination of the intervertebral disks. There were 20 normal subjects, 8 with degenerative lumbar disk disease, 27 with both degeneration and herniation, 5 with stenosis of the spinal canal, and 5 with disk space infection. T2 was significantly longer in the normal nucleus pulposus than in the degenerated disk. Based on plots of in vivo signal intensity vs. repetition time (TR) for various echo times (TE), a sagittal 30-msec. TE and a 0.25-sec. TR were used for anatomical delineation and rapid localization, while sagittal and/or axial 120-msec. TE/3-sec. TR images were used to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid and disk. Comparison with radiographs, high-resolution CT scans, and myelograms showed that MR was the most sensitive for identification of degeneration and disk space infection, separating the normal nucleus pulposus from the annulus and degenerated disk. Herniation, stenosis of the canal, and scarring can be identified as accurately with MR as with CT or myelography."
CD007431,0,12016348,0,Evaluation of electromagnetic fields in the treatment of pain in patients with lumbar radiculopathy or the whiplash syndrome.,"Back pain and the whiplash syndrome are very common diseases involving tremendous costs and extensive medical effort. A quick and effective reduction of symptoms, especially pain, is required. In two prospective randomized studies, patients with either lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 or the whiplash syndrome were investigated. Inclusion criteria were as follows: either clinically verified painful lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 and a Laségue's sign of 30 degrees (or more), or typical signs of the whiplash syndrome such as painful restriction of rotation and flexion/extension. Exclusion criteria were prolapsed intervertebral discs, systemic neurological diseases, epilepsy, and pregnancy. A total of 100 patients with lumbar radiculopathy and 92 with the whiplash syndrome were selected and entered in the study following a 1:1 ratio. Both groups (magnetic field treatment and controls) received standard medication consisting of diclofenac and tizanidine, while the magnetic field was only applied in group 1, twice a day, for a period of two weeks. In patients suffering from radiculopathy, the average time until pain relief and painless walking was 8.2 +/- 0.5 days in the magnetic field group, and 11.7 +/- 0.5 days in controls p < 0.04). In patients with the whiplash syndrome, pain was measured on a ten-point scale. Pain in the head was on average 4.6 before and 2.1 after treatment in those receiving magnetic field treatment, and 4.2/3.5 in controls. Neck pain was on average 6.3/1.9 as opposed to 5.3/4.6, and pain in the shoulder/arm was 2.4/0.8 as opposed to 2.8/2.2 (p < 0.03 for all regions). Hence, magnetic fields appear to have a considerable and statistically significant potential for reducing pain in cases of lumbar radiculopathy and the whiplash syndrome."
CD007431,0,10547007,0,Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Long-term results after undercutting decompression compared with decompressive laminectomy alone or with instrumented fusion.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of various surgical procedures for lumbar spinal stenosis. Operations were performed on 117 consecutive patients for lumbar spinal stenosis between 1987 and 1992. Pre- and intraoperative data were recorded in a standardized manner. Three treatment groups were distinguished: group I consisting of 39 patients submitted to undercutting decompression; group II, 51 patients, submitted to laminectomy and foraminal decompression alone; and group III, 27 patients, who underwent foraminal decompression and laminectomy with instrumented fusion. Eight years (5-10 years) after surgery a questionnaire was mailed to the patients containing the outcome scales according to Greenough and Fraser [6] and Turner et al. [22] together with questions about residual pain, necessity of treatment and satisfaction with the operative outcome. A total of 72 questionnaires (61.6%) gave enough information for analysis. After a mean follow-up of 8 years, walking capacity had increased significantly in all groups (P < 0.001). Compared to preoperative values, pain had decreased significantly in all groups (P < 0.01). In group I 36% had good-to-excellent outcomes, and 30.8% and 23.8% in groups II and III (P > 0.05). Forty percent of group I patients were unsatisfied with the result, compared to 38.4% and 33.3% in the other groups (P > 0.05). Overall, 25 of 72 patients (34.7%) had severe constant back and/or leg pain requiring daily administration of analgesics. We conclude that the long-term outcome of decompressive surgery of the lumbar spinal canal, without and with instrumented fusion, is less favourable than was previously reported."
CD007431,0,3206299,0,Magnetic resonance imaging and contrast CT of the lumbar spine. Comparison of diagnostic methods and correlation with surgical findings.,"Thirty-two patients with suspected lumbar disc herniation were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast computed tomography (CT). One hundred disc levels were evaluated. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery on 31 discs, allowing anatomic confirmation of the diagnosis. Surgical findings supported the MRI diagnosis at 28 of 31 levels (90.3% accuracy), whereas the CT diagnosis correctly reflected only 24 of 31 levels (77.4% accuracy). Discrepancy between MRI and CT interpretation occurred at ten levels that were surgically explored. Computed tomography (CT) was incorrect at seven levels, and MRI was in error at three levels. The sensitivity of MRI was 91.7%, compared with 83.3% for CT, and the MRI specificity of 100% was superior to 71.4% for CT. This study demonstrates the clinical superiority of surface coil MRI over contrast CT in the evaluation of lumbar disc herniation. Surface coil MRI can be used as the initial diagnostic procedure for a suspected herniated lumbar disc, using invasive contrast studies and CT, if required, to clarify an equivocal MRI finding."

One or more lumbar discs were abnormal in 57% of the 20-year-old LBP patients (n = 75) and in 35% of the asymptomatic controls (n = 34) in MRI. Narrowed disc spaces and alterations attributed to lumbar Scheuermann's disease, shown on the radiographs, were always associated with DD in MRI. Such a strong relationship was not observed with transitional vertebrae, spondylolisthesis, spina bifida, or postural abnormalities. However, an increased weight, a positive straight leg raising test, and a reduced lumbar mobility was consistent with an increase in frequency of DD. Magnetic resonance imaging is a safe and sensitive method for studying the presence and etiologic factors of DD."

Reproducibility of physical signs in low-back pain.,"The reproducibility between observers of physical signs in patients with low-back pain was investigated. Fifty patients were examined by two surgeons and another sample of 33 patients was examined by a surgeon and a physiotherapist. Continuous data on five signs were analyzed by Pearsons' correlation coefficient, and binary data on 54 signs were analyzed by the Kappa agreement coefficient. Reliable signs consisted of measurements of lordosis and flexion range, determination of pain on flexion and lateral bend, nearly all measurements associated with the straight leg raising test, determination of pain location in the thigh and legs, and determination of sensory changes in the legs. Signs of root tension showed better agreement when qualified with a description of where the pain was experienced. Bony tenderness was more reliable than soft tissue tenderness."
CD007431,0,11552391,0,[MRI diagnosis of intervertebral disk disease].,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the leading diagnostic procedure for disk pathology and has overtaken other imaging modalities in frequency of use. However, one must be cautious not to overinterpret small abnormalities that are also frequent in asymptomatic subjects. There is conflicting evidence about the correlation of high-intensity zones with clinical symptoms. Bulging disks and protrusions are a common finding in asymptomatic individuals, whilst extrusions are almost always accompanied by back pain and sciatica. In patients with back pain or sciatica, MRI is indicated after failure of conservative management or neurological deterioration. Contrast-enhanced MRI is well suited to differentiate a recurrent disk extrusion from epidural fibrosis. In all cases suspicious of tumor or infection, MRI is indicated as a first-line investigation. The indications and pitfalls of the state of the art of MRI are delineated in this article."

Fifty-Three patients (33 women and 20 men, with an average age of 60.8 years) were evaluated retrospectively by neurosurgery. All of the patients had received simple X-P, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery. The neurological findings were evaluated on admission and in a follow-up review. Surgical intervention was performed on all patients and they underwent gross-total cyst removal. During surgery, the origin of a cyst was well observed. Follow-up data ranged from 6 to 46 months. Patient outcome was graded on a scale of excellent, good, or poor. Histological findings were evaluated. In 53 patients 58 cysts were identified. Four of the patients had multiple cysts. All cysts were associated with mobile spine. Fifty-five cysts were found in the lumbo-sacral region, two cysts were found in the cervico-thoracic region and one cyst in the thoracic region. Forty-two patients presented back pain and 52 patients presented radicular pain. Four patients had a cauda equina syndrome. Sensory disturbance was observed in 24 cases and motor weakness was observed in 21 cases. Claudication was observed in 19 cases. All cases with cervico-thoracic or thoracic cysts presented myelopathy. The duration of these clinical symptoms ranged from 10 days to 10 years. After surgery there was no case of a recurrent cyst during the follow-up period. Thirty-four cases had an excellent outcome, 18 a good outcome, and one a poor outcome. Out of 58 cysts 32 were joint cysts (11 synovial cysts, 21 ganglion cysts). A further 19 were flavum cysts, one was a posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) cyst and six others were unknown pseudo cysts. In 34 of the cysts we found hemosiderin deposits and in eight amyloid deposits. Present investigation and findings in literature show a clear comparison of these cystic formations and the mobile part of the spine. An anatomical relation to a vertebral joint (""facet"") is only found in some of the cases (32 of 58). Further to that, the name ""cyst"" is not correct either, because most of the cystic formations are presented without a cell lining on their internal wall and therefore they are pseudo-cystic. We think that these cystic formations should be called ""cystic formations of mobile spine"" (CYFMOS) rather than ""juxtafacet cysts"". A surgical intervention is the best treatment for these cysts if they cause a compression of nerve roots or/and of the spinal cord."

There were 105 patients who were seen and examined by the senior author (for the sake of the study) at the Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Department, on an average of 5.5 days (range 0-21 days) before CT and/or MRI examination were carried out. There were 36 women and 69 men with an average age of 42.7 +/- 9.8 (range 19-64) years. According to the radiological findings on CT and/or MRI, the patients were divided into three groups: 52 patients with disc hernia, 41 patients with bulging discs and 12 patients without positive findings. The mean values with standard deviations of 25 variables of three diagnostic groups were studied. Multiple comparison adjustment according to Bonferroni showed significant differences for three variables that were of diagnostic value (lumbar range of motion for forward flexion, left side-bending in standing, and pain distribution during extension in standing).

Of 250 consecutive patients, 94 were diagnosed as having myofascial pain and 57 as having herniated disc syndrome. Before evaluation and diagnosis, all patients completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire, ratings of pain and disability, and the Symptom Checklist 90-R. Patients were also grouped on the basis of previous surgical history and workers' compensation benefits. Patients suffering from myofascial pain were significantly less likely to report periods of pain relief than patients with herniated disc syndrome. Those receiving workers' compensation benefits reported significantly greater levels of pain, disability, and psychological distress than those not receiving benefits, irrespective of diagnosis. Patients who underwent previous surgery did not differ significantly from those who never underwent surgery. All patients had elevated scores on the Somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-R. Patients with myofascial pain and workers' compensation benefits demonstrated the highest levels of somatization and phobia. These findings suggest that the effects of low back pain of myofascial origin have comparable, if not worse, consequences than disc herniation. These findings also reaffirm the importance of workers' compensation in understanding the differences in patients with chronic low back pain."

Eighty patients with mechanical low-back pain completed the SIP and a physical examination at a walk-in visit and again three weeks later. Test-retest reliability of the SIP was substantial. Biologic validity was confirmed by significant correlations with age, pain duration, spine flexion, straight leg raising, and pain severity. Validity of psychosocial subscales was confirmed by significant associations with patient anxiety and psychiatric problems. Scores changed in the expected directions when patients were evaluated three weeks later. The SIP is thus valid, reliable, sensitive to clinical changes, and comprehensively assesses a wide range of dysfunctions."
CD007431,0,18175427,0,"[Recommendations for early identification of damage to the skeleton by malignant processes, and for early diagnosis of multiple myeloma].","The number of newly diagnosed cases of multiple myeloma in the Czech Republic is about 3-4 per 100 000 persons per year. In the higher age groups, the incidence increases. Multiple myeloma is an illness that reacts well to treatment which can result in periods of remission lasting for years. Some of the patients are even able to return to work. A pre-requisite for successful treatment is early diagnosis and this is usually in the hands of first line physicians. This is the reason why the Czech Myeloma Group, in conjunction with neurologists, orthopedicians and radio diagnosticians has issued the following recommendations for first line physicians containing a more detailed description of the symptoms and the diagnostic pitfalls of the disease. This disease reminds a chameleon for the variety of its symptoms. For the sake of clarification, we shall divide multiple myeloma symptoms into five points, each of which is reason enough to warrant an examination to confirm or rule out a malignant cause of health problems (a negative result does not automatically mean exclusion). If any of the recommended examinations results positive, the diagnostic process must be continued, in which case a general practitioner refers the patient to a specialist health centre. Observing these recommendations should minimize the number of cases of late diagnosis. 1. Bone destruction symptoms. - Unexplained backache for more than one month in any part of spine even without nerve root irritability or without pain in other part of skeleton (ribs, hips, or long bones). - Pain at the beginning of myeloma disease is very similar to benigne common discopathy, however the intensity of backache is decreasing within one months in benigne disease. In the case of malignant process the intensity of bone pain is steadily increasing. - Immediate imaging and laboratory investigation are indicated by resting and night pain in spinal column or in any part of skeleton. - Backache with the sign of spinal cord or nerve compression should be sent for immediate X Ray, and focussed CT/MRI followed by acute surgery if needed. - Osteoporosis especially in men and premenopausal women. 2. Features of changed immunity or bone marrow function. Persistent and recurrent infection, typical is normochromic anaemia, with leucopenia and trombocytopenia. 3. Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate even increase concentration of total plasma protein. 4. Impaired renal function. Increased level of creatinin or proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome with bilateral legs oedema. 5. Hypercalcemia with typical clinical symptoms (polyuria with dehydratation, constipation, nausea, low level conscience, coma). Every one from these points has to be reason for general medical doctor to start battery of tests: -X-ray of bones focused to painful area (mandatory before physiotherapy, local anaesthesia or other empiric therapy). If plain X-ray does not elucidate pain and symptoms are lasting more than one month, please consider all circumstances and results from laboratory investigation. This patient needs referral to the centre with MRI/CT facilities (CT or MRI is necessary investigation in case of nerve root or spine compression). -Investigation of erythrocyte sedimantion rate (high level of sedimentation of erythrocyte can indicate multiple myeloma). -Full blood count. -Basic biochemical investigation serum and urine: serum urea, creatinin, ionts including calcium, total protein, and albumin CRP (high concentration of total protein indicates myeloma, low level of albumin indicates general pathological process, similary increased concentration of fibrinogen, impaired renal function indicates myeloma kidney, however hypercalcemia is typical for highly aggressive myeloma). -Quantitative screening for IgG, IgM and IgA in serum (isolated raised level one of immunoglobulin with decreased level of the others indicates myeloma). -Common electrophoresis of serum is able to detect monoclonal immunoglobulin level at few gramm concentration. If all the laboratory investigation are in normal level the possibility that the current problems are multiple myeloma origine is smaller, but it does not exclude one of rare variant--non secretory myeloma (undifferentiated plasmocyt lost characteristic feature to produce monoclonal immunoglobulin). If any of tests indicate the possibility of myeloma, patient require urgent specialist referral to department with possibility to make diagnosis of malignant myeloma."

Ketorolac Tromethamine has proven efficacy in decreasing postoperative pain but there is concern with postoperative epidural bleeding after spine procedures. We prospectively assessed the incidence of bleeding complications after microdiscectomy in patients treated with a single 30 mg intraoperative dose of Ketorolac subsequent to wound closure. Group 1 consisted of 44 patients, 24 women and 20 men with mean age of 35.7 years (20 to 68 y) treated with Ketorolac. Group 2 consisted of 45 patients, 28 men and 17 women with mean age 46.8 years (32 to 74 y), who underwent discectomy without Ketorolac. Postoperative bleeding complications were monitored along with pain levels and time to discharge. We detected no significant postoperative changes in coagulation parameters or bleeding from the surgical site in either group. Both group 1 and 2 had averaged preoperative visual analog scale scores for leg pain of 8. Group 1 had an average postoperative visual analog scale score of 2.6 compared with 4 for group 2 two hours after surgery. Single dose intravenous Ketorolac provided beneficial analgesia without significant increase in risk of bleeding after microdiscectomy, enabling us to consistently perform microdiscectomy as an ambulatory procedure. Meticulous hemostasis should be accomplished before closure. Prolonged postoperative use is a promising alternative to narcotics."

It is important to distinguish between impairment and disability. Physical impairment is objective structural limitation; disability is the resulting loss of function. Disability can be assessed by the patient's report of restriction in activities of daily living: bending and lifting, sitting, standing, walking, traveling, socializing, sleep, sex, and putting on or taking off footwear. Detailed statistical analysis of 480 patients identified the most important elements of lumbar impairment as the anatomic and time patterns of pain, lumbar flexion, straight leg raising, neurologic signs, previous surgery, and spinal fractures. Methods of examination need to be improved. An anatomic chart is provided to calculate impairment in the individual patient.

In the group with recurrent or continual low-back pain (17 boys and 21 girls), the boys were over 4 cm taller than those in the control group. In both sexes sagittal mobility was decreased in lumbar extension and straight leg raising, and increased in lumbar flexion. Endurance strength in the abdominal and back muscles was decreased compared to the control pupils, who reported no back pain at all in the questionnaire collected 1 year before the testing procedure. The pupils reporting sciatica (n = 7) at some time, in addition to recurrent low-back pain, had decreased lumbar flexion and side bending compared to those with recurrent low-back pain (n = 31) without sciatica.

CD007431,0,124641,0,Low back pain with femoral neuritis.,"In 465 patients treated surgically for low back and lower extremity disability, almost 10 per cent had femoral rather than sciatic distribution of pain. The average age of patients who had a primarily femoral distribution of pain is higher by a decade than those who had a predominantly sciatic distribution of pain; the higher level of the lesion and greater incidence of apophyseal joint arthritis may be associated with the aging process. The femoral distribution of pain may lead to difficulties in differential diagnosis between a spinal origin and a hip or knee origin of the problem. Radiculopathy causing femoral pain may be the result of both disk degeneration with protrusion and apophyseal arthritis with synovitis. Neuritis of the L4 nerve root is more commonly the result of a lesion at the L4-5 nerve root foramen than centrally at the L3-4 disk level. The syndrome of low back pain with femoral neuritis is not uncommon 5 or more years after an otherwise successful L4-S1, two level spine fusion. This syndrome can result from an L3-4 disk protrusion with nerve root neuritis but may be a reflex disturbance from the posterior arch structures as evidenced by fusion mass, apophyseal joint or spinous process overgrowth and associated soft tissue inflammation."

No beneficial effect of either treatment was observed on several clinical outcome measures, including straight leg raising, lumbar flexion, activities of daily living, and pain. In fact the results favoured early mobilisation over bed rest and suggested that the physiotherapy and education programme was doing more harm than good. Moreover, additional analyses, which focused on clinically interesting patient subgroups, discovered no subset of patients who benefited from either of the treatments under study. Having failed to identify any clinically important benefits, or other explanations for these negative results, we can only conclude that family doctors have little reason to prescribe either bed rest or isometric exercises to patients who suffer from low back pain."

The procedure includes wide bilateral decompressive laminotomies and radical partial discectomies, partial V-ostectomy of the adjacent spinous processes, partial facetectomies of the inferior and superior articular processes, and foraminotomies as indicated. One hundred patients who underwent this procedure were evaluated by an independent examiner in follow-up an average of six years postoperatively. The patients were evaluated by utilizing a scale which included back and leg pain relief, restriction of physical activities, analgesic use, and return to work. Seventy patients were graded as good, 12 as fair, and 18 as poor. Preoperative factors which were highly significantly correlated with a good postoperative result included occupation other than heavy labor, present employment or less than 12 months of unemployment, unilateral subjective paresthesias, symptoms of spinal claudication, unilateral restriction of straight leg raising, a positive Cram or bowstring test, the severity of the myelographic defect, elevation of spinal fluid protein, and the severity of the disc pathology noted at surgery. Several other preoperative factors were noted to be of somewhat lesser significance and were correlated with a poor surgical outcome, including job-related injury, compensation or litigation, previous unsuccessful surgery, subjective weakness, calf atrophy, and sensory deficit."

Three patients experienced transient ischemic attacks. Etiologies of completed strokes were diverse and included rupture and surgical repair of aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, aortic rupture and thrombosis, global ischemia, anterior spinal artery embolism, repair and thrombosis of spinal arteriovenous malformations, hematomyelia, epidural hematoma, cervical osteophytosis, celiac plexus block, systemic lupus erythematosus, coagulopathy, and decompression sickness. Motor function improved in 12 patients, was substantial in only one, and occurred largely within the first 2 to 4 weeks. Favorable ambulatory outcome correlated with improving neurologic examinations and relatively preserved strength in hip abductors and knee extensors. More extensive deficits without initial improvement portended a more severe prognosis. Autonomic dysfunction, pain, paresthesia, and depression were common and impeded recovery in some patients. The mean level of deficit was at T-8 and in cases of global ischemia was at T-9, which leads us to dispute the classical view of a midthoracic watershed zone of ischemic vulnerability near T-4."
CD007431,0,7716310,0,[Magnetic resonance myelography. Preliminary experience].,"Three-dimensional (3D) MR Myelography is a new technique using constructive interference steady-state (CISS) sequences, which are characterized by a symmetric flow compensation enhancing CSF signal intensity compared with neural and extradural structures. 3D myelographic projections with different rotation angles are obtained from the 3D dataset with a mathematical algorithm called maximum intensity projection (MIP). Myelographic projections yield a global view of subarachnoid spaces and of root sleeves with no intrathecal contrast agent injection. This study was aimed at assessing the feasibility, the clinical value and the diagnostic accuracy of 3D MR Myelography in comparison with conventional myelography. From September 1992 to January 1994, thirty-five myelograms were performed. The study population consisted of 10 volunteers, 8 patients with traumatic brachial plexus lesions, 7 with herniated disks (4 lumbar and 3 cervical disks), 4 with sacral radicular cysts, 2 with spinal vascular malformations, 3 with extramedullary intradural neoplasms (2 cervical neuromas and 1 cervical meningioma) and 1 with an intramedullary tumor (a conus medullaris ependymoma). All patients underwent SE MRI and conventional myelography (22 lumbar injections, 3 cervical injections of nonionic iodinated contrast agent) followed by CT (CT myelography). This trial demonstrates the feasibility of 3D MR myelography in the study of the cervical and lumbar spine: its results are comparable to those obtained with conventional myelography also in some specific indications like traumatic brachial plexus injuries, where invasive conventional myelography is usually thought to be essential."

Special attention is drawn to the removal of herniated discs associated with massive spondylotic degenerative changes."
CD007431,0,8864502,0,Surgery for patients with central protruded lumbar discs who have failed conservative therapy.,"The clinical presentation and results of surgery of patients with central protruded lumbar discs have not been well defined or distinguished from studies of patients with lateral herniated discs. Many patients are denied surgical treatment, even though they are incapacitated by pain, because they do not have the classic radiographic findings seen in patients with lateral disc herniation. Sixty-three symptomatic patients with radiographically documented central lumbar disc protrusion were analysed. All patients had failed at least 6 months of conservative therapy. Although lumbar spinal pain was the most common complaint, 24 patients also presented with bilateral leg pain and 33 with unilateral leg pain; 26 had unilateral limitation of straight leg raising. An interesting observation was that unilateral symptoms and dural tension signs can be seen in patients with central disc protrusion. After surgical follow-up for a mean of 51 months, 86% achieved good results when analysed by the Prolo Functional Economic Outcome Rating Scale. It is postulated that pain is mediated by neuropeptides and arachidonic acid degradation products which are a response to mechanical annular injury."

CD007431,0,17334791,0,Modic changes following lumbar disc herniation.,"Only a small proportion (20%) of patients with LBP can be diagnosed based on a patho-anatomical entity. Therefore, the identification of relevant subgroups, preferably on a patoanatomical basis, is strongly needed. Modic changes have been described by several authors as being closely linked with LBP. The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of Modic changes, their development as well as their association to LBP, previous disc contour, and surgery in patients with previous severe sciatica. This is a longitudinal cohort study where the patients were recruited from an RCT comparing two active conservative treatments, the 181 patients, who at baseline had radicular pain in or below the knee; all underwent a physical examination and MRI. MRI's, pain history and physical examination of 166 patients were obtained at follow-up 14 months later. The prevalence of Modic changes type 1 increased from 9% at baseline to 29% at follow-up. At that time, a strong association between Modic changes and non-specific LBP was noted. Apparently, Modic changes type 1 was more strongly associated with non-specific lumbar pain than Modic changes type 2. The development of new Modic changes was closely related to the level of a previous disc herniation. A lumbar disc herniation is a strong risk factor for developing Modic changes (especially type 1) during the following year. Furthermore, Modic changes are strongly associated with LBP."
CD007431,0,3703237,0,Lumbar disc disease evaluated by myelography and postmyelography spinal computed tomography.,"Five- and ten-millimeter-thick transverse axial computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained at lumbar disc spaces in 81 patients with suspected lumbar disc disease. Scans were obtained following metrizamide myelography. CT and myelography findings were compared and correlated with clinical and surgical findings. Postmyelography CT scan was superior to myelography in 68% since it was able to demonstrate even small herniations. It was especially valuable in the L5-S1 space where the wide epidural space can hide the disc herniation without it being demonstrated by myelography. Also other kinds of pathology which may simulate or complicate disc herniation were readily evaluated by postmyelography CT. Although noncontrast CT scans are usually diagnostic and sufficient, the improved anatomical details obtained by postcontrast CT scans, increase the diagnostic accuracy, and selected, complicated cases may need the CT study with intrathecal metrizamide."
CD007431,0,3024259,0,[The value of early postoperative CT study after lumbar intervertebral disk surgery].,"The changes of the early intraspinal conditions few days after an operation of a lumbar disc herniation are little known. We, therefore, examined these operation areas by CT on a representative group of 256 patients. Besides the ""common"" findings, such as seroma, one must classify conditions such as haematomas, isolated bone fragments and/or residual disc tissue as ""unusual"" changes. The CT findings are correlated with clinical symptoms. We conducted CT and clinical follow-up studies in 91 patients several weeks later. All patients showed epidural scars of very different intensity. The comparison between early postoperative findings and the controls documents the high accuracy of the interpretation of the early postoperative states seen by CT. Therefore, it is possible to give hints for the indication for early postoperative CT examinations, for the prognosis as well as for the technique for a safe operative procedure."

CD007431,0,18391677,1,The sensitivity and specificity of the Slump and the Straight Leg Raising tests in patients with lumbar disc herniation.,"An accurate and specific diagnosis prevents the recurrences of low back pain and chronic spinal pain. The physical examination is the most useful tool to diagnosis. The examiner must aim to determine the exact tissue that pain arises from to make the specific diagnosis. Lumbar disc herniation is 1 disease that physical examination, symptoms, and findings on imaging technique do not always correlate with each other. The Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test has been used as the primary test to diagnosis lumbar disc herniations and found to have high correlation with findings on operation since its sensitivity is high in only disc herniations leading to root compression that may eventually need operation. More sensitive test, like the Slump, might be used in herniations in which the SLR is negative. The Slump test is really a variant of the SLR and the Lasègue's tests performed in the seated position and is a progressive series of maneuvers designed to place the sciatic nerve roots under increasing tension. At each step in the procedure, the patient informs the examiner what is being felt and whether radicular pain is produced. As a result, the Slump test applies traction to the nerve roots by incorporating spinal and hip joint flexion into the leg raising and would warn the examiner of the presence of nerve root compression when there is a negative SLR test."

CD007431,0,7477696,0,[Characteristic neurological signs in patients with cervical disc disease].,"In cervical radiculopathy, neurological findings for the upper extremities and the responsible level of the radices have been precisely detailed. However, in cases of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, it is not always easy to determine the responsible level of the cervical spine solely based on neurological findings. To disclose characteristic neurological lesions of the upper extremities, if any, for different locations of disc disease, 49 patients with cervical disc protrusion at single levels, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, were analyzed. Thirty-six patients demonstrated long tract signs (LTS) concomitant with segmental signs in the upper extremities, and 13 patients had no LTS. Except for deep tendon reflexes and the extent of dysesthesia in the upper extremities, there were no characteristic neurological findings, such as muscle atrophy, loss of muscle strength, extent of hypalgesia, or hypesthesia, pointing to the responsible compression site. In the 13 patients without LTS, the extent of dysesthesia and diminution of deep tendon reflexes proved to be completely in agreement with results for radiculopathy: 9 had protruded discs at the C56 level and described dysesthesia in the thumb and the index finger with deep tendon reflexes in the biceps and brachioradialis being diminished. The remaining 4 had protruded discs at the C67 level and described dysesthesia in the middle finger. Their deep tendon reflexes in the triceps were diminished. A clear contrast was observed for the patients with LTS. Four out of 36 patients had C34 protruded discs and did not complain of dysesthesia in any digits. Their deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated in all muscles in the upper extremities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,3808189,0,[Transthoracic approach and costotransversectomy in thoracic discogenic disease].,"The thoracic discogenic disease is the rarest, yet is most devastating of all disc lesions. The clinical manifestations including myelopathy and radiculopathy are not characteristic, therefore accurate radiological diagnosis has to be made by carefully performed myelography and CT, and recently by MRI. Historically conventional laminectomy has been attended with terrible results such as paraplegia. Therefore transthoracic approach and costo-transversectomy have been the procedure of choice in recent years, and these procedures can be performed safely and effectively without serious complications with help of the operating microscope. Transthoracic approach is a more decisive anterolateral operation for the central disc and the spondylotic spur in the midthoracic spine with excellent visualization of the anterior aspect of the spinal cord. On the other hand, costrotransversectomy is a less formidable posterolateral approach and it provides a reasonable exposure to the lateral disc and the enlarged facet in the lower thoracic spine. The details of the both operative procedures were discussed by using illustrations."

Twenty-five females were in the conventional therapy group (CTG) and 26 females in the manipulation therapy group (MTG). Range of motion of total flexion and extension, total side-flexion and total rotation of the lumbar spine and the straight-leg-raising test were used as criteria to determine efficacy of treatment. The results showed that while the mean treatment time for CTG subjects was 160 minutes (SD = 7.9) that for MTG patients was 121.2 (SD = 10.2) with a significant difference p less than 0.001. There were significant differences between the two groups with regards to post-treatment differences in total flexion and extension p less than 0.01; total side flexion p less than 0.05; and total rotation p less than 0.05 in favour of the MTG subjects. There was also significant difference in post-treatment straight-leg-raising values between the two groups p less than 0.05 in favour of the MTG group. It was concluded that manipulation therapy as shown by this study was superior to the conventional method in the treatment of the type of patient described."

CD007431,0,15805943,0,Long-term vertebral changes attributable to postoperative lumbar discitis: a retrospective study of six cases.,"A clinical, plain radiographic, and magnetic resonance imaging retrospective followup study was done on six patients with postoperative septic L4-L5 lumbar spondylodiscitis to identify the characteristic long-term radiographic findings predicting the clinical outcome. The mean followup was 12 years (range, 9-13 years). Three patients had moderate low-back pain and two were handicapped. One patient had slight peroneal weakness. Flexibility of the lumbar spine was restricted to some extent in all patients. Laminectomy for spinal stenosis (L4-L5) had been done in one patient and reoperation because of recurring disc herniation was done in two patients. Partial or total bone marrow depletion and corresponding enhancement of fat signals in relation to adjacent vertebral bodies, narrowing of the intervertebral disc space, and irregularity or cavitations affecting one or both end plates were long-term findings of magnetic resonance imaging. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a complete bony fusion in one patient and partial fusion in one patient. In two patients, residual disc protrusion or herniation in relation to the surgically treated disc was evident; three affecting L3-L4 and two affecting L5-S1 disc levels. Septic postoperative lumbar discitis severely hampers clinical recovery after disc operations and results in long-term changes as seen on magnetic resonance imaging scans."
CD007431,0,15805944,0,Surgical versus pharmacologic treatment of intraspinal gout.,"A controversy between pharmacologic and surgical treatment of intraspinal gout exists in the literature. If gout is diagnosed timely, pharmacologic therapy may avert the need of surgery. The lack of readily available synovial fluid makes the diagnosis particularly difficult. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical pictures and magnetic resonance imaging features in rapid differentiations of intraspinal gout. I retrospectively evaluated lumbar intraspinal tophaceous gout without the classic radiographic punched-out lesions. Four patients (average age, 65 years) had a history of hyperuricemia with multiple tophaceous deposits in the joints or visceral organs or both. The common presentations were low back pain with or without inflammatory reaction (fever, elevated C-reactive protein level, and mild leukocytosis). The patients also presented with intermittent claudication or radiculopathy of variable duration or both. The gouty tophi yielded homogeneous and hypointense masses on T1- and T2-weighted images, with multiple hypointense speckles. The masses were located in bilateral lumbar facet joints in all patients, with additional midline extension along the ligamentum flavum in three. All patients had uneventful outcomes after surgical decompression and pharmacologic treatment. Rapid deposition of tophi may aggravate nerve compression. If neurologic deficits are found, surgical decompression can provide a satisfactory outcome."

In this approach an enlargement of the intervertebral foramen is achieved by the partial excision of adjacent pedicles or excision of one or several pedicles. The access to the anterior canal wall is gained in this manner. This surgical approach has been used in 48 patients with neurological injury (spinal cord, conus medullaris, cauda equina or the roots). An active tuberculosis was the causative factor in 12 cases, the sequelae of tuberculous infection in 10 cases, infection in one case, degenerative disc disease in 12 cases, osteochondrosis in 2 cases, nucleus pulposus prolapse into the root canal in 3 cases, developmental defect of the vertebrae in 2 cases, primary or metastatic tumors in 6 cases. These conditions resulted in plegia (3 cases), spastic paresis (3 cases), caudal paresis (5 cases), root paresis (12 cases) and root syndrome (24 cases). This approach provided possibility to recognize the pathology accurately and decompress the roots.

An effective treatment of this disease is given by the microinvasive. CT controlled periradicular therapy (micro PRT). Under visibility, the tip of a canula is led directly and high precisely in close neighbourhood to the prolaps, then locally NaCl and cristaline cortisone (40 mg Volon A) is instillated. The periradicular distribution and the distribution into the epidural space is documented via contrast medium. A retrospective study with 220 patients and a prospective randomized double blind study with 40 patients (10 mg vs. 40 mg Volon A) were carried out. The average age of the retrospective collective was 53.1 +/- 12.4 years, average treatment period 18.4 weeks, and the mean follow-up 17 months. The mean value of successful treatment of lumbal spine was at 60% (spine 88.5%) with protrusion, with prolaps at 75% (spine 94%), with sequester at 94%, and with stenoses at 69% (spine 60%). With 78.8% of the patients, the percentual result was constantly good at the time of questionnaire as to the end of the treatment. 7.7% still took analgesics, 5.9% were post-operated. 1.8% of the patients made a pension application.

At 27.5% of the patients, the start of pain was about more than 5 years ago and goes back to about 23 years (72.5% had pain more than 1 year). The mean value of visits was 4 physicians per patient, and 5 months of follow-up. There is a high significant improvement in results within the group with 40 mg Volon A (p = 0.0351479). The entire improvement, subjectively estimated (visual analogical scale) within this group was at 90%. After end of therapy, 83.3% (n = 30) had stopped the taking of analgesics and the neurologic deficit decreased significantly. Furthermore, significant reduction of prolapses could be observed at 60% of the patients in both study groups (n = 156).

CD007431,0,12021944,0,Clinical features of the localized girdle sensation of mid-trunk (false localizing sign) appeared in cervical compressive myelopathy patients.,"Cervical compressive myelopathy patients sometimes show localized girdle sensation in the mid trunk (so-called false localizing sign). This symptom often confuses physicians, but the clinical features and mechanism of this symptom are still unclear. We investigated the clinical features and possible mechanism. In each of five cases of cervical compressive myelopathy disease with and without mid-truncal girdle sensation, the clinical features, degree and shape of cord compression were analysed. The girdle sensation was expressed as a vague or burning sensation, and was localized with a width of 3 or 4 dermatomes from the T3 to T11 level. There was no correlation between the appearance of the girdle sensation and etiology and level of cervical cord compression. Pyramidal tract signs and disturbance of superficial sensation were observed in all cases. Furthermore, on axial MRI, the midline ventral surface of the cervical cord was remarkably compressed in cases with girdle sensation, as if the compressive lesion entered the anterior medial fissure of the cervical cord. From these findings, this false localizing sign may be caused by severe compression of midline ventral structure of the cervical cord. Ischemia of the thoracic watershed zone of the anterior spinal artery from the compression of the anterior spinal artery at the cervical level might also be considered to be a possible cause."

CD007431,0,6886503,0,[Electromyographical study of the straight leg raising test in lumbar disc herniation].,"The straight leg raising test is one of the most reliable test for the diagnosis of the disc herniation. It is well known that the pain is produced by the increased tension of the affected root. However, the patient's response to the pain evoked by the straight leg raising test is not uniform. In some patients the leg is raised beyond the straight leg raising positive angle without resistance and some young patients show the tight hamstrings phenomenon. To elucidate these phenomena, the muscle action of erector spinae, gluteus maximus and biceps femoris evoked by this test was studied electromyographically. The results are as follows: 1) The muscle action patterns in the patients of disc herniation which are not observed in normal group are classified into four groups, namely LGB type (erector spinae, gluteus maximus and biceps femoris act), GB type (gluteus maximus and biceps femoris act), G type (gluteus maximus only acts), B type (biceps femoris only act). These abnormal muscle actions disappear under general anesthesia and are different from the actions which are recorded when the patients resist passive straight leg raising intentionally. 2) In the case of L4-5 intervertebral disc herniation mainly gluteus maximus acts as the resisting force against the passive straight leg raising. On the other hand, biceps femoris acts mainly in the case of L5-S1 disc herniation. 3) The group of younger age and less degenerated disc shows more resistance against straight leg raising and records the action potential of resisting muscles in earlier stage of the leg raising test."

Potential advantages of disc replacement over fusion include avoidance of pseudarthrosis, postoperative orthoses, and junctional degeneration. After observing satisfactory clinical results at 7-11 years' follow-up with the ProDisc first-generation implant, a second-generation prosthesis was designed. This study is a prospective analysis of the early results of total disc replacement with the ProDisc II total disc prosthesis. Fifty-three patients had single-level or multilevel disc replacement and were evaluated clinically and radiographically preoperatively and at mean 1.4-year follow-up. There were clinically and statistically significant improvements in back and leg pain Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry disability scores that were maintained at final follow-up. The clinical results of patients with single- and multilevel surgery were equivalent. Satisfactory results were achieved in 90% of patients who had previous lumbar surgery. Complications occurred in 9% of patients and included vertebral body fracture, transient radicular pain, implant malposition, and transient retrograde ejaculation. Three patients (6%) required reoperation to address complications. No mechanical failure of the implants or loosening was observed, and the prostheses retained motion.

Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), and patient satisfaction rates were evaluated at these intervals, as well as range of motion, return to work, and recreational and ambulatory status. There were 28 ProDisc patients and 11 who underwent fusion. Six patients had two-level surgery. Estimated blood loss (ProDisc = 69 mL versus fusion = 175 mL) and operative time (ProDisc = 75 minutes versus fusion = 219 minutes) were significantly different (P < 0.01). Hospital stays were shorter (ProDisc = 2.1 days versus fusion = 3.5 days [P < 0.01]) for ProDisc patients. There was a significantly greater reduction in the ODQ scores at 3 months in the ProDisc group compared with the fusion group (P < 0.05). No difference was noted in VAS. A trend was identified at 6 months in patient satisfaction rates favoring ProDisc versus fusion (P = 0.08), and motion was significantly improved in ProDisc patients compared with the fusion group (P = 0.02). Ambulatory status as well as recreational activity improved faster in the ProDisc group. The data suggest that total disc arthroplasty may be an attractive option as opposed to lumbar fusion for the surgical treatment of disabling mechanical low back pain secondary to lumbar disc disease."

Disco-CT was also the most accurate test for patients with foraminal HNP (91% compared with 71% for CT, 65% for myelo-CT, and 58% for myelography). Disc injection reproduced the patient's clinical pain pattern in only 36% of herniated discs. This test has high specificity (89%), but low sensitivity (43%). The risks from myelography followed by discography within a 72-hour period are similar to those reported for myelography alone. Disco-CT is the most accurate of these tests (P less than 0.05) for the diagnosis of lumbar HNP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD007431,0,2266369,0,Neurophysiological observations on corticospinal projections to the upper limb in subjects with Rett syndrome.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the excitability of corticospinal neurons and the integrity of their projections to the alpha motor neurons through the corticospinal tract in subjects of different ages with Rett syndrome. Electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex and cervical motor roots was used to evoke motor action potentials in the biceps brachii and hypothenar muscles. The phasic stretch reflex in the biceps brachii was also recorded to study the excitability of spinal alpha motor neurons. Motor cortex stimulation evoked motor action potentials at low threshold and with abnormally short latencies and prolonged durations. In contrast cervical motor root stimulation resulted in responses of normal latency and duration. The phasic stretch reflex had a low threshold, short latency and prolonged duration. It is concluded that in Rett syndrome the corticospinal pathway is intact. The results suggest disordered synaptic control of the Betz cell of the motor cortex and/or the spinal alpha motor neuron, although the involvement of the latter might be a consequence of dysfunction in supraspinal descending motor pathways."

CD007431,0,3496925,0,[Old age and joint disease].,"The seriousness of articular diseases in old persons is related to the loss of function and the rapid way this can lead to them being bed ridden. Rheumatoid polyarthritis is often difficult to distinguish from rhizomelic pseudopolyarthritis, these two diseases resemble each other at this age with the asthenia and loss of general health, the inflammatory pains which are peripheral and of nerve root origin. Among the metabolic arthropathies, articular chondrocalcinosis is frequent, and often latent, but sometimes it is destructive in particular in the hips and knees; septic arthritis today mainly occurs in the elderly, and the algoneurodystrophies are more frequent in old persons than in young subjects, following trauma or a hemiplegia. Arthrosis is obviously the main articular disease of senescence especially involving the joints of the lower limb, hip disease being less incapacitating than knee disease where surgical treatment is less often considered. The arthroses of the upper limbs especially of the shoulder are well tolerated. Osteochondromatosis, osteonecrosis of the internal condyle of the knee, the rapidly destructive arthropathies and hemarthrosis can develop as a complication of a simple arthrosis. In the spine vertebral hyperostosis is especially a disease of the elderly, it can occur alone or with an arthrosis of the posterior vertebral joints, a narrow spinal canal straight or narrowed. Medical treatment, physiotherapy, and finally surgery can give very satisfactory results in an old patient, avoiding loss of function, a miserable existence and becoming bed ridden."
CD007431,0,2946981,0,Dexamethasone is not superior to placebo for treating lumbosacral radicular pain.,"In a prospective double-blind study, we compared dexamethasone and placebo in 33 subjects with lumbosacral radicular pain. Of subjects with resting pain, 7/21 improved on dexamethasone, and 4/12 improved on placebo. Of subjects with pain on straight-leg raising, 8/19 improved on dexamethasone and 1/6 on placebo. Of 27 subjects evaluated 1 to 4 years after treatment, 8/16 who had received dexamethasone were asymptomatic or had only occasional mild low-back pain, compared with 7/11 who had received placebo. Thus, dexamethasone is not superior to placebo for either early or long-term relief of lumbosacral radicular pain, but may reduce pain evoked by stretch of acutely inflamed spinal nerve roots."

They conducted a retrospective study of 200 cases of patients hospitalised for sciatica who were investigated by lumbar phlebography using selective catheterisation, without any prior neuro-radiological examination. 104 of these cases were operated. The lumbar phlebography was interpretable in 99 p. cent of cases. Severe thrombo-embolic episodes occurred in two cases. In the 104 patients who went to operation, the surgical procedure confirmed the presence of a herniated disc (suspected on phlebography) in 96 p. cent of cases. Topographical agreement between the phlebographic data and the operative findings was observed in 81 p. cent of cases. Phlebography proved to be more reliable at L4-L5 than at L5-S1. In the patients in whom clinical examination and plain X-ray findings provided coherent information as to the site of the herniated disc, phlebography was considered to be of no use. In those patients for whom this examination did not provide coherent information, phlebography proved to be valuable in the topographical diagnosis of the herniated disc."

However, its value is unclear in the early detection of signs that can negatively affect that later course of surgical cases. The purpose of the present study is to describe the MR images of early postoperative MRI at 3 days in 30 unselected patients who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy, and to correlate the findings with follow up MRI at 8 weeks and with final outcome. The findings are correlated with literature data. Early postoperative MRI findings were consisting of pseudohernia in 24 patients (80%), annular rent in 23 patients (80%), and other non-specific postoperative findings. On the late MRI the pseudohernia persisted in 12 patients (50%), the annular rent in 4 patients (15%) and asymptomatic pseudo-spondylodiscitis was apparent in 3 patients (10%) as was a case of true spondylodiscitis. Therefore, early postoperative findings have limited value in the management of patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation, since the images were not correlated with the immediate clinical course after surgery nor with the late radiological and clinical outcome. The evident imaging changes in the early postoperative period after lumbar disc surgery limit the accuracy of the interpretation of MRI examinations."

CD007431,0,123655,0,Capillary resistance and back pain.,"A rapid clinical and epidemiological method of grading Capillary Resistance (CR) based on the appearance of petechiae following negative pressure on the skin of the forearm is described, and the results of testing 469 postmen aged 22 to 63 years are given. CR is shown to be increased in men who have had back pain within 24 hours of testing and no difference was found between men who had had back pain in the past and those who denied ever having had back pain. A separate series of 35 post-laminectomy patients examined at least 10 months after operation and who were shown to have disc disease at operation and/or on myelogram were found to have low CR. This work suggests that the changes involved in disc disease are not limited solely to the discs, but may involve collagen/elastic tissue or ground substance elsewhere as for example in this case when detectable in a test on the forearm. Secondly, it is suggested that CR grading could be a helpful discriminating test for 'disc disease' among those presenting with back pain of undetermined diagnosis."

We undertook this study to evaluate the usefulness of this modality in diagnosing low back pain of uncertain etiology.
CD007431,0,11931066,0,Proinflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with disc herniation and sciatica.,"Proinflammatory cytokines have been identified in herniated intervertebral discs in humans, and such cytokines have experimentally been demonstrated to be important in the pathophysiological mechanisms of disc herniation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta IL-6, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were investigated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in 39 patients with lumbar disc herniation and sciatica. Pain duration and pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) were recorded at inclusion, and a clinical examination was performed evaluating neurological findings. The extent of disc herniation (protrusion or extrusion/sequestration) was evaluated perioperatively. Normal concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were present in CSF and serum in almost all patients with lumbar disc herniation. The concentrations of IL-8 in CSF were increased in 12 out of 39 patients, and these increased levels of IL-8 correlated to a short duration of pain and to more pronounced herniation (extrusion or sequestration). No relationship between IL-8 concentrations in CSF and pain intensity, positive neurological findings or a positive straight leg-raising (SLR) test was found. The observation of increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF in patients with a short duration of symptoms supports the concept of the initial involvement of inflammatory mechanisms after a disc herniation. The finding that most of the patients with increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF had an extrusion or a sequestration may suggest that the increase in IL-8 is related to mechanical nerve root compression, but may also indicate a biochemical effect exerted by the herniated disc on the surrounding tissue. Further studies on the potential role of IL-8 as a biomarker for disc herniation are warranted."

Clinical features, diagnostic procedures, and results of surgical treatment in 68 patients.","Our experience with 68 patients with strictly defined, myelographically proven, surgically confirmed lumbar spinal stenosis seen over a 30-month period was reviewed. Pseudoclaudication was the commonest symptom (94%) and was described by patients as pain (93%), numbness (63%), or weakness (43%). Symptoms were frequently bilateral (68%) and generally relieved by flexing the lumbosacral spine. Neurologic abnormalities were found in a minority of patients and were usually mild. Electromyography showed one or more lumbosacral radiculopathies in 34 of 37 patients examined. Radiographic evidence of degenerative disk or joint disease was found in 63 patients. All patients had stenosis on myelography, with narrowing at L2, L3, and L4 being the commonest; 30% had multi-level stenosis. Two of ten computed tomograms were normal.

CD007431,0,11931063,1,Cramp finding: can it be used as a new diagnostic and prognostic factor in lumbar disc surgery?,"In this prospective study, the validity and the importance of a new finding (cramp finding) in the diagnosis and outcome after lumbar disc surgery were tested. The test is performed with the person in prone position. Against a forceful knee flexion, the examiner holds the leg with one hand and applies a force to overcome the knee flexion. The finding is positive if the examined person feels a disturbing cramp in the leg or thigh. The study was performed between October 1997 and December 1999. Besides the cramp finding, the classical disc herniation examination, including mechanical and neurological findings, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging tests, and laboratory findings were checked pre- and postoperatively. The positive cramp finding in the operated group was 72% (n=133) preoperatively and straight leg raising (SLR) test was positive in all of them. Cramp finding was positive in 70%, 52%, 34%, and 8% of patients postoperatively in the first, 3rd, 12th and 24th months, respectively. The presented finding appears to be as valuable as the SLR, and especially contralateral SLR, tests in lumbar disc surgery. Cramp finding is also important in outcome evaluation."
CD007431,0,11931062,0,Diagnostic validity of somatosensory evoked potentials in subgroups of patients with sciatica.,"The diagnostic utility of scalp-recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in patients with sciatica has generally been regarded as low. The purpose of the present study was to determine the validity of sensory nerve SEP in different subgroups of sciatic patients. A total of 65 consecutive patients with sciatica showing disc pathology and/or facet joint hypertrophy on lumbar computed tomography (CT) and/or myelography were studied. Symptomatic myelographically compressed nerve roots were defined as truly compromised roots. Asymptomatic myelographically normal nerve roots were defined as truly normal roots. Bilateral sensory nerve SEP representing nerve roots L4, L5, and S1 were performed in all patients. Evaluation of SEP included the use of P1 latency inter-root comparison. The false-positive rate of SEP was low. Pathological L4, L5, and S1 SEP therefore strongly indicate true compromise of the corresponding nerve roots. The true-positive rate was higher in patients with facet joint hypertrophy with or without additional disc disease than in patients with disc pathology only, and highest if the sciatic sensory symptoms were present during the SEP registration. Diagnostic validity was not influenced by previous episodes of sciatica, the duration of the present episode, or the number of spinal levels with ipsilateral myelographically compressed nerve roots. Pathological SEP strongly indicate sensory radiculopathy in patients with sciatica. Diagnostic efficacy is higher in patients with facet joint hypertrophy than in patients with disc pathology only and highest when the sciatic symptoms are present during registration."
CD007431,0,11931060,0,Microendoscopic lumbar discectomy versus open surgery: an intraoperative EMG study.,"This study investigated electromyographic (EMG) activity as a marker of nerve root irritation during two different surgical procedures for lumbar disc herniation. Mechanically elicited EMG activity was recorded during the dynamic stages of surgery in muscle groups innervated by lumbar nerve roots. Confirmation of surgical activity was correlated with the activity of the electromyogram. Fifteen patients with lumbar disc herniations were treated via an endoscopic medial approach, and 15 patients via the open microscopic surgical technique. Results indicated that the endoscopic technique was superior to the open surgical technique and produced less irritation of the nerve root. Significantly less mechanically elicited activity was recorded during both the approach and the root mobilization. The study showed that microendoscopic discectomy allows a smaller incision and less tissue trauma with comparable visualization of the nerve structures than does open surgery."

It was found that disturbances of the vibration sensation occurred significantly more frequently than disturbances of surface sensitivity, and their character suggested that they were a more specific sign of damage to the innervation of the spine than segmental disturbances of superficial sensitivity which are due to root damage."
CD007431,0,11931068,0,Thermal quantitative sensory testing in lumbar disc herniation.,"The most frequent clinical presentation of sciatica suggests injury of sensor root fibers alone. To evaluate whether thermal quantitative sensory testing (QST) is applicable in the study of sensory dysfunction in lumbosacral disc herniations, 36 men and 30 women with L4/5 or L5/S1 disc herniations underwent thermal QST of the L4, L5, and Si dermatomes. For both levels of disc herniation, there was a significant difference for all temperature modalities, i.e., cold, warmth and heat pain, between all dermatomes as well as between the side of the herniated disc and the corresponding asymptomatic side. However, the proportion of herniated discs classified correctly was only 48% in patients with disc herniations at the L4/5 level, while it was 71% at the L5/S1 level. We conclude that thermal QST measurements reflect and document sensory dysfunction in patients with lumbosacral disc herniation. The method offers a new means both to study the time course of a spontaneous recovery of sensory dysfunction and to evaluate the result of different treatment options. However, thermal QST seems to have the same poor predictive value for identifying the anatomic location of a herniated lumbar disc as conventional electrophysiologic methods."

CD007431,0,15457335,0,Vrms/T quantitation in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.,"Thirty consecutive patients with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with lumbosacral root injury were evaluated. Electrodiagnostic examinations included determination of root mean square (Vrms)/turns (T) values. Vrms/T values > or =1 are consistent with chronic neurogenic injury and have been correlated with increase in fiber density. Radiographic studies were independently classified as having severe (group I; n= 8), mild (group II; n=11), or no lumbar spinal stenosis (group III; n=11). Abnormal Vrms/T values were present in all 8 patients in group I in comparison to 0/11 in group II and 2/11 in group III (p<0.0001 and 0.0007 respectively in comparison to group I). In 5/8 patients in group I, Vrms/T values provided unique information. Large amplitude motor units were also present more frequently in group I in comparison to the other groups (p<0.02). This study indicates Vrms/T values can be helpful in the electrodiagnostic evaluation of patients with lumbosacral radiculopathies, particularly where chronic multilevel radicular injury might be expected such as in lumbar spinal stenosis."

Such techniques do not enable any clear diagnosis to be made before the 3rd postoperative week. The PMN elastase released from stimulated polymorphonuclear granulocytes has been proved to be a good laboratory parameter by which it is possible to prognosticate bacterial and abacterial organ complications in surgical patients with a high degree of probability. Under investigation were 12 patients with spondylodiscitis out of 1162 operations on herniated lumbar discs. PMN elastase was determined on the 7th postoperative day. In patients with spondylodiscitis and a mean value of 110.5 micrograms/l, the elastase was on average higher by a factor of 2.6 as compared to 88 randomly selected control patients. Since spondylodiscitis is a rare complication, this results in a positive value of only 7%, which does not allow a reliable diagnosis of spondylodiscitis by the elastase assay. But because the negative predictive value is 100%, it is possible to exclude a postoperative spondylodiscitis already on the 7th postoperative day, if the elastase value is normal."

Forty-five consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed lumbosacral radiculopathy served as disease controls. Of the 110 SN patients, 32 were classified clinically as SN with large-fiber involvement (SN-LFI), whereas 78 had clinically pure small-fiber SN. Plantar NAP amplitudes were abnormal in 18 of 32 patients (56%) with SN-LFI, and 15 of 78 (19%) with small-fiber SN. A SRAR <0.21 (fifth percentile of normal) was found in 7 of 32 patients (22%) with SN-LFI and 8 of 78 (10%) with small-fiber SN. In the control group, the medial plantar NAP was normal in all 45 subjects (100%), whereas the SRAR was >0.21 in 43 subjects (96%). Thus, for a 50% pretest probability of SN-LFI, the positive predictive value of an abnormal medial plantar was 100% versus 85% for a SRAR <0.21. The medial plantar NAP amplitude is a more useful measure of SN, than is the SRAR, in patients under age 70, with suspected SN-LFI. The yield of the SRAR and plantar NAP amplitude is poor when clinical signs of large-fiber sensory dysfunction are lacking."

CD007431,0,11819133,0,Factors predicting the prognosis of lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation.,"This study was designed to determine the prognostic factors in unilateral lumbar radiculopathy due to herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP); this was done by prospectively investigating the clinical course of consecutive patients with HNP. The study population consisted of 131 patients who complained primarily of unilateral leg pain, and who were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to establish a definite diagnosis. Patients with a questionable diagnosis were excluded. The initial assessment was done within the first 2 months of presentation, according to conventional surgical indications. Surgery was performed only in patients who gave their informed consent for the procedure. Questionnaires were sent to patients twice, in 1994 and 1996, to assess the clinical outcome in those patients who did not meet the surgical indications and in those who met the indications, but who refused surgery. Clinical outcomes were classified into three categories based on the patients' own assessment. Fifty patients met the surgical indication criteria, and 25 were actually operated on. Neither these patients' profiles nor their MRI findings correlated with the results of the initial assessment. Patient age was significantly correlated with outcome only at the time of the first follow-up. The type of HNP and the result of the initial assessment were correlated with outcome at the times of both follow-ups, but the significance of these correlations had decreased at the second follow-up. In conclusion, initial assessment and type of HNP on MRI are major prognostic factors. However, the conventional manner of treatment selection is inadequate for the appropriate management of lumbar disc herniation."
CD007431,0,8476547,0,Segmental v dermatomal somatosensory-evoked potentials. Normal intertrial variation and side-to-side comparison.,"Although segmental and dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials have been used in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy, the unilateral or bilateral normal intertrial variation of these responses has not been investigated. Furthermore, there exists little consensus on how many sequential trials for a single nerve or dermatome are optimal and how to use the data generated from these trials. Without investigation of these basic parameters, determination of what constitutes a normal somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) is difficult. In 29 normal subjects, the ipsilateral intertrial variations, arithmetic mean side-to-side differences and maximum potential side-to-side differences with stimulation of the superficial peroneal sensory nerve, sural nerve and L5 and S1 dermatomes with respect to P1 and N1 latencies and peak-to-peak amplitudes were investigated. Considerable ipsilateral intertrial variation was observed and side-to-side comparisons revealed a further increase in this inherent variation regarding the above measured parameters. The maximum potential side-to-side differences were even more remarkable than the mean side-to-side differences. For these results and others presented, a method of evaluating SEP parameters whereby the arithmetic mean of two sequential trials for both latency and amplitude is presented that attempts to minimize the normal, inherent variation. We also suggest an additional parameter with which to evaluate SEPs: the maximum side-to-side latency difference. Only through the use of a consistent methodology can segmental or dermatomal SEPs be utilized in a reliable diagnostic manner."

ADCON-L European Study Group.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of any correlation between recurrent radicular pain during the first six months following first surgery for herniated lumbar intervertebral disc and the amount of lumbar peridural fibrosis as defined by MR imaging. 197 patients who underwent first-time single-level unilateral discectomy for lumbar disc herniation were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled multicenter clinical trial. Clinical assessments, performed by physicians blinded to patient treatment status, were conducted preoperatively and at one and six months postoperatively. The enhanced MR images of the operative site utilized in the analysis were obtained at six months postoperatively. Radicular pain was recorded by the patient using a validated visual analog pain scale in which 0 = no pain and 10 = excruciating pain. The data obtained at the 6 month time point were analyzed for an association between amount of peridural scars as measured by MR imaging and clinical failure as defined by the recurrence of radicular pain. The results showed that the probability of recurrent pain increases when scar score increases. Patients having extensive peridural scar were 3.2 times more likely to experience recurrent radicular pain than those patients with less extensive peridural scarring. In conclusion, this prospective, controlled, randomized, blinded, multicenter study has demonstrated that there is a significant association between the presence of extensive peridural scar and the occurrence of recurrent radicular pain."
CD007431,0,1030453,0,Shoulder muscle tenderness and physical features of female industrial workers.,"Physique, muscle strength, and jump-step scores of female industrial workers, ages 17--34, were studied in relation to tenderness of shoulder muscles for five groups, (A) character display operators, (B) fluorescent lamp assemblers, (C) photographic film rolling workers, (D) teachers and nurses of handicapped children, and (E) office workers. No significant differences were found between the five groups in mean body height, body weight, and skinfold thickness, but mean knee extension force of groups A and C and mean back muscle strength of groups A, B, and C was significantly lower than that of group E. Workers of groups C and D with a low tenderness threshold of m. trapezius of 0.6 kg/cm2 or less had stiff shoulders more frequently and lower force levels of knee extension, back muscle, and upper arm abduction than those without tenderness. No similar tendency was found for groups B and E. Further, among workers with objective signs of occupational cervicobrachial disorder, there were few whose knee extension force or jump-step scores were above the averages of normal office workers. Shoulder muscles of such operators were revealed to be continuously contracted during operations. The possible effects of chronic fatigue due to repetitive operations on developing localized tenderness and occupational hazards are discussed."

CD007431,0,12592544,0,Predictors of outcome in fusion surgery for chronic low back pain. A report from the Swedish Lumbar Spine Study.,"Despite the continuous development of surgical techniques and implants, a substantial number of patients still undergo surgery for chronic low back pain (CLBP) without any benefit, or even become worse. With the aim of finding predictors of functional and work status outcome, 264 patients with severe CLBP of long duration, randomised to surgical or non-surgical treatment, were characterized by socio-demographic, clinical, radiological and psychological variables. The variables were estimated as predictors of outcome at the 2-year follow-up. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used in both treatment groups. We found that a personality characterized by low neuroticism and low disc height were significant predictors of functional improvement after surgical treatment. Depressive symptoms predicted functional improvement after non-surgical treatment. Work resumption was predicted by low age and short sick leave in the surgical group, and by short sick leave in the non-surgical group. We conclude that improved selection of successful surgical candidates with CLBP seems to be promoted by attention to severe disc degeneration, evaluation of personality traits and shortening of preoperative sick leave."
CD007431,0,12592546,0,Temporary external pedicular fixation versus definitive bony fusion: a prospective comparative study on pain relief and function.,"Temporary external pedicular fixation is used as a prognostic instrument when treating degenerative conditions with spinal fusion. We studied the validity of the method and whether a functional test could improve the prognostic value of such fixation. Twenty-six patients with long-standing lumbar pain had an external temporary fixation. Pain levels were registered before fixation on a visual analogue scale at rest, as a mean for the previous week, and at seven different standardized activities. Walking capacity and walking speed for a standardized distance were also measured. Identical evaluations were then repeated during the external fixation and 1 year after definitive fusion. Based on the outcome of the temporary fixation, 20 patients were recommended for definitive surgical fusion. In six cases, the option of fusion surgery was rejected due to an unfavourable pain response or insufficient pain relief during the test fixation period, and this group was not further followed within the study. One year after surgery, 14 of 20 patients reported a good outcome. Solid bony fusion assessed by conventional radiography was seen in 19 patients. One patient with a poor clinical outcome had a pseudarthrosis. The mean values for pain level at rest, during last week and at the seven different activities in the functional test tended to decrease after fusion compared to the situation with temporary external fixation. In no activity did the external fixator overestimate the mean positive pain-relieving effect after definitive fusion. The walking capacity significantly increased, while the walking speed did not alter at the three different measurements. We conclude that with a good outcome ratio of 14 patients out of 19 having a solid fusion, the external frame improved patient selection and can be used as a valid prognostic instrument. The pain relief and function after definitive fusion can not be quantified by the external fixation, probably due to the fact that the stabilisation with an external frame is partial. The value of the functional test design presented is moderate, and an outcome evaluation comprising pain relief at rest and mean pain level during a week in fixation seems adequate."

CD007431,0,3782560,0,Effects of chemonucleolysis demonstrated by MR imaging.,"In a study designed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients to be treated with chymopapain, 39 patients with a clinicoradiographic picture of herniated lumbar disk were scanned. Twenty-one of these, who were actually treated, were rescanned 3 months following the intradiskal administration of chymopapain. In both pretreatment and posttreatment scans sagittal T1 and T2 weighted spinecho technique was used. Prior to therapy, disks that were later injected demonstrated narrowing of the intervertebral disk space (95% of cases); an extradural defect (86% of cases); diminished signal intensity on the T1 weighted images (50% of cases); and decreased signal intensity on the T2 weighted image when compared with normal controls (100% of cases). Additionally, the adjacent endplates of the injected disk showed increased signal intensity on the T1 weighted image in 32%; 18% of the cases displayed increased signal intensity on the T2 weighted image. Following chymopapain, 100% of injected disks demonstrated decrease in disk height; 36% of the extradural defects diminished in size and 9% increased; 91% of injected disks showed loss of signal intensity on the T1 weighted image; and 86% lost signal in the T2 weighted study with 14% remaining unchanged. Vertebral body endplates adjacent to the level of injection demonstrated a decreased signal intensity on the T1 weighted image in 32% of cases, and 40% demonstrated increased signal in the T2 weighted study. Even though these findings could not be correlated with clinical success or failure using the criteria in this study, six of the original 39 patients were diagnosed as having free disk fragments on the basis of their initial MR scans, a fact that does have management implications for the use of chymopapain in treatment of herniated disk disease."
CD007431,0,4061922,0,Epidural morphine strongly depresses nociceptive flexion reflexes in patients with postoperative pain.,"The comparative effects of low doses (0.03-0.04 mg/kg) of epidural morphine on a nociceptive flexion reflex of the lower limb and on postoperative pain in volunteer patients were studied after orthopedic surgery on one knee. According to the stimulation parameters, it was found that 40-50 min after the injection, morphine produced an increase of 87% and 83% of the reflex threshold and of the threshold of maximal reflex response, respectively, as well as a 80-90% depression of the nociceptive responses when elicited by a constant level of stimulation. Onset of pain relief occurred by the 25th min and increased to a maximum stable level 40-50 min after the injection. These data support the hypothesis that the main site of the pain-relieving effect of epidural morphine is located directly at a spinal level."
CD007431,0,11572192,0,Neurophysiological investigation of cervical spondylosis.,"The difficulties in diagnosing spinal cord lesions due to the cervical spondylosis is well-known in clinical neurology. In order to investigate the contribution of various neurophysiological examinations in the diagnosis in cervical spondylosis, we examined 70 patients suffering from cervical spondylosis, with peripheral nerve conduction studies, F-wave from the upper limb and electromyography from the corresponding muscles, as well as somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) from upper and lower limbs. Patients were separated into four groups: 20 patients had cervical spondylosis symptoms only; 15 patients had symptoms and signs of spinal root involvement; 15 patients had symptoms and signs of myelopathy; and 20 patients had symptoms and signs of both myelopathy and spinal root involvement. A group of 20 normal controls was also studied. In all groups of patients SEPs were the most sensitive electrophysiological study. Low-amplitude N13 and increased conduction time of N9-N13 and central conduction N13-N19 and LP-P27 were the most common finding in SSEP testing. SEPs were affected in many cases without CT-MRI findings of spinal cord pressure. From the above findings, SEPs proved to be the most sensitive diagnostic investigation in cervical spondylosis."
CD007431,0,7645156,0,Urodynamic evaluation of stress incontinence.,"A careful history points the urodynamic examination in the right direction and enables the examiner to ask the correct questions. The individual who does the test is the only reliable interpreter of the results of that study. No urodynamic technique is as sensitive or specific as a blood glucose, or even an electrocardiogram. A history of urgency and urge incontinence suggests uninhibited contractility and is a better index of that condition than a cystometrogram. Leakage occurring shortly after a previous operative procedure for stress incontinence suggests type III stress incontinence. A past history of radiation, prior pelvic surgery, neurologic disease, herniated disc conditions, or prior chemotherapy all require a simple cystometrogram to rule out abnormal bladder compliance. Following a simple history and urodynamic evaluation, a physical examination should be performed, searching for urethra hypermobility and genital prolapse. Abdominal leak-point pressure testing is useful to assign broad categories of incontinence. Relatively high leak-point pressures with hypermobility suggest suspension operations will be effective. Low leak-point pressures with hypermobility often require a sling, and very low leak-point pressures with no hypermobility indicate a suitable candidate for a trial of injection therapy."

CD007431,0,17973128,0,Pain and disability correlated with disc degeneration via magnetic resonance imaging in scoliosis patients.,"Prior imaging studies of scoliosis patients attempted to demonstrate a relationship between plain radiographic curve patterns and curve progression and pain, or used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to focus on spinal cord abnormalities. Pain in scoliosis patients may differ from nondeformity patients, yet may still be discogenic. The purpose of this study was to assess the possible relationship of degenerative disc findings on MRI to scoliosis patients' pain. This prospective study enrolled scoliosis and control patients, all of whom had assessment for back pain (visual analog scale) and disability (Oswestry Index) and spinal MRI to identify prevalence and distribution of degenerative disc findings. Specifically, we assessed 60 consecutive pediatric and adult idiopathic scoliosis patients who had progressed to surgical treatment, 60 age- and gender-matched asymptomatic controls, and 172 nondeformity symptomatic degenerative disc disease patients who had progressed to surgical treatment. All subjects had independent analysis of their preoperative MRI for disc degeneration, disc herniation, Schmorl's nodes, and inflammatory end plate changes. Imaging findings of the scoliosis patients were compared to those from asymptomatic and symptomatic control groups. Our results found that both pediatric and adult scoliosis patients had significantly more pain and disability than did asymptomatic controls (P < 0.001). The adult idiopathic scoliosis patients had pain and disability similar to those of surgical degenerative disc disease control groups. Disc degeneration and herniation (contained) were not related to pain. However, in the pediatric scoliosis patients, those with Schmorl's nodes often had greater pain than those without (P = 0.01). Adults with painful scoliosis, typically occurring at the apex of the scoliosis or at the lumbosacral junction, had a significantly higher frequency of inflammatory end plate changes on MRI than did controls (P < 0.001). Prior studies have demonstrated a correlation of inflammatory end plate changes to lumbar discogenic pain. In conclusions, scoliosis patients who have progressed to surgical intervention, pediatric patients have varying degrees of pain, and those with Schmorl's nodes may be at greater risk for pain. Adult scoliosis patients have multifactorial pain of which one component may be related to degeneration of the lower lumbar discs similar to that in nondeformity patients. Additionally, adult scoliosis patients may have MRI findings consistent with discogenic pain at the apex of their curvature, most commonly at the proximal lumbar levels."
CD007431,0,6410817,0,Myelopathy due to ossification or calcification of the ligamentum flavum: radiologic and histologic evaluations.,"The clinical, radiologic, and histologic features of ossification and calcification of the ligamentum flavum were studied in 18 patients. Ossification (15 patients) usually occurred in the lower thoracic spine in men of various ages, while calcification (three patients) was found exclusively in the cervical region of older women. Histologic examinations of ossification showed mature lamellar bone associated with proliferated cartilage replacing the ligamentum flavum (endochondral ossification). This corresponded well with radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) appearances. In the cases with calcification of the ligamentum flavum, calcification within the degenerated ligamentous fibers was observed on histologic examination, and correlated well with an oval nodular density on radiographs and CT. The two conditions differ in clinical, radiologic, and histologic considerations. Pathomechanisms in the development of these lesions and clinical significance are also discussed."

CD007431,0,9455668,0,Spinal manipulation results in immediate H-reflex changes in patients with unilateral disc herniation.,"The aim of this clinical investigation was to determine whether the abnormal H-reflex complex present in patients with S1 nerve root compression due to lumbosacral disc herniation is improved by single-session lumbar manipulation. Twenty-four patients with unilateral disc herniation at the L5-S1 level underwent spinal H-reflex electro-physiological evaluation. This was carried out before and after single-session lumbar manipulation in the side-lying position. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study were: predominant sciatica, no motor or sphincteric involvement, unilateral disc herniation at the L5-S1 level on CT or MR imaging, age between 20 and 50 years. H-reflex responses were recorded bilaterally from the gastrosoleous muscle following stimulation of tibial sensory fibers in the popliteal fossa. H-reflex amplitude in millivolts (HR-A) and H-reflex latency in milliseconds (HR-L) were measured from the spinal reflex response. Pre- and post-manipulation measurements were compared between the affected side and the healthy side. Statistical evaluation was performed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test (SPSS). Thirteen patients displayed abnormal H-reflex parameters prior to lumbar manipulation, indicating an S1 nerve root lesion. The mean amplitude was found to be significantly lower on the side of disc herniation than on the normal, healthy side (P = 0.0037). Following manipulation, the abnormal HR-A increased significantly on the affected side while the normal HR-A on the healthy side remained unchanged (P = 0.0045). There was a significant difference between latencies on the affected side and those on the healthy side (P = 0.003). Following manipulation there was a trend toward decreased HR-L. However, this trend did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.3877). Eight patients displayed no H-reflex abnormalities before or after manipulation. Their respective HR-A and HR-L values did not change significantly following manipulation. Three additional patients were excluded due to technical difficulties in achieving manipulation or measuring spinal reflex. These observations may lend physiological support for the clinical effects of manipulative therapy in patients with degenerative disc disease."
CD007431,0,15799188,0,Is there a clinical correlate to the histological and radiological evidence of inflammation in trans-ligamentous extruded and sequestered lumbar disc herniaton?,"The pain of lumbar disc herniation is related to direct compression of the nerve root and to the foreign-body inflammatory response to the herniated disc material. In this study, we attempted to identify disc-related inflammation in trans-ligamentous extruded and sequestered lumbar disc herniation using gadolinium-DPTA-enhanced T1-weighted and short-time inversion recovery (STIR) magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed how these results related to each other, and to patients' clinical status, and to immunohistochemistry findings in disc specimens removed at surgery. Forty-one patients with trans-ligamentous extruded or sequestered disc herniation were investigated clinically and radiologically. Twenty-five patients who did not respond to initial medical treatment or who had progressive neurological deficits underwent discectomy. Specimens of disc material removed during surgery were studied immunohistochemically and inflammatory cell types were identified. The other 16 patients showed good response to treatment, and were given further medical therapy and monitored for a mean of 6.3 months of follow-up. All radiological diagnoses in the operated cases were confirmed at surgery. There were no significant differences among the rates of detection of inflammation by contrast MRI, STIR technique, and immunohistochemistry in the surgical treated cases. In the medically treated cases, the frequency of radiological evidence of inflammation on the initial contrast enhanced T1-weighted and STIR images was similar to the frequency observed on the most recent scans done during follow-up. The study showed that the radiological and immunohistochemical evidence of inflammation in these cases does not correspond with patients' clinical pain profiles over time. It also revealed that STIR and contrast T1W are equally reliable for detecting inflammation in trans-ligamentous extruded or sequestered lumbar disc herniation. In future, studies that focus on physical and chemical mechanisms of pain in lumbar disc herniation in larger series of conservatively and surgically treated patients may clarify the link between inflammation and radicular pain in these types of disc herniation."

They were evaluated according to a protocol and treated with corticosteroid and praziquantel. The disease, in general, presented as a lower cord syndrome of acute progression characterized by motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunctions. The severity of the clinical picture was different among the patients, but the symptoms were quite constant. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an inflammatory pattern with or without eosinophils and/or IgG against schistosomal antigens. The most frequent alterations detected by imaging methods were enlargement of the medullary cone and of the roots of the cauda equina. Schistosome egg counts suggested a low parasite burden in 71.6% of the cases. Outcome was favorable in 38 (60.3%) patients and improvement usually started within the first 48 h after commencing on corticoid and was faster during the early period of treatment."

However, it is not known whether quantitative measurements of the spinal canal or herniated disc are sensitive and specific for low back-related leg pain. The size and cross-sectional area of the dural sac and any herniated discs were measured from magnetic resonance imaging examinations of 22 asymptomatic individuals and 44 patients with sciatica. The sensitivity and specificity of these measurements were determined. In this small population of patients, a dural sac anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 10.2 mm at the L3-4, L4-5, or L5-S1 vertebral levels was 74% sensitive and 74% specific for leg pain. Based on measurements in symptomatic patients, a herniated disc with an AP diameter of approximately 3 mm was over 95% sensitive and 95% specific. However, if the AP diameters of herniated discs in symptomatic patients were compared with similar measurements in asymptomatic controls, the most sensitive and specific threshold value was 6.8 mm. These findings must be confirmed in a larger population before they are applied clinically. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2000;12:439-443."

Weak trunk extensors were associated with a history of sciatica, weak trunk flexors with back injuries and with current backache at work/exercise. Weak leg extensors showed associations with a history of low back insufficiency and of sick leave due to the back and with current hip pain. Men with a history of lumbago and of hip and knee complaints performed poorly during 12 min of running.

Massive epidural scarring with no coexistent pathologic condition was found in every patient, and adhesive arachnoiditis was noted in three. The common clinical presentation consisted of low-back pain and sciatica, and radicular pain was usually a continuation or a recurrence of the preoperative sciatic pain. Neurologic deficits were mild, and no patients with the classic picture of adhesive arachnoiditis were found. Myelographic patterns did not disclose any correlation with the clinical symptoms. Five myelograms were normal, while six others simulated a recurrent disc herniation. The results of scar excision were good in 13 patients, fair in eight, and a failure in 17."

CD007431,0,10708995,0,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy of the Knee.,"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) of the knee frequently does not present with the classic combination of signs and symptoms seen in the upper extremity. Pain out of proportion to the initial injury is the hallmark symptom. Symptom relief by sympathetic block is the current standard for confirmation of the diagnosis. Because invasive diagnostic procedures, such as arthroscopy, are likely to increase symptoms, evaluation with a noninvasive diagnostic modality, such as magnetic resonance imaging, is preferred. Generally, RSD should be treated before surgical intervention to correct any underlying intra-articular pathologic condition. However, surgery may sometimes be necessary before RSD symptoms resolve; in these cases, use of intra- and postoperative continuous epidural block can be successful. The initial treatment of RSD of short duration should be conservative; physical therapy modalities, including exercise and contrast baths, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are indicated. In the authors' experience, an indwelling epidural block using bupivacaine for several days followed by use of a narcotic agent, combined with functional rehabilitation, is the most effective management when noninvasive treatment has failed. Surgical sympathectomy can be successful, but should be reserved until repeated lumbar sympathetic block or more than one trial of inpatient epidural block has failed. Early diagnosis and early institution of treatment (prior to 6 months) are the most favorable prognostic indicators in the management of RSD."

CD007431,0,1915902,0,Isolated iliac aneurysms.,"Isolated iliac aneurysms are relatively infrequent, often difficult to detect and therefore rarely considered in the differential diagnosis. Because of their close anatomical relationship to the ureters, bladder, colon, pelvic veins, femoral and sciatic nerve roots one is often misled. The consequences can be grave; chronic ureteric obstruction for instance can cause damage to one or both kidneys. With the growing frequency of tube grafting for aortic aneurysms it becomes increasingly important to consider the prevalence and incidence of isolated iliac aneurysms. The aim of this study is to report the incidence, clinical course and outcome of these lesions. In a consecutive series of 678 aorto-iliac aneurysms in the years 1972-1988 there were 53 isolated iliac aneurysms (7%) ranging in size from 3.5-14 cm whereas the reported incidence in the literature lies between 1-2%; the prevalence in consecutive autopsy series is even less than 1%. CT scanning proved to be the gold standard for the evaluation of pelvic aneurysmal disease whilst angiograms were of little help. A palpable mass was present in nine cases; GI-tract signs in 12 (five patients being operated on for suspicion of appendicitis or sigmoiditis), the genito-urinary tract was involved in eight cases, sciatic or femoral root nerve compression occurred in seven, recurrent pulmonary embolism in two, lower extremity ischaemia in seven and a-v fistula in one. The male:female ratio was 51:2 and that of ruptured to non-ruptured aneurysms 15:38. The site of isolated iliac aneurysms was the common and/or the internal iliac artery uni- or bilaterally.

CD007431,0,11803753,0,[Surgical method in treatment of total kyphosis in ankylosing spondylitis].,"In spite of extensive, conservative methods for treating spondylitis, more or less distinct kyphotic deformities are common. Pain usually plays a minor role as an indication for surgery either as local instability or as impairment of the large hip or knee joints. Much more common are the loss of social contact and the lack of visual contact with the surroundings, both of which the patients find unacceptable. The monosegmental, lumbar correction method as used at an early stage implicated a high rate of complications. The implant supported methods, and in particular those that allow the potential for dorsal transpediculated fixation, allowed, in the early 1980s, dorsal lordotic measures in the form of a multilocus method and, in the mid-1980s, a modified monosegmentary method as well. Both of these methods are widely accepted because of their good long-term results. The possible complications no longer include the disturbance of the spinal cord but are rather to be found in the poor general condition of the patient. The restoration of a largely normal equilibrium of the backbone relieves the musculature and is therefore a definitive pain therapy for muscle tension problems. Straightening the backbone also relieves the hip joints and therefore it is possible in many cases to delay the implantation of a hip prosthesis."
CD007431,0,16623937,0,A clinical genetic method to identify mechanisms by which pain causes depression and anxiety.,"Pain patients are often depressed and anxious, and benefit less from psychotropic drugs than pain-free patients. We hypothesize that this partial resistance is due to the unique neurochemical contribution to mood by afferent pain projections through the spino-parabrachial-hypothalamic-amygdalar systems and their projections to other mood-mediating systems. New psychotropic drugs for pain patients might target molecules in such brain systems. We propose a method to prioritize molecular targets by studying polymorphic genes in cohorts of patients undergoing surgical procedures associated with a variable pain relief response. We seek molecules that show a significant statistical interaction between (1) the amount of surgical pain relief, and (2) the alleles of the gene, on depression and anxiety during the first postoperative year."

The level specific incidence of extreme lateral disc herniation (ELLDH) ranged from a low of 4.5% at L4-5 to peak of 17.4% at L3-4 although the largest number of ELLDH occurred at L4-5 and L5-S1 for a total number of 139 cases (78.1%). 43.6% of all L3 radiculopathies were caused by an L3-4 ELLDH, whereas only 4.4% of all L5 radiculopathies were caused by an L5-S1 ELLDH. Leg pain, either of the sciatic or the femoral type, was the first and dominant clinical symptom of radiculopathy, but pain radiation occurred not always in the appropriate dermatomal segment. ELLDH at upper levels (L2-3 and L3-4) caused usually none or only minor low back signs (76.2%), whereas ELLDH at lower levels more often caused moderate or major lumbar symptoms and signs (59.6%). Positive femoral nerve traction test with upper ELLDH showed a high frequency (84.4%) and reliability and is therefore an important clinical parameter in this situation. Motor deficits occurred more often (78.8%) than sensory deficits (46.6%), were usually of the monoradicular type and were therefore a more reliable clinical sign than sensory disturbances."

Assessment during admission and at three months revealed statistically highly significant differences in respect of relief of pain and resumption of normal occupation in favour of the group treated by extradural injection. This treatment seems to be a valuable adjunct to the management of lumbar nerve root compression syndromes associated with degenerative disc disease.

CD007431,0,17918502,0,Influence of trunk muscle co-contraction on spinal curvature during sitting for desk work.,"Nowadays, a lot of office workers are forced to sit at a desk for many hours while doing their jobs. While sitting, the pelvis rotates backwardly, and lumbar lordosis is flattened. At the same time, the load on the intervertebral discs and spine increases. Sitting in a slumped position is known to increase disc pressure even more, and to aggravate chronic low back pain (CLBP). Therefore, it is very important to teach workers about the correct sitting posture. In addition, it has been recognized that co-contraction of the deep spine-stabilizing muscles enhances lumbar segmental stability and the sacro-iliac joint. However, little is known about the influence of co-contraction of the trunk deep muscles on spinal curvature during sitting for while doing desk work. The purpose of this study was to compare EMG (electromyographic) activity of the trunk muscles during slump sitting with that during co-contraction of the trunk muscles and to investigate how this co-contraction influences spinal curvature. Ten healthy male volunteers (21.7 +/- 2.5 years old) without CLBP participated in the study. Bipolar surface electrodes were attached to the rectus abdominis, the obliquus externus abdominis, the obliquus internus abdominis, the lower back extensor muscles (L3) and the multifidus on the right side. EMG signals were continuously recorded during slump sitting and co-contraction of the trunk muscles, simulating a desk work sitting posture; i.e., slightly inclined forward. They were amplified, band-pass filtered, digitized and stored by a data acquisition system. The average muscle activity values over the five-second sample for each sitting posture were normalized to maximal voluntary contractions (%MVC). While the subjects performed both sitting postures, the curvature of the spine was measured using a new skin-surface and hand-held device, the ""Spinal Mouse"". More significant activities of the trunk muscles, with the exception of the rectus abdominis, were observed during co-contraction of the trunk muscles than during slump sitting The co-contraction of the trunk muscles resulted in significantly less lumbar curvature and more sacral angle than during slump sitting. The thoracic curvature showed no significant change during either sitting posture. The results of this study indicated that co-contraction of the trunk muscles during sitting while doing desk work could bring about the correct lumbar curvature, and effectively stabilize the lumbopelvic region, and decrease focal stress on passive structures."

The relation between pain provocation and the degree of general degeneration and anular disruption assessed according to the Dallas Discogram Description as indices of intradiscal deterioration was investigated. Pain provocation was also evaluated after categorizing the discs by the clinical diagnosis. Pain provocation showed little relation to intradiscal deterioration, whereas a strong relation was found between it and herniated nucleus pulposus. in herniated nucleus pulposus, discs with extraligamentous extrusion or sequestration, large protrusions, maximum protrusion site at the nerve root portion, and herniation routes passing through the central portion of the disc showed a high pain provocation ratio. Pain provocation ratios of discs associated with spinal canal stenosis were extremely low."

CD007431,0,2378733,0,[Changes in the RIII response of the flexion reflex with painful maneuvers].,"In the search for reliable indirect indices of pain sensation, interest has recently focused on the nociceptive flexion reflex and late components of the brain evoked potentials. In ten volunteers with sciatica, the nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII) and the late component (N150-P220) of the evoked potentials were recorded, with the subjects at rest and during pain produced by the Lasegue manoeuvre. In recordings with the subjects at rest, both responses were stable. During the Lasegue manoeuvre, the RIII response was markedly suppressed, with a mean reduction in area of 40% (P less than 0.001). In contrast, the amplitude of the N150-P220 components did not change significantly. Our results indicate that, of the two parameters tested, RIII alone is a reliable index for measuring pain sensation."

The response to damage is characterized by increased collagen metabolism, which can be monitored by the serum markers PICP for type I synthesis and CTx for type I collagen degradation. In a cohort of 67 patients who underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation, PICP and CTx were measured and ratings were made of back pain, leg pain, and functional disability, before and after the operation. In the 6 weeks following surgery, concentrations of PICP increased, concentrations of CTx decreased, and the ratio between PICP and CTx increased. Back pain and functional disability improved, but the scores were not significantly associated with the marker concentrations. The changes in serum markers most likely reflect tissue healing. However, these markers are not yet ready for clinical use."

A controlled multicenter trial with an evaluation by orthopedic surgeons.,"Fifty-three acute or subacute patients with low back pain were given standardized but optimized activating conventional treatment by primary health care teams. Forty-eight patients received an experimental treatment that included specific manual treatment, such as manipulation and specific mobilization, muscle stretching, auto-traction, and cortisone injections. After 4 months, the experimental group had a less restricted range of movement in extension, less restricted side-bending to the right and to the left, less local pain caused by extension and side-bending to the right, less pain radiating to the right leg caused by side-bending to the left, and a less positive straight leg raising test (both sides) than the conventionally treated group. Manual treatment was superior to the conventional activating treatment in normalizing pathologic findings on physical examination of the lower back. These results agree with the positive influence on pain, drug consumption, sick-leave, disability rating, and quality of life reported in other reports from the same study."

CD007431,0,224837,0,Electromyographic value of the tibialis posterior muscle.,"Differentiation between peroneal palsy and L5 radiculopathy poses a diagnostic challenge. However, clinical weakness of the tibialis posterior muscle indicates that the involvement must lie outside the peroneal territory, potentially at a radicular level. Electromyographically this muscle should provide similar information but it has been relatively ignored, possibly for reasons of presumed inaccessibility. A retrospective study was undertaken to delineate the potential electrical discriminatory value of this muscle. Patients selected were those with clinical evidence of lower extremity neurogenic dysfunction in whom needle electrode examination had been performed on the tibialis posterior as well as other posterior and anterior compartment musculature. The parameters measured were the presence of abnormal spontaneous activity suggestive of denervation plus neurogenic motor unit alterations. Abnormalities were detected in the tibialis posterior which were reflected equally in the anterior but not posterior compartment muscles, indicating a shared L5 radicular innervation. Thus this muscle represents a useful source of electrical information assisting in the differentiation between peroneal and radicular dysfunction."

Of all the patients 98 had additional computed tomography scans (CT) of the lumbar spine and 82 had myelography. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scans were both diagnostic in cases of herniated and extruded discs. MRI scan showed more information concerning the degenerative state of the intervertebral discs. It was relatively more accurate in detecting, small bulging and herniated discs without ruptured anulus and the relation of the migrated fragments of extruded discs to both the back of the vertebrae and the thecal sac. Moreover, lumbar MRI matched the clinical response of disc disease to chymopapain treatment more than lumbar CT scan. In addition, the MRI studies differentiated more accurately postoperative epidural fibrotic changes from recurrent herniated and/or extruded disc and detected distal spinal cord abnormalities. CT scan easily detected laterally herniated lumbar discs. Myelography was the diagnostic study in cases of arachnoiditis."

CD007431,0,14673717,0,Comparison of instrumented anterior interbody fusion with instrumented circumferential lumbar fusion.,"Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) restores disc height, the load bearing ability of anterior ligaments and muscles, root canal dimensions, and spinal balance. It immobilizes the painful degenerate spinal segment and decompresses the nerve roots. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) does the same, but could have complications of graft extrusion, compression and instability contributing to pseudarthrosis in the absence of instrumentation. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the outcome of instrumented circumferential fusion through a posterior approach [PLIF and posterolateral fusion (PLF)] with instrumented ALIF using the Hartshill horseshoe cage, for comparable degrees of internal disc disruption and clinical disability. It was designed as a prospective study, comparing the outcome of two methods of instrumented interbody fusion for internal disc disruption. Between April 1994 and June 1998, the senior author (N.R.B.) performed 39 instrumented ALIF procedures and 35 instrumented circumferential fusion with PLIF procedures. The second author, an independent assessor (S.M.), performed the entire review. Preoperative radiographic assessment included plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and provocative discography in all the patients. The outcome in the two groups was compared in terms of radiological improvement and clinical improvement, measured on the basis of improvement of back pain and work capacity. Preoperatively, patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire giving their demographic details, maximum walking distance and current employment status in order to establish the comparability of the two groups. Patient assessment was with the Oswestry Disability Index, quality of life questionnaire (subjective), pain drawing, visual analogue scale, disability benefit, compensation status, and psychological profile. The results of the study showed a satisfactory outcome (score< or =30) on the subjective (quality of life questionnaire) score of 71.8% (28 patients) in the ALIF group and 74.3% (26 patients) in the PLIF group (P>0.05). On categorising Oswestry Index scores into ""excellent"", ""better"", ""same"", and ""worse"", we found no difference in outcome between the two groups: 79.5% (n=31) had satisfactory outcome with ALIF and 80% (n=28) had satisfactory outcome with PLIF. The rate of return to work was no different in the two groups. On radiological assessment, we found two nonunions in the circumferential fusion (PLIF) group (94.3% fusion rate) and indirect evidence of no nonunions in the ALIF group. There was no significant difference between the compensation rate and disability benefit rate between the two groups. There were three complications in ALIF group and four in the PLIF (circumferential) group. On the basis of these results, we conclude that it is possible to treat discogenic back pain by anterior interbody fusion with Hartshill horseshoe cage or with circumferential fusion using instrumented PLIF."

There were 19 male and 10 female patients with a mean age of 16.5 years (range, 9 to 24 years). Twenty-four patients were involved with various athletic activities. Clinical presentation included low back pain with a variable degree of radiculopathy in 25 patients and a cauda equina syndrome in four. The level of the affected spinal area was L1-2 in one patient, L2-3 in one, L3-4 in seven, L4-5 in 17, and L5-S1 in three. The preoperative imaging workup showed lateralised ""non-calcified' or 'calcified' limbus vertebral defects in 13 patients and centrally displaced lesions in 16 patients. All patients underwent posterior spinal decompression with a slightly extended laminotomy, except for three patients who had a subsequent posterolateral fusion. All of the patients consequently returned to practice their favourite preoperative sport and lifestyle, but five discontinued their previous sports. We suggest that patients with posterior limbus vertebral lesions require careful diagnosis and therapy that are different from those with an ordinary lumbar disc herniation."

An alternative to laminectomy in the treatment of backache and sciatica.,"The evacuation and decompression of the herniated lumbar disc (HLD) through a sheath or cannula inserted dorsolaterally represent a new concept in the treatment of backache and sciatica associated with disc herniation. Under local anesthetic and Valium (Roche, Nutley, New Jersey) sedation, 20 patients with sciatica, restricted straight-leg raising, and neurological impairment were treated by this simple and safe technique. All patients had computed tomographic evidence of L4-L5 protrusion. The introduction of a sheath with an internal diameter of 4.9 mm permitted removal of the nuclear material by means of a small pituitary forcep. Using the self-assessment method of Coventry and Stauffer, it was concluded that 12 of the 20 patients had a good or fair result. Predictably, the compensation patients fared poorly. There were no complications. This technique appears applicable in HLD to properly selected patients, and it would seem that it is safe, effective, and cost efficient."

In the second study, a subgroup of patients found to have lumbar disc protrusion were compared to a subgroup with few or no positive physical findings at the time of physical examination. If the cut-off scores recommended by Beck were used, patients in both studies would be classified as mildly depressed. Both studies found that patients were significantly more likely to report somatic than cognitive symptoms of depression. Patients with multiple physical findings or a disc abnormality at the time of operation were not found to be more likely to report somatic symptoms than patients with few physical findings."

Comparison with conventional electromyography.","A study of data on 30 patients with cervical spondylosis was carried out to determine whether short-latency somatosensory-evoked responses (SEPs) to median, ulnar, radial, and peroneal nerve stimulation provided additional information to that obtained by electromyography (EMG), late responses, and peripheral conduction studies. Peripheral studies, EMG results and SEPs were within normal limits in ten patients with pain, but without objective neurological deficit. By contrast, of ten patients who had objective signs of root compression, conventional EMG results were normal in nine, but abnormalities of the SEPs from radial nerve stimulation were obtained in only five patients, and were normal from ulnar and median nerve stimulation. In ten patients with clinical features of myelopathy, seven had abnormal median SEPs and all had abnormal peroneal SEPs, whereas EMG results were abnormal in only five patients. It is suggested that SEPs and EMG are both of limited use in patients with only symptoms of root compression. In patients with signs of root compression, EMG is the most sensitive procedure; however, some additional information can be obtained from superficial radial SEPs. In patients with cervical myelopathy, SEP was the most useful procedure, especially when upper and lower limbs were studied."

We hypothesized that classical acupuncture would be more effective than placebo acupuncture. One hundred and thirty-two patients with acute and chronic low back and leg pain were examined before and after surgery for lumbar disc protrusion. Diagnosis was based on CT and MRT findings. Patients received acupuncture drug-free throughout the study period. The visual analogue scale was used to assess pain intensity before and after (i.e. 30 min. 60 min. 2 h and 6 h) acupuncture. Classical acupuncture resulted in a significant reduction in pain that become increasingly stronger during the 6h study period.

CD007431,0,2139310,0,Herniated lumbar intervertebral disk.,"Low back pain is common, but a herniated intervertebral disk is the cause in only a small percentage of cases. Most symptomatic disk herniations result in clinical manifestations (pain, reflex loss, muscle weakness) that resolve with conservative therapy, and only 5% to 10% of patients require surgery. Sciatica is usually the first clue to disk herniation, but sciatica may be mimicked by other disorders that cause radiating pain. Because more than 95% of lumbar disk herniations occur at the L4-5 or L5-S1 levels, the physical examination should focus on abnormalities of the L5 and S1 nerve roots. Plain radiography is not useful in diagnosing disk herniation, but more sophisticated imaging (myelography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) should generally be delayed until a patient is clearly a surgical candidate. Conservative therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, brief bed rest (often for less than 1 week), early progressive ambulation, and reassurance about a favorable prognosis. Muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics have a limited role, and their use should be strictly time-limited. Conventional traction and corsets are probably ineffective. Except for patients with the cauda equina syndrome, surgery is generally appropriate only when there is a combination of definite disk herniation shown by imaging, a corresponding syndrome of sciatic pain, a corresponding neurologic deficit, and a failure to respond to 6 weeks of conservative therapy."

Single-fibre action potentials (APs) were recorded from a S4 root of a brain-dead human and a patient with a spinal cord lesion, with 2 pairs of wire electrodes, and distribution histograms of conduction velocity frequencies were constructed. By plotting the intrafusal velocity main gamma peak on a logarithmic scale, the peak splitted into one dynamic ad two static gamma-peaks and an additional peak of parasympathetic fibres. 2. Apart from the doublet firing, a single gamma 1 (dynamic) and a single gamma 21-motoneuron (static) fired with shortest interspike intervals of 80 msec, similarly as a simultaneously firing secondary spindle afferent fibre; with 13 msec the doublet interspike interval of the gamma 1-motoneuron was very similar to that of the spindle afferent fibre. The intrafusal motoneurons fired with patterns very similar to those of secondary spindle afferents, and they did not fire in the oscillatory mode for high activations as alpha 2 and alpha 3-motoneurons do. 3. The stability of the oscillatory firing of a sphincteric alpha 2-motoneuron increased with the increasing phases of approx. 50 msec between the APs of the gamma-motoneurons and the impulse train of the motoneuron following bladder catheter pulling. Moreover, in a certain phase range the number of phases between the APs of a gamma 1-motoneuron and a secondary spindle afferent fibre increased upon stimulation and, as shown earlier, also the number of phase correlations between the APs of some secondary spindle afferents and the impulse train of the oscillatory firing alpha 2-motoneuron increased. Phase relations between the APs of two spindle afferents also increased upon the bladder catheter pulling. During the oscillatory firing of the alpha 2-motoneuron a phase loop seemed to exist from the APs of the alpha 2-motoneuron to the APs of certain gamma-motoneurons, to the APs of certain secondary spindle afferent fibres and back to the APs of the alpha 2-motoneuron, in similarity to the phase recoupling of electronic oscillators. 4. Single gamma-motoneurons changed their activity levels rhythmically, similarly as the secondary spindle afferents, often with a frequency of 0.3 Hz. Parasympathetic intrafusal motoneurons fired at a constant activity level for about 10 sec, and activated up to 6 single encoding sites of a parent secondary spindle afferent fibre. Shortly after the recruitment of a new encoding site, the interspike intervals of the parent fibre were similar again.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

On the assumption that the most simple firing pattern of a single fibre with a shortest interspike interval (II) of 80 msec was generated by a single encoding site, the firing patterns of the other afferents could be splitted into firing patterns of single encoding sites with similar II distributions and also with a shortest II of about 80 msec. 3. Successive IIs also reflected the different ways of firing of the secondary muscle spindle afferents. A fibre from a paraplegic with bladder dyssynergia seemed to show a higher activity than a comparable probably normal fibre. The doublet IIs of two secondary spindle afferents ranged from about 9 to 14 msec with peaks at 10.2, 11.2 and 13 msec in the distributions. Multiple encoder sites increased discharge rates of parent fibres, but did not always regularize the output discharge. 4. The simultaneously plotted impulse patterns of 4 secondary spindle afferents showed coordinated firing: they did not fire simultaneously but regularized the summed activity. A phase of 50 msec (range 30 to 70 msec) often occurred between the spindle afferent APs and the impulse trains of an oscillatory firing alpha 2-motoneuron. An afferent drive of the oscillator with a certain phase is likely."

The protocol was found feasible in the occupational health service setting. The interexaminer repeatability between an occupational physician and an occupational physiotherapist was good for most items. The predictive validity of different symptoms and signs was investigated with regard to future sick leaves due to low back disorders. Relief of pain when lying, severe trouble at work caused by pain, continuous pain, and pain in the leg or numbness or diminished sensitivity in the foot predicted sick leaves. Of physical signs, pain in the low back or buttock during lateral flexion and a side difference > or = 20 degrees in the straight-leg-raising angle were predictors for sick leaves. The predictive validity of the protocol items should be tested in another patient population before conclusions can be drawn concerning the external validity of our results."
CD007431,0,10877482,0,Effect of foot movement and an elastic lumbar back support on spinal loading during free-dynamic symmetric and asymmetric lifting exertions.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an elastic lumbar back support on spinal loading and trunk, hip and knee kinematics while allowing subjects to move their feet during lifting exertions. Predicted spinal forces and moments about the L5/S1 intervertebral disc from a three-dimensional EMG-assisted biomechanical model, trunk position, velocities and accelerations, and hip and knee angles were evaluated as a function of wearing an elastic lumbar back support, while lifting two different box weights (13.6 and 22.7 kg) from two different heights (knee and 10 cm above knee height), and from two different asymmetries at the start of the lift (sagittally symmetric and 60 degrees asymmetry). Subjects were allowed to lift using any lifting style they preferred, and were allowed to move their feet during the lifting exertion. Wearing a lumbar back support resulted in no significant differences for any measure of spinal loading as compared with the no-back support condition. However, wearing a lumbar back support resulted in a modest but significant decrease in the maximum sagittal flexion angle (36.5 to 32.7 degrees), as well as reduction in the sagittal trunk extension velocity (47.2 to 40.2 degrees s(-1)). Thus, the use of the elastic lumbar back support provided no protective effect regarding spinal loading when individuals were allowed to move their feet during a lifting exertion."

CD007431,0,10534590,0,Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation: an alternative to TENS in the management of sciatica.,"Sciatica is a common pain problem and current pharmacologic therapies have proven inadequate for many patients. The objective of this sham-controlled investigation was to compare a novel non-pharmacologic technique, percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS), to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in the management of the radicular pain associated with sciatica. Sixty-four consenting patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation were treated with PENS, TENS and sham-PENS according to a randomized, single-blinded, cross-over study. All patients had been maintained on a stable oral non-opioid analgesic regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to entering the study. Each treatment modality was administered for a period of 30 min three times per week for 3 weeks, with 1 week 'off' between each modality. Both PENS and TENS treatments were administered using a stimulation frequency of 4 Hz. The pre-treatment assessment included the health status survey short form (SF-36), as well as visual analog scales (VAS) for radicular pain, physical activity and quality of sleep. The pain VAS was also repeated after each treatment session. At the end of each 3-week treatment block, the SF-36 was repeated. After receiving all three treatment modalities, a global assessment questionnaire was completed. Both PENS (42%) and TENS (23%) were significantly more effective than the sham (8%) treatments in decreasing VAS pain scores. The daily oral analgesic requirements were also significantly reduced compared to the pre-treatment values with PENS (P<0.01) and TENS (P<0.05). However, PENS was significantly more effective than TENS (and sham-PENS) in improving physical activity and quality of sleep. The SF-36 evaluation confirmed the superiority of PENS (versus TENS and sham-PENS) with respect to post-treatment functionality. In the overall assessment, 73% of the patients reported that PENS was the most desirable modality (versus 21% for TENS and 6% for sham-PENS). Finally, 71% of the patients stated that they would be willing to pay extra to receive PENS therapy compared to 22% and 3% for TENS and sham-PENS, respectively. In this sham-controlled study, we concluded that PENS was more effective than TENS when administered at a stimulation frequency of 4 Hz in providing short-term pain relief and improved functionality in patients with sciatica."

Once the position was stabilized, only ankle extensor muscles showed consistent tonic activity while ankle flexors and knee extensors and flexors were virtually silent. Reflex responses, elicited by painful electrical stimuli to the skin of the plantar and dorsal aspect of the foot, were recorded from ipsi- and contralateral quadriceps (Q), biceps femoris (Bic), tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (Sol) muscles. Plantar foot stimulation evoked a large excitatory response in the ipsilateral TA at about 80 ms and a smaller responses in Bic and Q at 70 ms and 110 ms, respectively. Ipsilateral excitatory effects after dorsal foot stimulation consisted of a Bic response at about 75 ms. In addition to excitatory effects, both plantar and dorsal foot stimulation evoked long-lasting suppression of ipsilateral Sol background activity starting at about 60 ms. Contralaterally, the only nociceptive effects after plantar or dorsal foot stimulation were a small excitatory response of Sol at about 85 ms. Evidence is provided that only excitatory responses were contingent upon nociceptive volley. The main mechanical effects seen after plantar stimulation were dorsiflexion of the foot without loss of heel contact with the floor; no withdrawal response of the foot followed nociceptive dorsal stimulation. Our main conclusion is that only reflex nociceptive responses serving to avoid the stimulus without conflicting with limb support function are expressed. The mechanisms reconciling nociceptive action and postural function of the lower limbs are discussed."
CD007431,0,8938612,0,Lumbar disc degeneration and sagittal flexibility.,"It is uncertain whether intervertebral disc degeneration is associated with reduced or increased flexibility, although lumbar flexibility is known to reduce with advancing age. This cross-sectional study of 214 middle-aged men attempted to determine the influence on lumbar sagittal flexibility from intervertebral disc degeneration parameters measured from magnetic resonance images (disc height, signal intensity, bulging, osteophytes). Multivariate analyses showed that a reduced extent of lumbar flexibility could be accounted for by the combined effect of decreasing disc height together with increasing age, weight, and back pain frequency. Although it remains possible that single degenerate discs will display increased mobility, the presence of discs at various stages of degeneration results in a net reduction of flexibility. The factors studied here explained only 31% of the variance in flexibility; the major determinants remain to be identified and quantified."

The sample studied included 220 persons (participation frequency 86%) between the ages of 16-65 who had either acutely declared themselves unable to work because of low back pain (acute patients, n = 50) or who had been ill because of low back pain for one month (subacute patients, n = 50) or for three months (chronic patients, n = 70). A control group (n = 50) consisting of persons who had not been absent at all from work the last year was also included. Information regarding the participants' socio-economic situation, previous and present illnesses, further sick-listing during the one year follow-up period and the duration of absenteeism was obtained from the records of the Department of Health Insurance. The median age for men (68%) in the four different groups was 46, 46, 46 and 48.5, respectively. The corresponding figures for women were 50, 33, 33 and 49 years. Twenty percent were of foreign extraction. The proportion of foreigners in the group of non-participants (n=33) was higher (39%) and in this group there was a significantly greater frequency of previous episodes of ill health of short duration (less than or equal to 7 days + no certificate of ill health). Despite a careful clinical examination it was not possible to find any objective signs amongst 51% (86) of the patients. These patients exhibited normal motion of the back, normal musculature, no signs of neurologic involvement, negative straight-leg-raising test, no fixed painful position and no pain during percussion or palpation despite the fact they had subjective symptoms. The proportion of patients without objective findings increased with increased duration of absenteeism. Forty percent of the acute back patients displayed no objective findings. The corresponding figures for the subacute and chronic back patient groups were 34% and 70%, respectively. In the group without objective findings but with chronic pain (greater than 3 months) there was an increased frequency of Waddell's non-organic signs compared with the group with objective findings. Psychological and social problems increased with increasing duration of absenteeism. There were significantly more patients with psychiatric illness, signs of alcoholism and early retirement in the three months group compared to the remaining groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,2526943,0,Physical findings in patients with chronic intractable benign pain of the neck and/or back.,"Chronic intractable benign pain (CIBP) is defined as non-neoplastic pain of greater than 6 months duration without objective physical findings and known nociceptive peripheral input. To test the CIBP concept, 283 consecutive chronic pain patients were examined independently by a neurosurgeon and physiatrist and only congruent physical findings were coded. Because they did not fit the CIBP definition, patients with the following primary treatment diagnoses were eliminated: degenerative disease of the spine and spinal stenosis; degenerative disease of the hips; radiculopathy; malignancy; deafferentation pain; and miscellaneous. Eliminated, also, were patients with any one finding indicative of a root compression syndrome, leaving 90 low back and 34 neck patients. These patients had abnormal physical findings in 7 categories: tender points/trigger points; decreased ranges of motion in back or neck; non-anatomical sensory loss; rigid musculature; decreased range of hip motion; gait disturbance; and miscellaneous non-neurologic signs. Low back CIBP patients had the following distribution among the 7 categories: 0% had findings of all 7; 1.1% had 6; 13.3% had 5; 24.4% had 4; 25.6% had 3; 26.7% had 2; 8.9% had 1; and 0% had none. Neck CIBP patients, in which only the first 4 categories of physical findings were applicable had the following distribution: 2.9% had 4; 41.2% had 3; 35.3% had 2; 20.6% had 1; and 0% had none. It was concluded that CIBP patients do have abnormal physical findings indicative of musculoskeletal disease: possibly fibrositis and/or specific myofascial syndromes, as sources of peripheral nociception. These findings question the validity of the CIBP concept and point to the need for a careful, all-inclusive physical examination as a basic initial requirement in the classification of chronic pain patients."

Radicular pain was predominant in patients with metastases located in the lumbar area, while the severity of motor symptoms was positively correlated with thoracic metastases. The most common initial symptom was radicular pain, followed, with decreasing frequency, by motor weakness, sensory complaints and bladder dysfunction. The progression of motor weakness influenced the probability of establishing the diagnosis of spinal cord compression by stepwise marked increased probability when patients lost gait function or progressed into total paralysis."

Attention is drawn to the lower average level of the iliac crests in these patients, and to the high incidence of osteoarthritis of the hips. Many patients in this series had been referred specifically for operation and fourteen were so treated. The techniques of decompression and of spinal fusion are discussed. It is concluded that patients with back pain predominant are well treated by corsetry, only a minority needing fusion, and that patients with nerve root involvement or with symptoms of spinal stenosis need decompression. The place of spinal fusion is the main problem, but it seems reasonable, firstly, in younger patients with clear evidence of instability and degenerative change at a single level, and secondly, when radical decompression is judged to increase the risk of instability."

CD007431,0,17216227,0,Quantitative analysis in outcome assessment of instrumented lumbosacral arthrodesis.,"The outcome assessment in instrumented lumbosacral fusion mostly focuses on clinical criteria, complications and scores, with a high variability of imaging means, methods of fusion grading and parameters describing degenerative changes, making comparisons between studies difficult. The aim of this retrospective evaluation was to evaluate the interest of quantified radiographic analysis of lumbar spine in global outcome assessment and to highlight the key biomechanical factors involved. Clinical data and Beaujon-Lassale scores were collected for 49 patients who underwent lumbosacral arthrodesis after prior lumbar discectomy (mean follow-up: 5 years). Sagittal standing and lumbar flexion-extension X-ray films allowed quantifying vertebral, lumbar, pelvic and kinematic parameters of the lumbar spine, which were compared to reference values. Statistics were performed to assess evolution for all variables. At long-term follow-up, 90% of patients presented satisfactory clinical outcomes, associated to normal sagittal alignment; vertebral parameters objectified adjacent level degeneration in four cases (8%). Clinical outcome was correlated (r = 0.8) with fusion that was confirmed in 80% of cases, doubtful in 16% and pseudarthrosis seemed to occur in 4% (2) of cases. In addition to clinical data (outcomes comparable to the literature), quantitative analysis accurately described lumbar spine geometry and kinematics, highlighting parameters related to adjacent level's degeneration and a significant correlation between clinical outcome and fusion. Furthermore, criteria proposed to quantitatively evaluate fusion from lumbar dynamic radiographs seem to be appropriate and in agreement with surgeon's qualitative grading in 87% of cases."
CD007431,0,14767713,0,Management of disabilities associated with achondroplasia.,"Achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia that manifests as short stature. Impairment and complications range over many disciplines including orthopedics, pediatrics, neurology, and otolaryngology. The major impairments of the extremities are short limbs, limited elbow and hip extension, and knee and leg deformities that can cause disabilities in arm function and locomotion. Hydrocephalus, a narrow foramen magnum, spinal deformity, and spinal canal stenosis can cause neurological problems, leading to disabilities in locomotion, communication, and learning. Malfunctions of the otolaryngeal system such as otitis media, upper respiratory obstruction, deafness, speech delay, and malocclusion are interrelated and can also lead to disabilities in communication and learning. Although such disabilities may cause social handicaps, most children receive a normal education. Their social maturity scale is comparable to that of normal children, but their scale of locomotion is not. The reported occupational level of female adult patients is lower than that of their unaffected siblings. When managing patients, orthopedists should consider the overall aspects of achondroplasia, including natural development and complications other than orthopedic factors."

All patients had lumbar disc disease which had failed to respond to conservative therapy. Chemonucleolysis was most effective in those patients with classical signs and symptoms of prolapsed lumbar disc disease of less than 3 months' duration and where sciatica was the predominant complaint. Poor results were obtained in those patients with pain for more than 6 months' duration and with predominantly low back pain. Workers' compensation patients did not respond favourably.

CD007431,0,12902949,0,The fate of the adjacent motion segments after lumbar fusion.,"Lumbar spine fusion is a commonly performed procedure in various pathologic conditions of the spine. Its role remains debated, and moreover, delayed complications may occur, among which is transitional segment alteration leading to recurrence of back pain, gross instability, and neurologic symptoms. Little is known about the long-term prevalence of this complication because of a lack of specific studies. We analyzed the fate of the transitional segments in a homogeneous group of patients operated on during a 14-year period for degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine resistant to conservative treatment. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 15 years. Seventy-five percent of our study group had a minimal 5-year follow-up. In this subgroup, 41% of the patients developed transitional segment alterations, and 20% needed a secondary operation for extension of the fusion. Potential risk factors such as postoperative delay, length of fusion, and spine imbalance were recognized. The frequency of delayed alterations of the adjacent segment and the severity of symptoms related to this complication in this study raise questions about the justification of fusion procedures in degenerative conditions of the spine without threatening instability. Data from the literature confirm the severity of the problem, but many uncertainties remain because of the lack of homogeneous and complete data on both the normal evolution of motion segments of the lumbar spine with age and the fate of the same segments when transformed in transitional segments. Future prospective studies on the subject are needed and must deal with homogeneous groups of patients. More reconstructive surgical procedures need to be developed to lessen the need for fusion procedures."

The objective was to assess the clinical efficacy of the prosthetic disc nucleus (PDN) for treatment of lumbar disc herniation. The PDN was designed to treat patients suffering from disc herniation and/or degeneration. Clinical trials for PDN were first conducted in 1996, and the results showed that the PDN device was effective in most of the patients who were implanted. These studies had been carried out with patients who were implanted with a pair of the devices. The main complication was device migration. Therefore, a follow-up study based on a single PDN device implantation was designed to evaluate its clinical result. Forty-five patients with lumbar disc herniation were implanted with one PDN device from March 2002 to December 2002. Thirty (66.7%) patients came to the clinical, functional, and radiographic 6-month follow-up examinations. Independent analysis was performed by careful review of the charts, operative notes, preoperative and postoperative radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and follow-up records of all patients. After implantation, significant proportions of patients experienced pain relief. Improvements were noted in pain intensity, walking distance, lumbar mobility, neurologic weakness, Oswestry and Prolo scores, and intervertebral disc height. No difference in work status after PDN implantation could be detected. Compared with the preoperative height, the intervertebral disc had gained 19.7% (P < 0.001). Device migration, failure, and dislocation were not noticed in any patient. A few patients had minor complications such as transient low-grade fever. Clinically, a single PDN is preferred and can effectively increase the height of the intervertebral disc in patients with lumbar disc herniation. However, long-term follow-up of PDN implantation needs to be studied."

Major complications included four cases of device migration, requiring revision surgery, and infection in one patient. According to MacNab's criteria, results were excellent in 5 patients (10.9%), good in 31 (67.4%), fair in 3 (6.5%), and poor in 7 (15.1%). The overall clinical success rate was 78.3%.

CD007431,0,10693256,0,[True neurological thoracic outlet syndrome].,"The thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) encompasses various clinical entities affecting the neurovascular bundle crossing the thoracic outlet. Unfortunately, this term often proves to be confusing because many of these entities have little in common beyond their known or presumed lesion site. Neurogenic TOS (true TOS) is caused by compression of the lower trunk in the brachial plexus, the cervical ribs or fibrous band. This syndrome is extremely rare. We consider that this neurological form of TOS is a clearly defined neurological syndrome. We report 10 patients with true TOS. All were females. Stating the onset was difficult because symptoms were progressive and insidious. Pain was the most frequently reported symptom. Sensory deficit was slight or absent. All patients showed unilateral severe atrophy of the thenar muscles. Wasting and weakness developed later. A reduced amplitude of ulnar and median compound muscle action potential associated with a normal amplitude of median sensory nerve action and a reduced amplitude of ulnar sensory nerve action potential were indicative of a chronic axon loss in the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. In all cases, we performed medial antebrachial cutaneous sensory nerve action potential, a C8-T1 innervated nerve. The absence of the medial antebrachial cutaneous sensory nerve action potential in 9 patients and a reduction in amplitude of 50 p. 100 compared to the unaffected side in the other patient, indicated the diagnostic value of this easy and reproductible test. It confirmed a C8-T1 post-ganglionic radicular lesion or a lower brachial plexus neuropathy. Radiography showed a rudimentary bilateral cervical rib or an elongated C7 transverse process in all cases. Surgery was performed in the affected side in 7 patients and in each case the lower part of the brachial plexus was found to be stretched and angulated over a fibrous band, which was removed. Pain was relieved after 1 to 4 weeks. A minimal motor improvement was observed after one year. Electrophysiological results were unchanged."

All patients undergoing ALIF performed by the senior author between 1998 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' preoperative and postoperative neurologic status, functional status, and both back and radicular pain were assessed according to a previously published outcome measure. Between 1998 and 2000, 23 patients underwent ALIF with cortical femoral allograft bone dowels. One patient underwent simultaneous bone dowel and titanium cage placements and was therefore excluded from further analysis. The 22 remaining patients underwent a total of 33 fused segments; of these, 21 patients were available for follow-up. Mean clinical follow-up was 30.6 months. Mean imaging follow-up was 21 months. There were 5 instances of radiographic nonunion (3 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic). The incidence of technical failures and complications related to the bone dowels was 17%. Bone dowels failed and caused symptoms only in patients with a stand-alone ALIF. There were no clinical failures in patients treated with supplemental anterior or posterior spinal fixation. These data demonstrate that marginal fusion rates and functional success rates can be achieved using stand-alone bone dowels for ALIF. The clinical success and fusion rates are significantly higher if ALIF dowels are shielded from stress with rigid spinal instrumentation."
CD007431,0,10442447,0,Surgical outcome in patients with coexisting multiple sclerosis and spondylosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-degenerative disease of unknown etiology which results in destruction of myelin. A variety of neurologic signs and symptoms are associated with MS and include myelopathy, extremity weakness, low back pain, sciatica and paresthesias. Many of these signs and symptoms are identical to those experienced by patients with spondylosis (e.g. spinal stenosis, disc herniations). The coexistence of MS with spondylosis can be problematic both for diagnosis and treatment."
CD007431,0,15138861,0,Detection of bacterial DNA in painful degenerated spinal discs in patients without signs of clinical infection.,"A local inflammatory and potentially painful response, of which the ultimate cause is unknown, has been described in nervous tissues in contact with degenerated disc material in patients with low back and leg pain. With the rationale that a possible cause of such inflammation could be bacterial infection, we utilized PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of the 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) gene followed by gene sequencing, to investigate whether bacterial DNA might be detected in the degenerative discs of 10 patients operated for disc herniation or post-discectomy syndrome. One patient with disc hernia harbored DNA homologous to Bacillus cereus, and in one patient suffering from post-discectomy syndrome, Citrobacter braaki/freundii DNA was detected. The finding demonstrates that 16S rRNA PCR can be a useful tool in search of bacterial DNA in degenerated discs, which in turn may be indicative of low-grade infection, manifesting itself only as pain rather than as clinical infection."
CD007431,0,11550835,0,Lumbar micro disc surgery with and without autologous fat graft. A prospective randomized trial evaluated with reference to clinical and social factors.,"Epidural scarring is one of the possible complications after lumbar disc surgery. Perineural scar tissue has been considered responsible for recurrent neurological symptoms in patients operated on for disc herniation and leads to a high rate of unsatisfactory results. In addition, postoperative scars may increase the technical difficulty and risk of subsequent procedures. Various materials have been used in animal studies to try to affect the degree of epidural scar tissue with controversial results. In particular, free fat transplantation has been described to reduce the degree of intraspinal scar tissue. We therefore performed a prospective, double-blind, randomized study comparing clinical and social factors of patients being operated on for the first time for lumbar disc herniation. A total of 92 patients received an implantation of autologous fat graft, 94 did not. After a median of 24.2 months after their surgery, an objective examinator compared various clinical parameters and the social situation of patients in both groups without knowing the operation method used. We found no significant differences between the fat-graft group and the control group regarding either the clinical outcome or the social aspects."
CD007431,0,1835156,0,Clinical validation of functional flexion-extension roentgenograms of the lumbar spine.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical validity of functional flexion-extension roentgenograms of the lumbar spine in a defined patient population. One hundred and one adults with low-back pain or functional disorders underwent passive functional flexion-extension examinations. Their roentgenograms were analyzed using a computer-assisted method to determine segmental motion parameters such as rotation and translation of the lumbar vertebrae. The patient population was broken down into five groups with similar pathologies or physical conditions, and their motion parameters compared to a normal population and to each other. It was found that all of the patient groups exhibited significantly hypomobile motion, spread equally among all levels, in comparison to the normal population, except for the group of high-performance athletes, who had significant hypermobility. The uniform spread of hypomobility limits the ability to distinguish with any confidence between the four pathologic groups by their motion. Thus, we believe that the analysis of the segmental motion of the lumbar spine using passive flexion-extension roentgenograms does not aid in differentiating the underlying pathologic condition of patients with low-back pain, and that no useful information can be derived form this procedure, especially in relation to the need for surgical intervention."
CD007431,0,11453405,0,Threaded cortical bone dowels for lumbar interbody fusion: over 1-year mean follow up in 28 patients.,The authors retrospectively reviewed a series of 35 patients with mechanical low-back or one- to two-level discogenic pain; the patients underwent lumbar interbody fusion in which threaded cortical bone dowels (TCBDs) were placed to treat degenerative disc disease.

CD007431,0,17974488,0,The use of electromyography to predict functional outcome following transforaminal epidural spinal injections for lumbar radiculopathy.,"This study aimed to determine if electromyographic (EMG) diagnostic evaluation can predict functional outcome in patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar spine epidural injections. In this retrospective study, functional outcome by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and verbal rating scale (VRS) for current pain severity was evaluated in 39 patients undergoing lumbar transforaminal epidural spinal injections (ESI). Subjects with low back pain (mean age, 60 +/- 12.5 years) were evaluated for functional improvement post EMG and ESI. Of 39 patients tested with EMG before injection, 18 patients were positive for radiculopathy and 21 had a normal or negative examination. The patients were followed postinjection on average of 10.8 (SD +/- 3.9) weeks. Pretreatment ODI scores were not significantly different between groups showing positive (72.3 SD +/- 12.7) and negative (65.9 SD +/- 18.6, P > .05) EMG findings. There was significantly greater improvement of ODI for EMG positive radiculopathy (7.11 SD +/- 9.5) compared with negative EMG (3.2 SD +/- 17.4, P < .05). Positive radiculopathy subjects complained of more pain by VRS before ESI than subjects with negative EMG findings, 8.1 SD +/- 1.0 and 7.3 SD +/- 0.8, respectively, which was not significant (P > .05). VRS mean improvement was not significantly different in the positive EMG group (1.8 SD +/- 1.2) compared with a negative EMG (1.2 SD +/- 1.2, P > .05)."
CD007431,0,8238703,0,Upper trunk brachial plexopathy. The stinger syndrome.,"This study was designed to determine the cause of upper trunk brachial plexopathy, which is referred to as a ""stinger"" or a ""burner."" This injury often has been thought to occur secondary to traction when an athlete sustains a lateral flexion injury of the neck. At the United States Military Academy, a 4-phase study was begun with 261 tackle football players (236 intramural- and 25 varsity-level players) to investigate this injury. Electromyography and nerve root stimulation studies were used to delineate the lesion, which was found in a total of 32 players who continued throughout the study. This study demonstrated that a much more common mechanism of injury resulting in the stinger syndrome is probably compression of the fixed brachial plexus between the shoulder pad and the superior medial scapula when the pad is pushed into the area of Erb's point, where the brachial plexus is most superficial. An orthosis was designed to protect the brachial plexus from the compressive force of the shoulder pad. In preliminary trials, this orthosis had been very effective in decreasing the number of episodes in which stinger injuries occurred."

CD007431,0,12709855,0,Posterior lumbar interbody fusion using one diagonal fusion cage with transpedicular screw/rod fixation.,"Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using threaded cages has gained wide popularity for lumbosacral spinal disease. Our biomechanical tests showed that PLIF using a single diagonal cage with unilateral facetectomy does add a little to spinal stability and provides equal or even higher postoperative stability than PLIF using two posterior cages with bilateral facetectomy. Studies also demonstrated that cages placed using a posterior approach did not cause the same increase in spinal stiffness seen with pedicle screw instrumentation, and we concluded that cages should not be used posteriorly without other forms of fixation. On the other hand, placement of two cages using a posterior approach does have the disadvantage of risk to the bilateral nerve roots. We therefore performed a prospective study to determine whether PLIF can be accomplished by utilizing a single diagonal fusion cage with the application of supplemental transpedicular screw/rod instrumentation. Twenty-seven patients underwent a PLIF using one single fusion cage (BAK, Sulzer Spine-Tech, Minneapolis, MN, USA) inserted posterolaterally and oriented anteromedially on the symptomatic side with unilateral facetectomy and at the same level supplemental fixation with a transpedicular screw/rod system. The internal fixation systems included 12 SOCON spinal systems (Aesculap AG, Germany) and 15 TSRH spinal systems (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, USA). The inclusion criteria were grade 1 to 2 lumbar isthmic spondylolisthesis, lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis, and recurrent lumbar disc herniations with instability. Patients had at least 1 year of low back pain and/or unilateral sciatica and a severely restricted functional ability in individuals aged 28-55 years. Patients with more than grade 2 spondylolisthesis or adjacent-level degeneration were excluded from the study. Patients were clinically assessed prior to surgery by an independent assessor; they were then reassessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively by the same assessor and put into four categories: excellent, good, fair, and poor. Operative time, blood loss, hospital expense, and complications were also recorded. All patients achieved successful radiographic fusion at 2 years, and this was achieved at 1 year in 25 out of 27 patients. At 2 years, clinical results were excellent in 15 patients, good in 10, fair in 1, and poor in 1. Regarding complications, one patient had a postoperative motor and sensory deficit of the nerve root. Reoperation was required in one patient due to migration of pedicle screws. No implant fractures or deformities occurred in any of the patients. PLIF using diagonal insertion of a single threaded cage with supplemental transpedicular screw/rod instrumentation enables sufficient decompression and solid interbody fusion to be achieved with minimal invasion of the posterior spinal elements. It is a clinically safer, easier, and more economical means of accomplishing PLIF."

CD007431,0,8511134,0,[Nociceptive flexion reflex of the leg. Use after surgical treatment of herniated disk].,"In patients suffering from acute sciatica due to herniated disk Lasegue's manoeuvre inhibits the leg flexion nociceptive reflex (RIII reflex) in either the ipsilateral or the contralateral limb. This is thought to be due what is called ""diffuse noxious inhibitor control"" modulating the activity of a group of convergent spinal neurons. The purpose of this study was to determine whether surgical resection of the herniated disk in patients suffering from sciatica might relieve this so-called ""counter-irritation"". Among 10 patients whose sciatica resulted from herniated disk, the decrease in amplitude of the RIII response observed when Lasegue's manoeuvre is applied disappeared in 7 patients, 6 to 8 days after surgical resection of the herniated disk. These results suggest that this test might be a useful tool for postoperative prediction of radicular compression."
CD007431,0,9481662,0,Hamstring shortening: postural defect or congenital contracture.,"The clinical appearance of hamstring shortening in 10 patients referred with diagnosis of asymmetry of the trunk, scoliosis, postural defect, strange gait, and back pain is reported. Additionally, an assessment of knee extension deficit (KED) angle in 575 healthy children (4-15 years of age) was performed. The mean KED angle in the group of healthy children was 35 degrees (SD = 14 degrees). The border between norm and disease was defined as a mean + 2 SD and equaled 63 degrees. A KED angle greater than 60 degrees occurred in 10% of normal children. There was no correlation between age and a value of KED angle. In the study group, KED angle greater than 40 degrees was more frequent in boys. A correlation between disorders within musculoskeletal system and greater KED angle was found. These disorders were more frequent in children with asymmetrical KED angle. In our opinion, the border value of the KED angle is not a good differentiating factor between hamstring shortening and contracture because it does not explain the cause of the disorder."
CD007431,0,8333299,0,Reoperation after lumbar disc surgery: results in 130 cases.,"Out of a series of 1850 cases operated upon for lumbar disc herniation 130 underwent re-operation because of persistent or recurrent symptoms. Re-operation was successful in 62%. The prognosis of re-operation was not related to special clinical symptoms and signs but only to the operative findings. Herniations at other levels and recurrences of lumbar disc herniations had the best results (excellent in 98% respectively 54%), but scar formations alone came out much less satisfactory (only 38% excellent results). Computed tomography (CT) findings were less reliable in distinguishing between disc prolapse and fibrosis than magnet resonance imaging (MR). Therefore MR is the diagnostic method of choice in these conditions, and scar formations alone should be considered a contra-indication for re-operation."

The objective was to determine the efficacy, clinical outcome, and functional recovery in patients undergoing simultaneous decompression. No previous study has focussed on the clinical outcome of such simultaneous decompression. Twenty-one patients with neurological claudication, progressive gait disturbance, upper motor neuron symptoms, and findings of myelopathy in both the lower extremities underwent simultaneous decompression and were assessed. The average follow-up was 32 months (range, 24-40 months). At the last examination,13 patients (82%) had excellent or good clinical results. Postoperative improvement correlated inversely with the duration of symptoms. The patients usually had satisfactory outcomes when the correct diagnosis was made and management was implemented. Functional recovery depends on early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention."
CD007431,0,2917056,0,Lower extremity manifestations of spasticity in chronic spinal cord injury.,"The prevalence of various manifestations of spasticity from questionnaire responses and from clinical examination of chronic spinal cord injured patients is reported. Extensor spasms, flexor withdrawal spasms, and clonus were reported by most subjects. Those with incomplete lesions reported more interference with activities, more pain, and less functional usefulness, than did those with complete lesions. Extensor spasms were reported to interfere more with transfers, whereas flexor withdrawal spasms were reported to be more frequent at night and to interfere more with sleep. Increased muscle tone was observed more often in extensor than in flexor muscles. Those with incomplete lesions had more hypertonus and more limited passive joint movements than did those with complete lesions. Flexor withdrawal reactions and extensor spasms were also more pronounced in those with incomplete lesions, particularly those with Frankel grade C lesions."
CD007431,0,1876219,0,[Diagnostic tests in carpal tunnel syndrome].,"In a first series 100 patients underwent surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) after being tested by provocative tests for sensory disturbances preoperatively. In addition to the well-established tests like passive wrist flexion (Phalen's test) or wrist extension, active movement tests of the patient against resistance were investigated. Tests of active movement were introduced because of the high values of intraoperatively measured pressure at the median nerve, similar to those recorded with passive movements. All investigated provocative tests for sensory disturbances related to CTS, investigated by active and passive movements, were positive in 72% to 84% of patients. Average delay times for reaction of these provocative tests ranged between 15.7 and 19.5 s. Furthermore Tinel's sign showed a sensitivity of 64% and the flick sign one of 69%. The specificity of tests and signs for the CTS was assessed on a group of 50 surgically treated patients with cervical nerve root entrapment at the C5-C8 level. In this group and a second CTS group the most sensitive of each test in the first series (active and passive provocational movement), Tinel's sign and flick sign were investigated. By forming subgroups in both diseases we showed that the results of the total groups were not influenced by a possible double crush. We could demonstrate high sensitivities in cervical nerve root entrapment for Phalen's sign with 74% and for active thumb abduction with 68% and a medium sensitivity for Tinel's sign with 40%--thus implying low specificity for CTS. Only the flick sign turned out to be relatively specific for CTS--its sensitivity in cervical nerve root entrapment was around 26%--indicating its potential to function as a valid criterion for the differential diagnosis of CTS and cervical nerve root entrapment syndrome."
CD007431,0,6844850,0,[Stenosis of the lumbar canal: nosologic and semeiologic study. 163 operated cases].,"The authors report a retrospective study of 163 cases of degenerative or constitutional stenosis of the lumbar canal. In this series, the most frequent cause was osteoarthrosis and constitutional stenoses were relatively rare. The authors note that this is often a difficult aetiological distinction to make, especially in elderly patients and the anatomical deformities caused by osteoarthrosis lead to stenosis of the canal similar to that seen in constitutional malformations. Sensori-motor claudication is inconstant and was only found in one third of the cases in this series. More often, the lumbar stenosis presents as nerve root pain. It can be distinguished from root disease of disc origin by the frequent absence of Lasegue's sign and of spinal stiffness. When a herniated disc is associated with a stenosis, the clinical picture is altered and can then resemble that of disc sciatica. The diagnosis of stenosis depends on the radiological examination. This series confirms the diagnostic value of the abnormalities seen on standard X-rays, but the severity and the extent of the stenosis can only be assessed by performing tomography, water-soluble contrast myelography and C.T. scan. The authors discuss the limitations and degree of reliability of each of these investigations. The extent of the surgical decompression depends on the severity of the symptoms and on the results of this radiological survey."
CD007431,0,1432127,0,Transpedicular screw-rod fixation of the lumbar spine: operative technique and outcome in 104 cases.,"A total of 104 patients underwent transpedicular spinal instrumentation using the Cotrel-Dubousset (71 cases) or the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital (33) screw-rod system. Surgery was performed for lumbar vertebral column instability secondary to fractures (28 cases), spondylolisthesis (29), tumors (four), vertebral osteomyelitis (two), or postoperative causes (41). Pseudoarthrodesis due to failure of a prior fusion was present in 37 cases. The 55 men and 49 women (mean age 47 years, range 18 to 87 years) all presented with severe back pain. Signs or symptoms of neural compression were noted in 96 patients. Surgery consisted of neural decompression, internal fixation, and autogenous iliac bone grafting. Spondylolistheses were fused in situ, without reduction; otherwise, major spinal deformities were corrected. A total of 516 pedicle screws were placed. The mean extent of fusion was 2.7 motion segments (range one to six motion segments). A 96% fusion rate was obtained with a mean follow-up period of 20 months. There were no operative deaths. Major complications included one spinal epidural hematoma, three isolated nerve root deficits (two transient, one permanent), and three wound infections (two deep, one superficial). Instrument failure eventually developed in 18 patients; nine were asymptomatic with a solid fusion and did not require further treatment and the other nine were symptomatic or had a pseudoarthrosis and required operative revision. Pedicle screw-rod fixation offers biomechanical advantages compared to other forms of internal fixation for the lumbar spine. It enables short-segment fixation with preservation of lumbar lordosis and adjacent normal motion segments. This technique provides a highly successful method to obtain arthrodesis, even with prior pseudoarthrosis."

We have tried to clinically evaluate lumbago and sciatica using the technique of multiple regression analysis. Selection of evaluation item and allocation of scores to the item were carried out in 104 patients. Multiple regression analysis was carried out in all patients and the standard regression coefficient showed a correlation with criterion variable (dependent Y) in the order of walking, pain, posture, paralytic symptom in lower limbs and SLR (straight leg raising test). The proportion was 0.69, which seems to be a nearly valid value when other factors are considered."

The clinical diagnosis is usually straightforward, but may be delayed for many years in a schwannoma of the posterior tibial nerve. The symptoms are often attributed to entrapment neuropathy or to lumbosacral radiculopathy. We describe 25 patients with a schwannoma of the posterior tibial nerve. Only three were diagnosed within a year of presentation. The mean time to diagnosis was 86.5 months with a median of 48 months (2 to 360). All the patients complained of pain, which was felt specifically in the sole of the foot in 18. A Tinel sign was detected in all 25 patients. MRI confirmed the diagnosis in all the cases in which it had been undertaken. Surgical resection of the lesion abolished the neuropathic pain. In patients with a long history of neuropathic pain in the lower limb in whom lumbar and pelvic lesions have been excluded, a benign tumour of the sheath of a peripheral nerve may explain the symptoms. Surgical resection of the tumour is safe and effective."

Clinical features from the patients' history that correlated with an abnormal CT and myelogram included age greater than or equal to 40, a history of previous surgery, and absence of a history of injury. Signs from the physical examination that correlated included reduced lumbar motion, a motor or sensory deficit, abnormal reflexes, and reduced capacity for straight leg-raising or walking. Using a clinical score incorporating these variables, we suggest a diagnostic strategy to promote more efficient and selective use of CT scans and myelograms. We project that the use of this diagnostic approach can reduce the number of myelograms ordered in a similar population by more than 50%."

The subjects were interviewed on leisure time physical activity preceding the measurements. Of the subjects with recurrent or continuous LBP and of those completely without LBP experience 73.7% vs 42.1% reported that they pursued some physical activity two days a week or less (P = 0.006). Further, decreased spinal mobility, diminished endurance strength of the back muscles and diminished dynamic strength of the abdominal muscles were found in the group with a low frequency of activity. Mobility in children pursuing physical activity two days a week or less was decreased in lumbar extension measured by flexicurve, in forward bending, in side bending and in straight leg raising. Our results indicate that a very low frequency of physical activity in the young might be the risk factor for LBP. Pursuing sports as a leisure time activity is not harmful; on the contrary it has positive effects on spinal mobility and trunk muscle strength."

CD007431,0,2657484,0,Spinal segmental somatosensory evoked potentials in lumbosacral radiculopathies.,"We studied 21 patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy with segmental somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) recorded over both spine and scalp following saphenous, superficial peroneal, and sural nerve stimulation. Spinal SEPs were abnormal in 10 patients. In 3 patients, SEPs detected abnormalities not seen on EMG examination. With 1 exception, all anatomic levels of SEP abnormalities matched that of radiographic, EMG, or clinical abnormalities. SEPs were abnormal in 41% of nerve roots shown to be involved by other techniques. SEPs added to the clinical evaluation in 4 patients, but were less accurate than a combination of EMG and radiography in indicating the extent of nerve root involvement. We conclude that spinal SEPs following segmental sensory stimulation are useful in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies and complement information provided by the EMG. In contrast, scalp-recorded segmental SEPs rarely provide additional useful clinical information."
CD007431,0,17570589,0,Pseudoradicular and radicular low-back pain--a disease continuum rather than different entities? Answers from quantitative sensory testing.,"To assess whether pseudoradicular low-back pain may be associated with subclinical sensory deficits in the distal extremity, we applied the quantitative sensory testing protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) in 15 patients with pseudoradicular pain distribution. Sixteen age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects as well as 12 patients with radicular pain syndromes (L4-S1) were studied with the same protocol. Radicular pain was diagnosed using clinical criteria (pain radiation beyond the knee, motor-, sensory-, or reflex deficits, positive Laségue's test). Z-score QST profiles revealed a selective loss of vibration detection, detection of v. Frey hair contact, and cold detection in the affected dermatomes in the radicular pain group. The contralateral dermatome was also affected, but to a lesser degree. In patients with pseudoradicular pain, the sensory profile was similar, but sensory loss was less pronounced than in the radicular pain patients. There was no significant difference between the two patient groups. Vibration detection was the most sensitive parameter with 73% abnormal values in radicular and 47% in pseudoradicular cases. These data verified the sensitivity of QST to detect sensory loss in radicular compression syndromes, and support a neuropathic component in low-back pain with radiculopathy. In contrast to some central pain syndromes this sensory loss involved predominantly large fiber functions. The subclinical sensory loss in pseudoradicular cases suggests that these patients may also have a neuropathic component of their chronic pain. The spatial incongruence of pain and sensory loss in pseudoradicular pain, however, may also indicate that the two are not causally related."

The single most useful electrophysiologic technique was EMG, which often provided evidence of denervation in a myotomal pattern when other electrophysiologic findings were normal. We found abnormal late responses in 14 patients, but always in association with EMG abnormalities. Peroneal-derived SEPs were always normal. Dermatomal SEPs confirmed the diagnosis in seven patients, including two in whom other electrophysiologic studies were normal."

The outcomes of each test were blinded as to group assignment and the data was assessed statistically to derive each test's independent scores of sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and accuracy. It was observed that plumbline analysis and lateral bending dynamic roentgenograms produced the most accurate prediction of correct diagnoses.

They usually occur at the S1-S2 region in suicide jumpers. A clinical study was performed to evaluate the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of transverse sacral fractures with anterior displacement. We present six patients with a transverse fracture of the sacrum with anterior displacement. All patients presented with bowel and bladder dysfunction, perineal anesthesia, sensory and motor deficits at the lower extremities. Prompt diagnosis of the sacral fracture was obtained in five of the six patients. Operative treatment including lumbosacral laminectomies, spine instrumentation and fusion was done in all patients. Neurological recovery was almost complete in one patient, incomplete in four patients, and none in one patient. Although reduction of the fracture was not ideal in many of these patients, long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up, and neurological improvement were rewarding."
CD007431,0,16403662,0,The course of high-sensitive C-reactive protein in correlation with pain and clinical function in patients with acute lumbosciatic pain and chronic low back pain - a 6 months prospective longitudinal study.,"In this prospective longitudinal study with a follow-up of 6 months, the course of serum concentration of C-reactive protein was measured by an ultrasensitive immunoassay in 31 patients with acute lumbosciatic pain and 41 patients with chronic low back pain. High-sensitive CRP (hsCRP), pain and clinical function were assessed at ten fixed time-points during follow-up. The course of hsCRP values was assessed in relation to the course of pain and clinical function adjusting for possible confounding factors. At the beginning of the study, there were no statistically significant differences in mean hsCRP levels in patients with acute lumbosciatic pain (1.49mg/l) compared to the levels obtained in patients with chronic low back pain (1.30mg/l) and those in a control group from the general population (1.26mg/l). In patients with acute lumbosciatic pain, hsCRP declined significantly in the initial period of 3 weeks with a corresponding decrease in pain and improvement in function and clinical evaluation as assessed with the straight leg raising test (SLR), whereas after this period, the course of the hsCRP did not correspond with the clinical parameters. In patients with chronic low back pain, hsCRP remained approximately constant throughout the whole period with no correlation with pain or function. As a conclusion, according to this study levels of hsCRP do not have a major clinical relevance when evaluating the long-term course of patients with acute lumbosciatic pain and chronic low back pain and therefore should not be taken into primary consideration when decisions on therapy are made."
CD007431,0,9766313,0,A paramedian tangential approach to lumbosacral extraforaminal disc herniations.,"Extraforaminal disc herniations today are operated on via the so-called lateral approach. Clinical experience has shown that in contrast to levels L2/3-L4/5, this approach may become extremely difficult at the L5-S1 level. According to new microanatomic studies, the previous lateral approaches at this level often do not allow access to the neuroforamen without partial or total destruction of the L5-S1 facet joint. Postoperatively, this may lead to joint irritation with consecutive low back and pseudoradicular pain. To preserve the facet joint, a new approach was developed based on an anatomic study."
CD007431,0,3401361,0,Night pain associated with diminished cardiopulmonary compliance. A concomitant of lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis.,"Twenty patients admitted to hospital with congestive heart failure were evaluated for severe concomitant lumbosacral and leg pain. In each instance the discomfort was worse at night and progressively decreased with a resolution of the pulmonary edema. Neurologic and electromyographic examinations in all but four patients were normal with reflexes, strength and straight leg raising testing normal. An absent Achilles reflex was recognized in two, a diminished knee jerk reflex in one and in a third, weakness in the extensor hallucis longus. Lumbar spinal stenosis was identified in all of the patients with a concomitant degenerative spondylolisthesis present in nine instances and in an additional two a spondylolisthesis with interruption of the neural arch. It is theorized that diminished right heart compliance can induce a sufficient increase in venous volume and pressure within the paravertebral plexus of Batson to acutely exacerbate a chronic lumbar spinal stenosis. In support of this hypothesis, the multiple factors involved in the pathomechanics and physiology of lumbar radiculopathy, spinal stenosis and the role of the paravertebral plexus of veins are examined. Specifically, their response to altered volume and pressure gradients tending to induce venous ""creep"" as well to alterations in posture and diurnal cycles are reviewed."
CD007431,0,15761707,0,Combined intra-extracanal approach to lumbosacral disc herniations with bi-radicular involvement. Technical considerations from a surgical series of 15 cases.,"Large lumbosacral disc herniations effacing both the paramedian and the foraminal area often cause double radicular compression. Surgical management of these lesions may be difficult. A traditional interlaminar approach usually brings into view only the paramedian portion of the intervertebral disc, unless the lateral bone removal is considerably increased. Conversely, the numerous far-lateral approaches proposed for removing foraminal or extraforaminal disc herniations would decompress the exiting nerve root only. Overall, these approaches share the drawback of controlling the neuroforamen on one side alone. A combined intra-extraforaminal exposure is a useful yet rarely reported approach. Over a 3-year period, 15 patients with bi-radicular symptoms due to large disc herniations of the lumbar spine underwent surgery through a combined intra-extracanal approach. A standard medial exposure with an almost complete hemilaminectomy of the upper vertebra was combined with an extraforaminal exposure, achieved by minimal drilling of the inferior facet joint, the lateral border of the pars interarticularis and the inferior margin of the superior transverse process. The herniated discs were removed using key maneuvers made feasible by working simultaneously on both operative windows. In all cases the disc herniation could be completely removed, thus decompressing both nerve roots. Radicular pain was fully relieved without procedure-related morbidity. The intra-extraforaminal exposure was particularly useful in identifying the extraforaminal nerve root early. Early identification was especially advantageous when periradicular scar tissue hid the nerve root from view, as it did in patients who had undergone previous surgery at the same site or had long-standing radicular symptoms. Controlling the foramen on both sides also reduced the risk of leaving residual disc fragments. A curved probe was used to push the disc material outside the foramen. In conclusion, specific surgical maneuvers made feasible by a simultaneous extraspinal and intraspinal exposure allow quick, safe and complete removal of lumbosacral disc herniations with paramedian and foraminal extension."

The design involved a combination of decision analysis and Rosser index, with assessment of probabilities from long term clinical series. Utility was based on patients' subjective assessment using a simplified self-administered Health Measurement Questionnaire (HMQ). 146 patients from 7 hospitals were enrolled, 2 to 3 months after chemonucleolysis or surgery. The end-points used were cost and QALYs for each intervention, every year for years 1 to 7. At the time of analysis (1990), the total cost of surgical discectomy was FF15,400, compared with FF8000 for chemonucleolysis. After 1 year, and including the costs of reoperation for failure and relapse and long term medical costs for the non-reoperated unsatisfactory results, discectomy costs were almost 40% higher than those of chemonucleolysis. Ratios remain unchanged after 7 years. QALY results reveal an additional benefit of 52 days of good health associated with chemonucleolysis."
CD007431,0,11052356,0,"The relationship between disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, and stability of the degenerative lumbar spine.","Degenerative processes in the disc and facet joints affect the stability of the motion segment. The exact relations among disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, and the kinematics of the motion segment are not well defined in the literature. Magnetic resonance imaging and functional radiography of the lumbar spine were analyzed to examine the relations among segmental instability, facet joint osteoarthritis, and disc degeneration in patients with degenerative disorders of the lumbar spine. Seventy consecutive patients (mean age, 46 years) had both magnetic resonance imaging and flexion and extension radiographs of the lumbar spine. The lumbar instability was classified into abnormal tilting on flexion, rotatory instability in the sagittal plane, and translatory instability. Translatory instability was subdivided into anterior, posterior, and anteroposterior translatory instability. Disc degeneration as seen on T2-weighted sagittal images was classified into five grades. Facet joint osteoarthritis as seen on axial T1-weighted images was divided into four grades. This study revealed that the kinematics of the lumbar motion segment are affected by disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis. Abnormal tilting movement on flexion and anteroposterior translatory instability both had negative associations with facet joint osteoarthritis. However, anterior translatory instability was positively associated with disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis. Rotatory instability in the sagittal plane and posterior translatory instability were not associated with disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis."

CD007431,0,11052353,0,Recovery of function in adjacent nerve roots after surgery for lumbar disc herniation: use of quantitative sensory testing in the exploration of different populations of nerve fibers.,"Results from experimental and clinical studies indicate that adjacent nerve roots may be affected in sciatica because of lumbar disc hemiation. This may be caused by proinflammatory mediators in the epidural space being transported into nerve roots at the same or neighboring lumbar segments. The aim of the present study was to investigate the recovery of function of sensory nerve fibers in the adjacent noncompressed nerve roots. Thirty-nine patients undergoing microdiscectomy for monoradiculopathy were investigated with quantitative sensory testing immediately before surgery, and at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months after the operation. Twenty-one healthy volunteers were used as controls. The patients were classified as having a good or a poor result at the 1-year follow-up according to a clinical score. Significant improvement of function in the noncompressed nerve roots were only observed in the 31 patients with a good result. The improvement in small myelinated nerve fibers came within 12 months in the adjacent nerve roots in both the symptomatic as well as the asymptomatic leg. The improvement of function in small unmyelinated fibers also came within 12 months after surgery; however, significant improvement was only observed in the ipsilateral neighboring nerve root. The function in large myelinated fibers did not improve in any of the adjacent nerve roots during the observation period. The observed recovery of function in adjacent noncompressed nerve roots after successful surgical decompression in monoradiculopathy may be because of less production of proinflammatory mediators when the disc herniation is removed."
CD007431,0,6450448,0,Acute low-back pain. An objective analysis of conservative therapy.,"The roles of bedrest, antiinflammatory medication, and analgesic medication in the treatment of acute back strain were objectively analyzed to determine whether they have a measurable effect on the return of patients to full daily activities as well as on the relief of pain. Two hundred patients were studied prospectively. Each patient had the diagnosis of acute back strain, which was defined as nonradiating low-back pain. The results of the patient's neurologic examination, straight leg raising test, and lumbosacral spine roentgenograms had to be within normal limits for the patient to be included in the study. The results showed that bedrest, as compared with ambulation, will decrease the amount of time lost from work by 50%. Bedrest will also decrease the amount of discomfort by 60%. Analgesic medication, when combined with bedrest, will further decrease the amount of pain incurred, particularly when used in the first three days of the healing process. However, analgesic medication will not allow a more prompt return to work. Antiinflammatory medication, when added to bedrest in the treatment of lumbago, does not provide an advantage over bedrest alone."

All patients had complaints for longer than 6 months and had recently undergone electrodiagnostic testing and computed tomography (CT). Correlation was made between symptoms, straight leg raising, clinical neurological deficits, electrodiagnostic and CT findings. The radiation of pain above or below the knee and pain on straight leg raising did not show a high correlation with each other or with neurological deficits or CT findings. Electrodiagnostic studies often defined a radiculopathy in patients with equivocal clinical signs. CT findings did not predict the nature of symptoms or clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Electrodiagnostic abnormalities showed the greatest ability to predict CT abnormalities. It is concluded that in chronic sciatica patients, no single diagnostic parameter is conclusive and a combination of clinical and laboratory findings is necessary to reach a diagnosis. In addition, many assumptions, valid in patients with acute pain cannot be extrapolated to patients with chronic sciatica."
CD007431,0,15614654,0,[Guidelines for back pain].,"Chronic back pain is one of our society's most important health problems, causing long periods of sick leave and early retirements.

It has been developed according to the 10-step concept of guideline development of the DEGAM, aiming for early detection of complicated clinical conditions, avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic tests and prevention of chronicity. Complicated, uncomplicated and radicular pain are defined by patient history and a short clinical examination. Imaging and further diagnostic tests are reserved for patients at risk. Basic therapy consists of structured advice. The aim of the guideline is to get patients back to their usual activity supported by effective pain relief. Psychosocial factors which are important for the prognosis should be evaluated already during the first consultation. Manual therapy might help in acute pain. Patients with persistent pain symptoms and long periods of sick leave should be transferred to multiprofessional management including pain treatment, behavioural therapy and physiotherapy.

Group IIIb showed significantly the highest age in all subtypes. Those in group I had higher depression scores than those in group II (P = 0.005). Group IIIa had a lower women's ratio than in group II (P = 0.001) and the patients showed a shorter pain duration than those in groups I (P = 0.000) and II (P = 0.001). Group IIIa patients also showed lower visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings for pain descriptors 'heavy' (P = 0.002) and 'tiring' (P = 0.004) than those of group I, and 'dull' (P = 0.005), 'heavy' (P = 0.001) and 'tiring' (P = 0.005) than those of group II.

Patients were evaluated by an independent interviewer postoperatively, and at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Ratings were based upon the modified Macnab criteria. All patients presented with leg pain with or without back pain that had failed a minimum of 6 weeks conservative treatment (e.g., rest, NSAIDs, physical therapy, epidural steroid injections). Patients were not considered for LADD if the primary source of neurologic findings was a result of scar tissue from a previous discectomy, lateral recess or central stenosis, or sequestered discs. At 1 year postoperative follow-up, the surgical success rate was 84%. For patients requiring an additional LADD procedure, results at 6 month follow-up yielded surgical success rates of 92.3% and 90% for additional level and index level LADD, respectively.

However, what happens to the disc in the latter circumstance is not well defined. We report the first prospective study in subjects with proven radiculopathy and definite disc herniation who improve with nonoperative management to determine what occurs to the herniated disc material. Eighteen subjects with lower extremity pain or paresthesia, positive straight leg raising, weakness in a myotomal distribution, reflex asymmetry, or electromyogram evidence of radiculopathy were studied. Subjects were admitted to the study if computed tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated definite disc herniation corresponding to the side and level of the radiculopathy. After complete clinical improvement, repeat CT scan was performed at six to 18 months after the initial study. The CT scans were interpreted separately by two neuroradiologists. Disc herniations were characterized by size (large, moderate, or minimal); the presence of absence of free fragments; and location. Follow-up scans were compared with the original study and characterized as resolved, improved, or unchanged. Fourteen subjects completed the study, an additional three had operative treatment, and one refused repeat scanning. Subjects were followed an average of 30.4 months with no recurrence of radicular symptoms during this follow-up period in 13 patients.

CD007431,0,8981896,1,Physical signs in lumbar disc hernia.,"In a prospective study of 163 consecutive patients operated on because they were thought to have lumbar disc hernia, the authors investigated whether physical signs could predict the degree of hernia (complete hernia, incomplete hernia, protruded disc, and normal disc) found at surgery. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that there were only 2 physical signs of diagnostic value: lumbar range of motion and crossed Lasegue sign. By these signs, 74% of the uncontained hernias and 68% of the contained hernias could be correctly classified. Discrimination also was made between intact annuli (negative exploration and protruded disc) versus ruptured annuli (incomplete hernias and complete hernias). Again, lumbar range of motion and crossed Lasègue sign were the only significant parameters, predicting 71% of the ruptured annuli and 80% of the intact annuli. These 2 physical signs are important because the degree of the hernia is the most important prognostic factor for the outcome of lumbar disc surgery. The degree of the hernia also has an impact on the choice of invasive therapy: open surgery, percutaneous surgery, or enzymatic nucleolysis. Neurologic signs often were absent, showed low correlation to the degree of the hernia, and had a limited value for predicting the level of the hernia. However, they are important for the differential diagnosis in distinguishing between radicular and referred pain."
CD007431,0,14506578,0,Documentation of brachial plexus compression (in the thoracic inlet) utilizing provocative neurosensory and muscular testing.,"Diagnosis and documentation of brachial plexus compression in the thoracic inlet, ""thoracic outlet syndrome"", remains difficult because the syndrome complex overlaps that of patients with cervical disc disease, intrinsic shoulder pathology, and peripheral nerve compression. While traditional electrodiagnostic testing can identify cervical radiculopathy and the rare isolated lower trunk compression, it cannot identify brachial plexus compression in the thoracic inlet. In 2000, neurosensory testing with the Pressure-Specified Sensory Device (PSSD) was applied to this diagnostic dilemma, demonstrating a significant increase in the one-point static touch cutaneous pressure threshold between controls and patients, when the index finger (upper trunk) and little finger (lower trunk) were tested with the hands at rest and after provoking the plexus by elevating the hands above the head. In the present study, this approach has been extended to include two-point static touch thresholds with the PSSD, and pinch and grip strength (Digit-Grip). Sixteen controls (mean: 34.2, range: 11 to 48 years) were tested and the 99 percent upper confidence limit calculated for percent change after elevation of the hands for 3 min. Forty-one patients symptomatic for brachial plexus compression (mean: 41.0, range: 21 to 62 years) were tested. The clinical severity of the plexus compression was dichotomized as either ""severe"" or ""not severe"" judged by the Roos and Tinel sign. Results demonstrated that when five or more of the eight possible neurosensory and motor test results were > 99 percent normal confidence limit for change, this testing has a sensitivity of 82 percent, a specificity of 100 percent, and a positive predictive value of 100 percent for the diagnosis of clinically severe brachial plexus compression. Seventeen patients who were in the ""severe"" category prior to surgery, were tested before and after plexus neurolysis and anterior scalenectomy. All 17 patients were clinically improved and in 16 of these patients, postoperative neurosensory and motor testing returned to a normal pattern (no significant increase in thresholds with hand elevation). It is concluded that neurosensory (PSSD) and motor testing (Digit-Grip) can help in the diagnosis and documentation of brachial plexus compression."
CD007431,0,3668570,0,Evaluation of the dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential in the diagnosis of lumbo-sacral root compression.,The dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential from the lumbo-sacral dermatomes was recorded from 21 patients with radiographically and surgically (20) proven lumbo-sacral root compression due to prolapsed intervertebral disc or canal stenosis. The potential was abnormal in 19 of the 20 surgically proven cases. The dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential is as accurate as myelography for diagnosis but has the advantage of being non-invasive and repeatable. It provides useful additional diagnostic and pathophysiological information about lumbo-sacral root compression.
CD007431,0,2983601,0,Dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials in unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"We examined scalp-recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) to electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerves and to stimulation in the L5 and S1 dermatomes in 19 patients with unilateral radiculopathies involving these segments. For the dermatomal studies at least two trials of 512 responses were recorded from the vertex with reference to both the midfrontal and contralateral parietal electrodes, using an averaging technique. Findings on the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides were compared in each patient. We found that peroneal SSEPs were normal in all patients. Dermatomal SSEPs correctly identified the lesion in 5 patients. In 1 patient dermatomal SSEPs lateralized the lesion correctly but localized it to the adjacent root. In 10 cases dermatomal SSEPs gave misleading information, indicating an abnormality on the asymptomatic side in 1 patient and no abnormality in 9. In the remaining 3 patients, both SSEPs and radiological contrast studies failed to identify any lesion, although the radiculopathy was confirmed by electromyography. These findings raise doubt about the ultimate utility of these evoked potential techniques in the evaluation of patients with suspected radiculopathies."
CD007431,0,3175834,0,Syndrome of intradiscal lumbar herniation. Clinical presentation and management.,"A syndrome of intradiscal lumbar herniation not associated with nerve root compression is described. The patients have a history similar to that seen in classic disk herniation, except the paresthesias and pain are ""referred"" roughly in a dermatomal distribution. On examination, limitation of range of motion of the back secondary to muscle spasm is noted; however, a positive straight leg-raising test result is not. Objective neurological findings are much less obvious than with radiculopathy. These patients may have ""weakness"" from lack of effort on their part during the examination. There is noted asymmetry in appropriate reflexes and also in the sensory examination. Standard imaging examinations are equivocal. If explored surgically, the findings are relatively unimpressive. These patients, if correctly identified, may be candidates for percutaneous nuclectomy."

CD007431,0,161216,0,The predictive utility of the orthopedic examination in identifying the low back pain patient with hysterical personality features.,"Physical examination of the patient with low back pain routinely includes a number of tests which are useful clinically to the orthopedist as suggestive of the presence of hysteria or malingering. These include tests of light touch differences medially and laterally in the same foot or leg, vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, forward flexion, straight-leg raising differences between the supine and sitting positions, and the Burns' bench test. The present study examined the specific predictive utility of these tests individually and as a composite battery in identifying low back pain patients with hysterical personality features. Twenty-five postoperative lumbar laminectomy and diskectomy patients were administered the MMPI and evaluated by physical examination. Silight to moderate correlations were found for each of the subtests with a Composite Hysteria Index derived from the MMPI. The predictability was improved by the use of a weighted combination of the individual tests obtained by multiple regression analysis. The results lend empirical support to: the predictive value of these clinical tests in definitively identifying 60% of those low back pain patients with hysterical personality features; decision rules for use in clinical practice were also developed."
CD007431,0,6396844,0,Chymopapain for the treatment of intervertebral disc herniation. The final report of a double-blind study.,"Sixty patients with unilateral sciatica resulting from lumbar intervertebral disc herniation were entered into a double-blind study. All patients had failed to respond to conservative management, and the diagnosis had been confirmed by metrizamide myelography. Following a randomized schedule, 30 patients had intradiscal injections of chymopapain, and 30 patients had intradiscal injections of an equivalent volume of normal saline solution. Two years after the injection, 77% of patients treated with chymopapain were assessed as moderately improved, compared with 47% of saline-injected patients. Fifty-seven percent of the chymopapain group were free of pain, compared with 23% in the saline group. Based on the late results of this study, chymopapain is recommended for the treatment of sciatica from intervertebral disc herniation when conservative measures have failed and before disc fragment excision is considered."

The results of patients operated for lumbar disc herniation are good in 83%, fair in 10% and poor in 7. The poor results are considered to be the consequence of post operative fibrosis. A prospective study in 67 patients has been performed to study the post operative appearance of the operated lumbar spine, three months after surgery. 45 days after surgery the recovery of patients was assessed by the score of Staufer and Coventry and patients were entered in the study independently of their clinical state. The MRI was performed at the end of the third month postoperatively and patient recovery assessed according to the score of Senegas and Lavignolle. All the clinical and radiologic data were statistically analysed... the chi-square test, a p. value less than 0.05 was considered statistically non significant.

CD007431,0,8727456,0,Persistent back pain and sciatica in the United States: patient characteristics.,"Low back pain is an extremely common, seriously disabling, nonfatal public health problem worldwide. The National Low Back Pain Study was a multicenter study of a large, heterogeneous group of patients who have been referred to either a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon for the evaluation and treatment of a persistent complaint of low back pain. In this paper, we characterize persistent low back pain patients and their complaints, describe the impact of persistent low back pain on the patients' functional and psychological status, report on the patients' medical characteristics, and identify treatments that are currently prescribed for these patients. Persistent low back pain is most common among people in their mid-to-late thirties and early-to-mid forties. The patients are mostly white, well educated, and generally affluent. The majority are gainfully employed, but some quit working because of pain and those who do tend to be less educated, and more likely to be involved in litigation. The average patient has had low back pain intermittently for 10 years. The pain is usually well localized but its severity varies considerably. Besides pain, most persistent low back pain patients report a variety of motor and sensory deficits. Patients also report significant functional impairment at work, at play, and at home. The typical patient does not, however, display significant psychological distress. Most patients have consulted multiple health care providers, have received a variety of treatments, and have used a variety of medications to alleviate pain; a few have been subjected to more aggressive treatment measures including surgery, intradiscal therapy, and narcotic and psychoactive drugs. None of these treatments has been effective. Physical examinations of these patients do not provide significant clues for making a definitive diagnosis. Nonspecific abnormalities such as muscle spasm, tenderness, and trigger points are quite common, but motor weakness and sensory deficits in the lower extremities, and reflex changes in the knees and ankles, are much less common. The classic combination of reflex changes, motor weakness, and sensory deficits associated with specific protruded discs are extremely rare even though one of three patients had a diagnosis of disc herniation. Diagnostic imaging studies revealed that the majority of persistent low back pain patients have spondylotic abnormalities involving root compression or lumbar instability or both, with root compression as the primary cause of the complaint. Myofascial syndrome and lumbar instability were the next most common diagnoses. After a thorough evaluation by specialists in spinal disorders, three of five persistent low back pain patients were prescribed an additional course of conservative therapy, one of five was prescribed surgery, and the rest were prescribed no treatment. Persistent low back pain patients appear to be a distinct group of low back pain patients who are different from patients who have similar nonpersistent acute symptoms and those who have the chronic pain syndrome characterized by significant behavioral and psychological co-morbidities."
CD007431,0,8727454,0,Clinical appearance of contained and noncontained lumbar disc herniation.,"In a prospective and consecutive study, we evaluated the incidence of common symptoms and neurologic disturbances in 200 patients operated on because of lumbar disc herniation by using a computer-coded protocol with pre- and perioperative registration. The preoperative occurrence of pain at rest, at night, and on coughing was registered. Use of analgesics and walking ability were registered as category data. At examination, a straight-leg-raising (SLR) test was graded in four categories, and results from neurologic findings were collected. At surgery, disc herniation was classified as extruded/sequestered herniation, prolapse, or focal protrusion. There were no significant differences concerning pain at rest or at night related to type of herniation. Pain on coughing was more common in extruded/sequestered herniations. Use of analgesics as well as severe reduction of walking capacity were significantly more common in patients with extrusion/sequestration. The highly restricted SLR test, as well as the crossed positive SLR test, were also significantly more common in patients with extruded/sequestered herniation, and this was also true for the incidence of relevant reflex/extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and sensory disturbance. In conclusion, the clinical appearance of lumbar disc herniation was most ""aggressive"" in extruded and sequestered disc herniation. The symptoms and signs in disc protrusion were less severe, whereas patients with prolapse had an ""intermediate"" appearance concerning symptoms and signs. The differences in incidence of common signs in noncontained versus contained herniation were statistically significant; these differences may be of clinical interest for patient selection and information as well as in pathophysiologic considerations."
CD007431,0,3031765,0,[The importance of thermography in the diagnosis of lumbar radicular pain syndromes].,"This study proved the existence of lateral differences in thermographic recordings of the legs of 83 out of a total of 84 patients with the clinical diagnosis ""lumbar disk herniation"". In 68.5 per cent only of 71 patients with unilateral symptoms, however, the hypothermic areas occurred in the symptomatic leg. These areas could not be matched with corresponding dermatomas. As regards determination of the level of the herniation, thermography is an unreliable method for differentiation between the different segments, because the site of the dermatoma cannot be identified in relation to the site of the herniation. The mechanism of difference in temperature distribution probably depends on sympathetic reflexes with increased activity in the vasoconstrictor system due to pain. These reflexes are not limited to one dermatoma. This has been confirmed by means of diagnostic nerve blocks of the appropriate root."
CD007431,0,3811746,0,[Diagnosis and microsurgical treatment of discogenic lumbosacral radiculitis].,"The literature data and the authors' experience in the treatment of 50 patients showed that the level and character of damage inflicted to the spinal cord roots by Schmorl's body can be determined with the precision necessary for performing a microsurgical intervention only on the basis of a diagnostic complex including scrupulous neurological, X-ray, and electrophysiological examination. The authors show the diagnostic value of studying the somatosensory evoked potentials in stimulation of the corresponding dermatomes (L4, L5 or S1), which reflect the primary side of the affection and, to a lesser degree, the level of Schmorl's body. The microsurgical techniques of exposing the spinal cord root compressed by Schmorl's body was carefully developed and described. Attention is focused on the necessity of using the appropriate microsurgical instruments and placing the patient in an adequate position on the operating table."
CD007431,0,9467995,0,Electric versus magnetic transcranial stimulation of the trigeminal system in healthy subjects. Clinical applications in gnathology.,"This investigation is focused on the analysis of the masseter responses evoked by means of magnetic and electric stimulation of the cortex and root of the trigeminal system of 20 healthy subjects. Moreover, in order to determine jaw elevation in centric occlusion, the analysis also focused on the motor response of the trigeminal bilateral roots evoked simultaneously using two stimulators. The masseter responses show a high level of symmetry in both latency and amplitude. The difference between the hinge axis in natural centric occlusion (CO) and in centric relation (CR) as determined by electric and magnetic transcranial stimulation is lesser than 2.5 mm. This is due to two main factors: (i) the response is evoked from the trigeminal motor neural pool involving all the masticatory muscles and hence simulating the natural 'muscular coactivation'; (ii) there is no manual manipulation to guide the jaw into the centric relation (CR). This method could be of some help for diagnosis in patients suffering from TMJ dysfunction who have lost stereognostic control over the jaw and display obvious signs of deviation during closure of the mandible."

CD007431,0,3231575,0,Evaluation and treatment of chemonucleolysis failures.,"Fifty patients underwent chemonucleolysis for the treatment of lumbar disk herniations unresponsive to conservative therapy. In patients treated with chymopapain, unrelieved sciatica was the most common cause of clinical treatment failure. Eight patients (16%) experienced no relief or only a transient reduction in their radicular symptoms following chymopapain injection. All eight patients were clinically reevaluated and underwent repeat neuroradiographic studies. Computed axial tomography and lumbar myelography demonstrated persistent nerve root compromise at the level of the injected disk space. Open diskectomy was performed in all eight cases. Postoperatively, seven patients noted complete resolution of their radicular symptoms; one patient had intermittent low back and leg pain following surgery."
CD007431,0,420553,0,Lumbosacral fusion by standing h-graft technique.,"Fusion of the lumbosacral spine was carried out on 44 patients. A modification of the standing H-graft technique was used in 41 of the patients. The operative diagnosis was degeneration of the lumbosacral spine in nearly two-thirds of the cases and spondylolisthesis in about one-third. Operations for low back or sciatic pain had previously been performed on 17 patients. The duration of postoperative bed rest ranged from one to six weeks; a lumbosacral corset was used at least for six weeks postoperatively. The average stay in hospital was 52 days. Complications occurred in five cases. The operative results of 40 patients were evaluated on the basis of a follow-up examination performed on average 3.6 years after operation. Nearly half the patients with radiologically successful fusions had a good subjective improvement and about one-fourth had returned to their previous or corresponding occupations. The operative result was at least fair in about half the patients, assessed by a measure of the patients' subjective improvement and working capacity. In the non-fusion group (six cases) the operative results were exclusively poor. Age over 40 years, long-standing preoperative disability and previous back operations proved prognostic factors for poor results. Assessed from functional radiographs, 63% of two-segment fusions and 95% of one-segment fusions were successful. The operative technique appeared simple and suitable for fusions of one spinal segment, but the value of the lumbosacral fusion in the treatment of low back pain seemed doubtful because of the great proportion of poor clinical results even following technically successful fusions."

CD007431,0,2384773,0,Leptomyelolipoma: analysis of 20 cases.,"Leptomyelolipoma (lumbosacral lipoma) is a common form of spinal dysraphism. The deficits produced include sensory, motor, bowel, and bladder dysfunction, and vary in incidence between the pediatric and adult populations. Twenty patients treated surgically at the Mount Sinai Hospital between 1972 and 1988 are reviewed. Fifty percent were 12 years of age or less and 50% were older than 18 years of age. The surgical approach was designed to accomplish untethering of the conus medullaris, debulking of the lipomatous mass compressing the cord, reconstruction of the dural canal, and reapproximation of the paraspinal muscles and lumbosacral fascia to prevent future trauma. Postoperatively, no patient experienced deterioration of neurological function. Of the symptomatic patients. 67% displayed dramatic improvement or became asymptomatic and 33% experienced stabilization of their deficits. The symptoms most resistant to surgical correction were orthopedic foot deformities and bowel dysfunction, whereas bladder dysfunction, motor weakness, and radiculopathies were most amenable to surgical therapy. Early surgical repair is recommended in these cases to forestall irreversible neurological damage."
CD007431,0,3889700,0,Microdiscectomy versus chemonucleolysis.,"A retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients treated with chemonucleolysis and 50 treated with microlumbar discectomy was carried out. Similar clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ""virgin"" herniated lumbar discs were used. All patients had low back or radicular pain unrelieved by a minimum of 4 weeks of conservative therapy. Physical findings included a positive straight leg raising sign, weakness of the appropriate muscle groups, and a sensory loss or evidence of depressed reflexes. All had myelograms or computed tomographic scans demonstrating an extradural defect. Compensation cases were eliminated. Results demonstrated a 90% marked improvement in the microdiscectomy category and a 58% marked improvement in the chemonucleolysis group. Four per cent of the microdiscectomy patients were unimproved, and 18% of the chemonucleolysis group required a subsequent surgical procedure. The average postoperative hospital stay was 3 days for both groups. Because of the necessity for reoperations in the chemonucleolysis group, chemonucleolysis seemed less cost-effective than microdiscectomy."

CD007431,0,11415594,0,Mechanical behaviour of hamstring muscles in low-back pain patients and control subjects.,"The purpose of this study was to measure and compare the passive elastic moment, the stiffness and the damping coefficient of the hip joint, as functions of the hip and knee joint angles in men with and without low-back pain. Two conventional tests, the straight-leg-raising test and the trunk forward flexion, were also performed and compared between these subjects. The passive elastic moment was measured using an isokinetic device in the passive mode. This device raised the lower limb from the horizontal position to the straight-leg-raising angle at a slow and constant angular velocity. A custom-made splint connected with the lever arm of the isokinetic device maintained the knee in extension and the ankle in the neutral position. The damping coefficient of the hip joint was measured for 0, 15, 45, 60, 75 and 90% of straight leg raising angle of each subject, using the suspension method based on small oscillation theory. To ensure that muscles were inactive during the passive hip moment tests, muscle activity was monitored with surface EMG. The stiffness was computed as the ratio of the change in passive elastic moment to the change in the hip angle. The passive elastic moment, the stiffness and the normalized trunk flexion were significantly different between the two groups respectively. There was, however, no difference between the two groups in the results of straight-leg-raise and damping coefficient of the hip. The passive elastic moment was a nonlinear function of the hip flexion angle and showed large intersubject differences, especially as the joint limit was approached. The damping coefficient was a polynomial function of the hip flexion angle. The measured variables were analysed using a discriminant function and it was shown that the two groups were clearly discriminable in a meaningful manner."

Analogue scales for the measurement of pain revealed a satisfactory decrease of nociception after morphine injection, while the H-reflex was not significantly affected. This study may confirm that monosynaptic reflexes are not affected by epidural administration of morphine and that they are probably not involved in pain transmission."

In a prospective cohort study (N = 1,067), we examined associations between worker sociodemographic and other characteristics and opioid prescription within six weeks of the first medical visit for workers' compensation claims for work loss due to back injury. We examined administrative, pharmacy, and worker-reported data. In bivariate logistic regression models, Hispanics were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive opioid prescriptions, and very high body mass index, daily tobacco use, greater pain and physical disability, pain radiating below the knee, injury severity categorizations (from medical records) of major sprain and radiculopathy, and worse mental health were associated with opioid prescription. Adjusting for demographics, pain intensity, and physical disability, opiate prescription was significantly associated with daily tobacco use, pain radiating below the knee, and injury severity categories (major sprain and radiculopathy). Knowledge of worker characteristics associated with early opioid prescription may be useful in future studies of the role of early pain treatment in influencing subsequent course of pain and disability among workers with back injuries."

Examinations of 36 patients with 57 cases of such compression neuropathies have demonstrated that the main etiological moments of the disease are orthopedic diseases, illnesses of the joints and veins of the lower limbs and loading factor. The major clinical symptoms of the disease are spontaneous pains at the site of nerve compression, paresthesias, disorders of sensitivity in the area of innervation of the damaged nerve as well as pains on palpation at the level of nerve compression. Diagnosis is verified by the positive tests inducing pains and paresthesias and by stimulation electromyography. The principal treatment method lies in paraneural injection of glucocorticoids."

There is backache and sciatica, occasionally after trauma, and straight leg raising is usually limited with signs of L-5 or S-1 root compression. The only distinguishing clinical characteristic is that the pain is worse on recumbency and relieved by sitting or walking.

Although studies have been done on the Graf ligamentoplasty procedure and the Hartshill horseshoe cage, their efficacy has never been compared in any study. This study was done to decide whether retaining mobility and stabilizing the spine is best or stiffening the lumbar segment by fusion is preferable. Between 1995 and 1997, a prospective randomized study was performed comparing Graf ligament stabilization and anterior lumbar interbody fusion. Twenty-eight patients had single-level Graf ligaments inserted and 27 patients had single-level anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) with a Hartshill horseshoe cage and tricortical iliac crest autograft. The two groups were similar in age, sex, symptoms, severity of the disc degeneration, and duration of follow-up. The chi-square test and t-test were used to evaluate the outcome. At a minimum follow-up of 2.1 years, we found that 93% of patients who had undergone Graf ligamentoplasty had a satisfactory outcome (rated ""excellent"" or ""better"") compared to 77.8% of patients who had been treated with ALIF with Hartshill horseshoe cage stabilization and fusion, when measured on the Oswestry Disability Index ( P<0.05). Retaining mobility in the lumbar segments gives better results after stabilisation with Graf ligaments than rigid fixation and fusion with the Hartshill horseshoe cage in the short term.

Patient groups were similar in respect of anthropometric data. The indication for using the semi-rigid technique was a fairly stable intraoperative situation; for the more common unstable situations, the rigid technique was chosen. Selecting implant rigidity on these criteria led to results with an improvement rate well within the upper success range reported in the literature.

The results of the prospective case study were compared with previous clinical experiences (1). For the examinations a 1.0T whole body MR-system (Siemens Magnetom Impact) was used. A strong T2*-weighted 3D-FISP sequence (TR = 73 ms, TE = 21 ms, alpha = 7 degrees) was applied in sagittal orientation using a circularly polarized oval spine coil. To obtain fat suppression a frequency selective 1-3-3-1 prepulse was applied prior to the imaging sequence. The acquired 3D-data set was evaluated using a Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) program. Our results confirmed earlier experiences which showed that the diagnostic sensitivity of 3D-MR myelography (3D-MRM) is comparable to that of conventional X-ray myelography. In cases of severe spinal canal stenosis and spondylolisthesises, and in cases of postoperative scar tissue with nerve root compressions, the sensitivity of the 3D-MRM is higher as compared to that of conventional X-ray myelography."

CD007431,0,6457838,0,Clinical studies of isolated disc resorption in the lumbar spine.,"Low lumbar pain with radiation into the leg is a common symptom pattern caused by a number of pathological processes. Isolated disc resorption is one such entity which can be readily identified and is amenable to surgical treatment. This study consisted of two groups of patients. Group I were 50 patients suffering from isolated disc resorption at L5--S1 with ill-defined low backache extending into the buttocks and down one or both legs, but not into the feet. Clinical signs of nerve root dysfunction were found in 16 per cent of patients. Radiographic changes with loss of disc height, facet over-riding and intrusion into the nerve root canal and intervertebral foramen were common and frequently associated with sclerosis of the vertebral end-plate. Group II were a series of 45 patients with isolated disc resorption independently reviewed an average of 45 months after surgical decompression of the S1 (98 per cent) or lower lumbar nerve roots. Based on objective grading by the clinician and subjective assessment by the patient complete success was achieved in 62 per cent of the patients and partial success in 24 per cent. Provided there is full appreciation of the pathological anatomy, strict diagnostic criteria and meticulous surgery, decompression of the nerve root canal is a useful surgical procedure in severely disabled patients suffering from isolated disc resorption."

A literature review reveals that there is no consensus on the diagnosis or treatment of piriformis syndrome. In addition, a survey of 75 physiatrists revealed that whether the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome even exists is controversial. This survey and literature review examines the diagnosis and treatment of piriformis syndrome. The fact that it remains controversial is likely due to a lack of objective clinical trials."
CD007431,0,11243472,0,Withdrawal reflex organisation to electrical stimulation of the dorsal foot in humans.,"The present study investigated excitatory reflex receptive fields for various muscle reflex responses and reflex mediated ankle joint movements using randomised electrical stimulation of the dorsal and plantar surface of the foot in 12 healthy subjects. Eleven electrodes (0.5-cm2 cathodes) were mounted on the dorsal side and three on the plantar side of the foot. A low (1.5 times pain threshold) and a high (2.3 times pain threshold) stimulus intensity were used to elicit the reflexes. EMG signals were recorded from tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), soleus (SO), biceps femoris (BF), and rectus femoris (RF) muscles together with the ankle movement measured by a goniometer. The withdrawal pattern evoked from the dorsal side consisted of two separate responses with different receptive fields: (1) early EMG responses in GM and BF (50-120 ms) evoking knee flexion, probably of purely spinal origin, and (2) a late response in GM and SO (120-200 ms) that may be under supraspinal control. The ankle flexor TA was significantly activated in both time windows, but in 11 of 12 subjects its contraction was too small to cause significant dorsal flexion. In the ankle joint inversion was the most dominant movement. Stimulation of the plantar side resulted in activation of TA when stimulating the forefoot and in activation of triceps surae when stimulating the heel. These observations show that painful stimuli activate appropriate muscles depending on stimulus location to initiate the adequate withdrawal. For proximal muscles (e.g. knee flexors) the receptive field covers almost the entire foot (dorsal and plantar sides) while more distal muscles have a smaller receptive field covering only a part of the foot. This adequate withdrawal movement suggests a more refined withdrawal reflex organisation than a stereotyped flexion of all joints to avoid tissue damage."

The progression of slipping was small and not correlated to age at diagnosis and initial degree of spondylolisthesis. Disc height reduction at the spondylolytic level occurred at an earlier age and was more severe than in a normal control group. Symptoms were correlated to radiographic pathology. Risk factors for low-back symptoms were greater than 25% slipping, low lumbar index in L5 spondylolysis, spondylolysis at the L4 level, and early disc degeneration."

CD007431,0,12508296,0,Comparison of surgical and electrodiagnostic findings in single root lumbosacral radiculopathies.,"To identify the segmental innervation of L-2-S-1 muscles, we compared the preoperative electrodiagnostic examinations of 45 patients with single-level lumbosacral radiculopathies confirmed radiologically and surgically. The electrodiagnostic findings were classified as abnormal only by the needle examination and only if muscles demonstrated active denervation or a marked neurogenic motor unit potential firing pattern. In comparison to other surgical, intraoperative root stimulation, and clinical studies, we found several differences. Overall, there was little overlap among L-2-4, L-5, and S-1 radiculopathies. The tibialis anterior was predominantly L-5 innervated, the gastrocnemius (medial and lateral head) predominantly S-1 innervated, and the biceps femoris (short and long head) exclusively S-1 innervated. The two heads of biceps femoris were not affected in any patients with L-5 radiculopathy in whom they were examined. These findings help guide both the clinician and surgeon in the diagnosis and treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathies."

CD007431,0,7453968,0,Stenosis of the lumbar vertebral canal and sciatica.,"Stenosis of the vertebral canal is a form of compressive stenosis in contrast to transport stenosis of vessels or other channels. The concept, definition and pathomorphological properties are discussed. As it is a form of compressive stenosis, the diagnosis is based on measurements of diameters rather than of cross-sectional surfaces. The biomechanical action of compressive stenosis is compression of the fixed living content at two opposite sites or at all sites. The special properties of sciatica in stenosis are described and presented in tabular form. Some properties of neurogenic intermittent claudication (I. Cl.) in the presence of stenosis are discussed. There is a predominance of sciatica at rest and of motor weakness during walking. The mechanism of neurogenic I. Cl. is obscure. Stenosis of the lumbar vertebral canal is one of the conditional determinants of I. Cl. The data presented in this paper demonstrate, however, that stenosis is not an absolute determinant of I. Cl. and that its production depends on the combination with other determinants. The theory is advanced that other determinants may be related to changes in the caudal nerve roots due to either constitutional properties or to subclinical changes induced by ageing and chronic wear and tear, and compression and traction in the area of stenosis during various bodily activities. Suppression of sciatica during I. Cl. is a phenomenon which is particularly difficult to explain."

CD007431,0,10228885,0,The diagnostic value of dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials in lumbosacral disc herniations: a critical approach.,"In this study, we examined scalp recorded dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (DSEPs) to electrical stimulation of L4, L5 and S1 dermatomes in 55 patients with proven lumbosacral radiculopathy and in 22 healthy subjects. We did not observe any significant ipsilateral intertrial variations and arithmetic mean side-to-side differences in normal subjects. As for segmental latencies, the dermatomal P40 latencies were directly correlated with height. The regression equations for L4, L5 and S1 dermatomes were as follows: (L4) y = 5.8 + 21.3 (height), (L5) y = -2.09 + 28.04 (height), (S1) y = -13.9 + 36.4 (height). Maximum side-to-side latency differences and maximum P 40 latencies were obtained by adding 2 standard deviations to the arithmetic means. The abnormal latencies for L4, L5 and S1 dermatomes were 48 msec., 52 msec., and 55 msec., respectively. The abnormal side-to-side latency difference were 3 msec. for all dermatomes. DSEPs accurately predicted the lesion only in four patients (7.2%). In 20 patients (36.3%), DSEPs correctly identified the lesion but also gave misleading information on the other levels. DSEP abnormality were on the correct level but opposite side in 5 patients (9%). The findings were normal in 11 patients (20%), and misleading in 15 patients (27.2%). We conclude that the ultimate diagnostic utility of DSEPs in lumbosacral radiculopathies is doubtful and controversial needs further investigations."

A comparison with radiculography, computed tomography, and operative findings.","Fifty nerve root infiltration studies were evaluated prospectively in a consecutive series of 50 patients referred to the Sheffield Problem Back Clinic with complicated back problems. All were over 35 years of age (mean, 51 years). Ten (20%) demonstrated abnormal segmentation of the lumbar spine. Sixteen (32%) had undergone previous surgery. Before nerve root infiltration all patients were investigated by radiculography and computed tomography. Nerve root infiltration identified two types of response. In 20 patients, infiltration reproduced the symptomatic pain, which then was abolished by local anesthetic--the positive result. These patients were considered suitable for surgery. One patient in this group had spontaneous resolution of pain and thus did not undergo operative treatment. In 30 patients, infiltration did not reproduce the symptomatic pain regardless of the level studied, or only partially reproduced the pain at two or more levels--the negative result. Radiculography and computed tomography in these patients also was inconsistent. This group were considered unsuitable for surgery. In those patients undergoing surgical decompression, nerve root infiltration correctly identified the symptomatic level in 18 of the 19. Computed tomography and radiculography identified the level in 14 and 12 patients, respectively."
CD007431,0,3405411,0,CT-diskography in the evaluation of the postoperative lumbar spine. Preliminary results.,"Thirty-three patients with recurrent sciatica after lumbar-disk surgery were studied for recurrent herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) by CT alone and CT-diskography (CTD). Twenty-six patients underwent surgical reexploration allowing correlation with CTD. CTD made a correct diagnosis of recurrent HNP in twenty-one patients showing an extravasation of the contrast medium from the disk space into the medullary canal. In two cases CTD was positive for recurrent HNP but surgery showed only fibrosis. The amount of contrast leak was very small in these two cases along the posterior common longitudinal ligament, and the junction with the disk was very narrow. Because of their clinical presentation three patients with negative studies were operated upon. One showed only fibrosis and the two others showed an associated disk fragment. Among the twenty-one true-positive cases, seven showed a combination of recurrent HNP and scarring. Contamination of CSF by the contrast medium through the dura was observed in two patients. Although a prospective comparative study between CTD and IV-contrast-enhanced CT is necessary, CTD appears to be a useful diagnostic procedure for recurrent HNP after surgery of the lumbar spine."

CD007431,0,1833832,0,The failed posterior lumbar interbody fusion.,"The problems presented by unsuccessful posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) have not been addressed. The cases of 12 patients who presented with failed PLIF were reviewed. Five patients were male and seven female (age range, 24-50 years; mean age, 40 years). All patients underwent at least one PLIF; many had undergone other procedures. A total of 37 procedures had been performed on the 12 patients. Chronic radiculopathy was present in all patients, as detected with electromyographic or nerve conduction velocity examination. At the time of reconstructive surgery, in the 11 patients in whom the canal was explored, all had extensive epidural fibrosis. Nine of the 12 patients had pseudarthrosis of the previous PLIF. Four patients had evidence of motion segment dysfunction at nearby levels: two had positive discograms adjacent to the PLIFs; one developed a facet syndrome at L5-S1, caudal to an L4-5 PLIF; and one demonstrated frank segmental instability at L2-3, cranial to a previous PLIF at L3-4. Twelve patients underwent a total of 22 procedures after referral. Eleven patients initially underwent decompression and fusion, and one patient underwent a sympathectomy. Seven patients underwent an additional 10 procedures, including repeat decompression, repair of pseudarthrosis, and implantation of an epidural analgesic pump system. After all surgical treatment, five patients rated their pain as improved. Seven patients were thought to have a solid fusion. The presence of a solid fusion did not correlate with satisfactory relief of pain (chi-square). Continued extremity pain was the predominant complaint of all the patients. Two shortcomings of the PLIF were evident.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,12962295,0,Microsurgical management of postoperative disc space infection.,"We analysed seventeen patients with septic postoperative spondylodiscitis (POD) who were managed by early microsurgical removal of the infected necrotic tissue, application of a closed suction-irrigation system (for a mean of 6.7 days), and early mobilisation. The POD was diagnosed clinically by elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) values and radiographically by computerised tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging. According to the sensitivity studies of the obtained pathogens, systemic antibiotics were given, followed by early mobilisation of all patients in a light cast corset. Immediate pain relief was noted in all patients except one, who required a third operation that was followed by rapid clinical improvement. Bacteriological diagnosis was obtained in 88% of the patients. Excellent or good clinical long-term results were achieved in 82% of the patients, whereas 18% had poor results. Elevated ESR/CRP values returned to normal ranges within 6 to 44 days (mean 15 days) after reoperation. All but one patient tolerated early mobilisation (within 2 to 4 weeks) well without any complication. Early microsurgical removal of the necrotic and infected tissue and application of a closed suction-irrigation system supported by specific antibiotic therapy should be considered an effective means to treat POD, thereby avoiding a prolonged period of unpleasant immobilisation for the patient."

These cases could be divided into two groups by the relative level of conus medullaris to that of L3 body, i.e. 34 cases in which the conus medullaris is tethered below the superior border of L3 body were classified into low placed conus medullaris (LPCM) and 43 in which the conus medullaris is located above the same level into the tight filum terminale (TFT). As to symptoms and signs, incontinence, gait disturbance, foot and toe deformities, lumbosacral tumor and sacral dimple were seen more often in the LPCM group. On the other hand, nocturia, pain in the back and in the lower limbs, positive Lasègue sign and tight back were seen more often in the TFT group. Neurological signs were seen more often in the LPCM group. In 3 cases of LPCM, and 10 of TFT, spina bifida was not visualized on the plain X-ray film of the spinal column. LPCM could be definitively diagnosed by myelography taken with the patient lying in the supine position, on the other hand myelography did not always give definitive diagnosis of TFT. Surgery for releasing the tethering conus was carried out in 58 of 77 cases. Of which 49 have been followed up more than 2 months after operation. Some degree of improvement of various symptomes and signs, was noted in 35 (68%) of these patients."

CD007431,0,17977762,0,Functional magnetic resonance imaging of cerebral activation during spinal cord stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome patients.,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) consisting of electrical stimulation of the dorsal spinal cord using epidural electrodes has been shown to relieve chronic neuropathic pain. To analyze the cerebral activation patterns related to SCS, and to evaluate the effects of SCS on the processing of acute experimental pain, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on eight patients suffering from failed back surgery syndrome who were also being treated with SCS for severe pain in their legs and lower back. Three types of stimulation were used, each lasting 36s: (i) SCS, (ii) heat pain (HP) applied to the leg affected by neuropathic pain, and (iii) simultaneous HP and SCS. During SCS, we found increased activation of the medial primary sensorimotor cortex somatotopically corresponding to the foot and/or perineal region, contralateral posterior insula, and the ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). Decreased activation was seen in the bilateral primary motor cortices and the ipsilateral primary somatosensory cortex corresponding to the shoulder, elbow and hand. Compared to separately presented HP and SCS, simultaneous HP and SCS showed statistically significant activation of the bilateral inferior temporal cortex and the ipsilateral cerebellar cortex. The activation of the primary motor cortex, insula and S2 during SCS may directly interfere with the processing of neuropathic pain. When SCS is associated with heat pain, the paralimbic association cortex and cerebellum show activation exceeding the sum of activations resulting from separate SCS and heat pain stimulation. The explanation of this could possibly rest with the continuous comparisons of simultaneous pain and somatosensory sensations occurring in a single dermatome."

CD007431,0,9352617,0,On surgical intervention in the temporomandibular joint.,"The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the indications for and the results of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery in patients with long-standing severe orofacial pain and dysfunction as well as in patients with fractures of the condylar neck. The patients with long-standing pain and dysfunction had had symptoms for a mean time of 4 years, had been treated conservatively for a mean time of 2.5 years, and had undergone numerous conservative treatment methods without improvement except for a minor increase in mouth opening capacity. The indications for surgery were strict; only 1% or less of all the patients referred to the departments with a diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) were prescribed surgery, which was considered to be the only remaining option. The TMJ surgery reduced pain, sleeping problems, and analgesic consumption and improved mouth opening capacity. The procedure showed low morbidity except for a facial nerve disturbance in three patients. Postoperatively, the bite force was observed to be normalised, and the radiographic examination showed moderate to severe osteoarthrotic changes. These changes, though extensive, were considered to be the normal outcome of diskectomy and without clinical significance, even though they resembled degenerative joint disease. In study V, surgery was performed on patients with a clear diagnosis of anterior disk displacement (ADD) with or without reduction. The preoperative pain and mouth opening capacity were markedly improved as well as other subjective symptoms. Although surgical morbidity was low, some radiographic changes were clearly detectable. In agreement with earlier reports, patients with a distinct diagnosis of ADD with or without reduction were clearly helped by diskectomy. In cases of ADD with or without reduction, it can be concluded that unsuccessful conservative treatment should not exceed 3-6 months but be discontinued in favour of the documented advantages of surgery in these cases. Patients with ankylosis should be treated surgically without delay. Unclear diagnoses such as arthralgia and osteoarthrosis with symptoms should be excluded from surgery unless overlapping muscular hyperactivity has been excluded as a major cause of the patients problem. Diskectomy is a useful surgical procedure for patients with severe long-standing TMD. It was shown in study VI that patients with dislocated fractures of the condylar neck can be successfully treated with open surgical reduction when the dislocation is large and associated with symptoms and limited function. When cognitive-behavioural profiles were measured psychometrically in study VII, a dysfunctional profile was more common in patients with myofascial pain and pain with an obscure origin than in other patients diagnosed with TMD. The dysfunctional profile was also common in patients in whom treatment of a conservative or surgical nature had failed. Among TMD patients with disk displacement, adaptive copers were most common in successfully diskectomized patients and least common in patients about to undergo invasive treatment."

In the remaining 10 patients (20%), it was negative; in this group the myelogram correctly predicted the lesion in 8 (80%). Sector CT correctly predicted the nature of the lesion in 24 patients (48%), was incorrect in 14 (28%), and gave incomplete findings in 12 (24%). CT was most accurate when it demonstrated a disc protrusion as the only finding. In this group, sector CT correctly predicted the operative findings in 24 of 25 patients (96%).

CD007431,0,8113853,0,A long-term outcome analysis of 984 surgically treated herniated lumbar discs.,"This paper presents a long-term follow-up study of 984 patients operated on for a herniated lumbar disc between 1959 and 1991. It was possible to follow 98% of patients from the time of operation to the time of writing. The mean follow-up period was 10.8 years. The most common presenting complaint was back pain with sciatica in one leg; the most frequent neurological finding was impaired straight-leg raising. Myelography confirmed the diagnosis in 80% of patients, but more recently enhanced computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have been the preferred studies. The operative procedure was either hemilaminectomy or laminectomy with x 3.5 magnification and fiberoptic lighting. Herniated lumbar discs involved L4-5 and L5-S1 with equal frequency (47%). The recurrence rate was 6%, one-third of which developed during the 1st year after operation. The complication rate was 4%; there were no intraoperative vascular or intestinal injuries. The Prolo Functional Economic Outcome Rating Scale was used to measure long-term outcome and the results were compared to those of Pappas, et al. Patients who did sedentary work and housewives had statistically higher total and economic Prolo scores (p < 0.01) than those who did strenuous work. The majority of patients with the ""failed-back syndrome"" had pending legal or Workers' Compensation claims, or were at psychological risk for surgery. In 89% of patients the outcome was good--defined as a Prolo score of 8 in 10%, 9 in 19%, and 10 in 60%."
CD007431,0,10664304,0,The active straight leg raising test and mobility of the pelvic joints.,"Objective signs to assess impairment in patients who are disabled by peripartum pelvic girdle pain hardly exist. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical test to quantify and qualify disability in these patients. The study examined the relationship between impaired active straight leg raising (ASLR) and mobility of pelvic joints in patients with peripartum pelvic girdle pain, focusing on (1) the reduction of impairment of ASLR when the patient was wearing a pelvic belt, and (2) motions between the pubic bones measured by X-ray examination when the patient was standing on one leg, alternating left and right. Twenty-one non-pregnant patients with peripartum pelvic girdle pain in whom pain and impairment of ASLR were mainly located on one side were selected. ASLR was performed in the supine position, first without a pelvic belt and then with a belt. The influence of the belt on the ability to actively raise the leg was assessed by the patient. Mobility of the pelvic joints was radiographically visualized by means of the Chamberlain method. Assessment was blinded. Ability to perform ASLR was improved by a pelvic belt in 20 of the 21 patients (binomial two-tailed P = 0.0000). When the patient was standing on one leg, alternating the symptomatic side and the reference side, a significant difference between the two sides was observed with respect to the size of the radiographically visualized steps between the pubic bones (binomial two-tailed P = 0.01). The step at the symptomatic side was on average larger when the leg at that side was hanging down than when the patient was standing on the leg at that side. Impairment of ASLR correlates strongly with mobility of the pelvic joints in patients with peripartum pelvic girdle pain. The ASLR test could be a suitable instrument to quantify and qualify disability in diseases related to mobility of the pelvic joints. Further studies are needed to assess the relationship with clinical parameters, sensitivity, specificity and responsiveness in various categories of patients. In contrast with the opinion of Chamberlain, that a radiographically visualized step between the pubic bones is caused by cranial shift of the pubic bone at the side of the standing leg, it is concluded that the step is caused by caudal shift of the pubic bone at the side of the leg hanging down. The caudal shift is caused by an anterior rotation of the hip bone about a horizontal axis near the sacroiliac joint."

CD007431,0,10664306,0,Recurrent pain after lumbar discectomy: the diagnostic value of peridural scar on MRI.,The association between peridural scarring and recurrent pain after lumbar discectomy is much debated. A recently published study found that patients with extensive peridural fibrosis were 3.2 times more likely to experience recurrent radicular pain than those with less extensive scarring. This finding may lead to an overestimation of peridural fibrosis in clinical practice. In a retrospective study we analyzed the records of 53 patients who underwent a lumbar MRI because of recurrent pain after first unilateral microdiscectomy. Patients were classified as those with radicular or non-radicular pain according to history and clinical findings. The diagnosis was confirmed by spinal anesthetic block. The extension of scarring was compared between the two groups of patients. The amount of epidural fibrosis was examined on contrast-enhanced MRI in axial slices subdivided into four quadrants. The amount of fibrosis was divided into four stages in each affected quadrant. We found no differences regarding the amount of peridural fibrosis between patients with radicular pain and patients with non-radicular pain. We conclude that the extent of peridural scarring as defined by MRI is of minor value in the differential diagnosis of recurrent back and leg pain after lumbar microdiscectomy.

In this study, findings from radiography, computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy with SPECT in 34 patients with chronic back pain were examined to determine the nature and clinical relevance of the lesions. Twenty-seven patients had lesions at SPECT, of whom 24 (89%) had abnormalities at CT and 18 (67%) had abnormalities at radiography. SPECT allowed identification of 54 lesions, of which only 20 (37%) were detected with planar imaging. Forty-three (80%) SPECT lesions were located at the site of an abnormality also seen at CT and 20 (37%) at the site of an abnormality also seen at radiography. It was concluded that bone SPECT provides diagnostic information in chronic low back pain that is not available with radiography or planar imaging. The majority of lesions seen at SPECT corresponded to identifiable disease at CT."

CD007431,0,11902355,0,Lumbar percutaneous KTP532 wavelength laser disc decompression and disc ablation in the management of discogenic pain.,"The objective of this research was to determine the outcome of laser disc decompression and laser disc ablation in the management of painful degenerative disc disease with or without associated disc prolapse. Nonendoscopic percutaneous laser disc decompression was performed under x-ray control via the posterolateral approach with side-firing probes. All patients with chronic back pain who had reproduced pain during discography of a nature, pattern, and distribution similar to what they experienced normally were included in the study. Magnetic resonance which confirmed stenosis and sequestrated discs, and patients with acute neurological findings were excluded from the study. Laser disc decompression or ablation was done using the KTP532 wavelength. The functional outcome was assessed prospectively using the Oswestry Disability Index. Clinical benefit was considered significant in those patients with a percentage change in the index of > or =50% at review 3-9 years (mean, 5.33 years) following surgery. A total of 52% of patients demonstrated a sustained significant clinical benefit, with an additional 21% in whom functional improvement was noted. Cohort integrity was 67%. Long-term benefit of the laser disc ablation and decompression for discogenic pain suggests a mechanism other than principally mechanical as a cause of chronic back and sciatic pain. It may suggest that efficacy occurs by reduction in the intradiscal production of irritative products and by an effect upon discal and annular neoneuralization. The sustained nature of the benefit after long-term preoperative symptoms (mean, 4.7 years) rules out any placebo effect. Selection should be restricted to patients without significant lateral recess stenosis, retrolisthesis or olisthesis of > or =3 mm, significant dorsal or foraminal osteophytosis, extrusion, or sequestration."

CD007431,0,12933410,0,Can quantitative sensory testing predict the outcome of epidural steroid injections in sciatica? A preliminary study.,"Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) is a psycho-physiological test used to identify dysfunction of individual nerve fiber types. In the present study, we investigated whether selective nerve fiber dysfunction, as assessed by QST, correlates with the effectiveness of epidural steroid injections (ESI) in patients with lumbar radiculopathy. Twenty patients with unilateral painful sciatica caused by disc herniation participated in this open study. Before ESI, quantitative thermal and mechanical sensory testing was conducted at the most painful dermatome and the contralateral dermatome. The primary outcome measure used was the self-recording of pain intensity twice daily with a 0-10 numerical pain scale (NPS). Secondary efficacy measures included the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the straight leg raising test, and the lumbar range of motion. A significant difference in all types of sensory thresholds between the affected and the contralateral dermatomes was detected at baseline. All outcome measures improved subsequent to the ESI. A significant positive correlation was found between the increase in cold sensation thresholds of the affected dermatome (Adelta-fiber dysfunction) and the improvement in NPS. The increase in touch and vibration thresholds (Abeta-fiber dysfunction) was found to be inversely correlated with the improvement in NPS. No correlation was found between heat sensation thresholds (C fibers) and any of the outcome measures. These results suggest that QST has the potential to be an important tool in the selection of the appropriate treatment (e.g., ESI versus surgery) for patients with sciatica and may assist in identifying the mechanisms of pain generation in these patients."
CD007431,0,17613505,0,Survival and clinical outcome of SB Charite III disc replacement for back pain.,"Between January 1990 and December 2000 we carried out 226 SB Charité III disc replacements for lumbar disc degeneration in 160 patients. They were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 79 months (31 to 161) to determine the clinical and radiological outcome. The clinical results were collected by an independent observer, who was not involved in patient selection, treatment or follow-up, using a combination of outcome measures, including the Oswestry Disability Index. Pain was recorded using a visual analogue score, and the most recent radiographs were reviewed. Survival of the device was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and showed a cumulative survival of 35% at 156 months when radiological failure was taken as the endpoint. The mean improvement in the Oswestry disability index scores after disc replacement was 14% (6% to 21%) and the mean improvement in the pain score was 1.6 (0.46 to 2.73), both falling below the clinically significant threshold. Removal of the implant was required in 12 patients, four because of implant failure. These poor results indicate that further use of this implant is not justified."

A prospective double-blind clinical trial.,"A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of intradiscal steroid injections. Criteria for entrance were one-level internal disc disruption or nonsequestered nuclear prolapse with or without sciatica and a positive pain response on awake discography. Exclusion criteria were multilevel disease, central or lateral stenosis, prior lumbar surgery, or medical disease requiring systemic steroids. A total of 25 patients were randomly assigned to Treatment Group A (methylprednisolone, Depo-Medrol 80 mg/ml, The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Michigan) or Treatment Group B (bupivacaine, Marcaine .5% 1.5 ml, Sanofi Winthrop Pharmaceuticals, New York, New York). Fourteen patients received Depo-Medrol, with 21% showing subjective improvement and 79% no improvement; 0% were clinically worse. Eleven patients received intradiscal Marcaine, with 9% showing clinical improvement and 91% no improvement; 0% were clinically worse. To quantify clinical response, a pain diagram grid score, a visual analog scale, and the Oswestry Pain Questionnaire were used before injection and 10-14 days after injection. No statistically significant benefit was identified in the use of intradiscal steroids."
CD007431,0,9438816,0,"Cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations in patients with sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation: an investigation of biochemical, neurologic, and radiologic predictors of long-term outcome.","We studied 180 adult patients admitted to the Neurological Department, Haukeland Hospital in Bergen, Norway, for a period of 5 years from 1984 to 1988. One hundred fifty-seven patients were followed up 3.9-9.0 years after admittance to the Neurological Department. The purpose of this study was to find out if the total cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration could predict the outcome of lumbar disc surgery or conservative treatment in patients with sciatica. Neurologic and radiologic parameters were also included in the investigation. The increase of the CSF total protein concentration in sciatica without spinal block is assumed to be due to leak of plasma proteins into the CSF from the nerve root. A relationship between CSF protein concentrations and certain clinical parameters has been found. At myelography, 10 ml of CSF was collected for analysis. The patients were evaluated for involvement of the nerve root and/or the dural sac, respectively. The neurologic parameters investigated were: straight leg raising tests, paresis, disturbances of sensibility, and altered reflexes. At follow-up, the patients were asked to fill in questionnaires concerning job function, sick leave or disability pension, subjective physical disability and pain perception, and a clinical examination with the same neurologic parameters was performed. Elevated CSF total protein concentration was related to chronic leg pain, leg pain, and subjective physical disability at follow-up. Nonoperated women reported higher subjective physical disability scores and were more often on sick-leave or disability pension than were men at follow-up. Lateral prolapses were associated with good job function outcome and less risk for sick-leave or disability pension. Reduced lower extremity reflexes, laterally located disc herniation and elevated CSF total protein concentration were associated with a favorable long-term outcome in patients with sciatica. CSF proteins as objective measures on nerve root injury are discussed. CSF total protein concentration can be regarded as an indicator of the functional status of the nerve root and a prognostic factor in patients with sciatica."
CD007431,0,9438815,0,Effects of intravenous lipoprostaglandin E1 on neurogenic intermittent claudication.,"Circulation disturbances in the cauda equina and nerve roots have been implicated in the genesis of neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). We report the clinical results of lipoprostaglandin E1 (lipo-PGE1) treatments in patients with NIC. Lipo-PGE1 was administered intravenously for 10 consecutive days to 40 patients, 31 of whom showed a response to the treatment. Of the clinical symptoms examined, walking ability and leg numbness were significantly improved with an average effective period of 2.5 months. However, patients with radicular pain and severely affected patients did not respond well. Nerve root circulation in eight patients who subsequently underwent surgery was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter. We observed increased blood flow in seven of these eight patients, after the intraoperative administration of lipo-PGE1. Lipo-PGE1 produced symptomatic improvement for a limited period in the treatment of NIC associated with LSS. The drug appeared to exert its effects through an increase in the circulation of blood in the nerve roots and the cauda equina."

Clinical parameters such as pain on motion, lumbar range of motion, straight leg raising test, deep tendon reflexes, dermatomal sensations, motor functions and neurogenic claudication distances were assessed at admission and were compared after a conservative treatment program was completed. A conservative treatment program consisted of physical therapy (infrared heating, ultrasonic diathermy and active lumbar exercises) and salmon calcitonin. Pain on motion (100%), restriction of extension (77%), limited straight leg raising test (23%), neurogenic claudication (100%), dermatomal sensory impairment (47%), motor deficit (29%), and reflex deficit (40%) were observed in the patients. All aforementioned disturbances except reflex deficits improved by the conservative treatment and results were statistically significant.

CD007431,0,8278854,0,Evaluation of clinical lumbar instability using the treadmill.,"The physical signs of lumbar instability have not yet been clearly defined. Furthermore, they do not always coincide with the abnormal movement on flexion-extension radiographs. Thus, the treadmill was used to evaluate clinical lumbar instability. The subjects were 82 patients with degenerative lumbar disease aggravated by walking or daily physical activities. The reproduction and provocation of low-back pain or pain in the lower extremities was examined during walking on a treadmill. The responses of the reproduction and provocation of the symptoms were divided into four grades. Fifteen cases were examined again using a treadmill after body casting to determine the indication for fusion surgery. As a result, the responses in the reproduction or provocation test using a treadmill manifest more dominant reflection of clinical symptoms suggesting clinical lumbar instability than the existence of the abnormal movement on flexion-extension radiographs. Reexamination after body casting was useful to determine the indications of fusion operations. The reproduction or provocation test using a treadmill was implied as a possible functional evaluation method of clinical lumbar instability."
CD007431,0,17180400,0,Headache in patients with cervical radiculopathy: a prospective study with selective nerve root blocks in 275 patients.,"Since many years we routinely use diagnostic selective nerve root blocks (SNRB) at our department when evaluating patients with cervical radiculopathy. Frequently patients who also presented with headache reported that the headache disappeared when the nerve root responsible for the radicular pain was blocked with local anaesthetics. Headache has been described as a companioning symptom related to cervical radiculopathy but has never before been evaluated with SNRB performed in the lower cervical spine. For this reason we added to our routine an evaluation of the response from the SNRB on headache in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The aim was to describe the frequency of headache in patients with cervical radiculopathy and its response to a selective nerve root block of the nerve root/roots responsible for the radiculopathy. Can nerve root compression in the lower cervical spine produce headache? In this consecutive series of 275 patients with cervical radiculopathy, 161 patients reported that they also suffered from daily or recurrent headache located most often unilaterally on the same side as the radiculopathy. All patients underwent a careful clinical examination by a neurosurgeon and a MRI of the cervical spine. The significantly compressed root/roots, according to the MRI, underwent SNRB with a local anaesthetic. The effect of the nerve root block on the radiculopathy and the headache was carefully noted and evaluated by a physiotherapist using visual analogue scales (VAS) before and after the SNRB. All patients with headache had tender points in the neck/shoulder region on the affected side. Patients with headache graded significantly more limitations in daily activities and higher pain intensity in the neck/shoulder/arm than patients without headache. After selective nerve root block, 59% of the patients with headache reported 50% or more reduction of headache and of these 69% reported total relief. A significant correlation was seen between reduced headache intensity and reduced pain in the neck, shoulder and arm. The result indicates that cervical root compression from degenerative disease in the lower cervical spine producing radiculopathy might also induce headache."

Evidence of nerve root tension, including a positive straight-leg raising test seen in 67% of our patients, proved valuable for outruling sciatica due to bony impingement. Outcome was favorable in 78% of cases after a mean follow-up of 2.5 years. This findings is consistent with previous studies performed without age restrictions. Chemonucleolysis had no adverse effects. Despite the biochemical changes which occur in the aging disc, chemonucleolysis is an effective tool for the treatment of sciatica due to disc herniation in elderly patients."

In 22% of our patients, one method alone was not sufficient for satisfactory preoperative diagnosis. The value of myelography and ct in the diagnosis of problem cases in herniated lumbar disk disease is different. Because of specific advantages (Tab. 1) in the representation of the spinal canal the techniques have their own position.

Intraoperatively, the respective peak latencies of spinal P13 and N13 coincided with those of the N1 component of the dorsal cord potential and its phase reversed positivity. On both the ventral and dorsal sides of the cervical epidural space, maximal amplitude was at the C5 vertebral level to which nerve input from the C6 dermatome is the main contributor. The modality of sensory impairment in the hand dermatome was examined in selected patients with cervical lesions, who showed such normal conventional SEP components as Erb N9, far-field P9, P11, P14, N18 and cortical N20, with or without loss of spinal N13. Statistically, the loss of spinal N13 was associated with decrease of pain sensation in the C6 dermatome. This was interpreted as being due to damage to the central grey matter of the cord, including the dorsal horn. Our results suggest the spinal N13 and P13 originate from the same source in the C6 spinal cord segment and that they are good indicators for the detection of centromedullary cervical cord damage."

The investigated group comprised 9 subjects (4 women, 5 men) aged 33 to 67 years operated upon at the Neurosurgical Clinic in Kosice between Jan. 1 1982 and June 30 2001 on account of compression of nervous structures in the thoracic portion of the spine by sequestra of intervertebral discs. This was manifested by back pain, a sensation of stiffening of the muscles of the lower extremities, altered sensitivity and in all by impaired gait. Only one female patient developed urinary retention, another one painless paraparesis of the lower extremities, therefore the condition was evaluated as a demyelinisation process. In three patients as the only imaging examination method perimyelography was used, in another two it was supplemented by CT. Four patients were examined by MRI. This graphic method proved to be the most suitable. In all subjects of the investigated group the clinical picture and examination methods indicated a unilateral predominance of the affection. In five subjects it proved possible to remove the sequestream of the intervertebral disc via laminectomy, in another four a transpedicular approach into the spinal canal was used successfully.

Causes of diagnostic errors were analyzed. Most frequently a discogenic or other vertebrogenic cause of complaints was suspected. In all patients a local or root symptoms were the first manifestation of the disease. From the investigation ensues that a tumour must be considered when pain radiates into both lower extremities, in case of striking stiffness of the spine up to the neck and in case of damage of the higher lumbar roots. Tumours are more frequently located higher than prolapsed discs with manifestations of caudal compression. When bone structures are affected in primary tumours, the objective clinical finding may be very sparse. Tumours at the borderline of Th-L may be manifested by root symptoms L5 or S1. During PMG attention is focused lower, usually a prolapsed disc of L4/5 or L5/S1 is suspected and the tumour may be missed.

The objectives of this clinical study were to evaluate inter-examiner reliability in the classification of patients with LBP, the influence of radiological findings on the classification and the reliability of some clinical tests. Two examiners independently assessed 50 outpatients with LBP. Inter-examiner reliability in classification of patients with LBP using Kirkkaldy-Willis classification (KWC) system and in 30 clinical tests was calculated as percentage agreement and kappa coefficients (kappa). Inter-examiner reliability was excellent (kappa>0.8) for classification according to KWC. Radiological findings did not influence the reliability. Age of the patient, movement range, and pain and neurological signs seemed to guide the decision on classification. The reliability of clinical tests was good (kappa>0.6) in 6 tests and moderate (kappa>0.4) in 12 tests. Good inter-examiner reliability was found for the SLR test, movement range and sensibility testing with spurs in dermatome areas. We conclude that the KWC for classifying patients with LBP seems to be a reliable classification system depending on a few key observations and that moderate and good inter-examiner reliability can be achieved in several clinical tests in the assessment of LBP."

With the recording electrode over the abductor digiti quinti latencies of stimulation in the supraclavicular fossa and of the C8 nerve root were ascertained. The difference between these 2 values reflected conduction time between C8 and the supraclavicular fossa. Four normal volunteers, 150 patients without Thoracic Outlet Syndrome and 50 patients with clinical thoracic outlet syndrome were studied. Using this method, conduction time from C8 to supraclavicular fossa ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 msec (mean = 0.6570, S.D. = 0.2097) in patients without thoracic outlet syndrome, and from 1.0 to 2.6 msec (mean = 1.7836, S.D. = 0.1984) in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. These values show a significant difference between the 2 groups at the 0.05 level of confidence (T-Test). In thoracic outlet syndrome, conduction time has a tendency to be prolonged and the value above 1.3 msec is strongly suggestive of thoracic outlet syndrome.

Most improvement occurred within the first month, and one year after treatment outcome was judged satisfactory (excellent or good) in 71%. Individual patient characteristics associated with a satisfactory response were sciatica of greater severity than back pain (p = 0.005) and duration of symptoms less than 18 months (p = 0.03). Patients fulfilling 3 or 4 of four immediate pre-treatment clinical and radiographic criteria (sciatica more severe than back pain, reduced straight leg raising, neurological deficit, radiographic abnormality) had a satisfactory response more often than others (p less than 0.05). Reported success one year after surgery for disc prolapse is similar. Chemonucleolysis, however, requires less resources and does not preclude subsequent operation. Our results therefore suggest that it might be considered an alternative to surgery when conservative treatment has failed."

CD007431,0,9392047,0,Objective evaluation of pain in various spinal diseases: neuropeptide immunoreactivity in the cerebrospinal fluid.,"A quantitative analysis was performed of substance P-like immunoreactivity (SPLI) and of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-ENDLI), in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in various diseases. The results reported to date have not been consistent. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not the concentration of SPLI or that of beta-ENDLI in CSF demonstrated any potential for assessing the degree of subjective pain in various spinal diseases. SPLI in CSF was measured by radioimmunoassay in 158 patients with a spinal disease; involving 57 patients with a lumbar disc herniation (LDH), 38 with lumbar canal stenosis (LCS), 46 with cervical myelopathy (CM) and 17 with cervical radiculopathy (CR), and also in 20 healthy controls. beta-ENDLI in CSF was measured in 25 of these same patients; involving 12 with LDH, seven with LCS and six with CM, and also five of the same controls. The concentration of serum SPLI was also measured in 50 of these 158. The severity of pain was self-evaluated by each patient using a linear visual analogue scale (VAS). Their Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was also calculated objectively using the clinical findings. Correlations were investigated among the concentrations of SPLI and beta-ENDLI in the CSF and the VAS and JOA clinical assessments of these patients. The concentration of SPLI in CSF was significantly higher in various spinal diseases than in control (P < 0.05), and was correlated with the severity on the VAS and with the JOA score. However, beta-ENDLI was not correlated with either the VAS or the JOA score. We conclude that the measurement of the SPLI concentration in CSF has the potential for assessing objectively the severity of pain associated with various spinal diseases."

Axial 1 mm thick slices were obtained in a 1.5 T unit using a three-dimensional (3D) fast low angle shot data set of 32 contiguous slices. The data were post-processed with multiplanar reconstruction algorithms to obtain oblique sagittal (along the long axis of a nerve) images or coronal images with a slice thickness of 0.8 mm. The MR angiographic images were also obtained from the same 3D data set with maximum intensity projection algorithms. The MR studies showed that 9 of 12 patients had neurovascular compression caused by one or two arteries. These findings were verified at surgery. In two of the remaining three patients, MRI failed to delineate the affected nerves compressed by a vein in one, and a previously applied prosthesis in the other. In the last patient no neurovascular compression was found by MRI or at surgery."

CD007431,0,3581584,0,Spasticity.,"Spasticity has been defined as velocity-dependent hyperactivity of stretch reflexes; it is therefore only one aspect of the complex syndrome produced by a lesion of the upper motoneuron. Although spasticity may be partially responsible for joint contractures, it does not produce most of the functional disability experienced by patients with upper motoneuron lesions. Paresis, fatigability, lack of dexterity, etc., account for most of these patients' complaints. The pathophysiology of spasticity is poorly understood but appears to be related to an increased excitatory state at the segmental spinal level; there is no evidence for increased sensitivity of muscle spindles in spastic patients. Several mechanisms for this increased excitability within the spinal cord have been proposed. There are different types as well as degrees of spasticity. Clinical neurophysiologic recordings of reflex activity in patients with spasticity provide the means to differentiate among the various types of spasticity, to select the therapy most likely to be effective in a particular patient, and to see the results of its employment objectively. The latter will prove whether a specific therapy is useful or not. Ablative treatment at the level of the peripheral nerve or dorsal root may be useful, particularly when spasticity is severe. Drugs such as baclofen or diazepam relieve flexor spasms but are not particularly effective against spasticity itself. Dantrolene acts to weaken muscles, but that is not often helpful. Rarely do any of these therapies increase function; there are no effective cures for paresis or related negative manifestations of chronic spasticity."

All patients had clinical signs and symptoms of disk prolapse and positive findings on neuroradiologic testing. We assessed the latency and the amplitude of the first positive waveform of Dermatomal SEPs, as well as conducting peripheral nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Our studies showed a clear correlation of Dermatomal SEP abnormalities and radiculopathy in up to 83.3% of subjects studied. Use of electromyography testing provided this correlation in about 62.5% of the same subjects. On the basis of these results, we propose that Dermatomal SEPs have value in complementing the routine electrophysiological testing of the patients with radiculopathy and provide a sensitive non-invasive technique for defining the level of disk prolapse."

Seven hundred and one of the 1,821 patients seen over a two-year period had degenerative spinal disease. Spinal disease included lower back pain (n = 385), lumbar and radicular pain suggestive of disk protrusion (n = 137), lumbar and radicular pain with claudication suggestive of stenosis of the spinal canal (n = 42), dorsal pain (n = 24), cervical pain (n = 68) and cervical and brachial pain (n = 45). Clinical patterns were similar to those seen in Western countries. However, lumbar and radicular pain with claudication suggestive of stenosis of the spinal canal occurred at a younger age and mainly affected females. These data are in contrast with previous studies suggesting that lumbar and radicular pain due to disk protrusion and stenosis of the spinal canal are uncommon in Black Africa."

CD007431,0,6225064,0,Descriptions of pain and other sensory modalities in patients with lumbago-sciatica and herniated intervertebral discs. Interview administration of an adapted Mcgill Pain Questionnaire.,"This paper aims at elucidating to what extent patients with lumbago-sciatica in the presence of an herniated intervertebral disc, are inclined to describe their pain in a characteristic way. The material comprised 50 patients with clinical and radiological signs indicating herniation of the L4/5 or L5/S1 discs. The assessment of pain was performed by formal oral interview, focussing on spatial distribution and somatosensory dimensions of pain in various regions of the back and leg. In conformity with the fact that a range of sensible nerves are affected by the herniation pain description is represented by a variety of pain qualities. The pattern of pain description tends to exhibit certain characteristic traits: only half of the patients had low-back pain, and pain was most frequently occurring in the gluteal region, thigh and calf. The frequency of superficially localized pain tended to increase in the proximo-distal direction. Aching-like pain was the most common pain quality, and this variant of pain as well as flashing and jerking sensations were commonly reported in the gluteal region, thigh and calf. Warmth was most frequently experienced in these regions, cold sensations in distal parts. A feeling of punctate pressure was common in the gluteal region, incisive pressure and paraesthesia in the thigh and calf, and a cramp-like feeling in the calf region. Reduced sensibility was frequently experienced in distal parts and never in the lumbar region. Pain quality differs in patients with a short and a long duration of the actual attack of sciatica. The mapping of pain seems to represent a diagnostical aid. A high degree of homogeneity of the patients is required for pain description to be a valid and reliable instrument. The clinical application of pain mapping is to be shown through a paper-and-pencil administration of a questionnaire based upon the findings from this study."

No single disorder was associated specifically with ganglioside antibodies. No characteristic patterns of ganglioside antibodies were observed in any disease category. However, 32% of all patients had pathological antibody titres to at least one ganglioside. Four patients had pathological IgG and IgM titres for all gangliosides evaluated. They suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus [2], neuroborreliosis and schizophrenia, respectively. The results of this study indicate that the introduction of ganglioside antibody determination as a differential diagnostic test in clinical neurology is only helpful in a few patients with typical lower motor neuron syndromes."
CD007431,0,2876596,0,[Surgically treated carpal tunnel syndrome--clinical and electrophysiologic follow-up].,"The carpal tunnel syndrome is described as a compression of the N. medianus under the retinaculum flexorum with the causes for this syndrome being of the most varied nature. The aetiology is multifactorial with frequent alterations of the connective tissue being observed in the histological specimen, i.e. chronic inflammatory proliferations or fibrotic degenerations. Direct pressure measurements have shown that the pressure is markedly higher both at rest and extension or flexion as compared to normal healthy subjects. An exact diagnosis requires a measurable prolongation of the distal motorial latency. Surgery is the treatment of choice to ensure perfect recovery. For this purpose the retinaculum flexorum must be entirely split, and our experiments have shown that the splitting of the epineurium yields good results. The microsurgical interfascicular neurolysis, however, should be considered in special cases only. Complaints tend to disappear fairly quickly in the majority of cases, i.e. pain recedes by 90%, sensitivity disorders by more than 70% and muscle atrophy by 50%. The operation enables a measurable improvement of the distal motorial latency. The incidence of postoperative complications is relatively low, and if they do occur, then they are negligible and without any bearing on the final surgical result. Persistent residual complaints are very often due to other accompanying diseases such as cervical vertebral column syndrome, cervical ribs etc."
CD007431,0,2951048,0,Recognizing specific characteristics of nonspecific low back pain.,"A retrospective review of 1293 cases of low back pain treated over a 12-year period revealed that sacroiliac joint syndrome and posterior joint syndromes were the most common referred-pain syndromes, whereas herniated nucleus pulposus and lateral spinal stenosis were the most common nerve root compression lesions. Referred pain syndromes occur nearly twice as often and frequently mimic the clinical presentation of nerve root compression syndromes. Combined lesions occurred in 33.5% of cases. Lateral spinal stenosis and herniated nucleus pulposus coexisted in 17.7%. In 30% of the cases of spondylolisthesis, the radiographic findings were incidental and the source of pain was the sacroiliac joint. Distinguishing radicular from referred pain, recognition of coexisting lesions, and correlation of diagnostic imaging with the overall clinical presentation facilities formulation of a rational plan of therapy. The above-outlined approach to managing low back pain evolved over a 12-year period. Designed to establish a specific diagnosis, it should yield excellent or good results in 84% of patients."

Continued significant symptomatic benefit was observed to long-term assessment and the health gains in this patient group compared favourably with other elective surgical procedures. We have used this data to validate the SF-36 for use in this context and we recommend that SF36 should be used as a sole measure of outcome in routine practice, as well as in future studies."

CD007431,0,11472384,0,Cervicogenic headache: evaluation of the original diagnostic criteria.,"A variety of headaches are frequently associated with the occurrence of neck pain. The purpose of this paper was to describe the adherence to diagnostic criteria of a series of patients enrolled on the basis of two clinical criteria: (1) unilateral headache without side-shift, and (2) pain starting in the neck and spreading to the fronto-ocular area. One hundred and thirty-two patients (36 male and 96 female) entered the study. Sixty-two patients were assigned to Group A (patients fulfilling criteria 1 and 2), 40 to Group B (criterion 2 only) and 12 to Group C (criterion 1, only). Eighteen subjects were excluded because X-rays of the neck were not available. Patients were evaluated regardless of whether or not they fell into one or more of the following diagnostic categories: cervicogenic headache (CEH), migraine without aura (M) and headache associated with disorders of the neck (HN) (IHS definitions). Fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria for CEH was found to be particularly frequent in Group A. A higher frequency of CEH diagnosis was found when two criteria were used (Group A) than in Group B (P = 0.001); in the former group a higher mean number of diagnostic criteria for CEH were also present (P = 0.001). Group A patients more frequently presented pain episodes of varying duration or fluctuating, continuous pain and moderate, non-excruciating, non-throbbing pain than Group B patients (P = 0.04 and P = 0.08, respectively). In Group C patients, the frequency of these two criteria was relatively low (17%) especially of the first mentioned variable. The presence of at least five of the seven 'pooled' CEH criteria (present in > or = 50% of the patients) might be deemed a reliable cut-off point, allowing the headache to be diagnosed as 'probable' CEH. If patients fulfilling M or HN criteria in addition to the CEH criteria are added to the 'pure' CEH group a total of 74% of Group A patients may have a CEH picture. The temporal pattern of pain and the quality of pain in Group A showed good sensitivity and specificity (> or = 75) when compared with Group B; therefore, the chances of diagnosing a definite CEH are significantly more frequent in patients presenting with unilateral pain that also begins as a neck pain. Head/neck trauma and radiological abnormalities in the cervical spine were not significantly associated with CEH, M or HN diagnoses. An improvement of the current diagnostic IHS criteria might make it possible to avoid the existing, partial overlap of CEH with HN and M. Extensive use should be made of the GON, and other, blockades in the routine work-up of CEH, both in the differential diagnosis and in the mixed forms (CEH + M, and CEH + HN), in order to improve the efficiency of the current diagnostic system."
CD007431,0,11180701,0,Surgical results of lumbar disc herniation in the elderly.,"We investigated the surgical results of lumbar disc herniation in the elderly. Ten elderly patients underwent surgical treatment between 1990 and 1999. There were 7 males and 3 females with a mean age of 68.2 years (range: 60~85 years). Thirteen patients in their 20s and 30s were used as a control. Preoperatively, severe leg pain and gait disturbance, and higher rates of negative straight leg-raising were shown in the elderly group. Higher levels of herniation and higher graded disc degeneration were shown compared with the young. The mean total of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score in the elderly group improved from 5.1 points to 13.1 points postoperatively, and that in the young group improved from 6.9 points to 14.5 points. The recovery rate was 82.6% in the elderly group and 94.3% in the young group. Postoperatively, the recovery of gait disturbance in the elderly group tended to be poor compared with the young group. The elderly patients would not tolerate bed rest and would often do poorly if kept recumbent and in pain for long periods of time. Satisfactory results are being sought with regard to the operative management of lumbar disc herniation in the elderly."
CD007431,0,8628931,0,[Magnetic resonance myelography with a fast-spin-echo sequence].,"A major application of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) consists in the ""myelographic effect"", characterized by high signal intensity of the CSF, which permits to visualize spinal subarachnoid spaces and nerve root sheaths. Such new ultrafast pulse sequences as fast spin echo (FSE) further enhance CSF high signal intensity. In addition, suppressing background with the fat suppression technique and with maximum intensity projection (MIP), a particular algorithm already used in MR angiography, FSE sequences yield 3D myelography-like images. Our study was aimed at assessing the clinical role and the reliability of this technique. Our preliminary experience is based on 21 patients with pain in the lower back and legs and on 5 healthy volunteers; all the myelography-like images were obtained with a 1.5-T MR system (Signa, General Electric). The parameters for FSE myelography-like images included: TR = 6000, TE = 200, ETL = 32, thickness = 3 mm, matrix = 256 x 224, Nex = 4, FOV = 20 cm, fat presaturation, no phase wrap, acquisition time = 2 min 58 s. MR myelography sequences were acquired after a standard FSE T1/T2-weighted exam. MR-myelography results confirmed the diagnosis of disk herniation made on conventional T1/T2-weighted images, especially in thecal sac compression and/or amputation of nerve root sheaths. MR myelography appeared to be especially useful in migrated disk herniation or in abnormal origin of nerve roots. Moreover, it allowed full and panoramic visualization of the subarachnoid spaces and excellent definition of the thecal sac, nerve roots and nerve root sheaths. In one patient only movement artifacts affected image quality. To conclude, even though it fails to yield any functional information, MR myelography appears to be an easy, rapid and noninvasive support to conventional MRI of the lumbar spine, to replace conventional myelography."

They also were compared with morphologic abnormalities (normal, bulging, protruded, and extruded) and signal alteration (high signal on T2-weighted images) of the disc. Image interpretation was decided by the consensus of two musculoskeletal radiologists. Enhancement was observed in 69 (32.6%) discs. The enhancement patterns were either intradiscal, linear of (79.7%) or nodular (10.2%), peridiscal (7.2%), or combined (2.9%). Thirty-five (77.8%) of the 45 herniated discs, 35 (77.8%) were enhanced, whereas 34 (20.6%) of 165 normal-appearing disc were enhanced. Enhancement was observed more frequently in discs with high signal intensity zones (P < 0.05). In the six patients with enhanced discs, surgery revealed granulation tissue in three extruded discs, two protruded discs, and one bulging disc. The authors believe that contrast enhancements are frequent in herniated discs and are not infrequent in normal-appearing discs. The understanding of various enhancement patterns may help in the interpretation of lumbar spine MRI."

CD007431,0,6450875,0,Lumbar dorsal ramus syndrome.,"Low back pain, referred pain in the lower limbs, and spasm of the back, gluteal, and hamstring muscles are clinical features which can be induced in normal volunteers by stimulating structures which are innervated by the lumbar dorsal rami. Conversely, they can be relieved in certain patients by selective interruption of conduction along dorsal rami. These facts permit the definition of a lumbar dorsal ramus syndrome, which can be distinguished from the intervertebral disc syndrome and other forms of low back pain. The distinguishing feature is that, in lumbar dorsal ramus syndrome, all the clinical features are exclusively mediated by dorsal rami and do not arise from nerve-root compression. The pathophysiology, pathology, and treatment of this syndrome are described. Recognition of this syndrome, and its treatment with relatively minor procedures, can obviate the need for major surgery which might otherwise be undertaken."

CD007431,0,8367766,0,The relationship of facet tropism to degenerative disc disease.,"The role of facet tropism (asymmetry) in the pathogenesis of degenerative disc disease is unknown, and several conflicting reports have been published. We studied this association using CT/discography performed at 324 lumbar levels (108 patients). The stage of disc degeneration as well as the patient's pain response upon discographic injection were scored using a standardized protocol. The facet angles were measured directly from the axial CT/discographic images and defined, in each case, as the angle formed by the facet orientation with respect to the midsagittal plane. The facet tropism angle was defined as the difference between the left and right facet angles at each disc level. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the tropism angles were calculated. From this calculation, each pair of facet joints was classified as symmetric (within 1 SD of the mean), moderately asymmetric (between 1 and 2 SD), or severely asymmetric (beyond 2 SD of the mean). There were no differences in degree of disc degeneration or pain response with respect to the facet tropism. The total facet angle was also studied. The total facet angle was greater at the more caudal levels. The total angle size was not associated, however, with disc degeneration or pain provocation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that there is an association between facet tropism and degenerative lumbar disc disease."

The purpose of the study was to establish the frequency of symptoms, clinical signs and tissue-specific diagnoses of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint in elderly subjects and their relation with respect to gender and type of prosthetic replacement. The study was conducted on 96 subjects, 48 complete denture wearers and 48 removable partial denture wearers, whose average age was 75.8 years. The diagnostic procedure used in this study was manual functional analysis consisting of specific techniques of dynamic compressions and translations in diagnosing internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint. Chi-square test for independent samples was used for statistical analysis of the results. The symptoms of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint were found in 9.3% of the subjects, and tissue-specific diagnoses were established in 52.1% of the subjects. The most common diagnoses were osteoarthrosis, total disk displacement with stable reposition and partial anterolateral disk displacement.

CD007431,0,1834038,0,Trigger point of the posterior iliac crest: painful iliolumbar ligament insertion or cutaneous dorsal ramus pain? An anatomic study.,"A trigger point is frequently found over the iliac crest at 7 to 8 cm from the midline in low-back-pain syndromes. Previously, this was described as either a painful insertion site of the iliolumbar ligament or pain in the distribution of the cutaneous dorsal ramus of the first or second lumbar nerve. The authors performed 37 dissections, and they report their anatomic findings. The iliac insertion of the iliolumbar ligament is inaccessible to palpation, being shielded by the iliac crest. The dorsal rami of L1 or L2 nerve roots, however, cross the crest at 7 cm from the midline, and this distance closely correlates with the dorsal projection of the iliolumbar ligament insertion. These rami are superficial and dorsal to the crest, easily accessible to palpation. In two of the 37 dissections performed, some rami were found to be narrowed as they crossed through an osteofibrous orifice over the crest, thus being susceptible to an entrapment neuropathy. The authors conclude that the trigger point sometimes localized over the iliac crest at 7 cm from the midline likely corresponds to elicited pain from a cutaneous dorsal ramus originating from the thoracolumbar junction rather than from the iliac insertion of the iliolumbar ligament."

CD007431,0,11525209,0,Diagnosis and treatment of piriformis syndrome.,"Piriformis syndrome remains a controversial diagnosis, despite its having first been described over 60 years ago. The controversy stems from several factors: variable and sometimes unclear cause, similarity to other more easily recognizable causes of sciatica, lack of consistent objective diagnostic findings, and relative rarity. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to infer that sciatic pain may be caused by compression anywhere along its length, from the spinal root level to the popliteal fossa, as is peripheral nerve entrapment elsewhere in the body. Pathologic changes at the greater sciatic notch may well be the source of sciatic pain and should be considered by the clinician. The diagnosis of piriformis syndrome remains one of exclusion, however, and in patients who present with sciatica, more common causes such as lumbar disease should be investigated and ruled out first. After excluding the most common causes of sciatica, physicians can use the criteria described here to investigate the possibility of piriformis syndrome. If properly diagnosed, it can often be treated effectively with either surgical or nonsurgical means."
CD007431,0,7596766,0,[Radiotherapy for vertebral metastases: analysis of symptoms and clinical effects by MR imaging].,"Fifty patients with 63 symptomatic vertebral metastases (18 sites: pain only, 28 sites: radiculopathy with pain, 17 sites: myelopathy) were treated by radiotherapy. Primary lesions were located in the lung (9 cases), breast (9 cases) colorectal area (9 cases), prostate (7 cases) and so on. We correlated the radiologic findings, symptoms and clinical effects with metastatic features which were classified into 4 types by MR imaging: non-deformity, expanding, vertebral collapse, and destructive mass. Each type of metastasis was accompanied with or without epidural tumor. Osteolytic metastases were apt to create features of deformity (expanding type: 18 vertebrae, vertebral collapse type: 17 vertebrae, destructive mass type: 9 vertebrae). The features of osteoblastic metastases were no deformity (18 vertebrae) and expanding type (2 vertebrae). The symptom of pain only occurred most frequently in the lumbosacral spine. The vertebral body deformity of symptomatic sites was relatively slight (non-deformity type: 6 sites, expanding type: 6 sites, vertebral collapse type: 6 sites), and epidural tumors were seen at only 2 sites. The effect of radiotherapy was excellent (complete pain relief: 64.7%, partial pain relief: 29.4%). Radiculopathy occurred most frequently in the lumbar spine. Vertebral body deformity was noted in most symptomatic sites (expanding type: 9 sites, vertebral collapse type: 10 sites, destructive mass type: 2 sites). Complete relief was obtained in 6 sites (22. 2%), partial relief in 18 (63.0%). Myelopathy occurred most often in the thoracic spine, followed by the lumbar spine. The vertebral body deformity was severe (expanding type: 3 cases, vertebral collapse type: 3 cases, destructive mass type: 6 cases). Epidural tumors were also present in all but one case. Six of 13 patients treated with radiation alone improved. These 6 patients had non-deformity or expanding types with epidural tumor. No improvement was seen in the vertebral collapse type with epidural tumor or destructive mass type."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of motion measurements in the assessment of LBP. The motion characteristics of 138 LBP subjects were investigated, and the data compared with a previously published database of normal subjects. Values of range of motion and angular velocity were obtained for all subjects in each plane of motion. Analysis of these motion characteristics demonstrated significant differences (P < 0.0001) between the two populations; however both populations demonstrated considerable intersubject variation. Multiple regression analysis revealed that some of the variance in the LBP population was attributable to the underlying diagnosis. Patients with a spondylolisthesis tended to be hypermobile whilst those with spinal stenosis, disc prolapse or degenerative disc disease tended to be hypomobile. All diagnostic groups showed impairments in their velocity characteristics."

Thirty consecutive patients are included, all with a contained lumbar disc herniation on magnetic resonance imaging. There was a significant reduction in the sciatic pain and straight leg raising (SLR) test postoperatively at all the different measurements in the early course except for the sciatic pain at 2 weeks. On the same occasions, there was no change in the back pain or the Oswestry score. Ten patients needed subsequent open surgery. For the remaining patients, the long-term result showed a significant and unchanged improvement in the sciatic pain and SLR. In addition, the Oswestry score had now significantly improved. The failure rate of APLD turned out to be unacceptably high in this study, because 38% of the patients needed subsequent open surgery. However, an early satisfactory course also seemed to imply a beneficial long-term prognosis."
CD007431,0,7866858,0,Tomoscintigraphy of the lumbar spine: prospects and clinical application.,"In an in vivo prospective study, we examined the lumbar spine of 18 patients presenting with a first episode of acute low-back pain with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Scintigraphic activity at L2 was considered 100%, and the other levels were quantified in relation to L2. MRI scans were rated for disc signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The results show that an abnormal intervertebral MRI signal corresponds with an abnormal image on tomoscintigraphy. On tomoscintographic profiles, the disappearance of the 'discal dip' corresponds well with degeneration on MRI. Furthermore, a positive MRI at one level appears to influence other levels at which a significantly higher scintigraphic activity was observed. Of patients with acute LBP 50% had a normal disc SPECT; it is concluded that in these cases a non-discal origin for the pain must be sought."

A preliminary study.,"This article reports on a study of 51 consecutive patients (83 lumbar discs) with back pain who underwent anterior interbody lumbar fusion or combined anterior and posterior fusion at the same operation during a 2-year period. All patients met the criteria for diagnosis of a painful internal disc disruption and/or failed back syndrome and have had a lengthy trial of conservative treatment consisting of rest, physical therapy, back support, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, and guarded activity; this treatment was often supplemented by epidural cortisone injections, pain management, and functional rehabilitation. Patients with prolonged back pain who failed with conservative care after a minimum of 12 months of severely disabling symptoms were selected for surgery on the basis of a positive dynamic discogram reproducing their exact pain and demonstrating a morphologically degenerative disc (internal disc disruption). For the purpose of this study, patients were categorized into three groups and followed up for 15-36 months after the operation. There were no deaths or major complications, and the overall success in achieving measurable diminution of preoperative pain was 80%. This article discusses preliminary conclusions on the efficacy and safety on anterior and anteroposterior fusion for lumbar disc pain."

Nineteen oarsmen and 20 male controls matched for age, height and body mass performed a series of isokinetic and isometric strength tests on an isokinetic dynamometer. These strength tests focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Comparisons of strength were made between and within groups for right and left symmetry patterns, hamstring: quadriceps ratios, and trunk flexor and extensor ratios. The results revealed no left and right asymmetries in either the knee extensor or flexor strength parameters (including both isometric and isokinetic measures). Knee extensor strength was significantly greater in the rowing population, but knee flexor strength was similar between the two groups. No difference was seen between the groups for the hamstring: quadriceps strength ratio. In the rowing population, stroke side had no influence on leg strength. No differences were observed in the isometric strength of the trunk flexors and extensors between groups, although EMG activity was significantly higher in the rowing population. Patterns of asymmetry of muscle activity were observed between the left and right erector spinae muscles during extension, which was significantly related to rowing side (P < 0.01). These observations could be related to the high incidence of low back pain in oarsmen."
CD007431,0,9577926,0,Short-term prognostic factors in lumbar disc surgery: the low back prognostic score is of predictive value.,"In order to determine prognostic factors of lumbar disc surgery, we examined 107 patients who were conventionally operated on in a prospective, consecutive study. We analysed general data, the case history, the neurological examination at admission and all data from imaging examinations and therapy. In addition, all patients received a questionnaire based on the Low Back Outcome Score [9, 10]. The patients were re-examined after 2-8 months (103 days mean). According to their ratings on a pain grading scale, the patients were divided into a group with favorable and another with unfavorable results. These groups were analysed in relation to the patients' initial condition. At follow up, 88% of the patients had either completely recovered or their complaints had been relieved. According to the Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS), 64.5% went well. Used to evaluate the initial condition of the patients on admission the LBOS was able to predict favorable outcome in 68% and unfavorable outcome in 50%. To improve the prognostic value, we combined significant questions of the LBOS with the pain grading scale and significant prognostic factors to form a new prognostic score (Low Back Prognostic Score). With this new score we were able to predict a favorable outcome in 84% of our patients, and an unfavorable outcome in 71%. The Low Back Prognostic score seems to provide a sensitive method for predicting a favorable or unfavorable outcome for patients scheduled to undergo lumbar disc surgery."
CD007431,0,6320020,0,[Painful sciatic rubbing caused by benign synovioma of the spinal joints. Apropos of 4 cases].,"Synovioma, a benign neoplasm arising from pigmented villonodular synovium or synovitis, is uncommon. It involves the tendons and joints of the finger, ankle and foot. In this study four cases of villonodular synovioma of spinal joints are reported. The authors studied 555 cases of patients operated for sciatica due to herniated disk. Histopathology showed that in four out of 555 cases sciatica was found to be due to synoviomas of the spinal joints. The patients, three women and one man, were between 54 and 70 years of age and each had had a long history of low back pain with episodes of sciatica. Clinical evaluation at the time of surgery showed moderate severity of signs and symptoms. Roentgenographic studies of all four cases revealed osteoarthritic changes of vertebral apophyses, with two cases of spondylolisthesis. The pathogenesis of synovioma remains controversial and its histopathological characterization -hyperplasia VS/true tumours- has not yet been determined. It is possible that the number of recorded cases of sciatica due to synoviomas is small because surgical and pathological studies in patients with sciatica associated with osteoarthritic changes have not been adequately performed. Surgery consists of a large resection of the capsule and ligament including resection of intraspinal extension. Because this study involves only four cases, the first of which occurred in 1977, the possibility of recurrence cannot be evaluated."

This article reviews the most common injuries described in the literature, including musculoskeletal problems in the lower back, ribs, shoulder, wrist and knee. A review of basic rowing physiology and equipment is included, along with a description of the mechanics of the rowing stroke. This information is necessary in order to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment protocol for these injuries, which are mainly chronic in nature. The most frequently injured region is the low back, mainly due to excessive hyperflexion and twisting, and can include specific injuries such as spondylolysis, sacroiliac joint dysfunction and disc herniation. Rib stress fractures account for the most time lost from on-water training and competition. Although theories abound for the mechanism of injury, the exact aetiology of rib stress fractures remains unknown. Other injuries discussed within, which are specific to ribs, include costochondritis, costovertebral joint subluxation and intercostal muscle strains. Shoulder pain is quite common in rowers and can be the result of overuse, poor technique, or tension in the upper body. Injuries concerning the forearm and wrist are also common, and can include exertional compartment syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, deQuervain's and intersection syndrome, and tenosynovitis of the wrist extensors. In the lower body, the major injuries reported include generalised patellofemoral pain due to abnormal patellar tracking, and iliotibial band friction syndrome. Lastly, dermatological issues, such as blisters and abrasions, and miscellaneous issues, such as environmental concerns and the female athlete triad, are also included in this article.Pathophysiology, mechanism of injury, assessment and management strategies are outlined in the text for each injury, with special attention given to ways to correct biomechanical or equipment problems specific to rowing. By gaining an understanding of basic rowing biomechanics and training habits, the physician and/or healthcare provider will be better equipped to treat and prevent injuries in the rowing population."

In 63 cases the clinical symptom complex was that of sciatic pains, in the remaining 25 cases no neurological defect was found. In 63 cases operation was done and 45 of them intervertebral disc prolapse was found. The decision to operate was based on the refractoriness and intensity of pain, presence of neurological defect and radiculography performed in 36 cases.

CD007431,0,4000674,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of the narrow lumbar spinal canal].,"In 30%-40% of the patients who are operated on for herniation of lumbar discs, osseous stenosis plays a certain role. However, only in one-third of them are special operative measures such as laminectomy necessary with or without additional lumbar fusion. When spondylodesis is carried out after laminectomy it is often combined with metal implant, which can drastically reduce the time a patient requires perioperative treatment. In younger patients showing typical signs of nerve root compression due to osseous stenosis of lateral recess, only segmental decompression in the form of foraminotomy is done. On the other hand, in cases of narrow spinal canal, which is found in elderly patients, neurogenic intermittent claudication is the predominant clinical picture. Kyphosis, scoliosis, and vertebral displacement can lead to local spinal stenosis. On addition, local pressure and tension on unstabile segments in combination with secondary fibrosis can lead to compression of the neural structures. The diagnosis is based on the clinical history and myelography. Computed tomography helps reveal the presence of herniation of a lumbar disc, which should be simultaneously operated upon. For the operative treatment there is no age limit. All in all, the operative results are so good that one is inclined to decide in favour of operation."

Results of 38 repeat operations].,"Lumbar epiduro-arachnoiditis is a well-known complication of surgery of the intervertebral disc. The epidural fibrous scar is the normal outcome of inflammatory activity secondary to the mechanical tissue disturbance resulting from surgery. In certain individuals, perhaps genetically predisposed as excessive quantity of fibrous tissue is deposited in the epi and/or nitradural space. This abnormal situation, comparable to cheloid cutaneous scars, is perhaps at the origin of the clinical symptoms. The authors report the clinical and radiological signs observed in 38 patients having had at least one operation for discal hernia, and who underwent further operations in the aim of freeing the roots and the dural sack from fibrous compression. Results of excision of the epidural ""cheloid"" were good in 13 cases, and average in 8 others. There was a complete failure in 17 other patients. Three explanations were offered to explain the frequency of the failures: 1) formation of a new cheloid, 2) difficulty of neurolysis of the arachnoiditis, 3) possibility of intrinsic lesions of the nerve associated with the epiduro-arachnoiditis."
CD007431,0,6217517,0,[70 patients operated on for sciatica without herniated disk].,"Seventy patients suffering from sciatica were operated in whom no disc herniation was found. In 42 instances, compression of bony origin was found. These cases were either due to general narrowing of the spinal canal with signs in the distribution of several roots with neurological intermittent claudication, or to narrowing of the lateral recess or intervertebral foramen with involvement of only one root. Decompressive surgery was always beneficial for pain. In 20 instances a disc was found to be only bulging; disc excision was performed in 17 of these patients. In 8 instances, no abnormality was found. Some patients were nevertheless cured by disc excision, a single laminectomy being useful. The incidence of additional psychological problems is discussed. It is concluded that the clinical signs should guide the surgeon rather than the radiological findings in decisions for surgical treatment. Patients who have been correctly treated by conservative means for an adequate time should be systematically operated on if they have not shown sufficient clinical improvement."
CD007431,0,9416012,0,Changes in stature following plyometric drop-jump and pendulum exercises.,"The aim of this study was to compare the changes in stature following the performance of plyometric exercises using drop-jumps and a pendulum swing. Eight male participants aged 21.7 +/- 1.8 years with experience of plyometric training gave their informed consent to act as participants. Participants undertook two exercise regimens and a 15-min standing test in a random order. The exercises entailed the performance of 50 drop-jumps from a height of 0.28 m or 50 pendulum rebounds. Participants were instructed to perform maximal jumps or rebounds using a 'bounce' style. Measurements of stature were performed after a 20-min period of standing (pre-exercise), 2-min after exercise (post-exercise) and after a 20-min standing recovery (recovery). Back pain and muscle soreness were assessed using an analogue-visual scale, at each of the above times and also 24 and 36 h after the test. Peak torque during isokinetic knee extension at 1.04 rads-1 was measured immediately before and after the exercise bouts, to assess the degree of muscular fatigue. Ground/wall reaction force data were recorded using a Kistler force platform mounted in the floor for drop-jumps and vertically on the rebound wall for pendulum exercises. Drop-jumps resulted in the greatest (p < 0.05) change in stature (-2.71 +/- 0.8 mm), compared to pendulum exercises (-1.77 +/- 0.7 mm) and standing (-0.39 +/- 0.2 mm). Both exercise regimens resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in stature when compared to the standing condition. Drop-jumps resulted in significantly greater peak impact forces (p < 0.05) than pendulum exercises (drop-jumps = 3.2 +/- 0.5 x body weight, pendulum = 2.6 +/- 0.5 x body weight). The two exercise conditions both invoked a small degree of muscle soreness but there were no significant differences between conditions. Both exercise regimens resulted in a non-significant decrease in peak torque indicating a similar degree of muscular fatigue. Based on the lower shrinkage resulted and lower peak forces, it can be concluded that pendulum exercises pose a lower injury potential to the lower back than drop-jumps performed from a height of 28 cm."

CD007431,0,15977116,0,[The delayed OP--indications for surgery of lumbar disc herniations].,"In Germany, lumbar disc herniations require surgical treatment in about 50,000 patients/year. The clinical and socio-economical results are determined by the preoperative duration of symptoms and preoperative time out of work (highly predictive). Other parameters such as severity of neurological deficits, morphology of disc herniation, age, associated diseases, type of surgery, working conditions or litigation processes are only weak predictors of outcome. Postoperative improvement of clinical symptoms as well as professional reintegration is strongly determined by the time period between onset of symptoms and surgery. Surgery performed ""too early"" diminishes the chance for improvement by conservative therapy. If surgery is performed ""too late"" the risk of a bad result is high, and the reintegration of the patient into his preoperative social and professional activities may be prevented. The duration of conservative therapy including so-called semi-invasive procedures is critical in this sense. If a therapeutic success (= professional and social reintegration) cannot be achieved by conservative measures and if there is a clear morphological correlate (= disc herniations with corresponding clinical symptoms) of the clinical symptoms an early change of the strategy towards surgical therapy is recommended."

CD007431,0,7619623,0,Clinical results after percutaneous automated lumbar nucleotomy. A follow-up study.,"This study was carried out in order to assess the clinical results after percutaneous automated nucleotomy with regard to predictive factors for the outcome. Selection criteria included patients with predominance of low-back pain, diffuse posterior disk bulges and concomitant spinal stenosis who are not normally accepted for nucleotomy. In all, 142 patients were treated. The overall success rate after an average observation time of 21 months was 56%. The results were not influenced by whether a diffuse posterior bulge or a focal hernia had been treated or not (p = 0.449). Spinal stenosis (p = 0.043) and disk space narrowing exceeding 25% of the expected width (p = 0.017) were associated with a poor outcome. By excluding these categories and patients with symptoms from more than one disk level, the success rate rose to 70%. With this selection, the results were equally good in patients with predominantly low-back pain compared to those with predominantly sciatica (p = 0.490)."
CD007431,0,438234,0,Management of severe spondylolisthesis in children and adolescents.,"Forty-three patients with a fifth lumbar-first sacral spondylolisthesis of 50 per cent or greater were reviewed. Four had been treated non-operatively; eleven, by arthrodesis; eighteen, by decompression and arthrodesis; and ten, by reduction and arthrodesis. The angle of slipping (measurement of the kyphotic relationship of the fifth lumbar to the first sacral vertebra) was found to be as important a measurement as the percentage of slipping in measuring instability and progression of slipping. Hamstring tightness did not correlate with neural deficit. Arthrodesis alone, even in the presence of minor neural deficits, tight hamstrings, or both, gave relief of pain and resolution of neural deficits and tight hamstrings. Our experience with a limited number of patients suggests that management by postoperative extension casts may achieve a significant reduction in percentage of slipping and in angle of slipping. Progression of the spondylolisthesis may occur following a solid arthrodesis."
CD007431,0,2303509,0,Elective discectomy for herniation of a lumbar disc. Additional experience with an objective method.,"An objective evaluation for the assessment of patients who have persistent low-back pain and sciatica was tested in eighty-four patients who were operated on by one of us (D.M.S.). In this scoring system, there are four major categories for preoperative assessment: neurological signs, sciatic-tension signs, psychological factors, and imaging studies. When the preoperative scores of the eighty-four patients were correlated with the findings at operation, the three patients who had the lowest scores were the only ones in whom the operative findings were negative. As shown by statistical analysis, the score for imaging studies correlated best with the operative findings. In contrast, in the sixty-one patients who were followed sufficiently to determine the clinical outcome, the psychological score was the best predictor of the outcome of treatment. On the basis of these studies, we concluded that the use of this objective scoring system reduced the incidence of negative findings at exploration of the disc and improved the clinical result after elective discectomy. The higher the score was preoperatively, the more likely the patient was to have a good result after discectomy."
CD007431,0,16759773,0,Sagittal plane motion in the human lumbar spine: comparison of the in vitro quasistatic neutral zone and dynamic motion parameters.,"Disabling low back pain is often attributed to clinical instability but defining instability is problematic. The most common parameter used to characterize instability in the lab is the neutral zone which is measured with a quasi-static technique. But, it cannot be measured from continuous motion data. Our goal was to describe the relationship between the quasi-static neutral zone and dynamic motion parameters that might reflect laxity about the neutral position. We also sought to determine if dynamic parameters were correlated with disc degeneration."
CD007431,0,7124191,0,[Problem of the early recognition of spinal cord tumors].,Two thirds of a group of patients with 40 space-restricting processes in the region of the spinal canal were submitted to an operation in the stage of an incomplete transverse syndrome. A striking fact was that these patients had tumours of different histological classifications which were localised in the thoracic and thoraco-lumbal transitional region Tumours in the cervical and cervico-thoracic transitional region were mainly operated on in their early stages. They had a considerably shorter period of anamnesis from the beginning of the clinical symptoms up to the operation. A cause of the different periods of anamnesis with different localisations is discussed.

CD007431,0,10666490,0,Bone mineral density and muscle strength in young men with mental retardation (with and without Down syndrome).,"The objective of this study was to compare the bone mineral density (BMD) of men with Down syndrome (DS) to otherwise mentally retarded (MR) men and to investigate whether leg muscle strength of these patients is related to BMD. Two groups with MR (with and without DS) participated in the study, having met the following criteria: similar age, moderate to mild mental retardation, Tanner stage V of sexual development, similar age of beginning to walk, and equal motor activities. The DS group consisted of 8 men 23.9 +/- 4.2 years, and the MR group without DS consisted of 8 men 23.5 +/- 3.6 years. The two groups were compared with 10 sedentary students of the same age range (25.9 +/- 2.9 years) attending our University. The BMD of the 2(nd) to 4(th) lumbar vertebrae was measured in the PA projection and the mean density was expressed as g/cm(2). The isokinetic muscle strength of the right quadriceps femoris and hamstrings muscles was measured on a Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer. The value measured was peak torque at angular velocities at 60, 120, and 300 degrees.sec(-1). The results showed that BMD in DS individuals versus young adults (reference group of the scanner) was lower at the 26% level (T-score - 2.66 +/- 0.29) and significantly lower (P = 0.002) than that of the MR group. Significantly different muscle strength was observed between the DS and non-DS MR group (in quadriceps at 300 degrees.s(-1): P < 0.01, at 120 and 60 degrees. s(-1): P < 0.05; in hamstrings at 300 degrees.s(-1): P < 0.05). Higher differences in muscle strength were found between MR and control men, but no significant difference existed in BMD between them. Bivariate correlation showed that quadriceps strength significantly predicted the BMD in the DS patients. Active lifestyle and increased physical exercise to improve muscular strength should be instituted to avoid the development of osteoporosis in DS patients."
CD007431,0,2326476,0,Cauda equina syndrome complicating ankylosing spondylitis.,"The cauda equina syndrome is an uncommon and poorly understood complication of ankylosing spondylitis. The clinical and radiologic findings in five patients with this syndrome are described. Typical findings include cutaneous sensory impairment of the lower limbs and perineum with sphincter disturbances. Motor impairment occurs less frequently, and associated pain is an inconstant feature. Enlargement of the caudal sac and dorsal arachnoid diverticula that erode the lamina and spinous processes are characteristic myelographic and computed tomographic findings. The pathogenesis of the cauda equina syndrome in ankylosing spondylitis remains unknown but may be due to demyelination, post-irradiation ischemia, or compression from spinal arachnoiditis."

The technique of percutaneous minimally invasive neurolysis described by Racz is being performed increasingly to treat chronic radiculopathy. A total of 61 patients with corresponding symptomatology after screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria in the region of the lumbar spinal nerve were treated with the Racz catheter technique. Distinct clinical improvement was observed at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups after percutaneous minimally invasive epidural neurolysis. Subjective pain perception, quantified by the McNab score, clearly improved after 3 as well as 6 months. With the exception of partial catheter shearing in two cases and one occurrence of infection, no relevant side effects were noted. The Racz catheter technique for treatment of chronic radiculopathy following disk surgery is suitable with minimal side effects."

One hundred three patients (14%) required a second posterior procedure, but only 24 (3%) cases represented true recurrent radiculopathy. There were 13 minor complications (1.5%) and no deaths or detectable incidence of air embolism. All operations were done with the patient in the sitting position. Central venous pressure monitoring was used only infrequently. There was a 96% incidence of relief of significant arm pain and/or paresthesia and a 98% incidence of resolution of preoperatively present motor deficit. Eight hundred twenty-eight procedures (98%) were preceded by Pantopaque cervical myelography. There was a 71.5% incidence of correlation between preoperative clinical findings (both sensory and motor) and operative findings. In 13% of the cases, two spaces were thought by the operating surgeon to be equally involved by the spondylotic process. Most (91.5%) of the patients describe themselves as either ""good or excellent"" postoperatively. There was no significant difference postoperatively regarding results or recurrence between patients with suspected soft or hard disc protrusions and those with strictly spondylotic radiculopathy. Nor was there any statistical difference in results among the three patient population groups (""private"" vs. compensation vs. liability). The mean length of time to return to work or other ""normal"" activities was 9.4 weeks. The mean length of follow-up time was 146 weeks (2.8 years). There was an associated incidence of significant lumbar disc and/or foraminal disease requiring operation of 33.4%."

Report of three cases.,"The authors report three cases of neurinoma of the cauda equina initially misdiagnosed as prolapsed lumbar disk. Computed Tomography failed to reveal the tumour, while showing evidence of disk-degenerative patology and being thus misleading. Similar cases are reported in literature. After a thorough analysis of the causes of such an apparently gross error, it is concluded that the main source of pitfalls arises from neglecting those typical clinical features differentiating prolapsed disk from oncogenetic sciatica. When oncogenetic sciatica is suspected Computed Tomography is inappropriate and even misleading, while the elective investigation is Magnetic Resonance."
CD007431,0,16421883,0,Meralgia paresthetica: clinical and electrophysiological diagnosis in 120 cases.,"We report the results of clinical and electrophysiological examinations in 131 cases of meralgia paresthetica (MP) among 120 unselected patients, 69 men and 51 women, aged 15-81 years. All patients experienced permanent or intermittent pain, and all but one had permanent sensory impairment of the thigh. The lateral aspect of the thigh was solely involved in 88 cases and the anterior aspect was also or exclusively involved in 32 cases. The right thigh was involved 62 times and the left 58 times. Symptom duration varied from 2 weeks to 20 years. The initial diagnosis was meralgia paresthetica in 47 cases (39%), root disease in 35 cases, and osteoarthritis in 6 cases; no diagnosis was proposed in the 32 remaining cases. Two cases had undergone previous spine surgery for disk herniation, with no benefit. A precise cause could explain the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) lesion in 46 cases, the other 74 cases being considered idiopathic (25% of patients were obese). Only one case required surgery to relieve symptoms. LFCN conduction was studied orthodromically, distally from the anterior superior iliac spine. The side-to-side amplitude ratio (ssRatio) was greater than 2.3 in 118 of 120 patients (98.3%) and was a better index to confirm a lesion of the LFCN than SNAP amplitude, which was abnormal (less than 3 microV) in 88 cases (73.3%). Only two of the 11 bilateral cases had an ssRatio lower than 2.3 (they were both 2.0). An ssRatio of 2.3 or more and a SNAP amplitude lower than 3 microV provided a specificity of 98.75% or more. The mean axonal loss was 88%. These clinical and electrophysiological data highlight the central role the neurophysiologist should play in diagnosing MP by means of an LFCN conduction study."
CD007431,0,6446161,0,The relation between biomechanical and psychological factors in patients with low-back pain.,"Behavioral factors are increasingly being recognized for their role in determining the course and outcome of low-back disorders. This paper examines the relation between behavioral variables, which include psychological symptoms and pain tolerance, and biomechanical variables. The majority of the 89 patients tested could be classified into two groups. One group was intolerant of pain and showed reduced spinal mobility, restricted straight leg raising, and altered flexor-extensor muscle balance. The other group was more tolerant of pain and did not show restriction of motion or muscle imbalance. Spinal mobility was also related to psychological symptoms. A model is proposed which points to a feedback between spinal motion and the patient's ability to cope with pain as one mechanism that determines return to a functional range of motion."

CD007431,0,2402700,0,Lumbar spinal fusion. Assessment of functional stability with magnetic resonance imaging.,"Segmental spinal instability was evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computed tomography (CT), and conventional radiography in 33 patients who had undergone surgical spinal fusion. In 16 of the 19 patients who had a diagnosis of solid fusion, the immobilized vertebral bodies demonstrated areas of high signal intensity on images with short repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE). The signal intensity of these areas was either less intense or normal on images with long TR and TE. In 10 of the 14 patients with segmental instability at the fusion site, subchondral vertebral bands of low signal intensity were shown on short TR/TE images, which demonstrated high signal intensity on long TR/TE images. All but two of the patients showed vertebral signal changes 12 or more months past fusion or onset of clinical symptoms. The vertebral MR signal intensity in solid lumbar fusions might be related to marrow composition changes resulting from decreased biomechanical stress, while the vertebral signal intensities in patients with unstable fusions might be related to reparative granulation tissue, inflammation, edema, and hyperemic changes. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be unique in its assessment of functional fusion stability. Magnetic resonance may be most useful in patients symptomatic of fusion pseudarthrosis in whom conventional radiography and CT fail to demonstrate anatomic disruption."

CD007431,0,1490039,0,Comparison of MRI and discography in the diagnosis of lumbar degenerative disc disease.,"Recent reports have attempted to compare the relative value of discography and MRI in the evaluation of lumbar degenerative disc disease. None has compared the accuracy of the two techniques in regard to the detection of disc herniation specifically, and none has offered surgical correlation. In this prospective study, both techniques were used to evaluate 264 disc levels in 90 patients with incapacitating low back pain or radicular pain. The results showed an 86% agreement level both between tests and between the orthopaedist and radiologist on each test. Surgical findings agreed with diagnostic studies at 63 of 76 levels in 57 patients who underwent operative treatment. An analysis of the relative sensitivity and specificity of each test in the diagnosis of degeneration and herniation revealed that the greater sensitivity of MRI in the detection of herniation was the only statistically significant difference (p < 0.05)."

Within 3 years, 64% of these patients developed symptoms of lumbosacral radiculopathy. The clinical features of these patients comprise a syndrome significantly different from that typically associated with classical lumbar disc herniation: the syndrome described here carries a much higher incidence of silent root compression with minimal pain. Incidental lumbar myelographic defects are not necessarily benign findings, and patients in whom they are encountered deserve close clinical follow-up review and appropriate treatment if the defects become symptomatic."

Enhanced MR imaging was performed on 115 patients treated surgically for lumbar disc herniation. Nerve root enhancement was seen in 39.1% of the patients preoperatively and in 58.7% postoperatively. Preoperative root enhancement reflects the radicular pain intensity rather than the degree of neurological deficits, whereas postoperative enhancement did not correlate with the radicular symptoms. Nerve root enhancement represents an intraneural edema in the affected nerve root. Enhanced MR imaging is a potential method for the identification of an affected nerve root in patients with a discrepancy between the level of disc herniation and neurological manifestations."

CD007431,0,8483516,0,Surgical treatment and results in patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenoses.,"Stenosis of the lumbar spinal canal is contributing to 3-5% of all patients operated on a lumbar nerve root compression syndrome. Morphologically, a reduction of the midsagittal diameter of the spinal canal to less than 12 mm or stenoses of the lateral recessus or foramen intervertebrale have been described. In our department 37 patients with a lumbar spinal stenosis have been surgically treated between 1982 and 1987. Spinal stenosis is a disease of aged patients mostly suffering for a long history. The main symptoms are lumbar and sciatic pains, neurological deficits and a claudicatio intermittens spinalis. Neuroradiologically, the diagnosis can be confirmed by CT, myelography or MRI. These studies were demonstrating the stenosis in 69% at the level of L4/5, multiple stenoses have been found in 22% of all cases. An additional disc herniation existed in 35% of the patients. Concerning the specific complaints of the patients and their neuroradiological findings, the extent of the surgical decompression was decided on individually in each patient. We performed 22 laminectomies, 11 hemilaminectomies, in 3 cases an extended flavectomy and in one case an implantation of a dorsal column stimulation device. The postoperative follow-up period, ranging from 3 months to 3 years, demonstrated a complete recovery in 53%, a marked reduction of complaints in 44% of all cases. One patient did not respond to surgical treatment, but in the remaining cases surgical treatment led to satisfactory results."

Using a qualitative rating scale, 92 cases were analyzed retrospectively whose primary diagnosis was questioned because of conflicting data from clinical, neuroradiological and neurophysiological testing. In conclusion SEP techniques proved to be a useful tool in exclusing other e.g. demyelinating diseases. Except for the time-consuming method of segmental stimulation, the demonstration of the functional deficit itself by SEP techniques in general was frequently disappointing. The contribution of the different SEP parameters to clinical decision making and the clinical consequences are briefly discussed."

CD007431,0,6225597,0,Spinal manipulative therapy. A status report.,"Spinal manipulative therapy is one of the most commonly used treatments for patients with low back pain. It is both a manual diagnostic and a treatment method. Manual diagnosis includes the palpation of vertebral position, vertebral motion, joint play, end feel, soft tissue texture changes, and muscle contracture. Manipulative treatment can be divided into seven categories: long-lever, nonspecific manipulation; specific, short-lever high-velocity spinal adjustments; active or functional manipulation; mobilization; manual traction; soft tissue massage; and point pressure manipulation. Clinical experience with manipulation for low back pain is extensive, and controlled observations show that it is possible to produce immediate relief of pain in some cases. The effectiveness of manipulation is greatest in patients who have acute pain and no leg pain or neurologic deficits. Long-term effects of manipulation have not been demonstrated. Manipulation appears to increase spinal range of motion and straight leg raising but is not known to reduce intervertebral disc herniations. Complications following manipulation, although rare, can be catastrophic."

The technique consists of mechanical decompression of the herniated intervertebral disc without total excision. Only one-space discs were treated by this method. Sciatica was the predominant clinical symptom in 30 cases, and lumbar pain in 9 cases. Good to very good results were obtained in 70% of patients with sciatica and in 55% of patients with lumbar pain. After 4 cases of nucleotomy performed after failure of nucleolysis were excluded, the proportion of very good results rose to 77% in sciatica. Conversely, it seems that a number of failed nucleotomies can be treated by nucleolysis. Nucleotomy is very well tolerated and deserves to be used as first-line treatment of single and radiologically well documented lumbar disc herniations."

An attempt was made to distinguish before re-operation whether the residue symptoms were due to recurrence of, or a fresh disc herniation, or to extradural scarring. Persistence of pain after the initial operation or the time interval before pain re-appeared did not help to distinguish the causative pathology. A recurrent disc herniation was found if a different disc was involved, but was else best distinguished by myelographic demonstration of a short indentation in the contrast column at the level of a disc or a short root sleeve with a thickened associated nerve root. An absence of indentation in the column suggested extradural scarring. At re-operation disc herniation and extradural scarring without herniation were found in approximately equal numbers of patients."

Sector CT scanning demonstrates preoperatively which neural foramina are narrow. This information, correlated with the patient's history and physical examination, indicates which foramina should be operated on and prevents unnecessary exploration of normal neural foramina. CT findings were confirmed surgically in 14 patients. Eleven of these 14 patients had excellent postoperative results and remain pain free."

Studies have stressed that misdiagnosis of root entrapment significantly contributes to the incidence of failed back syndrome. In an attempt to aid the proper selection of surgical candidates, dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials ( DSSEP ) have been used in conjunction with standard diagnostic techniques to evaluate our patients. The advantage of this technique lies in the root specificity. The authors studied the DSSEP using two methods. In Method 1, using myelograms as the standard, the accuracy was 85.7%. In Method II, using surgical outcome as the standard, the accuracy was 87.5%. As a result, the authors have found the noninvasive, relatively inexpensive DSSEP to be a useful adjunct in the selection of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery."
CD007431,0,15725222,0,Repetitive painful stimulation produces an expansion of withdrawal reflex receptive fields in humans.,"The aims of the present study were to investigate whether temporal summation of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex depends on the stimulation site on the sole of the human foot, and to characterize the reflex receptive fields (RRF) of lower limb muscles to repetitive stimulation. The cutaneous RRFs were assessed in 15 subjects in sitting position by recording the EMG from five lower leg muscles and the kinematic responses (ankle, knee, and hip joints) to repetitive painful electrical stimulation. The stimulus consisted of a series of five stimuli (frequency: 3 Hz) delivered randomly at 10 different sites on the sole of the foot. The size of the reflexes increased generally between the first and the second stimulus, however, the increment depended on the stimulation site. In tibialis anterior, the RRF covered the distal sole of the foot and gradually expanded during the stimulus train. No expansion toward the heel area was detected. In soleus, the reflexes were facilitated after the second stimulus at all sites and remained in this state until the last stimulus. In vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, and iliopsoas a gradual expansion of the RRF was seen, resulting in RRFs covering the lateral, distal foot, and part of the proximal foot (iliopsoas). Knee and hip flexion were evoked at all sites. Ankle dorsiflexion was evoked at the distal foot, while ankle plantarflexion was evoked at the heel. The enlargement of the RRF reflects spinal temporal summation leading to gradually stronger reflex responses. The degree of temporal summation was dependent on stimulation site. The facilitation of the withdrawal reflex responses due to repetitive stimulation might have potential applications in the rehabilitation engineering field, where these reflexes could be used to assist gait of patients with central nervous system injuries."
CD007431,0,6630258,0,The indications for metrizamide myelography. Relationship with complications after myelography.,"To test the validity of our impression that in the absence of objective clinical evidence of nerve-root impingement there is a disproportionately high incidence of complications associated with myelography, the results in 248 patients were reviewed retrospectively and those in 110 were studied prospectively. Of all 358 patients, 53 per cent had complications after myelography with injection of metrizamide, of which headache and nausea and vomiting were the most frequent. The incidence of complications in the 112 patients whose objective clinical and myelographic findings were consistent was compared with that in the 180 patients who had only subjective complaints and normal myelographic findings. The incidence of complications was 30 per cent in the former group and 70 per cent in the latter group, an almost twofold difference (p greater than 0.05). The 110 patients in the prospective study were asked to grade the intensity of their headache after myelography. Of the thirty-one patients with positive objective clinical and myelographic findings, ten complained of headache, which was mild in seven (70 per cent) and severe in three. Of the sixty patients with only subjective complaints, thirty-eight complained of headache, which was mild in twelve (32 per cent) and severe in twenty-six."
CD007431,0,3805082,0,The use of computerized tomography in evaluating non-visualized vertebral levels caudad to a complete block on a lumbar myelogram. A review of thirty-two cases.,"In thirty-two patients who demonstrated a complete or almost complete block on a lumbar myelogram, computerized tomography of the non-visualized vertebral levels caudad to the block was performed prior to surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of computerized tomography in detecting a lesion that is caudad to the level of a myelographic block. For twenty-three patients the cause of the myelographic block was stenosis of the spine; for five patients, a combination of stenosis of the spine and herniation of a disc; for one patient, herniation of a disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae alone; for two patients, arachnoiditis; and for one patient, kyphosis secondary to fracture. A total of fifty vertebral levels that could not be visualized because of the block were evaluated. Thirty (60 per cent) of the non-visualized vertebral levels, in nineteen (59 per cent) of the thirty-two patients, demonstrated stenosis of the spine or a herniated disc that was confirmed at the time of surgical treatment. The value of computerized tomography for the evaluation of the vertebral levels caudad to the level of a complete or almost complete block on a lumbar myelogram was threefold. First, it provided visualization of the vertebral levels that could not be evaluated by the myelography. Second, the findings on computerized tomography provided information that was essential for preoperative planning and it removed the so-called exploratory element from the operative procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,8492849,0,Cauda equina syndrome secondary to lumbar disc herniation.,"Between 1986 and 1991, 14 patients (nine men and five women), ranging in age from 22 to 67 years (mean, 43 yr), presented with acute cauda equina syndrome from a herniated lumbar disc. All presented with bilateral sciatica and leg weakness; 13 (93%) had urine or stool incontinence, or both. At presentation, all were emergently studied with myelogram/computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging. Nine (64%) had large or massive herniations, including two with tethered cords. Five had smaller herniations superimposed on preexisting stenosis. Three had previous surgery; two-thirds had a herniation at a different level. The levels of the herniations were L4-L5 in nine patients, L5-S1 in three patients, and L3-L4 in two patients. The time to surgery ranged from less than 24 hours to more than 30 days; 11 patients underwent surgery within 5 days of onset. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 5 years (mean, 3.3 yr). Postoperatively, six patients (44%) were normal, four (28%) had chronic pain and numbness, and four (28%) had persistent incontinence and weakness. All the patients were ambulatory. There were no operative deaths, and only one patient had a wound infection. Of the 10 patients who had no incontinence after surgery, 7 underwent surgery within 48 hours of onset. Of the four patients with persistent incontinence, all underwent surgery after 48 hours. Previous reports and our experience demonstrate the following most common characteristics for this presentation: 1) male sex; 2) L4-L5 herniations; and 3) onset in the 4th decade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,10422699,0,Outcome analyses in 1072 surgically treated lumbar disc herniations.,"This article reports the outcomes of 1072 consecutive patients surgically treated during a ten-year period. There are many new techniques for the treatment for lumbar disc hernia, but also the conventional standard discectomy procedure is still the most acceptable method today. 1072 consecutive, non-randomized patients with lumbar disc herniation were reviewed for a clinical retrospective study about the surgical outcome according to our functional grading system. The patients reported ruptured disc to be due to lifting (30.13%), trauma (9.42%), and sports (8.11%). Almost all patients had complained of radicular pain in a dermatomal distribution (90.39%) and 86.07% had low-back pain, 5.2% of the patients had complications. Eighty-five patients (7.92%) had a second lumbar disc operation. Thirty of these eighty-five patients underwent the operation at the same level. Patients were also rated to improve the ability. Almost 91% of the patients had excellent, good, and satisfactory outcome; 9% of patients had moderate and poor categories of outcome. Several conclusions can be drawn from this large series of patients who were operated for lumbar disc herniation. 1. Most patients had good-to-excellent surgical outcomes after lumbar discectomy. 2. The results of disc surgery depend not only upon operative technique and skill, the degree of neurological impairment but also upon the correct selection of cases."
CD007431,0,3356095,0,"Lumbar lateral canal entrapment: clinical, radiculographic and computed tomographic findings.","The radiculographic and computed tomographic findings in those nerve roots compressed by lumbar lateral canal entrapment have been assessed in a prospective series of 44 patients in whom such entrapment was found at surgery. The radiological procedures were reported by radiologists who were unaware of the clinical findings. Radiculography was performed in 41 of the patients and enabled the site or sites of entrapment to be correctly predicted in 62% of patients undergoing primary decompression and in 42% of patients undergoing revision surgery. Computed tomography (CT) was performed in 24 of the patients and enabled entrapment to be correctly predicted in 75% of the patients in both groups. We conclude that computed tomography is superior to radiculography in demonstrating lumbar lateral entrapment, and should usually be reserved for patients in whom operation or other intervention is warranted on clinical grounds. Otherwise false positive results may occur, especially in elderly patients, although the true incidence of false positive results in this condition is not known and has not been assessed in this study."

CD007431,0,3104541,0,Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a clinico-radiological study of 74 cases.,"A clinico-radiological analysis of 74 cases of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament is reported. Eighteen cases (24%) were asymptomatic or only had neck or shoulder pain; 16 cases (22%) showed signs of radiculopathy, and the remaining 40 cases (54%) had myelopathy. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament developed most frequently at C5, and was rare in thoracic and lumbar regions. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament led to stenosis of the spinal canal; more marked stenosis caused clinical myelopathy. The data showed that 30% of stenosis caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament was critical for the production of myelopathy."
CD007431,0,8934890,0,[Far lateral lumbar disc herniation: clinical and radiographical features of three cases].,"The authors report three operated cases of far lateral lumbar disc herniation (FLLDH) during the past two years and discuss their diagnostic pitfalls. Until recently FLLDH was hardly ever diagnosed because the myelography was negative in almost all cases. Since the advent of CT and/or MRI, FLLDH has been found to be not such a rare entity. FLLDH has also been found to reveal characteristic clinical features and radiographical findings. Usual lumbar disc herniations occur at L4/5 or L5/S1 levels, producing low back pain with the pain or sensory disturbance from the posterolateral thigh down to the foot. In contrast, FLLDH affects upper lumbar levels and produces severe anterolateral thigh pain, dysesthesia resulting from nerve root or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) compression in the foraminal or extraforaminal region. The level predilection of these two groups can be attributed to the difference of the facet joint planes between the upper and lower lumbar levels. The facets with a coronal plane are resistant to lateral bending and rotational forces, but those with a sagittal plane are unstable resulting in more shearing stress to the intervertebral discs. A patient with definite neurological signs but a negative myelography should be examined for FLLDH by using a high-resolution CT or MRI. MRI clearly shows the detailed anatomical relationships between herniated disc and nerve root or DRG in the foraminal and extraforaminal regions. As well as thin-sliced axial images, sagittal MR images that include the foraminal zone are useful for detecting a direct nerve root compression from FLLDH. The authors conclude that gait disturbance due to severe leg pain, antero-lateral thigh pain or dysesthesia are characteristic of FLLDH, and that either a foraminal or extraforaminal herniated disc or both on a CT and/or MRI are diagnostic radiographical findings of FLLDH."

CD007431,0,6867309,0,Clinical usefulness of CT scanning in the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spine disease.,"CT scanning of the lumbar spine is in its infancy. Nevertheless, it has had a remarkable effect on the way we evaluate and treat patients. The principal advantages are the following: (1) If the scan alone in the diagnostic work-up of patients with lumbar disc herniation and correlative neurologic deficit. (2) The CT scan aids in the screening of patients with back and leg pain who did not have a neurologic deficit. It may determine the need for further studies such as myelography. (3) CT has become helpful in the evaluation of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and may replace myelography when greater experience is garnered. (4) CT is of great value in the evaluation of the lumbar spine previously operated on and may provide diagnostic information unavailable on the myelogram because of dural scar formation, arachnoiditis, and so on. (5) Future comparative studies probably will indicate greater accuracy with CT scanning than with myelography, and consequently, the overall diagnostic acumen in the treatment of patients with lumbar spine disease will be improved."
CD007431,0,12836070,0,Lumbar disc herniation associated with separation of the posterior ring apophysis: analysis of five surgical cases and review of the literature.,"Separation of the posterior ring apophysis of an adjacent vertebral body can sometimes accompany lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. The condition can be both difficult to detect in conventional radiographs and is somewhat controversial to treat. Although there is general agreement on the frequent need for surgery, there is no consensus on the choice of operation. One procedure, posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), has never been examined for effectiveness."
CD007431,0,2618816,0,Short-term outcome in lumbar spine surgery. A prospective study (Part I).,"A prospective survey of the outcome of lumbar surgery was carried out under conditions where all intervention was according to routine procedures. Of a consecutive series of patients 132 cases (92%) could be evaluated. The aim was to investigate possible predictive factors among self-reported data and clinical data readily available under routine circumstances. Follow-up was for six months post-operatively. Surgical findings were: herniated disc (62%), osteochondrosis (21%), other pathology (7%), and negative findings (10%). Unsatisfactory outcome was either relapse, operation before follow-up (9%) or persisting pain (30%). The surgical finding of a disc herniation predicted a significantly better outcome than any other finding. Cases previously operated upon (20%) fared equal with those operated upon for the first time irrespective of surgical findings. Self-reported weighting of preoperative pain and its location showed that predominant sciatica was significantly associated with the finding of a disc herniation, but also with satisfactory outcome irrespective of the operative finding. Factors without predictive value included sex, age, number of prior back surgeries, duration and impact of symptoms, and clinical findings. The social consequences were associated with the duration of low back disease."
CD007431,0,6222717,0,Pregnancy and the herniated lumbar disc.,"During the last decade, five pregnant patients with symptoms and signs of a herniated lumbar disc were identified among a series of 48,760 consecutive deliveries at William Beaumont Hospital, an incidence of 1:10,000. In all cases, clinical evaluation and electromyography complemented conservative treatment during the final stage of pregnancy. Each patient was delivered by cesarean section. Large lumbar disc herniations in each case were subsequently identified by myelography. In all five cases, lumbar laminectomy was successful in facilitating the eventual resolution of the signs and symptoms of the radiculopathy. Although the mechanical and postural stresses of pregnancy have been cited as predisposing causes of a herniated lumbar disc, this study suggests otherwise. Lumbosacral vertebral disc ruptures of pregnancy, while relatively rare, should nevertheless be recognized early, distinguished from other causes of lumbosacral gestational plexopathy, and promptly treated."
CD007431,0,6635514,0,[Sciatic foramina radiculalgia. Apropos of 16 cases].,"Over a period of six years, the authors have seen sixteen cases of foraminal sciatica with an L5 topography which possesses the following unusual clinical features: long history of back pain with a grumbling course and without any acute episodes, progressive sciatica without any predisposing factors, paresthesiae particularly on standing with normal amipaque saccoradiculography and unresponsive to medical treatment. The operative finding in all of these patients was a disc compression in the intervertebral foramen (hernia, disc residue or softened disc), which was frequently associated with factors reducing the calibre of the foramen: abnormal position of the root and lowering of the pedicular roof caused by lumbosacral disc degeneration. This multi-factorial compression therefore required, depending on the case, curettage of the disc or a localized annulectomy combined with a facettectomy. The long term results of the operation can be considered to be favourable, in view of the long history of root pain (an average of 4 years) which largely explains the incomplete nature of the post-operative success."
CD007431,0,10398988,0,Long-term outcome of patients who underwent percutaneous nucleotomy for lumbar disc herniation: results after a mean follow-up of 5 years.,"A total of 41 patients who had undergone percutaneous nucleotomy for a single level lumbar disc herniation were clinically examined after a mean postoperative follow-up of 5 years (range 4 to 7 years). There were 14 (34%) male and 27 (66%) female patients with a mean age of 49 years. By intra-operative discography, the herniation had been graded as a protrusion in 21 (51%) patients and as a prolapse in 20 (49%) patients. At the time of the investigation, sciatica had completely recovered or markedly diminished in 32 (78%) patients, and 29 (71%) patients had returned to work. Evaluated by a 100 mm visual analog pain scale (VAS), the postoperative pain relief was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Clinical signs and symptoms of segmental instability of the lumbar spine were detected in 10 (24%) patients. Instability was significantly associated with an unsatisfactory long-term outcome in the patients with the occurrence of sciatica (p = 0.003) and low back pain (p = 0.001) as well as the VAS score (p = 0.005) and Oswestry index (p < 0.0001). Clinical investigation revealed sensory deficits in the leg in 12 (29%) patients, weakness of the extensor hallucis longus muscle in 5 (12%) patients and a total peroneal paresis in one (2%). The patellar and achilles tendon reflexes were depressed in 2 (5%) and 5 (12%) patients, respectively. During the follow-up period, recurrent disc herniation was detected in 3 (7%) patients who were all re-operated on. In addition, 3 (7%) patients were re-operated on for other back problems. Corroborating earlier findings, the results of this study indicate that percutaneous nucleotomy is an effective and safe alternative to open surgery in the treatment of patients with a small prolapse or a protrusion."

Clinical aspects--diagnosis--therapy].,"From 1980 to 1986 6632 operations of the lumbar spine due to disc prolapse were carried out by the Department of Neurosurgery of the hospital of the Technical University of Munich. During this period we saw 14 cases of postoperative spondylodiscitis. Patients' main symptom was increasing low back pain. Physical examination showed difficulty in forward flexion of the body. The blood sedimentation rate was always examined: an average increase to 42/66 mm was recorded. X-ray examination of the lumbar spine and magnetic resonance imaging proved to be the most sensitive methods of investigation, better than scintigram and computed tomography. Our therapeutic management consists of fixation in normal position with a ""Light Cast"" corset and additional antibiotic therapy with cephadroxil. In comparison to other therapy methods, i.e. restcure, the advantage for our patients is that they can stay at home and move about. Therapy must be continued until the blood sedimentation rate is normal and radiological signs of consolidation can be seen for at least over 10 weeks. Good long-term results were seen in all patients."

CD007431,0,15843972,0,Subsidence after anterior lumbar interbody fusion using paired stand-alone rectangular cages.,"The authors conducted a study to determine at what stage after surgery the subsidence occurred, and to assess the relationships of radiographic fusion and the recurrence of symptoms with the development of subsidence. Ninety patients underwent a single-level anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) using paired stand-alone rectangular cages between November 2000 and June 2002. All patients had regular clinical or imaging follow-up for a minimum of 19 months (range 19-38 months, mean = 27 months). The ratio of male to female patients was 1:3.1. The patients' ages at the time of ALIF ranged from 25 to 72 years, with a mean of 53 years. The preoperative and postoperative intervertebral disc heights were serially measured by plain radiographs. The location of cage subsidence into the vertebral body and times until the presence of subsidence were also assessed. The mean preoperative intervertebral disc height was 11.6+/-3.1 mm, which spread immediately after surgery to 16.9+/-2.0 mm. This increase was statistically significant (P = 0.001). At the last follow-up visit, the mean intervertebral disc height had been reduced to 13.2+/-2.4 mm. Sixty-nine of 90 patients (76.7%) developed cage subsidence into the surrounding vertebral body. Subsidence was more often noted in the superior endplate above the cage with regard to the location of cage subsidence [superior endplate: 27 patients (39.1%), inferior endplate: 12 patients (17.3%), both: 30 patients (43.6%)]. The onset of subsidence varied from 0.25 to 8 months after surgery (median, 2.75 months). The 8-, 12-, and 16-week actuarial rates for developing cage subsidence were 38.9, 63.4, and 70.7%, respectively, when using the Kaplan-Meier method. There was no statistical correlation between the recurrence of symptoms (P = 0.3952) and radiographic fusion (P = 0.9518) with the log-rank test in development of subsidence. This study demonstrates that cage subsidence is an expected occurrence after ALIF using stand-alone rectangular cages. The 3- and 4-month actuarial rates for developing cage subsidence were 63.4 and 70.7%, respectively, and cage subsidence had no correlation with recurrence of symptoms and radiographic fusion in our study."
CD007431,0,2954226,0,Dallas discogram description. A new classification of CT/discography in low-back disorders.,"A new classification method for CT/discography was developed. The Dallas discogram description (DDD) related five separate categories of information. Degeneration and annular disruption were regarded as separate phenomena. Additionally, provoked pain response, contrast volume, and miscellaneous information were recorded. Discogram findings of 59 patients with low-back and/or leg pain were graded according to the new method and compared with standard methods using routine anteroposterior and lateral discographic images. Findings from routine discography and CT/discography were graded and correlated with myelographic and plain computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans. This study demonstrated that the contrast-enhanced axial view provided by CT/discography served as a useful projection for demonstrating disc pathology. CT/discography analyzed according to DDD offered a more sensitive discriminator of disc degeneration from annular disruption (disc protrusion/leaking). This evaluation can be recommended as the procedure of choice when revision of spine surgery is considered or when there is an equivocal or negative correlation between clinical information and myelography or CAT scan."

CD007431,0,6410824,0,Influence of spinal posture on abnormalities demonstrated by lumbar myelography.,"During spinal movements the dural end sac undergoes displacement and deformation, chiefly because of bulging of intervertebral disks and flaval ligaments in lumbar extension. Under normal circumstances these dural changes of form do not lead to clinical symptoms. However, in patients with spinal stenosis radiologic signs may be accentuated in lumbar extension. These tend to disappear in flexion. This implies that examination techniques performed in extension (prone lumbar myelography) tend to enhance abnormalities, while techniques in which the spine is more or less flexed (epidural phlebography, computed tomography) tend to mask them. In addition, there may be discrepancy between the picture during surgery (usually in lumbar flexion) and the situation in which a patient experiences symptoms (usually in lumbar extension in spinal stenosis)."

CD007431,0,7641460,0,Percutaneous laser disc nucleotomy.,"In September 1988, the first laser decompression of a symptomatic contained bulging disc was performed in the United States. This author participated in a case study of 333 patients treated with the neodymium (Nd)-impregnated yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser of 1064-nm wavelength. He also treated 117 patients with the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser of 532-nm wavelength. Detailed surgical techniques and followup statistics of the 117 patients treated with the KTP laser are presented and compared with those of a subset of 36 of the 333 patients treated with the Nd:YAG laser. Of the 117 patients treated with the KTP laser, 23 patients were at the 2-year followup, and 46 patients at the 1-year followup, at the time of this writing. A statistically significant reduction in overall average patient pain was documented by disc level as a function of followup duration. Variation in average specific neurologic findings (knee jerk, reflex, toe strength, ankle jerk, pinprick, and Lasague's sign) by disc level as a function of followup duration was not significant. These procedures were accomplished with no major complications. The success rate based on a 2-year followup was 72%. The success rate with the Nd:YAG laser was very similar, at 70%. These data provide encouraging information substantiating the validity of laser surgery for percutaneous disc nucleotomy."
CD007431,0,11513310,0,Concurrent improvements in cardiorespiratory and muscle fitness in response to total body recumbent stepping in humans.,"A group of 26 sedentary adults [mean age 48.4 (SD 6.4) years] were allocated randomly into either a non-exercising control group (CON, n =9) or an exercise group (EX, n = 17) that trained 3 days a week for 12 weeks using a total body recumbent stepper (TBRS). Training intensity and duration progressed from 50% of heart rate reserve maximum (HRRmax) for 20 min to 75% HRRmax for 40 min. Maximal exercise responses were measured during incremental treadmill (TM) and TBRS tests to examine the specificity of the adaptations to training. Muscle strength was measured using a one repetition maximum (1 RM) test for the leg press (LP), chest press (CP), and seated row (SR). Muscle endurance (END) was evaluated for LP, CP, and SR as the number of repetitions achieved before failure when exercising at an intensity of 60% of baseline 1 RM. Body composition was estimated using the sum of seven skinfolds. After training, significant increases (P < 0.05) in maximal oxygen uptake and exercise time were observed in the EX group on both the TM (9.3% and 4.8%, respectively) and TBRS (18.2% and 70.5%, respectively). The TBRS training resulted in significant increases (P < 0.01) in 1 RM and END of the legs, chest, and back, with greater magnitude of improvements observed for END. Furthermore, TBRS training resulted in a significant increase in lean body mass and significant reductions in fat mass and percentage body fat (P<0.01). The CON did not show changes in any measurement (P>0.05). These data indicated concurrent improvements in both cardiovascular and muscle fitness. The greater improvements observed on the TBRS test and in muscle endurance suggest the adaptations are specific to the mode of training."

CD007431,0,9883963,0,Comparison of three techniques of anterior fusion in single-level cervical disc herniation.,"This study compared the clinical and radiographic outcome of three techniques of anterior fusion for cervical disc herniation: Cloward fusion with autograft, Cloward fusion with freeze-dried bone, and BAK-C device fusion. In a cohort of 84 consecutive patients, 34 were treated by classic autograft Cloward's technique, in 26 patients freeze-dried xenograft Surgibone was used and in the last 24 patients a BAK-C titanium device was implanted. The mean follow-up period of this last group was 14.6 months. All patients were operated by the same surgeon at the same hospital and all underwent single-level surgery. Results were evaluated on the basis of patient satisfaction and postoperative capacity to work. There was no significant difference between the three groups related to the preoperative assessment. The analysis revealed that BAK-C patients had significantly shorter hospital stays. No postoperative cervical collar was worn by BAK-C patients and they had the highest percentage of excellent clinical results. Concerning radiographic evaluation, BAK-C achieved a more stable fixation of the involved segment without complications in contrast with the two others, which presented a significant incidence of extrusion, collapse, kyphosis and pseudarthrosis. Measurement of the progressive kyphosis grade shows statistically significant differences between the three groups. BAK-C patients had the lowest kyphosis grade at the end of the follow-up. There is an important correlation between collapse, collapse with kyphosis and pseudarthrosis with bad clinical results. In conclusion, the BAK-C device showed significant advantages, including higher patient satisfaction, unnecessary postoperative collar, early rehabilitation and a lower rate of complications. Furthermore, BAK-C is cost effective because of it shortens postoperative hospital stay and allows an earlier return to work."
CD007431,0,8750399,0,Comparison of the onset and intensity of action of intramuscular meloxicam and oral meloxicam in patients with acute sciatica.,"In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial, 113 patients with acute sciatica were treated with a single 15-mg dose of meloxicam given intramuscularly (n = 54) or orally (n = 59). There was a significant improvement in induced pain (as measured by using the straight-leg-raising test) in both treatment groups at 60 minutes (P < 0.005), and there was a significant difference in favor of the intramuscular formulation in terms of the time to maximum improvement of induced pain (P = 0.01). Changes in spontaneous pain were similar in both treatment groups and were significant versus baseline (P < 0.01) at 30 minutes after study drug administration. Global efficacy evaluations by both the patients and investigators confirmed that meloxicam 15 mg in an intramuscular or oral formulation was effective in relieving pain in patients with acute sciatica. Meloxicam was generally well tolerated, and the local tolerability of the intramuscular injection was found to be excellent on the basis of both clinical evaluation and assessment of creatine phosphokinase levels."

The review revealed a higher incidence of adolescent lumbar disk herniations in female patients and a higher percentage of patients with a family history than previously reported. Leg pain continues to be the primary presenting symptom in this group of patients and is often not recognized as the radicular pain of a herniated disk by the primary care physician. This reflects a lack of understanding of the relationship of the presenting symptoms to the pathology of the herniated nucleus pulposus, causing a delay in referral to the spine specialist."

CD007431,0,3381141,0,The lumbar facet syndrome.,"A clinical study was undertaken to formulate better criteria for accurate diagnosis of the lumbar facet syndrome and for predicting treatment response to facet joint injection. Twenty-two consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of lumbar facet syndrome, made by conventional diagnostic criteria, who were then treated with facet joint injection, were reviewed for their treatment responses. New diagnostic criteria were formulated based on a scoring system derived from the values observed in this review study. The scoring system has a total of 100 points, allocated as follows: back pain associated with groin or thigh pain, 30 points; well-localized paraspinal tenderness, 20 points; reproduction of pain with extension-rotation, 30 points; corresponding radiographic changes, 20 points; and pain below the knee, -10 points. A score of 60 points or more indicates a very high probability of satisfactory response to facet joint injection (100% prolonged response in this study). When only the conventional criteria were used, the overall results of prolonged relief of pain after facet joint injection was 50%. A ""scorecard"" system is proposed that may give a higher degree of diagnostic accuracy and predictability of successful response to facet joint injection."

Sixty-one patients undergoing lumbar discectomy were included. They were assigned randomly to receive, immediately after removal of the disc, either 80 mg methylprednisolone acetate (Depomedrol) or the same amount (2 mL) of saline. Both were soaked in 2.5 x 2.5 cm of collagen absorbable hemostat (Instat) that was left on the decompressed nerve root. All discs were removed in the same way via unilateral flavectomy. The patients were asked to grade the pain intensity daily in the first 2 weeks and 1 year after surgery. Pain intensity was evaluated by the visual analog scale from 0 to 10, zero being no pain and 10 being the most severe pain. Statistically significant back pain relief was observed on postoperative days 1, 2, 6, and 14 in the study group (the group that received steroids). No difference between the two groups was found 1 year after surgery or when leg pain was compared. No side effects that could be related to the steroids were observed."

Surgery was most frequently required following L4/L5 than L5/S1 nucleolysis. The most frequent causes of failure of nucleolysis were lateral osseous stenosis (19 cases) and sub-ligamentous hernia (17 cases), apparently due to the ineffectiveness of the enzyme. Excluded hernia was rare (4 cases). Hernias at another level (4 cases) required surgery since it was not possible to repeat the injection of chymopapain. Three of these explorations were of the linea alba and one failure was due to spondylolisthesis due to isthmic lysis. Some failures occurred after some delay. The sciatic relapses after a period of complete clinical cure. In some cases, the relapse was in fact at another level or involved sub-ligamentous or excluded hernia. Surgery following nucleolysis is the same as that of an uninjected hernia; there are no adherences. The results are generally the same as those obtained by primitive surgery (two thirds favorable outcome). However, this depends mainly on what has been detected. The results are very good for hernias at another level and for excluded hernias. Fair results are obtained for stenosis and for sub-ligamentous hernias but only poor results in explorations of the linea alba."

Recordings were performed before surgery and on Days 4 and 50 after surgery. Electromyography was also performed before surgery. Dermatomal SEPs were shown to be sensitive (70%) and specific in both terms of their lateralizing value and their ability to identify the L5 or S1 level. Moreover, combining SEPs and EMG significantly increased the sensitivity of the electrophysiological testing when compared with each method alone. There was no relationship between SEPs performed before surgery and surgical outcome. Inversely, we demonstrated the prognostic value of SEPs performed on Day 4, SEP normalization at Day 4 was associated with a good outcome at Day 50 in 91.8% of examined cases, while the persistence of pathological SEPs at Day 4 was associated with poor outcome at Day 50 in 56% of the cases."

Compounds selectively blocking COX-2 received special attention due to their minimal impact on COX-1 that provides good anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect with simultaneous dramatic reduction of ulcerogenic activity. One of the first drugs with such an action is Movalis (meloxicam). Thirty patients were divided into 2 groups, the first including 22 patients with vertebral diseases and musculotonic syndromes; patients of the second group (8) had a pain syndrome caused by disk herniation. During the first 3 days Movalis was administered in the form of injections (15 mg/day) and in the same doses in tablets for the following 20 days. After the treatment course, complete arrest of pain syndrome was observed in 33.3% patients, significant improvement--in 53.3% and insignificant effect--in 13.3%. Patients with reflex pain and musculotonic syndromes had a good analgesic effect after 3-day course of intramuscular injections, with the effect being mostly expressed in 8-10 days. Patients with diskogenic compressive radicular syndrome demonstrated a stable analgesic effect after a week of Movalis intake in tablet form. Movalis is well tolerated; side effects have occurred in 10 patients but they were minimal and did not lead to the change of medication dose or additional therapy."
CD007431,0,17188924,0,The active straight leg raising test (ASLR) in pregnant women: differences in muscle activity and force between patients and healthy subjects.,"Pregnancy-related low back and pelvic pain (PLBP) is a frequent complication of pregnancy. Although pathological mechanisms underlying PLBP are obscure, dysfunction of the sacroiliac joints (SI-joints) seems to play an important role. A cross-sectional study was performed on 24 pregnant women with and without PLBP. The objective was to determine muscle activation patterns of trunk and leg muscles during the active straight leg raising test (ASLR) and static hip flexion, and to determine maximal hip flexion force at 0 and 20 cm leg raise height. Moreover, the effort to raise the leg was scored. The measurements resulted in several significant differences between the patients and healthy controls; among others (a) patients scored subjectively more effort during ASLR, (b) at both 0 and 20 cm leg raise height patients had less hip flexion force, and (c) patients developed more muscle activity during ASLR. Since pregnant women with PLBP developed a higher muscle activity during ASLR with a significantly lower output at 0 and 20 cm than healthy pregnant women, it could be proposed that the ASLR demonstrates a disturbed load transfer across the SI-joints in this population."

In this prospective study, the usefulness of free fat grafts during lumbar disc surgery was evaluated. Ninety-nine patients who had undergone operation due to lumbar disc herniation were divided in two groups: those with implantation of free fat grafts (group A) and those without (group B). Outcome was evaluated at a mean of 2.6 years postoperatively according to the following criteria: visual analog scale for back and leg pain, Hannover Questionnaire on activities of daily living, reflex findings, sensory and motor deficits, consumption of analgesics, walking distance, straight leg raising test, and clinical examination.

CD007431,0,18441759,0,Effects of electroacupuncture on a degenerated intervertebral disc using an in-vivo rat-tail model.,"Electroacupuncture (EA) has long been used as conservative treatment for low back pain (LBP). Its effect on relief of back pain has been demonstrated in many clinical studies. However, whether it has any effect on the biological properties of an intervertebral disc, which is one of the major causes of LBP, is still unclear. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the effects of EA with different simulation frequencies on an intervertebral disc with simulated degeneration using an in-vivo rat-tail model. In this study, 33 rats were used. Disc degeneration was simulated in the rat caudal 8-9 disc via continuous static compressive loading of 11 N for 2 weeks. EA with a frequency of 2 or 100 Hz was then applied to the degenerated disc for 3 weeks with 3 sessions/week and 20 min/session. The intervertebral disc height was measured before and after compression as well as after EA intervention for 3 weeks. The static compression was found to result in a reduction in the disc height of about 22 per cent. There was no evidence that this change could be reversed after resting or the EA intervention. However, EA at 100 Hz was found to induce a further decrease in disc height, which was not shown for the rats after resting or EA at 2 Hz. The results of this study showed that effects of EA on disc degeneration are frequency dependent and adverse effects could result if EA at a certain frequency was used."

CD007431,0,10333151,0,Relationship of pain drawings to invasive tests assessing intervertebral disc pathology.,"It has been found that the pain patterns in pain drawings are related to the presence of herniated disc identified by myelography. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the pattern of pain in the drawings or the type of pain indicated (aching, burning, numbness, pins and needles, stabbing) was related to the presence of symptomatic disc pathology identified by CT/discography. In a subgroup of patients who underwent myelography, the relationship of the drawings to myelographic findings was also investigated. Pain drawings were completed by 187 patients with low back and/or radicular pain who were undergoing CT/discography. The drawings were scored in two ways, first by the system described by Ransford and secondly by visual inspection. They were classified as being indicative, or not, of disc pathology. The CT/discograms were classified as disrupted, or not, and the pain responses were recorded upon injection of each disc, based on the similarity of the pain provoked to clinical symptoms. Among the 133 patients with discogenic pain confirmed by discography, 110 (82.7%) had pain drawings that were classified as indicative. Among the 45 patients without discogenic pain, 29 (64.4%) had pain drawings classified as non-indicative. Patients with discogenic pain used more symbols indicating burning pain and aching pain than did non-discogenic pain patients. Our results confirmed those reported earlier by Uden, who found a relationship between the pattern of pain in the drawings and myelographic findings. Pain drawings may be helpful in the diagnosis of symptomatic disc pathology."

The question is not whether the combined operation or the simple disc excision is superior in itself, but which of the two should be chosen in a given case. For patients with disc displacement and radicular pain as the predominant symptom, undercutting hemilaminectomy and disc excision will generally yield satisfying results. The main indication for a combined operation is a history of instability complaints long before radicular pain caused by the disc displacement appears. Since the number of patients (of all age groups) that require a disc operation is ever increasing, the selection of patients suited for a combined operation is becoming more and more important, so as to bring down the number of secondary fusions for the treatment of invalidating low back pain after disc excision. The aim of our clinical research is to test the criteria for the selection of patients for the combined operation by taking into account both patients who underwent a combined operation and others whose postoperative condition was such as to require a secondary fusion within one year after diskectomy. In the majority of these cases, one can presume that the fusion should have been carried out on the occasion of the first operation. 26 (90%) out of 29 patients showed a good result three months after the combined operation; 25 (86%) were still satisfied four years later. This confirms that patients with a long history of low back pain as a symptom of instability--in addition to the recent symptoms of the herniation--and those with a significant dislocation of one vertebral body (retrolisthesis, spondylolisthesis and pseudospondylolisthesis), too, should be examined in view of a possible combined operation. However, the combined operation is needed in no more than about three to four per cent of all diskectomies."

CD007431,0,12089733,0,Comparison of clinical outcomes and natural morphologic changes between sequestered and large central extruded disc herniations.,"A prospective and longitudinal investigation concerning clinical outcomes and morphologic changes of large lumbar disc herniations by MR imaging. To compare the clinical outcomes and the natural morphologic changes of between sequestered and large central extruded disc herniations. The spontaneous disappearance or diminution of large herniated lumbar discs in the spinal canal is known. Poor clinical outcome and small changes of herniated discs have been shown for large central extruded disc herniations with conservative treatment. The study population consisted of 22 patients with sequestration and a large central as extrusion established by an MR imaging study. Seventeen (11 patients with sequestration, and 6 patients with a large central extrusion) patients underwent a follow-up MR imaging study. The size of the herniated disc was measured on serial MR imaging studies, and the changes in size were classified into four categories. Clinical evaluations were also performed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), the Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire, the straight leg raising test (SLRT) and so forth. Both the sequestered and large central extruded disc herniations showed a successful clinical outcome after conservative treatment in 17 of 22 patients (77%) in total: 11 of 13 patients (85%) with sequestered disc herniations, and 6 of 9 patients (67%) with large central extruded disc herniations. VAS and Oswestry disability scoring showed a greater change in the group with sequestration than in the group with large central extrusions. In the group with sequestration, seven patients reported the disappearance of herniated disc materials, and four patients showed a marked decrease in the size of their herniated discs in follow-up MR images. However, in the group with large central extrusions, only two patients showed a decrease in the size of their herniated discs. Large central extruded disc herniations can be treated successfully by conservative treatment. Outcomes seemed to be as good as or slightly inferior to those of sequestered disc herniations. However, a greater morphologic decrease in the herniated discs occurred more frequently for sequestered disc herniations than for large central extruded disc herniations."

Thoracic myelopathy is rare, and there are many unsolved problems including its epidemiological and clinical features. We have established a registration system of spinal surgeries, which covered almost all surgeries in Miyagi Prefecture, and enrolled the data of 265 patients with thoracic myelopathy from 1988 to 2002. The annual rate of surgery gradually increased and averaged 0.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, which was less than 1/10 of that for cervical myelopathy. About 20 patients with thoracic myelopathy are operated on in Miyagi Prefecture each year. It frequently develops in middle-aged males. About half of the cases were caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum, followed by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, intervertebral disc herniation and posterior spur. Patients usually noticed numbness or pain in the legs and the preoperative duration was long, averaging 2 years. Its symptomatic similarities to lumbar disorders might cause difficulty in making a correct diagnosis. Since thoracic myelopathy can markedly restrict the activities of daily life, even general physicians should recognize this entity."

The diagnosis can be established early be careful physical examination: manual compression of the pelvis produces pain on the affected side, and palpation reveals tenderness over over the site of infection. The inflammatory process can be located even in early cases on a bone scan with radioactive technetium. When diagnosed early, the infection can be cured with intensive intravenous antibiotic therapy alone."

All patients had been under treatment with analgesic or anti-inflammatory agents. The intensity of the pain was measured 2, 7, 30, and 180 days after the percutaneous discectomy. An improvement in the painful symptomatology of less than 30%, observed in 11 cases and in 1 case of epidural pathology, was considered an unsuccessful result. A decrease of the pain of more than 70% was observed in 72% of cases, either with the end of the symptoms of pain as noted in 79.5% of patients or with a marked reduction of the medical treatments obtained in 21.5%. The results obtained were already almost definitive at the seventh day of follow-up, and further controls rarely demonstrated an improvement in the pain. The location of the herniated disc is a parameter which appears to be very important in the efficacy of percutaneous discectomy. We noted an improvement of more than 70% in 79% of the posterolateral foraminal or extraforaminal hernias, although these favorable results were observed only in 50% of the posteromedian hernias."

There were no differences in sexes, ages, or pain duration between the group of 37 patients with a herniated lumbar disc compared to the 44 patients with a normal myelogram. From the features of the pain drawing alone, it was possible to predict the presence or absence of a herniated disc with a high statistical significance (p less than 0.001). Patients with a disc herniation rarely had pain in the upper trunk or arms (three of 37) compared with the normal group (23 of 44). Only one of nine patients with pain in the groin had disc herniation, and the same was true concerning pain in the iliac crest. Three patients without pain below the knee had no prolapsed disc. The Ransford score was significantly higher in patients with nondiscogenic sciatica, but there was no difference between the groups in the number of types of pain sensation."

This study was a cross-sectional study that was conducted among the personnel of four industrial companies. Interview, questionnaire survey, medical examination (Lasegue test), radiographic evaluation, and ergonomic survey (using the NIOSH checklist) were the methods to collect data. The result of the study was divided into two parts: individual factors and work-related factors. The highest frequency of low back pain was observed in the age of 30-34 years old, medium height and heavy weight with 34.4, 84.4, and 33.0 percent, respectively. With regard to work-related factors, load lifting with 44.7 and body posture with 18.4 percent contributed to low back pain as the most important occupational causes among the patients. Observing recommended regulations and limitations of load lifting, modifying and optimizing ergonomic conditions in the workplace, selecting workers with suitable body strength on the basis of a pre-employment examination and implementing a continuous educational program for employees were the most important methods recommended to prevent low back pain."

Follow-up was performed during one year after operation. Preoperatively, surgeons found motor loss more frequently than patients, (28 and 12% respectively) and, postoperatively, motor loss was still present in 25% and 24%, respectively, of these cases. The operation had caused motor loss in 5% and aggravated motor loss in 3%. Sensibility was reported as abnormal one year after surgery by both patients and surgeons in one-third of the cases. Sensory loss, considered by the patient to have been caused or aggravated by the operation, occurred in 15% of the cases and in 12% of these the surgeons agreed. Preoperatively, unilaterally diminished knee and Achilles tendon reflexes were found in 9% and 42% respectively; one year after surgery, these had recovered in 65% and 57%, respectively.

CD007431,0,2278776,0,Size of lumbar disc hernias measured using computed tomography and related to sciatic symptoms.,"The change in the relative size of lumbar disc hernias and its relation to sciatic symptoms was investigated in 30 consecutive patients after conservative treatment of CT verified lumbar disc herniations. CT and clinical examination were performed before the start of therapy (CT1), as well as 3 months (CT2) and 24 months (CT3) after institution of treatment. In each patient the size of the lumbar disc herniation in relation to the size of the spinal canal was measured on identical CT slices and expressed as an index. The disc herniation index decreased markedly from CT1 to CT2 (p less than 0.001). Between CT2 and CT3 the reduction of the hernias was less pronounced and not significant for hernias located centrally but still significant for intermediate (p = 0.03) and lateral (p = 0.04) hernias. The degree of sciatic symptoms also decreased markedly between CT1 and CT2 (p = 0.001) while no further improvement occurred from CT2 to CT3. There was a significant positive correlation between the improvement from sciatic pain and the reduction in the size of the individual hernia (CT1-CT2 p = 0.02, CT2-CT3 p less than 0.001). Thus, the disc herniation index provided a method to study the anatomic effect of conservative treatment as well as a method to evaluate sciatic symptoms in relation to anatomic changes."

CD007431,0,8553881,0,Facilitation of the human nociceptive reflex by stimulation of A beta-fibres in a secondary hyperalgesic area sustained by nociceptive input from the primary hyperalgesic area.,"Hyperalgesia was induced in healthy volunteers by topical capsaicin applied on the dorsum of the foot within the receptive field of the sural nerve. Under presence of hyperalgesia different normally non-noxious conditioning stimuli were applied to the hyperalgesic area and the polysynaptic nociceptive spinal reflex and pain ratings were used to assess central excitability. The nociceptive reflex was measured in the knee extensor and flexor muscles evoked by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve trunk at an intensity of 1.5 times the initial reflex threshold (an intensity above the pain threshold). Thermal stimulation of the primary hyperalgesic area (re)established both on-going spontaneous pain and secondary hyperalgesia. Thus, increased nociceptive reflexes were recorded and increased pain intensity reported when A beta-fibres in the secondary hyperalgesic area were activated concurrently with the reflex testing after a non-noxious thermal stimulation of the primary hyperalgesic area. The A beta-fibre activation was achieved by continuous low-intensity electrical stimulation (40 Hz) that was initiated after on-going pain produced by the thermal stimulation had waned. The same measurement without prior thermal conditioning stimulation of the primary area resulted in no reflex facilitation, indicating rapid changes in the central excitability with existence of on-going nociceptive activity. This indicates that the development and maintenance of secondary hyperalgesia are dependent on sustained peripheral nociceptive activity. The study also shows that a central summation of nociceptive and non-nociceptive afferent activity can occur once secondary hyperalgesia is present."

CD007431,0,12384752,0,Blood clots in vessels surrounding symptomatic nerve roots in disc herniation patients: a pilot study.,"Mechanical compression and biochemical influences, e.g. by various inflammatory cells and mediators, have been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of sciatica. In addition, it has been suggested, but so far not clearly demonstrated, that blood pooling in the venous blood vessels surrounding nerve roots may contribute to impaired nerve root function and sciatica. There is also more direct evidence from studies on an animal model that nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue may induce blood vessel thrombosis. In the present study, a specific monoclonal antibody to platelet membrane glycoprotein complex GPIIb-IIIa was used for direct visualization of blood clots in tissue samples removed from the vicinity of symptomatic nerve roots in 20 disc herniation (DH) patients. For 12 patients, the DH was primary, for 7 patients recurrent and for 1 patient the index operation was for root canal stenosis following a DH operation 3 months earlier. Blood clots immunoreactive to GPIIb-IIIa were observed in small blood vessels in 11/20 tissue samples (55%), in 5/12 patients (42%) with primary DH and in 5/7 patients (71%) with recurrent DH. The presence or absence of GPIIb-IIIa complex immunoreactivity did not show a statistically significant relationship with pain duration, DH type (primary or recurrent), gender or straight leg raising (SLR). Thus, though immunohistochemically demonstrable, the observed periradicular blood clots could not be established to have a clinical role in sciatica in this pilot study."

Normal values and clinical application in disorders of the lumbar spine.,"Magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, motor roots, and proximal nerve trunks was performed in 46 healthy adults and in 73 consecutive patients with disorders of the lumbar spine. In combination with neurography and F-wave recordings, the fractionated stimulation of the motor pathways allowed calculation of conduction times of the pyramidal tract fibers, of the motor roots (ie, caudal fibers), and of the motor fibers of the lumbosacral plexus. Normal values for motor conduction times to the quadriceps, anterior tibial, and extensor digitorum brevis muscles were established. Patients had clinical and radiologic diagnoses of spinal stenosis (n = 43) and nerve root compression syndromes (n = 30). Motor conduction times to lower limb muscles were significantly delayed (above mean normal value +/- 2 x SD) in 65% of the patients with spinal stenosis and 50% of the patients with nerve root compression syndromes. Conduction slowing could be localized within the motor root and caudal fiber segment of the motor pathways in 80% of the patients in whom F-waves could be recorded. This method can be used to verify, quantify, and locate lesions of the motor pathways in conditions such as compression of the spinal cord, the caudal fibers (spinal stenosis), or the motor root passing through the intervertebral canal."

The scans were interpreted independently by three neuro-radiologists who had no knowledge about the presence or absence of clinical symptoms in the subjects. About one-third of the subjects were found to have a substantial abnormality. Of those who were less than sixty years old, 20 per cent had a herniated nucleus pulposus and one had spinal stenosis. In the group that was sixty years old or older, the findings were abnormal on about 57 per cent of the scans: 36 per cent of the subjects had a herniated nucleus pulposus and 21 per cent had spinal stenosis. There was degeneration or bulging of a disc at at least one lumbar level in 35 per cent of the subjects between twenty and thirty-nine years old and in all but one of the sixty to eighty-year-old subjects. In view of these findings in asymptomatic subjects, we concluded that abnormalities on magnetic resonance images must be strictly correlated with age and any clinical signs and symptoms before operative treatment is contemplated."

Thirty patients with sciatica severe enough to require a discectomy and 46 asymptomatic volunteers (controls) were included in this study. Both groups had a clinical examination as well as a magnetic resonance investigation of the lumbar spine. The longitudinal and transverse magnetic relaxation times (T1 and T2, respectively) were calculated from a set of 20 images obtained with five single-slice/multi-echo sequences at different repetition time values on a commercial whole-body system (1.5 T). Twenty-two symptomatic and asymptomatic disc herniations could be matched according to age, gender, disc level, and the extent of herniation (protrusion or extrusion) and were compared with regard to T1 and T2 relaxation times. Symptomatic disc herniations exhibited significantly (pT1 < 0.04 and pT2 < 0.003) shorter T1 (delta T1: -182.1 milliseconds, -15%) and T2 (delta T2: -11.0 milliseconds, -21%) relaxation times than matched asymptomatic herniations. Symptomatic disc herniations also exhibited more advanced disc degeneration as graded by Pearce's criteria (p < 0.01). These results suggest that symptomatic and morphologically matched asymptomatic disc herniations differ with regard to disc matrix composition."

Median time from start of symptoms to operation was 1 year (1 month-5 years). The dominant symptom was back pain with radiating pain (17/ 20). The straight leg raising test was positive in 19/20. Seven of the patients had scoliosis. The levels of herniation were ten in the 4th lumbar disc and nine in the 5th lumbar disc. The results were excellent or good in all patients, except in one patient in whom no disc herniation had been found. Lumbar disc herniation in adolescents should be considered in the case of back pain and radiating pain to one or both legs. Investigation and treatment should follow the same guidelines as for adults. The short-term results of surgical treatment are good."
CD007431,0,15830980,0,CAM versus nucleoplasty.,"In recent years the general trend in spinal surgery has been reduction and minimalization. In general, all these have shown a moderate or good clinical result but they have been associated with serious sequelae. Plasma-mediated electrosurgery, widely used in other medical fields, has demonstrated to be well suited for this new indication. To perform the Nucleoplasty (Coblation) and the CAM (Coblation-Assisted Microdiscectomy) is use the Perc-DLE SpineWand connected to a System 2000 generator (ArthoCare Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) was used. The device functions via plasma-mediated electrosurgery (Coblation) and differs from traditional electrosurgery. From a small sample 64 operated patients with contained disc herniation were analysed and classified into those who underwent percutaneous disc decompression (PDD) using coblation technology and patients who underwent CAM. All patients who presented with PDD were considered candidates for open surgery but all of them opted for the new technique. There was no contraindication. They had discogenic low back pain and/or leg pain and the procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. Follow-up data was of 1 to 12 months. Patients' gender distribution for PDD was 65% (41.6) male, 35% (22.4) female with a mean age of 43 years. The average duration of pain before nucleoplasty was of 18 months and none of them had previous lumbar surgery. At 6 to 12 months, 80% of the patients demonstrated an improvement in pain scores (75% very good, 5% good, 15% improved but not good, and 5% no effect). None of the patients was worse. Results indicate that Nucleoplasty may be an efficacious minimally invasive technique for the treatment of symptoms associated with contained herniated disc. However, randomized controlled studies are required to know with more precision the role of this procedure. CAM procedure (13 cases) is an excellent method in cases of root compression that needs liberation or in spine stenosis."

In 2003 50 patients treated with one or two epidural injections have been selected ""ad random"" and 50 patients treated with disc coablation. Comparison of the data indicated an improvement of average VAS when relaxed for both groups (p < 0.01), while after slight-moderate strain, this value was significant only after coablation (p < 0.001). Finally, average VAS was clearly lower (p < 0.01) after coablation as compared to epidural injections."
CD007431,0,3750080,0,Diagnosis and decision making in lumbar disc prolapse and nerve entrapment.,"This prospective study of 185 patients undergoing first-time lumbar surgery compared how accurately clinical criteria and water-soluble myelography predicted the operative findings. Clinical diagnostic criteria of nerve root pain, root irritation signs, and neurologic signs of root compression supplemented by myelography were shown to be much more accurate than myelography alone, both in predicting the presence or absence of nerve root involvement and in distinguishing disc prolapse from bony entrapment. Provided the clinical criteria were clearly defined, patients with three or more of the four criteria were usually found to have a disc prolapse while bony entrapment could frequently be identified with one or two criteria. It is concluded that although lumbar disc prolapse is well-recognized, in practice clinical assessment and diagnostic criteria need to be defined more clearly to match increasingly sophisticated radiology."

Results suggest that increased tension in the pelvic and leg muscles due to rapid skeletal growth contributes to the limited range of SLR in growing persons, while the Lasègue-test is less influenced by age and shows less pelvic rotation than the SLR-test."
CD007431,0,10672297,0,Does additional discectomy and the degree of dural sac compression influence the outcome of decompressive surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis?,"The discussion regarding factors that reliably predict the long-term surgical results in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis is still going on. This retrospective study analyses the relation between the dimensions of the dural sac and patients' clinical status before and after decompressive operations performed with or without additional discectomy. The type of surgery performed in 134 patients and the dural sac dimensions measured on postmyelograpic computed tomography in 100 of these patients were related to the Prolo scores before surgery and at follow-up (mean 46 months). The degree of dural sac compression correlated significantly with the patients' postoperative Prolo score and with the difference between the pre- and postoperative scores. The dural sac diameters predicted outcome after surgery more reliably than the preoperative Prolo scores. There was no statistically significant difference in the outcome when comparing patients with and without additional discectomy. The results presented suggest that the relief of symptoms after decompressive surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis correlates with the degree of the dural sac compression and that the simultaneous presence of disc herniation necessitating additional discectomy does not influence the postoperative outcome. However, these results have to be confirmed by prospective studies."
CD007431,0,3136760,0,[Meningomyeloradiculitis caused by Schistosoma mansoni. Research protocol and report of 21 cases].,"Twenty one cases of schistosomal meningomyeloradiculopathy due to Schistosoma mansoni are reported. This result was attained after a 4- year research period based on a ""Clinical and Laboratory Investigation Protocol"" applied on 212 patients in Itabuna, a city of Southeast region of Bahia state in the Northeast of Brazil. This region is a non endemic one for schistosomiasis. The Protocol consisted in leading to investigation every patient that presented a clinical triad characterized by: lumbar pain, paresthesias in the inferior limbs, miction difficulties. Diagnostic criteria were based on clinical neurologic signs, presence of Schistosoma mansoni eggs on feces or rectum biopsy, positive immunofluorescence reaction for schistosomiasis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the inflammatory CSF characteristics, and an exhaustive research for differential diagnosis. The diagnosis has been essentially based on clinical and laboratory data, not having for any of the cases an histopathological study. The treatment was performed the earliest as possible, and corticosteroids associated to oxaminiquine were used for all cases. The patients were studied as to sex, age, profession, city of origin, initial symptoms, laboratory tests related to schistosomiasis, the onset type of neurologic clinical symptoms and several CSF aspects. Treatment beginning was related with time of disease. Clinical evolution and sequelae were analysed. Abdominal contractions were observed in 10 cases several hours before the clinical picture had been clearly presented. Clinical diagnosis is justified since it is performed under severe clinical and laboratory evidences, as well as an accurate search for differential diagnosis. The authors think that the schistosomal meningomyeloradiculopathy is a well defined nosological entity by its neurological picture, as also from the pathological point of view. Finally, the authors suggest to neurological services of the country the planning and application of similar or even more detailed Protocol in order to obtain an early diagnosis and treatment for the disease, preventing so irreversible damages and sequelae very harmful for the patients in their social life."

CD007431,0,1318522,0,Somatosensory evoked potentials in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"We performed lower extremity somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) studies in 59 patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of lumbosacral radiculopathy and compared them with results of myelography with post-myelogram CT (myelogram/CT), MRI, and other electrodiagnostic studies. Of 38 patients with abnormal myelogram/CTs, 32 had abnormal SEPs, while 11 demonstrated EMG abnormalities. All 21 patients with normal myelogram/CTs had normal SEPs. SEP improved electrodiagnostic sensitivity in patients with weakness or reflex changes as well as in those with sensory deficits only. SEP was less sensitive in patients in whom spinal stenosis was the only radiographic finding. MRI generally corresponded well with the results of myelogram/CT and SEP but overestimated the significance of disk bulges in some patients. SEP is useful in the electrodiagnostic evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy, particularly when EMG is nondiagnostic."
CD007431,0,15830214,0,A prospective study of the interrelationship between subjective and objective measures of disability before and 2 months after lumbar decompression surgery for disc herniation.,"The value of range of motion (ROM) as an indicator of impairment associated with spinal problems, and in monitoring changes in response to treatment, is a controversial issue. The aim of this study was to examine the interrelationship between subjective disability (Roland-Morris scores) and objectively measured impairment (ROM), both before and in response to spinal decompression surgery, in an older group of patients with herniated lumbar disc (DH). Seventy-six individuals took part in the study: 33 patients (mean age 57 years, SD 9 years) presenting with DH and for whom decompression surgery was planned, and 43 controls (mean age 57 years, SD 7 years), with no history of back pain requiring medical treatment. In the patient group, pain intensity (leg and back; visual analog score), self-rated disability (Roland-Morris score), certain psychological attributes, and ROM of the spine (Spinal Mouse) were measured before and 2 months after decompression surgery. In addition, the patients rated the success of surgery on a 1-5 Likert scale. The pain-free control group performed only the tests of spinal mobility. Before surgery, compared with matched controls, significantly lower values were observed in the DH patients for standing lumbar lordosis (p=0.01), and for range of flexion of the lumbar spine (ROF(lumbar)) (p=0.0006), but not of the hips (ROF(hip)) (p=0.14). Roland-Morris Disability scores correlated significantly with ROF(lumbar) (r=0.61, p=0.0002), but less well with ROF(hip)(r=0.43, p=0.01). Two months after surgery, there were significant reductions in back pain and leg pain (p=0.0001) and in Roland-Morris Disability scores (p=0.019). There was also a significant decrease in the group mean values for lumbar lordosis angle (i.e., a ""flatter"" spine after surgery, p=0.002) and ROF(lumbar) (p=0.038). ROF(hip) showed a (nonsignificant) tendency to increase (p=0.08) towards normal control values. As a result of these two opposing changes, the range of total trunk flexion showed no significant changes from pre-surgery to 2 months post-surgery (p=0.60). On an individual basis, there was a highly significant relationship between the change in self-rated disability scores and the change in ROF(lumbar), pre-surgery- to 2 months post-surgery (r= -0.82; p<0.0001). Changes in ROF(hip) showed no such relationship (r= -0.30, p=0.10). The patients in the ""poor"" outcome group (""surgery didn't help""; 9%) had a significantly greater reduction in ROF(lumbar) post-surgery compared with the ""good"" outcome group (""surgery helped""; 91%) (p=0.04). In stepwise linear regression, the change in ROF(lumbar) was the only variable accounting for the change in self-rated disability pre-surgery to post-surgery (variables not included: pain intensity, psychological factors). The pivotal role of lumbar mobility in explaining disability emphasizes the importance of measuring lumbar and hip ranges of motion separately, as opposed to ""global trunk motion."" In the patient group examined, the determination of lumbar spinal mobility provides a valid, objective measure of function, that shows differences from normal matched controls, that correlates well with self-rated disability, and the changes in which correlate extremely well with subjective changes in disability following surgery."

Thirty consecutive patients referred to physical therapy by their primary care physician for LBP who met all eligibility criteria including a positive slump test but who had a negative straight-leg-raise test (SLR) agreed to participate in the study. All patients completed several self-report measures including a body diagram, numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Patients were randomized to receive lumbar spine mobilization and exercise (n = 14) or lumbar spine mobilization, exercise, and slump stretching (n = 16). All patients were treated in physical therapy twice weekly for 3 weeks for a total of 6 visits. Upon discharge, outcome measures were re-assessed. Independent t-tests were used to assess differences between groups at baseline and discharge. No baseline differences existed between the groups (P > .05). At discharge, patients who received slump stretching demonstrated significantly greater improvements in disability (9.7 points on the ODI, P < .001), pain (.93 points on the NPRS, P = .001), and centralization of symptoms (P < .01) than patients who did not. The results suggest that slump stretching is beneficial for improving short-term disability, pain, and centralization of symptoms. Future studies should examine whether these benefits are maintained at a longer-term follow-up."

CD007431,0,6648707,0,Variations in the pattern of muscle innervation by the L5 and S1 nerve roots.,"Evidence based on electrical studies is presented for the standard and anomalous patterns of innervation of muscles supplied by the fifth lumbar and first sacral nerve roots. Although considerable controversy still exists, previous work in this field suggests that the L5 nerve root supplies tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum brevis, and the lateral head of gastrocnemius, while the S1 nerve root innervates the medial head of gastrocnemius, soleus, and abductor hallucis. In order to confirm the reliability of this data, the L5 and S1 nerve roots of 50 patients were electrically stimulated during surgery, and distally evoked responses in the relevant muscles were recorded, using surface electrodes. The results confirm the essential reliability of the proposed table of segmental innervation and also demonstrate that most muscles have a dual innervation, with one nerve root being dominant. However, eight patients (16%) exhibited a marked departure from the normal pattern. For example, it is clear that on occasion the extensor digitorum brevis and the lateral head of gastrocnemius can be supplied by S1 and the soleus and medial head of gastrocnemius can be supplied by L5. In a prospective study of 100 patients presenting with clinical evidence of lumbosacral nerve root entrapment, the level of nerve root involvement, as predicted by electromyography, was compared with the operative findings. Correct preoperative nerve root localization was achieved in 84%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A long-term follow-up study.,"Twenty-two consecutive unselected patients who had severe spondylolisthesis were treated by a first-stage posterior decompression (Gill procedure) and a posterolateral arthrodesis, followed by halo-skeletal traction, and then by a second-stage anterior interbody arthrodesis, followed by immobilization in a cast. Nineteen patients had complete clinical and radiographic evaluation, with an average follow-up of five years (range, two to seven and one-half years). The slip angle averaged 71 degrees preoperatively, was corrected to an average of 31 degrees by reduction, and averaged 28 degrees at follow-up. The average preoperative percentage of slippage (98 per cent) did not change substantially. A pseudarthrosis developed in four patients, all of whom had a reoperation. The neurological deficits that had been present in ten patients preoperatively had completely resolved in all but one at follow-up. One patient had a cauda equina syndrome and two patients had a neuropathy of the root of the fifth lumbar nerve as a result of the reduction; complete recovery occurred in two patients and partial recovery, in one. Alignment in the sagittal plane was restored in seventeen patients, and the back pain and radicular symptoms were relieved in all patients except one who had had those symptoms preoperatively."

The surgery was designed to restore the physiological lordosis and relax tethered cord and epidural veins by transpedicular decancellation osteotomy at a vertebra other than the vertebra with peridural fibrosis. This paper presents the long-term functional outcome of these 12 patients. Clinical assessments were conducted pre-operatively and at 3-month intervals postoperatively and included X-ray assessment and evaluation of the patients' functional status by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and of pain by visual analogue scale (pain VAS). All symptoms and the pain due to peridural fibrosis disappeared in the early postoperative period. Patients had tower disability and pain scores at their early and long-term follow-ups (follow-up period 24-74 months, mean 36.3 months). For patients with failed medical therapy for peridural fibrosis accompanied by lumbar kyphosis or hypolordosis, transpedicular decancellation osteotomy should be the surgical treatment of choice."

Myelography and computed tomographic myelography (CTM) of the cervical spine documented major spondylotic compressive lesions mainly between the C3 and C5 levels. The cortical responses of dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (DSEPs) revealed progressively prolonged peak latencies and progressively decreased amplitudes of early components from C6 to C8 dermatomal stimulation. In comparison, the C5 and L2 DSEPs were affected to a lesser extent. This finding suggests that high cervical cord compression may produce dysfunction of the dorsal column caudal to the direct compressive sites. In other words, the funiculus cuneatus of C6-8 cord is most affected in high cervical myelopathy. Moreover, the funiculus cuneatus is within the border zone susceptible to an overall reduction in blood flow. We conclude therefore, that ischemia secondary to cord compression is the pathophysiology resulting in this unique syndrome of ""numb, clumsy hands"" and tactile agnosia."

CD007431,0,11964642,0,Effect of lumbar disc herniation on clinical symptoms in lateral recess syndrome.,"This study investigated the differences in the clinical features of lateral recess syndrome attributable to the bony entrapment of the spinal nerve root under the superior articular facet, and lateral recess syndrome and associated lumbar disc herniation. Ninety patients with pure bony entrapment (47 men, 43 women) ranging in age from 19 to 83 years (mean age, 63 years) and 59 patients with lumbar disc herniation in the lateral recess (43 men, 16 women) 19 to 85 years of age (mean age, 49 years) were included in this study. All patients had L5 root radiculopathies and were treated surgically. Although the early symptoms of patients with lateral recess syndrome often were in the lower extremities, many of the patients with associated lumbar disc herniation had a transition initially experiencing low back pain and subsequently having lower extremity symptoms. Flexion and extension of the lumbar spine exacerbated symptoms, particularly in patients with lumbar disc herniation. The results of the current study show that the clinical presentation of lateral recess syndrome differs depending on the cause of the compression in the lateral recess."
CD007431,0,15699793,0,Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF): technical feasibility and initial results.,"Forty-nine patients underwent minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) from October 2001 to August 2002 (minimum 18-month follow-up). The diagnosis was degenerative disc disease with herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) in 26, spondylolisthesis in 22, and a Chance-type seatbelt fracture in 1. The majority of cases (n = 45) were at L4-L5 or L5-S1. A paramedian, muscle-sparing approach was performed through a tubular retractor docked unilaterally on the facet joint. A total facetectomy was then conducted, exposing the disc space. Discectomy and endplate preparation were completed through the tube using customized surgical instruments. Structural support was achieved with allograft bone or interbody cages. Bone grafting was done with local autologous or allograft bone, augmented with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 in some cases. Bilateral percutaneous pedicle screw-rod placement was accomplished with the Sextant system. There were no conversions to open surgery. Operative time averaged 240 minutes. Estimated blood loss averaged 140 mL. Mean length of hospital stay was 1.9 days. All patients presenting with preoperative radiculopathy (n = 45) had resolution of symptoms postoperatively. Complications included two instances of screw malposition requiring screw repositioning and two cases of new radiculopathy postoperatively (one from graft dislodgement, the other from contralateral neuroforaminal stenosis). Narcotic use was discontinued 2-4 weeks postoperatively. Improvements in average Visual Analogue Pain Scale and Oswestry Disability Index (preoperative to last follow-up) scores were 7.2-2.1 and 46-14, respectively. At last follow-up, all patients had solid fusions by radiographic criteria. Results of this study indicate that minimally invasive TLIF is feasible and offers several potential advantages over traditional open techniques."

The growing economic and personal costs of this challenging entity have led to the development of a wide array of new treatments, ranging from pharmacotherapy with neuropathic medications to open surgical treatment. Among the therapeutic options to emerge are a plethora of minimally invasive treatments aimed at removing nuclear material and lowering intradiscal pressure through devices inserted percutaneously into intervertebral discs. Yet there is a compelling lack of clinical evidence to support the use of these procedures. This study was undertaken to determine the treatment outcomes of 16 consecutive patients with lumbar radicular pain secondary to a herniated disc who underwent nucleoplasty as their primary therapy."
CD007431,0,16835739,0,"Relationship between alterations of the lumbar spine, visualized with magnetic resonance imaging, and occupational variables.","Although the effect of physical workload on the occurrence of low back pain (LBP) has been extensively investigated, few quantitative studies have examined the morphological changes visualized via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in relation to occupational variables. The relationship between the severity of some abnormalities such as lumbar spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis and physical or psychosocial occupational risk factors has not been investigated previously. In this cross-sectional study patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) long-standing (minimum 1-year) LBP radiating down the leg (or not); (2) age more than 40 years; (3) willingness to undergo an MRI of the lumbar spine; and (4) ability to speak Italian. Primary objective of the study was to investigate the association between occupational exposure and morphological MRI findings, while controlling for the individual risk factors for LBP. Secondarily, we looked at the influence of this exposure and the degenerative changes in the lumbar spine on clinical symptoms and the related disability. Lumbar MRI scans from 120 symptomatic patients were supplemented by the results of structured interviews, which provided personal, medical, and occupational histories. All occupational factors were arranged on scales of increasing exposure, whereas pain and disability were assessed using ad hoc validated questionnaires. Evidence of intervertebral disc narrowing or herniation and the occurrence and severity of spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis was obtained from the MRI scans and a summative degenerative score was then calculated. We detected a direct association between increasing age and the global amount of degenerative change, the severity of intervertebral disc height loss, the number of narrowed discs, stenosis, the number of stenotic levels, and spondylolisthesis. Physical occupational exposure was not associated with the presence of lumbar disc degeneration and narrowing per se, but a higher degree of such an exposure was directly associated with a higher degree of degeneration (P=0.017). Spondylolistesis and stenosis were positively related to heavy workload (P=0.014) and the manual handling of materials (P=0.023), respectively. Psychosocial occupational discomfort was directly associated to stenosis (P=0.041) and number of stenotic levels (P=0.019). A heavier job workload was the only occupational factor positively related to the degree of disability at the multivariate analysis (P=0.002). Total amount of degeneration in the lumbar spine directly influenced pain duration (P=0.011) and degree of disability (P=0.050). These results suggest that caution should be exercised when symptomatic subjects with evidence of degenerative changes on MRI scans engage in strenuous physical labor."
CD007431,0,15614653,0,[Lumbar discogenic pain].,"Lumbar discogenic pain in the sense of an internal disc disruption (IDD) represents a nociceptive pain syndrome with the source of pain in the innervated outer third of the annulus. Such discs anatomically appear with almost normal contours. Neither clinical nor technical assessments have any diagnostic value, with the exception of MRI which has been shown, if present in symptomatic patients, to have a positive predictive value of up to 89 % to indicate a strong correlation to a painful grade 3 or 4 fissure. However, only the stimulation of a disc (controlled provocation discography) with a subsequent CT scan is of exclusive diagnostic value. As an underlying pathomechanism, a compression fracture of the superior subchondral endplate like a fatigue fracture is discussed. In this way, a deterioration of the homogeneous intradiscal stress distribution could occur with consecutive damage to the internal disc environment and the expression of a radial fissure. The clinical picture of discogenic pain is non-specific. It does not correlate with degenerative changes. It does not differ from any other back pain. Thus, it has to be differentiated from zygapophysial joint pain as well as from sacroiliac joint pain and muscular-ligamentous pain sources. In a single study of American workers, the prevalence of IDD was 39 %, rendering it one of the most important causes for patients with a specified source of back pain."

The morphometry of the canal and dural sac at the intervertebral disc level was defined by reviewing normal levels of CT scans. Levels with herniated discs were then analyzed for comparison of treatment results between successful and unsuccessful procedures. The concept of spinal reserve capacity was evaluated. Significant differences between canal morphometric parameters of patients with treatment success or failure were then identified. The concept of spinal reserve capacity may be applicable in spinal stenosis, but we were unable to delineate any predictive value in the evaluation of patients with herniated lumbar discs undergoing chemonucleolysis."
CD007431,0,8990543,0,Do pain expectancies cause pain in chronic low back patients? A clinical investigation.,"The present study investigated whether pain expectancies cause pain in chronic low back patients. Back patients (N = 29) were requested to perform four exercise bouts (two with each leg), each consisting of flexing and extending the knee three times at maximal force (Cybex 350 System). During each exercise bout the baseline pain, the expected pain and experienced pain were recorded. Patients also reported their experienced fear of further injury to the back. Furthermore, the peak force of both knee flexors and extensors was assessed. Although patients did expect a back pain increase during the first exercise bout with each leg, no evidence was found for the thesis that pain expectancies generate increases in subjective pain experiences. Instead, the reported pain expectancy was readily corrected during the next exercise bout, whereas the experienced pain remained unchanged. Furthermore, a high pain expectancy co-occurred with (1) a marginally significant fear of (re)injury, and (2) a significant lower peak torque of the knee flexors. These results are consistent with conditioning models which state that pain expectations are associated with a fear response and an urge to avoid the pain."
CD007431,0,1852159,0,A technique for needle localization in paraspinal muscles with cadaveric confirmation.,"Invasive electromyography (EMG) of the paraspinal muscles is useful in clinical and research settings. No technique for localization of the needle in specific fascicles has been validated. Recent descriptions of the segmented innervation of the multifidus imply that such a technique would add greatly to the EMG determination of root level of a radiculopathy. We have developed a technique for localization which relies on palpation of bony structures and needle insertion at certain angles and depths. The technique was evaluated by injecting latex dye in 199 locations in 13 cadavers. Dissection demonstrated that the technique was accurate in 91 of 112 injections into specific fascicles of the multifidus (originating from different spinous processes), 39 of 43 injections into the longissimus, and 35 of 44 injections into the iliocostalis. Certain types of errors would not have occurred with the aid of EMG in vivo. When these are added to the correct injections, accuracy improves 97%, 93%, and 82%, respectively. The technique described here should be useful for kinesiological studies, biopsies and injections, as well as for the EMG confirmation of a radiculopathy."
CD007431,0,11008742,0,Internal derotation osteotomy of the tibia: pre- and postoperative gait analysis in persons with high sacral myelomeningocele.,"Rotational deformities of the lower extremities are common in patients with myelomeningocele. In these situations, surgical correction is often necessary. We conducted a retrospective review of eight ambulatory patients with high sacral myelomeningocele and external tibial torsion who underwent 10 distal tibia and fibular internal derotation osteotomies. All patients had an increased valgus knee stress preoperatively. Pre- and postoperative three-dimensional gait analysis was used to evaluate coronal plane knee moments and dynamic sagittal plane knee motion. Postoperatively, a significant improvement in the abnormal internal knee varus moment (p < 0.005) as well as a significant increase in the stance phase knee extension (p < 0.01) was seen. Three patients had resolution of preoperative knee pain. We believe that patients with increased knee stress secondary to excessive external tibial torsion will benefit from a tibial derotation osteotomy that could delay or prevent the onset of late degenerative changes about the knee."

CD007431,0,16609977,0,Interrater reliability of the needle examination in lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"Low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy are among the most common painful disorders affecting the adult population. This study hypothesizes that there is good correlation between the diagnostic impression of an unblinded electromyographer, using clinical and electromyographic information, and an independent electromyographer, who uses the needle examination only to assess for lumbar radiculopathy. This is a prospective, single-blinded, observational pilot study. The needle examination was electronically recorded, reproduced, and shown to a second examiner, blinded to all clinical data. Diagnostic impressions from both examiners were recorded and evaluated for agreement. Six recorded cases were reviewed by 66 blinded examiners. Overall diagnostic agreement was 46.9% (60.5% faculty level, 28.5% resident level). Logistic regression shows a strong association between training level and agreement on diagnostic impression (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.22; P = 0.019). This study shows that there is fair interrater reliability between faculty-level examiners and poor reliability among resident-level examiners when the needle examination is used to evaluate patients with lumbar radiculopathy."

CD007431,0,8057762,0,"Quantitative MR imaging of lumbar intervertebral disc and vertebral bodies: methodology, reproducibility, and preliminary results.","Since relaxation times are influenced by the hydration of the tissue and the chemical environment of the water molecules, T1 and T2 measurements (quantitative MRI) could be used as an indicator for the water content and the biochemical composition of lumbar intervertebral discs. The discriminating power of quantitative MRI for tissue characterization in individuals (for clinical diagnosis) and in cohorts (e.g. for investigations on disc physiology or composition) relies on the reproducibility in relation to the expected tissue differences. We therefore investigated the reproducibility in vitro (lumbar spine phantom) and in vivo (10 volunteers). To estimate the differences between normal and pathologic tissues in vivo, 100 normal and 20 herniated intervertebral discs were examined by quantitative MRI in a first application of our method. The relaxation times were calculated from a set of 20 images obtained with five single-slice/multi-echo sequences at different TR values on a commercial whole-body system (1.5 T). We have found a satisfactory reproducibility in vitro (T1: 1.9%; T2: 6.2%), while the reproducibility was less satisfactory in vivo (T1: 16.4%; T2: 13.4%). Calculated from theses values, differences in relaxation times of various tissues must exceed 486 ms for T1 and 24 ms for T2 (tolerance limits) to allow discrimination with a 95% confidence in individuals. We observed statistically significant (p = 0.001) mean differences between normal (n = 100) and herniated (n = 20) intervertebral discs (delta T1: 196 ms; delta T2: 15 ms). Although statistical significant in cohorts, a discrimination of normal and herniated intervertebral discs is limited by quantitative MRI in individuals, since the differences are smaller than the tolerance limits necessary for a reliable clinical diagnosis. However, our results indicate that variations in the disc hydration and/or composition can be noninvasively detected by quantitative MRI in studies of cohorts with sufficient accuracy."

The authors performed a modified open-door laminoplasty procedure in which allograft bone and titanium miniplates were used to treat cervical myeloradiculopathy in younger patients with congenital canal stenosis while maintaining functional cervical motion segments. Pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and/or computerized tomography myelography were performed to assess changes in cervical spinal canal dimensions. Pre- and postoperative flexion-extension radiographs were compared to determine the residual motion of the targeted operative segments."

A clinicopathological study on 179 patients.","It is postulated that in addition to nerve-root compression, an inflammatory stimulus of the herniated lumbar disc is responsible for sciatic pain and radiculopathy. The clinical relevance of the histologically described inflammatory infiltrates is, however, not clearly defined [8, 22]. It was the aim of this study to assess the clinical relevance of inflammatory cells in herniated lumbar disc specimens. The presence of inflammatory cells was examined immunohistochemically in routinely processed resection specimens of the lumbar disc. The histological results were compared to prospectively obtained clinical data. Disc specimens of 179 patients who underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation were studied immunohistologically. Preoperatively each patient received a visual analogue scale for classification of the pain level and general clinical data were recorded prospectively. Varying amounts of inflammatory cells could be demonstrated in the resected disc tissue. In the statistical workup no statistically significant correlation between the histological evidence of macrophage infiltrates and the pain grading scale or the clinical data could be found. In our study there is no statistically significant correlation between macrophage infiltrates in herniated lumbar disc specimen and the obtained clinical data."
CD007431,0,8378668,0,Peripheral nerve injuries in athletes. Treatment and prevention.,"Peripheral nerve lesions are uncommon but serious injuries which may delay or preclude an athlete's safe return to sports. Early, accurate anatomical diagnosis is essential. Nerve lesions may be due to acute injury (e.g. from a direct blow) or chronic injury secondary to repetitive microtrauma (entrapment). Accurate diagnosis is based upon physical examination and a knowledge of the relative anatomy. Palpation, neurological testing and provocative manoeuvres are mainstays of physical diagnosis. Diagnostic suspicion can be confirmed by electrophysiological testing, including electromyography and nerve conduction studies. Proper equipment, technique and conditioning are the keys to prevention. Rest, anti-inflammatories, physical therapy and appropriate splinting are the mainstays of treatment. In the shoulder, spinal accessory nerve injury is caused by a blow to the neck and results in trapezius paralysis with sparing of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Scapular winging results from paralysis of the serratus anterior because of long thoracic nerve palsy. A lesion of the suprascapular nerve may mimic a rotator cuff tear with pain a weakness of the rotator cuff. Axillary nerve injury often follows anterior shoulder dislocation. In the elbow region, musculocutaneous nerve palsy is seen in weightlifters with weakness of the elbow flexors and dysesthesias of the lateral forearm. Pronator syndrome is a median nerve lesion occurring in the proximal forearm which is diagnosed by several provocative manoeuvres. Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment is common among tennis players and occurs at the Arcade of Froshe--it results in weakness of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal extensors. Ulnar neuritis at the elbow is common amongst baseball pitchers. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common neuropathy seen in sport and is caused by median nerve compression in the carpal tunnel. Paralysis of the ulnar nerve at the wrist is seen among bicyclists resulting in weakness of grip and numbness of the ulnar 1.5 digits. Thigh injuries include lateral femoral cutaneous nerve palsy resulting in loss of sensation over the anterior thigh without power deficit. Femoral nerve injury occurs secondary to an iliopsoas haematoma from high energy sports. A lesion of the sciatic nerve may indicate a concomitant dislocated hip. Common peroneal nerve injury may be due to a direct blow or a traction injury and results in a foot drop and numbness of the dorsum of the foot. Deep and superficial peroneal nerve palsies could be secondary to an exertional compartment syndrome. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a compressive lesion of the posterior tibial nerve caused by repetitive dorsiflexion of the ankle--it is common among runners and mountain climbers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD007431,0,6241399,0,[Psychogenically-induced lumbar pain].,"Diseases of the column and some psychic disturbances (e.g. neuroses) form the causes of transitory or chronic invalidity. From a psychological point of view, the lumbar region plays an important role in the polarisation of certain psychological conflicts: sexuality, aggressiveness, depression, frustration, exaggerated submission, etc. In consideration of this sensitivity of the lumbar region to certain psychic disturbances we have subjected a great number of women and men to a special neurological and clinical examination. Only in one per cent of the patients operated on no organic change was found, which underlines the importance and necessity of an appraisal of the personality of the patients with chronic, psychically caused pain. When this appraisal of the personality is omitted, diagnostic errors may occur that cannot be made good again."
CD007431,0,6979892,0,Recognition of lumbar disk disease: comparison of myelography and computed tomography.,"A retrospective study was devised to determine the correlation between myelography and computed tomography (CT) in the recognition of abnormalities of the lumbar intervertebral disk. A group of 106 patients was studied who had had both myelography and CT within a 6 week period. Each examination was interpreted separately by a neuroradiologist who had no access to the patients' clinical findings or the results of any radiologic studies. On comparison of 290 interspace levels, there was agreement in definite abnormalities in 70%. Most discrepancies were due to suspicious findings and inconclusive studies of both kinds. In particular, there was poor correlation between the two examinations in the diagnosis of a slightly bulging disk. The major discrepancy rate was less than 5% overall and less than 1% among patients without prior surgery. On the basis of these findings, a diagnostic algorithm is suggested that would facilitate the workup of a similar group of patients."
CD007431,0,9378733,0,Quality of data regarding diagnoses of spinal disorders in administrative databases. A multicenter study.,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of data regarding diagnoses of spinal disorders in administrative databases at eight different institutions. The records of 189 patients who had been managed for a disorder of the lumbar spine were independently reviewed by a physician who assigned the appropriate diagnostic codes according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The age range of the 189 patients was seventeen to eighty-four years. The six major diagnostic categories studied were herniation of a lumbar disc, a previous operation on the lumbar spine, spinal stenosis, cauda equina syndrome, acquired spondylolisthesis, and congenital spondylolisthesis. The diagnostic codes assigned by the physician were compared with the codes that had been assigned during the ordinary course of events by personnel in the medical records department of each of the eight hospitals. The accuracy of coding was also compared among the eight hospitals, and it was found to vary depending on the diagnosis. Although there were both false-negative and false-positive codes at each institution, most errors were related to the low sensitivity of coding for previous spinal operations: only seventeen (28 per cent) of sixty-one such diagnoses were coded correctly. Other errors in coding were less frequent, but their implications for conclusions drawn from the information in administrative databases depend on the frequency of a diagnosis and its importance in an analysis. This study demonstrated that the accuracy of a diagnosis of a spinal disorder recorded in an administrative database varies according to the specific condition being evaluated. It is necessary to document the relative accuracy of specific ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes in order to improve the ability to validate the conclusions derived from investigations based on administrative databases."
CD007431,0,17225000,0,Modifications of the sympathetic skin response in workers chronically exposed to lead.,"The long-term effects of low-level lead intoxication are not known. The sympathetic skin response (SSR) was evaluated in a group of 60 former workers of a primary lead smelter, located in Santo Amaro, BA, Brazil. The individuals participating in the study were submitted to a clinical-epidemiological evaluation including questions related to potential risk factors for intoxication, complaints related to peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement, neurological clinical examination, and also to electromyography and nerve conduction studies and SSR evaluation. The sample consisted of 57 men and 3 women aged 34 to 69 years (mean +/- SD: 46.8 +/- 6.9). The neurophysiologic evaluation showed the presence of lumbosacral radiculopathy in one of the individuals (1.7%), axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy in 2 (3.3%), and carpal tunnel syndrome in 6 (10%). SSR was abnormal or absent in 12 cases, representing 20% of the sample. More than half of the subjects (53.3%) reported a history of acute abdominal pain requiring hospitalization during the period of work at the plant. A history of acute palsy of radial and peroneal nerves was reported by about 16.7 and 8.3% of the individuals, respectively. Mean SSR amplitude did not differ significantly between patients presenting or not the various characteristics in the current neurological situation, except for diaphoresis. The results suggest that chronic lead intoxication induces PNS damage, particularly affecting unmyelinated small fibers. Further systematic study is needed to more precisely define the role of lead in inducing PNS injury."

CD007431,0,2770988,0,The symptomatic incompetent cervical intervertebral disc.,"A series of 16 patients with symptoms such as pain in the neck, occiput, shoulder and arm; numbness in the hands; and/or difficulty in walking, is described. Neurological examination of the upper extremities disclosed signs of nerve roots dysfunction in 5 patients and long tract signs in 12, whereas examination of the lower extremities disclosed long tract signs in every patient. Positive contrast cervical myelograms suggested mild posterior bulging of one or two intervertebral discs in every patient, but computed tomographic myelograms invariably demonstrated a coincident narrow cervical spinal canal, thus revealing the true compressive potential of the aforementioned mild disc protrusion on the spinal cord. All patients underwent anterior cervical microdiscectomy of the offending disc or discs, which were found to be degenerated. No case of frank rupture of the anulus was identified. Response to treatment was graded as excellent in 12 patients, who had complete relief of symptoms, and good in 4 patients, who had mild residual complaints. This study suggests that incompetence (bulging) of a cervical intervertebral disc may acquire important clinical significance in the presence of a narrow spinal canal by compressing the spinal cord and the corresponding nerve roots. Surgical removal of the diseased disc may result in restoration of neurological function."

Twelve patients with quantifiable weakness were selected and tested before, during, and after surgery. Nine patients showed dramatic intraoperative electrical improvement, including decreased latencies and/or increased amplitudes; all had postoperative relief of pain and motor return. Three patients showed variable intraoperative electrical responses with complete pain relief but no motor improvement. No patients had false-negative findings. Intraoperative monitoring of dermatomal evoked potentials appears to be of value in predicting the quality of spinal decompression. Similar monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials alone cannot provide the specificity for individual root levels that is available by monitoring individual dermatomes."

Five distinct clinical categories were defined. Twenty-eight percent of the patients were asymptomatic; 28% had only mechanical or degenerative lumbar pain; 6% had symptoms of a disc herniation; 21% had spinal claudication; and 17% had spinal claudication and objective neurologic deficits. Over 50% of the achondroplastic patients in this series had minor or no lumbar-spine-related symptoms through the third decade. The number of symptomatic patients did not increase in the older age groups. Ninety-one percent of symptomatic patients were 30 years of age or younger at the onset of symptoms. The presence of a thoracolumbar kyphosis, regardless of its magnitude, an L1 interpediculate distance less than 20 mm, and L5 interpediculate distance less than 16 mm, and a large structural lumbar lordosis were found more frequently in patients with disabling symptoms."

Lumbosacral spinal fibrosis is seen particularly often after extensive and repeated operations. Radicular pain responds better to stimulation than back pain. A favourable long-term effect on radicular pain has been observed in 67% of patients treated by epidural implantation, the corresponding average follow-up period being 4 1/2 years. 40% of these patients needed less analgesics after the operation, while 25% of them showed an improved fitness for work. Among about 5,000 patients who underwent surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation, an indication for spinal cord stimulation was found in 1.5%.

CD007431,0,1406196,0,Etiology of low back pain in elite boardsailors.,"Seven elite boardsailors reporting nonradiating low back pain without leg pain during sailing volunteered for detailed examination. In these subjects, the onset of pain was limited to those occasions when sailing positions were held for a significant period of time, e.g., close hauled sailing or in light winds. No pain was described at any other time. The determination of possible antecedent factors was based on the results of clinical assessment, radiological evaluation, and computer tomography (CT) scanning. Apart from limited flexibility in some subjects, the clinical examination of these athletes was normal; CT changes in this group were limited to disc protrusions and bulges, and pars interarticularis defects. Despite the small number of subjects in the present report, it appears that the frequency of these problems exceeds that in the normal population. It may be possible to suggest that risk factors such as body position during prolonged sailing, particularly under light wind conditions without a harness, and limited flexibility may be associated with the radiological findings and may be implicated in the presence of low back pain, although further investigations appears warranted."

The results were evaluated using a rating system and serial radiographs and a follow-up of 2 to 10 1/2 years (mean, 5.2 years). The overall results corroborate the advantage of the trumpet laminectomy, demonstrating a lower incidence and lower grade of postoperative lumbar scoliosis as well as less symptom recurrence in the trumpet laminectomy group than in the extensive laminectomy group. Risk factors for postoperative spinal instability and scoliosis appear to be facet joint destruction and elderly females with a high level of physical activity."

For comparison, early and late cerebral potentials in response to electrical nerve stimuli (SEPn) were recorded in the same session. In 8 patients with localized impairment of pain and temperature sensitivity we found complete absence of SEPc after stimulation of the affected area; in another patient with similar sensory deficits, the SEPc was grossly attenuated and delayed. In 1 patient with intact pain sensitivity but absent temperature sensitivity, a well defined SEPc could be recorded. Both early cortical SEPn and late SEPn in response to conventional nerve stimuli were normal in all patients and thus did not differentiate control and affected areas. These data indicate that alteration of SEPc correlates with altered pain sensitivity in patients with a circumscribed spinal lesion. SEPc may thus be used as a neurophysiological test in the assessment of hypalgesic dermatomes."

Mean age is 39.4 years, 178 males and 90 females. Sixty-two patients had compensation or litigation and 12 had prior lumbar spine surgery. Discography was performed in 223 patients, resulting in 134 one-level injections, 124 two-level injections, and ten three-level injections. Forty percent of the patients experienced postoperative muscle spasm for several days. No complications were seen in 241 patients (92%) who were available for follow-up examination at ten years; 86% had less leg pain, 82% were employed at a capacity equal to or greater than before injection, 9% were at a less strenuous job, 1% were disabled, and 8% had retired. In 22 patients treated surgically within one year of chemonucleolysis, disc-related pathology was present in 14 cases and spondylosis or spinal stenosis was present in seven cases. One had a negative exploration and continued to be disabled. Eight patients came to surgical intervention after one year because of persisting symptoms: four patients had disc protrusion, three had laminectomy and spinal fusion, and one had a decompressive laminectomy secondary to spondylotic change. Chemonucleolysis did not prejudice the outcome of subsequent surgical treatment with good results following this intervention. One tumor, a neurofibroma, was found in this study. Chemonucleolysis with chymopapain was a safe and effective treatment of radicular complaints caused by well-documented intervertebral disc herniation."

To determine whether a particular subset of symptomatic lumbar disease is specifically associated with these polymorphisms, we performed a prospective case-control study of 107 patients who underwent surgery of the lumbar spine. Patients were assigned to one of five clinical categories (fracture, disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis) based on history, imaging results, and findings during surgery. Of the 11 tryptophan-positive patients, eight had spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis and three had disc herniation. The presence of the tryptophan allele was significantly associated with African-American or Asian designation for race (odds ratio 4.61, 95% CI 0.63 to 25.35) and with the diagnosis of spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis (odds ratio 6.81, 95% CI 1.47 to 41.95). Our findings indicate that tryptophan polymorphisms predispose carriers to the development of symptomatic spinal stenosis associated with spondylolisthesis which requires surgery."

On the basis of characteristic clinical symptoms of radicular and pseudoradicular syndrome patients were divided into two groups: 45 patients with dominant pseudoradicular syndrome and 35 persons with dominant radicular syndrome. All patients underwent clinical examination before and after traction treatment. Clinical evaluation included: the pain syndrome, postural disturbances and nerve root dysfunctions. The effects of the traction treatment were significantly worse in patients with the pseudoradicular syndrome. These results suggest the necessity of differential therapeutic approach in lumbar disc disease patients depending on the predominance of the pathomechanism of disease."

These parameters were compared with the grade of disc degeneration as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging with the aim of studying lumbar segmental instability. Disc space height decreased in proportion to the grade of disc degeneration. Angular displacement was significantly less with severe disc degeneration, accompanied by a tendency to stabilization of the motion segment. Tilting movement and horizontal displacement did not correlate with the grade of disc degeneration. Lumbar segmental instability was recognized at all levels even in individuals who appeared to be normal or to have mild disc degeneration. The incidence of lumbar segmental instability at the L3-4 level was significantly higher in patients with normal discs or mild disc degeneration.

This leakage corresponds to a total body dose of 0.4 rad and a liver dose of 2.5 rad, equivalent to a lumbosacral series of diagnostic radiographs. Eighty percent of the treated knees showed improvement, which was maintained as long as one year after treatment. There was a direct correlation between the preoperative radiographic stage and the response to treatment, with patients in Stages I and II more likely to have a good or excellent response at one year. There was also good correlation between clinical improvement and improvement in technetium-99m (99mTc)-pertechnetate flow scintigraphy. Chemical synovectomy by the instillation of appropriate radionuclides can be recommended as an effective means of reducing inflammation, effusion, and pain in patients with RA. The duration of favorable results cannot be predicted, but the results to date suggest that longevity should be comparable with that of surgical synovectomy. Like surgical synovectomy, radiation synovectomy is most effective in the early stages of the disease process, before there is extensive destruction of cartilage and bone."
CD007431,0,12610691,0,Clonus after human spinal cord injury cannot be attributed solely to recurrent muscle-tendon stretch.,"Clonus, presented behaviorally as rhythmic distal joint oscillation, is a common pathology that occurs secondary to spinal cord injury (SCI) and other neurological disabilities. There are two predominant theories as to the underlying mechanism of clonus. The prevailing one is that clonus results from recurrent activation of stretch reflexes. An alternative hypothesis is that clonus results from the action of a central oscillator. We present evidence that the mechanism underlying clonus in individuals with SCI is not solely related to muscle stretch. We studied electromyography (EMG) of the soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral hamstrings, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris from subjects with clinically complete and clinically incomplete SCI during stretch-induced ankle clonus, stepping, and non-weight-bearing standing. Clonic EMG of the SOL, MG, and TA occurred synchronously and were not consistently related to muscle-tendon stretch in any of the conditions studied. Further, EMG activity during stretch-induced ankle clonus, stepping, and non-weight-bearing standing had similar burst frequency, burst duration, silent period duration, and coactivation among muscles, indicating that clonic EMG patterns occurred over a wide range of kinematic and kinetic conditions, and thus proprioceptive inputs. These results suggest that the repetitive clonic bursts could not be attributable solely to immediate afferent feedback such as recurrent muscle stretch. However, these results support the theory that the interaction of central mechanisms and peripheral events may be responsible for clonus."
CD007431,0,2975066,0,Signs and symptoms after chemonucleolysis. A detailed evaluation of 214 worker's compensation and noncompensation patients.,"The effectiveness of chemonucleolysis was examined in a retrospective study of 214 consecutive patients with herniated lumbar discs. All patients were candidates for surgery. All underwent myelography, and most had computed tomography (CT) scans. The clinical status of patients was assessed at 6 weeks and at 6 months, and evaluation was made from responses of the patients to a questionnaire at 1 year. Evaluation at 1 year demonstrated that the results of chemonucleolysis were successful for 181 patients (84.6%). Of the 172 patients who received no worker's compensation, the procedure was successful for 90.7%. Of 42 with worker's compensation, the success rate was 59.5%. After chemonucleolysis, most patients showed neurologic improvement. Data comparing neurologic symptoms and signs between compensation and noncompensation patients are presented. This is the first report of objective data after chemonucleolysis in these two groups. A discussion on the morbidity and mortality of chemonucleolysis is included, along with a comparison of cost between chemonucleolysis and laminectomy."

Early clinical results with TDR have shown a significant reduction in low back pain and a significant improvement in disability scores. When compared to fusion, the results with TDR tend to be superior in the short-term follow-up and initial rehabilitation is faster. The radiological assessment is an integral part of the preoperative work-up. Plain X-rays of the lumbar spine should be complemented by flexion - extension views in order to assess residual segmental mobility. Computed tomography is used to exclude osteoarthritis of the zygapophyseal joints, Baastrup's disease (kissing spines) and other sources of low back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful to exclude substantial disc protrusions; it allows for the detection of disc dehydration and bone marrow edema in the case of activated spondylochondrosis. If osteoporosis is suspected, an osteodensitometry of the lumbar spine should be performed. Postoperative plain X-rays should include antero-posterior and lateral views as well as flexion - extension views in the later postoperative course. Measurements should determine the disc space height in the lateral view, the segmental and total lumbar lordosis as well as the segmental mobility in the flexion - extension views. The ideal position of a TDR is exactly central in the ap-view and close to the dorsal border of the vertebral endplates in the lateral view. Malpositioning may cause segmental hyperlordosis and unbalanced loading of the endplates with the risk of implant subsidence and migration."

A pilot study was done in 1971 on six patients. In this trial, 28 patients were operated on with informed consent. Twenty-three had a minimum of five years' follow-up study. There were 14 men and boys, and nine women and girls. The average follow-up period was eight years and four months (range, five to 12 years three months). The average age at operation was 36 years four months (range, 13-66 years). Symptomatic improvement were divided into three groups. Sixteen patients were in Group 1, three in Group 2, and three in Group 3. Flexion-extension radiographs showed 14 patients with no movement between the vertebral bodies adjacent to the operated disk, five with minimal movement, and four with definite movement. At the implant-bone interface, no radiolucent zone was seen in 18 patients, and a definite radiolucent zone was seen in five. Twenty implants were intact, three implants had developed a crack, and three were deformed. There were no complications. The titanium-mesh block implant is an effective substitute for autogenous bone grafting in interbody fusion."
CD007431,0,12782871,0,Efficacy of serotonin receptor blocker for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.,"Serotonin is one of the chemical mediators associated with nerve root inflammation and sciatic symptoms in lumbar disc herniation. The efficacy of serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor blocker was examined in 44 patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. A selective 5-HT(2A) receptor blocker (sarpogrelate hydroxychloride) was administered orally at a dose of 300 mg per day for 2 weeks. Visual analog scales of low back pain, sciatic pain, and numbness were significantly improved after the administration of the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor blocker. Clinical results were good (> 50% pain relief) in 23 patients, fair (25%-50% pain relief) in five patients, and poor (< 25% of pain relief) in 16 patients. Nineteen patients eventually required surgery because of muscle weakness or cauda equina symptoms. The effect of 5-HT(2A) blocker was good in 64% of patients who had uncontained disc herniation, whereas all patients with contained disc herniation had fair or poor results. Patients with uncontained disc herniation responded more favorably to the 5-HT(2A) blocker treatment than patients with contained disc herniation. A 5-HT(2A) blocker has the potential to block the cascade of acute nerve root inflammation and to alleviate symptoms in lumbar disc herniation."

In addition, the subjects were asked about leisure time physical activities in an interview preceding the measurements. Spinal muscular atrophy was the only finding that was more common among physically inactive subjects (p = 0.005). Moreover, increased occurrence of disk degeneration (DD) was observed in the low-activity group. However, the difference was not significant. Neither Scheuermann-type changes nor DD were related to spinal mobility or trunk muscle strength. Children with disk protrusion were, on the average, taller (p = 0.044), and their lumbar flexion measured by flexicurve was decreased (p = 0.043). Our results strengthen further the evidence that MRI is a sensitive measure and that imaging findings must be interpreted carefully with respect to pain and physical impairment of the lumbar spine. Furthermore, no clear evidence of the association between physical activity and early DD could be found."

We retrospectively reviewed the database of 3720 cases of spine operation in a single institute over 7 years (1998 April- 2005 July). Nine patients who demonstrated neurologic deterioration after surgery and required surgical decompression were identified. Factors postulated to increase the postoperative epidural hematoma and to improve neurologic outcome were investigated. The incidence of postoperative epidural hematoma was 0.24%. Operation sites were cervical 3 cases, thoracic 2 cases, and lumbar 4 cases. Their original diagnoses were tumor 3 cases, cervical stenosis 2 cases, lumbar stenosis 3 cases and herniated lumbar disc 1 case. The symptoms of epidural hematomas were neurologic deterioration and pain. After decompression, clinical outcome revealed complete recovery in 3 cases (33.3%), incomplete recovery in 5 cases (55.6%) and no change in 1 case (11.1%). Factors increasing the risk of postoperative epidural hematoma were coagulopathy from medical illness or anticoagulation therapy (4 cases, 44.4%) and highly vascularized tumor (3 cases, 33.3%). The time interval to evacuation of complete recovery group (29.3 hours) was shorter than incomplete recovery group (66.3 hours). Patients with coagulopathy and highly vascularized tumor were more vulnerable to spinal epidural hematoma. The postoperative outcome was related to the preoperative neurological deficit and the time interval to the decompression."

CD007431,0,8434328,0,Cerebrospinal fluid proteins as indicators of nerve root compression in patients with sciatica caused by disc herniation.,"Patients with sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation were studied to identify biochemical changes in the cerebrospinal fluid related to myelographic findings and clinical observations. One hundred forty-three patients were evaluated by myelography with regard to involvement of the dural sac and the nerve root. A medial group (20 patients) with evidence of dural sac impingement was compared to a lateral group (63 patients) and an extreme lateral group (9 patients) whose condition primarily affected the nerve root. The remaining 51 patients comprised a mixed group with involvement of both the dural sac and the nerve root. The mean cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio, cerebrospinal fluid/serum immunoglobulin G ratio, and cerebrospinal fluid total proteins showed a significantly increasing trend from the medial through the lateral to the extreme lateral groups. Patients with lateral lumbar disc herniations more often showed neurologic deficits. These results indicate that the elevated cerebrospinal fluid total protein found in the patients with sciatica is due to leaking of plasma proteins primarily from the nerve root into the cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebrospinal fluid proteins may be used as diagnostic parameters of nerve root compression, especially when surgery is a consideration or in patients in whom sciatica is unlikely."

Most juxta-facet cysts are observed at the L4/5 level, which generally has the most motion within the lumbar spine. In this retrospective study 31 juxta-facet cysts in 28 patients were detected within 2898 lumbar MRI studies over a 2-year period (frequency 1%). 24 patients complained of back and lower extremity pain, the other 4 patients had unilateral back pain. In 7 cases radicular symptoms were observed, in 6 patients a neurogenic claudication. In 78% of the patients juxta-facet cysts were responsible for clinical symptoms. MRI is the diagnostic imaging technique of choice due to a high sensitivity. The juxta-facet cysts were located extradural, laterally to the thecal sack and adjacent to a degenerated facet joint. In all but one cases the cysts showed a signal intensity equivalent to cerebrospinal fluid. T2-weighted pulse sequences in sagittal orientation were very useful in delineating the hypointense cyst wall. In 1 patient with acute radicular pain MRI demonstrated a subacute hemorrhage within a juxta-facet cyst. Calcifications and gas-filled cysts can be missed with MRI, but will be demonstrated by computed tomography. 45% of the juxta-facet cysts showed an enhancement of the cyst wall after injection of Gd-DTPA. Spontaneous reduction or resolution of the cyst may occur during rest. Injection of corticosteroids into the corresponding facet joint may reduce the inflammatory process and resolve the symptoms in up to 70%. Surgical resection of the cyst is indicated in case of intractable pain and significant neurologic deficit and generally produces good relief from radicular symptoms."

In this paper a new radiological classification for lumbar disc herniations has been used in order to study the predictive value of the type and location of the herniation for the postoperative result. 142 patients operated with standard lumbar discectomy were included in the study. The preoperative CT-scans were used to classify the disc herniations in the transverse, sagittal and longitudinal directions and the size of the herniations were calculated. At a mean of 7.7 years postoperatively a patient administrated questionnaire was used to compare the clinical results to the radiological findings. A significantly smaller size of the lumbar disc herniation was found with increasing age, which could reflect the increased degeneration of the disc. Patients with a wide transverse distribution of the herniation seem to have a less favorable postoperative outcome in terms of higher rate of repeat surgery (p = 0.056).

As a control group we examined with MRI 30 professional swimmers as well. Among the volley-ball players the incidence of intervertebral disk alterations was 44.4%; they were represented by 8 cases of disk degeneration, 11 cases of bulging and 9 disk herniations (in 8 patients the simultaneous presence of more than one lesion was observed). In the control group the incidence of such lesions was 20%. The obtained results were correlated with the clinical findings and the age of the athletes. Among the 26 athletes with back pain only 13 had positive findings at MRI, while among the 19 asymptomatic athletes 7 showed lesions detectable with MRI. As for age, we observed that the younger athletes (17-19 years) had positive MRI findings in 38.5% of cases, while the players in the age group ranging from 23 to 26 years, had positive MRI findings in 56.2% of cases. The analysis of the different types of training of the volley-ball players and the control group, showed that 19 volley-ball players who followed appropriate training procedures had positive MRI findings in 21.1% of cases (in the control group the percentage was 20%). Among the 26 athletes who were trained with exercises that caused significant functional overload, 16 had intervertebral disk lesions at MRI (61.5%). Moreover, our data showed that the correlation of the incidence of disk lesions with the type of training (and relative varying degree of overload) is definitely more important than the one existing with the age of volley-ball players and the overall period of their athletic activity. MRI proved to be a useful technique for the early assessment of the intervertebral disk damage caused by an incorrect training in young athletes, even when asymptomatic."

CD007431,0,2409171,0,The contribution of neurogenic inflammation in experimental arthritis.,"The release of the peptide neurotransmitter substance P from the peripheral terminals of nociceptive afferent neurons and the release of catecholamines from postganglionic sympathetic efferent neurons produce physiologic changes associated with acute inflammation. The contribution of these neurogenic mechanisms to inflammatory diseases has not been determined. Activation of central neural circuits elicits similar physiologic changes, and lesions of the peripheral and central nervous system are associated with alteration in activity of inflammatory diseases. We have evaluated the contribution of neurogenic inflammation to the severity of joint injury in experimentally induced arthritis in the rat. The finding of a greater density of substance P-containing nociceptive afferents in a joint that develops more severe arthritis (ankle) suggests a role of substance P in joint injury. Direct evidence that the proinflammatory factor released from these nociceptors is substance P is provided by the finding that the injection of substance P into a joint which normally develops less severe arthritis (knee) increases the severity of arthritis in that joint. A contribution of catecholamines to the severity of joint injury was suggested by the finding that both guanethidine-induced sympathectomy and reserpine-induced depletion of catecholamines attenuated the severity of joint injury. Finally, a contribution of central neural circuits to inflammatory processes was studied in a model in which activation of nociceptive afferents elicited swelling and tenderness at a remote site. This reflex neurogenic inflammation was inhibited by intracerebroventricular injections of morphine, which also attenuated the severity of arthritis. These studies provide evidence that elements of the peripheral afferent and sympathetic efferent neurons and of descending supraspinal, opioid-mediated, circuits in the central nervous system modulate the severity of joint injury in experimental arthritis in the rat."

Sciatica and root tension signs decreased promptly after surgery and remained largely unchanged during followup, which was not the case for neurologic signs. Similarly, pain relief was not associated with neurologic signs but was associated with lumbar mobility and root tension signs. Patients without neurologic symptoms before surgery did not report more sciatica after 2 years than did those with positive neurologic signs before surgery. Positive crossed Lasegue sign and restricted lumbar mobility before surgery predicted better chances for postoperative pain relief. Patients with a ruptured anulus fibrosus at surgery had less sciatica and back pain after surgery than did patients with an intact anulus fibrosus."

CD007431,0,10825111,0,Clinical and pathologic characteristics of lumbar disk herniation in the elderly.,"The clinical and pathologic characteristics of lumbar disk herniation in 23 elderly patients (15 men and 8 women) who required surgical treatment were investigated. Average age at surgery was 67.3 years, and average follow-up was 23 months. Preoperatively, the predominant symptom was severe unilateral leg pain, and 13 patients were nonambulatory because of leg pain. Operative treatment included wide laminectomy in 8, hemilaminectomy in 3, fenestration in 10, and osteoplastic laminectomy in 2 patients. Four (17%) patients had disk herniation at the L2-L3 or L3-L4 level. Sequestered herniation with or without migration was observed in 15 (65%) patients. Of 14 sequestered disk fragments examined histologically, 8 (57%) specimens contained cartilaginous or bony end plate with anulus fibrosus or nucleus pulposus. Postoperatively, results were rated as excellent in 11 patients and good in 12; no patient was rated as fair or poor. Severe leg pain affecting activities of daily life is a predominant symptom of disk herniation in the elderly. For patients in whom conservative treatment has failed, operative treatment should be considered. In lumbar disk herniation in the elderly, the incidence of cephalad and lateral herniation is higher than in younger patients. In addition, sequestered and migrated herniations including end plate are frequent."
CD007431,0,2212906,0,Clinical aspects of lumbar intervertebral disc disease.,"The diagnosis and management of lumbar disc disease has undergone significant changes in recent years. This is especially true for diagnostic imaging studies (MRI and CT). Currently, CT/myelography or unenhanced MRI may be used to confirm the diagnosis and the level of involvement of lumbar disc disease. The indications for lumbar disc surgery include patients with neurologic deficits and/or those in whom intractable pain does not respond to conservative measures. Conventional disc surgery and/or microdiscectomy are both good operative procedures for lumbar disc disease, and each yields excellent results when criteria for diagnosis and surgery are strictly followed."
CD007431,0,3194066,0,Diagnostic value of different electrophysiologic tests in cervical disk prolapse.,"We evaluated 24 patients with radiologically verified cervical disk prolapse. EMG abnormalities appeared in 67% of cases studied; dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials revealed 85% abnormal findings on the affected side, but also revealed abnormalities in adjacent segments. In 38%, F responses were abnormal. We found electrodiagnostic abnormalities at levels without a disk prolapse, probably due to degenerative spondylopathic changes and beginning consecutive vascular compromise."
CD007431,0,15024661,0,EMG recovery and ratings after back extensor fatigue in patients with lumbar disc herniation and healthy subjects.,"This prospective study aimed to examine whether patients with lumbar disc herniation, before and after surgery, showed impaired recovery from fatigue measured with EMG and subjective ratings as compared to healthy subjects. Forty-three patients due for, and after, lumbar disc surgery and 60 healthy subjects were fatigued using a modified Sørensen's test. Recovery of back extensor muscles was assessed using electromyography and the Borg scale ratings at 1, 2, 3, and 5 minutes of recovery, and was further analyzed using an exponential time-dependence model. The patients completed four questionnaires: the Oswestry, the Roland-Morris, a self-efficacy scale and the SF-36. The exponential time-dependence model was successful for 14 of the 43 patients and 57 of the 60 healthy subjects. The patients for whom the model succeeded had significantly better scores on the questionnaires than those for whom the model was unsuccessful. Specific items related to standing and lifting were identified. The patients' recovery was impaired compared to the healthy subjects, as determined by use of the exponential time-dependence model. The combination of fatigue and recovery measures was reflected in the questionnaire scores and is therefore important for evaluating patients with lumbar disc herniation."
CD007431,0,7105575,0,Lumbar spinal nerve lateral entrapment.,"In past years, lumbar nerve lateral entrapment seldom has been diagnosed. A presumptive preoperative diagnosis has been made based on clinical findings and radiographs demonstrating disc resorption. The Computed Tomography scan has made it possible to diagnose the lesion with certainty and accuracy. Treatment for patients who do not respond to conservative measures is a bilateral minimal partial laminectomy. The lateral canal is enlarged by removing the medial and anterior parts of the superior articular process. Adhesion formation is prevented by placing a free fat graft posterior to the dura. Instability is diagnosed by examining stress radiographs and, when present, is treated by a one level posterolateral fusion. After operation, marked improvement was obtained in 62% of patients and slight improvement in another 21%; 17% were unimproved. Sixty-two per cent of patients reported no pain or mild pain. Sixty-six per cent resumed their previous occupation."

CD007431,0,3374776,0,Surgical management of extreme lateral lumbar disc herniations: review of 138 cases.,"Extreme lateral disc herniations in the authors' series account for 10% of all lumbar herniations; 80% occurred at the L3, L4 and L4, L5 interspaces. The authors review the clinical findings in 138 patients and point to the characteristic features of the clinical syndrome. They compare the accuracy of various diagnostic studies and conclude that computed tomography is highly accurate and should be used before other diagnostic studies. Discography is still helpful as a confirmatory study in some cases, whereas myelography is particularly useful in disclosing other associated lesions. Analysis of the operative series revealed a high percentage of extruded fragments (60%) and a significant number of double herniations on the same side and at the same level (15%). These two findings may respectively preclude chemonucleolysis and microsurgery from the surgical management of extreme lateral herniations. Double herniations explain some discrepancies in the clinical picture and are emphasized as a potential source of error in diagnosis. The surgical technique allows exploration for herniations within the intervertebral canal as well as for extraforaminal herniations without sacrifice of the facet. Operative results are presented."

An analysis of 15 cases.,"Extraforaminal lumbar disc herniations are uncommon, but thanks to recent progress in imaging procedures, they may be easily diagnosed. Several surgical approaches have been described and employed to remove these herniations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical, radiological and surgical features which differentiate the treatment of this type of hernia from the more common surgical approaches to other types of lumbar disc hernias."
CD007431,0,9394964,0,Thrombangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease): still a limb threatening disease.,"A series of 29 well-documented and properly analysed patients with thrombangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) is presented. The diagnosis of Buerger's disease was based on following criteria: smoking history, onset before the age of 50 years, infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease, either upper limb involvement or phlebitis migrans, absence of atherosclerotic risk factors other than smoking. In the last 10 years (1986-1996), we identified 29 patients who met these rigid criteria. There were 24 men and 5 women, aged 32.4 years at the moment of the disease first clinical symptom. The cumulative tobacco use averaged 16 pack-years for each patient. The initial symptom was limited gangrene of a toe (n = 9) or a finger (n = 2), foot claudication (n = 6), calf claudication (n = 3), rest pain (n = 3), migratory superficial phlebitis (n = 4), and Raynaud phenomenon (n = 2). Angiography and/or Doppler ultrasound revealed digital, pedal and calf artery involvement in all patients, with proximal extension in ten patients (femoropopliteal in ten, including three cases with external iliac artery involvement). Seven patients had also evidence of upper limb involvement. Histologic proof was available in only seven patients. Only nine patients completely stopped smoking. Treatment was exclusively medical in five cases. Twenty-four underwent sympathectomy (20 at lumbar, and four at thoracic level), with good immediate result in 16. In 11 patients a vascular reconstruction was done (eight femorocrural and three iliofemoral bypasses), with a patency rate of only 36% at two years. Amputation was required in 16 patients (a mean of 2.7 amputations per patient) at one or more levels: toe (n = 19), forefoot (n = 5), below knee (n = 8), above knee (n = 2), finger (n = 3). Two patients ended up with bilateral leg amputation. Overall, 23% (7/30) of the patients required major leg amputation during the course of the disease. Disease progression was moderately related to continued tobacco use. Buerger's disease still entails considerable risk of major amputation. Complete abstinence from tobacco use is crucial to expect stabilization of the process. However, in advanced stages of the disease and despite cessation of smoking recurrent episodes of ischaemia or tissue loss are not excluded."
CD007431,0,12582791,0,Two-year results after lumbar microdiscectomy with and without prophylaxis of a peridural fibrosis using Adcon-L.,A retrospective study investigated the advantages of the intraoperative application of the anti-adhesion barrier gel Adcon-L after lumbar microdiscectomy.
CD007431,0,1388253,0,[Factors determining the results of surgical treatment of backache syndromes in the lumbar spine].,"The therapeutic results were analysed in a group of 509 patients operated on for low back pain syndromes (after previous establishing of indications based on clinical examination and radiological investigations) with over 6 months of follow-up. The therapeutic results were compared with the observed symptoms and signs, neurological findings, age, duration of acute phase of the disease, surgical approach used, changes found during the operation, stability of the spine and type of its surgical immobilization. The therapeutic result depended mainly on the degree of neurological abnormalities before the operation, duration of the acute phase and operative findings as well as spinal stability. The operative approach and stabilization type, although influencing the result, were a consequence of the above factors."
CD007431,0,17356146,0,Interbody fusion with allograft and rhBMP-2 leads to consistent fusion but early subsidence.,"We carried out a prospective study to determine whether the addition of a recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) to a machined allograft spacer would improve the rate of intervertebral body fusion in the spine. We studied 77 patients who were to undergo an interbody fusion with allograft and instrumentation. The first 36 patients received allograft with adjuvant rhBMP-2 (allograft/rhBMP-2 group), and the next 41, allograft and demineralised bone matrix (allograft/demineralised bone matrix group). Each patient was assessed clinically and radiologically both pre-operatively and at each follow-up visit using standard methods. Follow-up continued for two years. Every patient in the allograft/rhBMP-2 group had fused by six months. However, early graft lucency and significant (> 10%) subsidence were seen radiologically in 27 of 55 levels in this group. The mean graft height subsidence was 27% (13% to 42%) for anterior lumbar interbody fusion, 24% (13% to 40%) for transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, and 53% (40% to 58%) for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Those who had undergone fusion using allograft and demineralised bone matrix lost only a mean of 4.6% (0% to 15%) of their graft height. Although a high rate of fusion (100%) was achieved with rhBMP-2, significant subsidence occurred in more than half of the levels (23 of 37) in the lumbar spine and 33% (6 of 18) in the cervical spine. A 98% fusion rate (62 of 63 levels) was achieved without rhBMP-2 and without the associated graft subsidence. Consequently, we no longer use rhBMP-2 with allograft in our practice if the allograft has to provide significant structural support."
CD007431,0,18272560,0,Value of diagnostic lumbar selective nerve root block: a prospective controlled study.,"Although diagnostic lumbar selective nerve root blocks are often used to confirm the pain-generating nerve root level, the reported accuracy of these blocks has been variable and their usefulness is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic lumbar selective nerve root blocks to analyze potential causes of false results in a prospective, controlled, single-blinded manner."
CD007431,0,9312686,0,[Juxta-facet cysts as space-occupying intraspinal processes].,"Ganglionic and synovial cysts (juxta-facet cysts) causing nerve root compression are very rare. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best means of diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the cysts, though spontaneous remissions do occur. CT-guided aspiration of the cysts and corticosteroid injection can lead the symptoms to disappear, but only for a short time. In a retrospective study covering a period of 16.5 years, we discovered 24 juxta-facet cysts (10 ganglionic and 14 synovial cysts) with clinical symptoms in a total of 19,107 lumbar and thoracic operations performed to relieve nerve root compression: 16 cysts were located at the level L4-5,3 at the level L5-S1,2 at L3-4, and 1 each at the levels L2-3, L1-2, and T10-1. Seven patients complained of radicular pain, and the other 17 patients also had neurological deficits. Fourteen cysts were resected, and in 10 cases the lumbar disc was removed simultaneously. The average follow-up in 23 of the 24 patients was 26.6 months. Most (74%) of the patients became free of pain. Pareses disappeared in 89% and sensory deficits in 73% of cases."
CD007431,0,9144678,0,Side effects and complications of automated percutaneous lumbar nucleotomy.,"We reviewed the records of 243 patients treated at 271 disc levels to determine the incidence of side effects and complications of percutaneous nucleotomy. In our early experience there were 7 technical failures (2.5% of all attempts), of which 6 were at the 5th disc level. The success rate dropped from 67% at 3 months to 60% 1 year after treatment due to recurrences in 16 patients (6.6%). Extruded or sequestered fragments were found in 6 patients (2.4%), and may have been caused by nucleotomy. However, only one was accompanied by aggravation of symptoms. Discitis was seen in 2 patients (0.8%), both treated at two separate disc levels. About half the patients experienced increased low back pain, mean duration 9 days, after treatment, and 3 (1.2%), of whom 2 also had nonorganic disorders, needed admission to hospital because of severe pain. Mild spasm and a sensation of instability were noted by 9.6% and 25% of the patients respectively. Injury to nerves, bowels, vessels or ureters or a dural leak never occurred. The study confirms earlier reports that the rate of serious complications is low."
CD007431,0,18163905,0,Health-related quality of life of patients following selected types of lumbar spinal surgery: a pilot study.,"Over 500,000 spinal surgeries are performed annually in the United States. Although pain relief and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are expectations following lumbar spinal surgery, there is limited research regarding this experience from the individual's perspective. In addition, no studies have examined the HRQOL of persons who have had this surgery using a comprehensive approach. The intent of this study was to address this deficiency by an assessment of both the individual and environmental factors that impact perceived HRQOL using the Wilson and Cleary Model for Health-Related Quality of Life in persons who have undergone lumbar spinal surgery."
CD007431,0,11132978,0,Disc degeneration in patients with lumbar spondylolysis.,"The grade of intervertebral disc degeneration in 73 symptomatic patients with lumbar spondylolysis was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging to assess the prevalence of disc degeneration. The results were compared with those of age- and sex-matched asymptomatic control populations and with patients with clinical back pain symptoms but without spondylolysis. The relationship between disc degeneration and age of patients, the duration and severity of clinical symptoms, and the grade of vertebral slip was evaluated. A five-point grading scale based on T2 signal intensity recommended by Gibson et al. was used to evaluate the degree of disc degeneration. The grade of disc degeneration below the spondylolytic defect in the patients was highly significantly related to the age of patients (p < 0.01) and was more severe than in the controls (p < 0.01), but there was no difference of disc degeneration above the defect between the patients and the controls (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the grade of disc degeneration below the spondylolytic defect in the patients was highly significantly correlated with the duration of clinical symptoms (p < 0.01), although it was not associated with the severity of clinical symptoms or the grade of vertebral slip (p > 0.05). The results suggest that the degree of disc degeneration at the spondylolytic level is a more important determinant for choice of the fusion procedure than the age of the patients or the grade of vertebral slip, and that preoperative magnetic resonance examination is of great importance to evaluation of disc degeneration."
CD007431,0,11132979,0,Abnormalities of the soleus H-reflex in lumbar spondylolisthesis: a possible early sign of bilateral S1 root dysfunction.,"Using routine electrodiagnostic procedures, the authors searched for physiologic evidence of nerve root compromise in patients with chronic mechanical perturbation to the lumbar spine. They examined 37 patients with spondylolisthesis and various degrees of degenerative changes in the lumbar canal. Clinical and neurophysiologic findings were compared with data obtained from 36 healthy persons. The soleus H-reflex appeared to be a sensitive indicator of sensory fiber compromise at the S1 root level, because changes correlated well with the focal sensory signs and preceded clinical and electromyographic signs of motor root involvement. When these occurred, the clinical findings were consistent with a more severe nerve root deficit and with radiographic evidence of neural compression. The greater sensitivity of the soleus H-reflex may be related to the pathophysiologic events that occur at the lesion site."
CD007431,0,9506196,0,"Clinical assessment of a novel antiadhesion barrier gel: prospective, randomized, multicenter, clinical trial of ADCON-L to inhibit postoperative peridural fibrosis and related symptoms after lumbar discectomy.","A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of ADCON-L Anti-Adhesion Barrier Gel (a medical device by Gliatech Inc, Cleveland, OH) was conducted in 298 patients undergoing first-time lumbar discectomy to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ADCON-L in preventing postoperative peridural fibrosis and in improving patient clinical outcome. After lumbar discectomy, patients were randomized to receive either ADCON-L gel or nothing (control group) at the conclusion of the surgical procedure. Six months after surgery, peridural scar was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, and postoperative pain and straight-leg-raise angle were assessed. No statistically significant differences between the ADCON-L and control groups were observed in terms of adverse events or wound healing characteristics. ADCON-L gel was shown to be safe and to significantly inhibit peridural scar compared with the control group (P = 0.002). That peridural scarring was reduced with ADCON-L gel was further supported by direct visualization of scar tissue at reoperation in both groups. ADCON-L-treated patients had better clinical outcomes than did control patients. The incidence of activity-related pain was significantly reduced (P = 0.013), straight-leg-raise examination scores were significantly improved (P = 0.024 on the operative side and P = 0.015 on the nonoperative side), and ADCON-L reduced low back pain when it was most severe (P = 0.047) and at the end of the day (P = 0.044)."
CD007431,0,135669,0,Variations in size of the bony lumbar canal in patients with prolapse of lumbar intervertebral discs.,"Prolapse of the lumbar intervertebral disc is one of the commonly accepted causes of low back pain. Most patients respond well to conservative treatment, but some may not respond at all. Though the reason for this variation is not clearly understood, it is felt that a developmentally narrow spinal canal might have some relation to the persistence of backache and sciatica. The canal was therefore measured at each of the lumbar vertebral level by a method described by Jones and Thomson (1969) in 100 consecutive patients operated upon for prolapsed lumbar intervertebral discs, in 100 normal patients for comparison. This method does not give direct measurements of the bony spinal canal but provides a ratio of the size of the canal to the adjacent vertebral body. We found a trend towards the presence of a narrower than normal lumbar canal in patients with prolapsed lumbar intervertebral discs. It is concluded that in patients with prolapsed lumbar intervertebral discs necessitating operation, the canal tends to be narrower than normal, and such narrowing enhances the effect of any disc protrusion leading to severe symptoms of backache and sciatica."
CD007431,0,12384741,0,The dynamic neutralization system for the spine: a multi-center study of a novel non-fusion system.,"Various forms of lumbar instability require a surgical stabilization. As an alternative to fusion, a mobile, dynamic stabilization restricting segmental motion would be advantageous in various indications, allowing greater physiological function and reducing the inherent disadvantages of rigid instrumentation and fusion. The dynamic neutralization system for the spine (Dynesys) is a pedicle screw system for mobile stabilization, consisting of titanium alloy screws connected by an elastic synthetic compound, controlling motion in any plane (non-fusion system). This prospective, multi-center study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Dynesys in the treatment of lumbar instability conditions, evaluating pre- and post-operative pain, function, and radiological data on a consecutive series of 83 patients. Indications consisted of unstable segmental conditions, mainly combined with spinal stenosis (60.2%) and with degenerative discopathy (24.1%), in some cases with disc herniation (8.4%), and with revision surgery (6.0%). Thirty-nine patients additionally had degenerative spondylolisthesis, and 30 patients had undergone previous lumbar surgery. In 56 patients instrumentation was combined with direct decompression. The mean age at operation was 58.2 (range 26.8-85.3) years; the mean follow-up time was 38.1 months (range 11.2-79.1 months). There were nine complications unrelated to the implant, and one due to a screw malplacement. Four of them required an early surgical reintervention. Additional lumbar surgery in the follow-up period included: implant removal and conversion into spinal fusion with rigid instrumentation for persisting pain in three cases, laminectomy of an index segment in one case and screw removal due to loosening in one case. In seven cases, radiological signs of screw loosening were observed. In seven cases, adjacent segment degeneration necessitated further surgery. Mean pain and function scores improved significantly from baseline to follow-up, as follows: back pain scale from 7.4 to 3.1, leg pain scale from 6.9 to 2.4, and Oswestry Disability Index from 55.4% to 22.9%. These study results compare well with those obtained by conventional procedures; in addition to which, mobile stabilization is less invasive than fusion. Long-term screw fixation is dependent on correct screw dimension and proper screw positioning. The natural course of polysegmental disease in some cases necessitates further surgery as the disease progresses. Dynamic neutralization proved to be a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of unstable lumbar conditions."
CD007431,0,17607963,0,[Comparative analysis of the professional activity in patients with discopathy of the lumbar spine receiving only conservative therapy or operative therapy].,Pain syndromes of the lower spine are considered as a serious economical problem throughout the world. They are one of the main reasons of limitation or total disability to work. Social expenses connected with treatment costs are accompanied by deterioration of the patient's financial situation and his family.

The purpose of this study was to comparably evaluate of the professional activity of the patients with lumbar discopathy receiving only conservative treatment as well as operated patients.
CD007431,0,8578893,0,[Lumbar epidural lipomatosis].,"Spinal epidural lipomatosis is a pathological accommodation of fat tissue in the spinal canal. It seems to be a disease entity, which, though rare, has recently been diagnosed more frequently and can be accompanied by neurological deficits. The thoracic spinal canal is the preferred localization. Eighteen cases of symptomatic lumbar epidural lipomatosis have been described in the literature. We are reporting on our experience with another 8 patients. Three of these patients presented with the typical signs of spinal nerve irritation. In these cases epidural lipomatosis was associated with a small disk herniation without direct contact to the spinal nerve. Another 5 patients showed the clinical picture of a spinal claudication. In all 5 patients, there was a concentric compression of the thecal sac by epidural fat. In one patient, the cause of the lipomatosis was assumed to be long-term steroid therapy following kidney transplantation. Four patients suffered from extreme obesity. No cause for lipomatosis could be found in 3 patients. A microdiskektomy was performed in the 3 patients with the associated disk herniation; the remaining patients were treated conservatively. In 6/8 patients (3x surgery/3x diet), an ""excellent"" or ""good"" clinical result could be achieved after 1 year. Two patients had a ""satisfactory"" result. Lumbar epidural lipomatosis can be treated conservatively in cases with only mild neurological dysfunctions and known cause (e.g. obesity, steroid therapy). The surgical removal of associated disk herniation proved to be sufficient in cases described in this paper."

The radiological diagnosis according to the original x-ray report was correlated with the surgical findings at reoperation. Myelography reports describe morphological changes but often contain no definite diagnosis. CT reports usually contain detailed tissue diagnosis, but correlation with surgical findings is generally poor. Review of the original x-ray films leads to the following conclusions: At present, myelography is always indicated, except in suspected extreme lateral disc herniation. CT should be reserved for particular clinical or myelographic problems."

In 3 cases free gas was found in the epidural space, and one patient presented an intraspinal gas-filled ""bleb"". Gas collection in intervertebral disk spaces and facet joints was found in a total of 60 patients. The CT findings and surgical results were compared to determine whether gas collection contributes to clinical symptoms. In most cases the presence of gas was not clinically important, but in one patient it presented as a spinal mass, causing pain and radiculopathy."

Fifteen patients who underwent previous radiculography with Dimer-X plus Depo-Medrol exhibited adhesive arachnoiditis. This was not observed in 6 patients who received Dimer-X alone. No positive correlation between radiological diagnosis of adhesive arachnoiditis and clinical symptoms can be demonstrated.

The relation of nerve root enhancement to dysfunction also remains controversial. To investigate the clinical significance of contrast enhancement we looked at the symptoms and signs and gadolinium DPTA-enhanced images of 71 consecutive surgical candidates in a standardised fashion. Annular rupture and disc enhancement were found to be closely related, and correlated with sensory loss and paresis, respectively. Nerve root enhancement was found to be related to neurological deficits in general and sensory impairment in particular."
CD007431,0,18084782,0,Predictive factors for long-term outcome of anterior cervical decompression and fusion: a multivariate data analysis.,"We conducted a prospective randomized study to investigate predictive factors for short- and long-term outcome of anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) as measured by current pain intensity on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and by disability using the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Current understanding about how preoperative and short-term outcome data predict long-term outcome is sparse, and there are few studies involving analysis of short-term follow-up using multivariate approaches with quantification of the relative importance of each variable studied. A total of 95 patients were randomly allocated for ACDF with the cervical intervertebral fusion cage or the Cloward procedure. The mean follow-up time was 19 months (range 12-24) for short-term follow-up and 76 months (range 56-94 months) for long-term. Background factors, radiologically detected findings, physiological measurements, treatment type, pain, and disability were used as potential predictors. Multivariate statistical analysis by projection to latent structures was used to investigate predictors of importance for short- and long-term outcome of ACDF. A ""preoperative"" low disability and pain intensity, non-smoking status, male sex, good hand strength, and an active range of motion (AROM) in the neck were significant predictors for good short- and long-term outcomes. The short-term outcome data were better at predicting long-term outcome than were baseline data. Radiologically detected findings and surgical technique used were mainly insignificant as predictors. We suggest that the inclusion criteria for ACDF should be based on a bio-psycho-social model including NDI. NDI may also be regarded as an important outcome measurement in evaluation of ACDF."

Of the 100 patients in 20% pseudoradicular syndrome features prevailed, 14% experienced mainly radicular syndrome features and 66% patients presented mixed clinical picture. We suggest that above relationships should be considered in clinical practice."

Prominent difficulties include: inattention to the clinical boundaries of the syndrome, neglected co-morbid disease processes, comparison of unequal treatment groups and premature clinical data extrapolation, inadequate diagnostic validation, variability in surgical observation, and reliance upon follow-up techniques faulted by unaddressed distorting factors. Proposals for improvement include: formulation of suitable stratification subgroups emphasizing age and sign-symptom intensity and duration, techniques for improved diagnostic return from surgical exploration, suggestions toward improved quantitation of clinical testing procedures, and implantation of a quality of life scale."

Cadaveric and clinical studies of the effects of medial hip rotation.,"Studies of the sacral plexus have been made in six cadavers to demonstrate the increased tension due to medial hip rotation. A standard protocol was adopted for the straight-leg-raising test (SLR) and three qualifying tests--dorsiflexion of the ankle, medial hip rotation, and cervical flexion--when examining 442 patients. Positive signs on medial hip rotation were frequently associated with evidence of increased tension and neurologic dysfunction of lumbosacral roots. It is concluded that uncontrolled hip rotation reduces the value of the SLR is a useful qualifying test for increased root tension, and that the diagnostic value and repeatability of SLR would be improved by adopting a standardized protocol."

CD007431,0,15731680,0,Donor-site morbidity of the pedicled rectus femoris muscle flap.,"The rectus femoris muscle flap is well known for its reliable anatomy, the ease with which it can be harvested, and its great versatility. As a pedicled or free flap, it is used to cover soft-tissue defects and to recreate motor function. Although the muscle is very reliable, it is not well respected because of its assumed donor-site morbidity, such as weakened knee extension force and decreased range of motion of the knee. To date, these clinical assumptions have only rarely been quantified in terms of objective scores, concerning force deficit and functional or aesthetic outcome. From 1995 to 2002, the authors treated 24 patients with pedicled rectus femoris muscle flaps. Fourteen patients were followed up. Follow-up time ranged from 3 to 56 months postoperatively. The results were evaluated by a standard questionnaire in which pain in relation to walking distance, subjective feeling of weakness, sensibility disorders, everyday function, and aesthetic aspects were assessed. Range of motion in the hip and the knee was measured. For objective verification of a decrease of maximal voluntary contraction force of the remaining quadriceps muscle and for detecting differences in true muscular capacity and voluntary activation, 10 patients with unilateral rectus femoris flaps were tested using the twitch interpolation technique. The authors' patients assessed the remaining function and the aesthetic result of the thigh as at least satisfactory. Two patients complained about pain and weakness in the thigh. Eight patients reported hypesthesia in the lateral suprapatellar region. The maximal voluntary contraction and true muscular capacity values were reduced by 21.8 percent and 18 percent, respectively, when compared with the healthy leg. The range of motion in the knee and hip was not influenced by muscle harvesting. The twitch interpolation technique revealed a mild voluntary activation deficit, probably caused by inhibitory regulation in the spinal cord. In conclusion, donor-site morbidity of the rectus femoris muscle flap is evident but well compensated. There is no decrease in active range of motion in the knee and hip. Patient satisfaction with the functional and aesthetic outcome was high."

Normal data and their range are given for 54 subjects (108 legs). The latency of the peak of the first positive wave (P40) can be predicted from the subject's height from the regression formulae: P40 latency in msec = height in metres X 23.7 + 8.6 for the L5 dermatome. P40 latency in msec = height in metres X 24.5 + 8.7 for the S1 dermatome. P40 latency in msec = height in metres X 15.0 + 14.6 for the posterior tibial nerve. The standard deviations are 2.90 for L5; 2.95 for S1 and 1.60 for the posterior tibial nerve. Age and sex of the subjects had no significant effect. The data will have value when dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials are used to investigate radiculopathies.

Pudendal nerve stimulation was used to monitor 154 patients. Eleven patients (7.14%) had responses that were either difficult or impossible to interpret in that they were not consistently replicable. In one case (0.65%), responses were lost during surgery, and there were no subsequent neurologic sequelae (false-positive response). No patients had postoperative deficit to the sacral roots or to the global cord. Although it is possible to obtain definitive dermatomal responses down to S1, the use of pudendal nerve stimulation was found to provide additional means of monitoring lower sacral roots. Since the pudendal nerve is intimately associated with bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction, easily obtainable routine monitoring of this nerve can provide significant safety that the conventional somatosensory and dermatomal responses give to higher spinal levels."
CD007431,0,9513866,0,Centralization of low back pain and perceived functional outcome.,"McKenzie's methods for evaluating and treating low back pain are used often but studied little. When using the McKenzie system, it is important to observe signs of symptom movement to a central location (centralization). This study investigated the relationships between centralization of low back pain and/or radiculopathy and the subjects' rating of functional outcome. Thirty-six subjects with low back pain volunteered to participate and were evaluated and treated by six researchers. Subjects were tested initially and again 14 days after initiation of treatment using the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and the Performance Assessment and Capacity Testing Spinal Function Sort (SFS). Symptoms were monitored for the occurrence of ""complete centralization."" Of the 36 subjects, 25 showed complete centralization within 14 days. The SFS score changes were significantly higher for subjects who completely centralized (p = 0.015). The results supported the hypothesis that subjects who centralize will have improved functional outcome and, thus, quality of life. However, shorter time to occurrence of complete centralization does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome."

Nineteen participants with LLA were placed into two groups based on visual analog scores of LBP. We assessed functional limitations, iliopsoas length, hamstring length, abdominal strength, back extensor strength, and back extensor endurance. Data analysis included correlations and t-tests. We found significant correlations between pain score and functional limitations, iliopsoas length, and back extensor endurance. We also detected significant differences in functional limitations, iliopsoas length, back extensor strength, and back extensor endurance between those with and without LBP. We saw significant differences in back extensor strength and back extensor endurance between those with transtibial and transfemoral amputations. Differences exist in physical measures of individuals with LLA with and without LBP. Clinicians should consider these impairments in individuals with amputation who experience LBP. Because of the participants' characteristics, these findings may be applicable to veterans with LLA."

A prospective controlled pilot study to prove effectiveness].,"The treatment of chronic back pain with sciatica is still an unsolved therapeutic challenge. Percutaneous minimally invasive neurolysis according to the Racz technique is increasingly applied and discussed controversially. So far there is no prospective randomized controlled study for evaluation of a possible treatment effect. In a prospective pilot study, 25 patients with monosegmental radiculopathy of the lumbar spine were treated with minimally invasive percutaneous epidural neurolysis according to Racz's technique. They all suffered from chronic disc herniations or failed back syndromes after surgery, all with radiculopathy. The average age of the patients was 51+/-16 years, the average duration of the symptoms was 28 months. Twelve weeks after the procedure patients had significant clinical improvement. The Oswestry score increased from 64+/-17 to 22+/-12 points. Subjective pain sensation according to the McNab score showed improvement too. None of the patients had worsening of the situation compared to preoperative findings. No clinically relevant complications were observed. The results are being used to design a clinical trial in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of the procedure. The described technique is still a clinically experimental procedure. However, due to a low probability of side effects and due to the good results reported so far by most authors, the Racz catheter technique may be applied in certain patients with chronic radiculopathy refractory to conservative treatment."
CD007431,0,14579016,0,[Laser-evoked potentials: diagnostic approach to the dorsal root].,"Functional diagnostics of the dorsal root are especially effective via nociceptive fibers on account of less intersegmental overlap compared to large-diameter fibers of the mechanoreceptive afferents. Laser-evoked potentials (LEP) are induced by short, painful heat stimuli. The aim of this work was to describe changes of the LEP in cases of dorsal root damage. The recorded LEP changes will be discussed with regard to their prognostic value as well as pathophysiologic aspects of dorsal root damage. Dorsal root function was tested in 21 patients suffering from clinically proven radiculopathy in one of the segments L4 to S1. Mechanosensibility and thermosensibility were clinically investigated. LEP were induced by slightly painful stimuli (80 on the affected and 80 on the contralateral unaffected dermatome). The LEP were evaluated by amplitude of the averaged electroencephalogram (EEG). In addition, a subjective pain rating was recorded after each stimulus. Investigation of dorsal root function by LEP in patients with radiculopathy yields two typical changes of the amplitude. On the one hand, there were significant reductions of amplitude, and on the other hand, a complete loss of LEP was found. LEP changes allow a graduation of patients who show no obvious differences in their clinical appearance. Which mechanisms are responsible as concerns deafferentiation and neuropathy of the dorsal root fibers are discussed. With regard to the LEP changes, a prognostic relevance in patients with dorsal root affections is likely. This question will be addressed in a prospective study soon."

At 2 or more years of followup, all patients in Group 1 who had complete operative disc removal achieved solid arthrodesis. There were no revision surgeries. However, in Group 2, there were seven patients who had a pseudarthrosis and an additional patient with early postoperative cage displacement, which resulted in eight patients in Group 2 requiring revision surgery. The differences in operative preparation of the disc space for BAK instrumentation surgery resulting in complications proved to be significant. The use of interbody titanium cages dramatically increases the biomechanical efficacy of anterior fusions. Original proponents of cages advocated removing a cylindrical channel of disc material using a drill.

Epidural clonidine led to a minor but significant decrease in amplitude of two components (N1 and N3) following S1 stimulation while SEP latency was prolonged only in the P1 and P3 components (P less than 0.05). In all patients the pain score decreased, mean score at rest from 4.9 +/- 0.5 to 0.6 +/- 0.2 and during mobilization from 7.4 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased from 118 +/- 4/72 +/- 5 mmHg to 99 +/- 5/60 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than 0.01), respectively. It is concluded that epidural clonidine has a minor effect on the early SEPs to electrical dermatomal stimulation. Additionally, a pronounced effect on cancer pain was seen."
CD007431,0,16341712,0,A randomized clinical trial and subgroup analysis to compare flexion-distraction with active exercise for chronic low back pain.,"Many clinical trials on chiropractic management of low back pain have neglected to include specific forms of care. This study compared two well-defined treatment protocols. The objective was to compare the outcome of flexion-distraction (FD) procedures performed by chiropractors with an active trunk exercise protocol (ATEP) performed by physical therapists. A randomized clinical trial study design was used. Subjects, 18 years of age and older, with a primary complaint of low back pain (>3 months) were recruited. A 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for perceived pain, the Roland Morris (RM) Questionnaire for low back function, and the SF-36 for overall health status served as primary outcome measures. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either FD or ATEP. The FD intervention consisted of the application of flexion and traction applied to specific regions in the low back, with the aid of a specially designed manipulation table. The ATEP intervention included stabilizing and flexibility exercises, the use of modalities, and cardiovascular training. A total of 235 subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and signed the informed consent. Of these, 123 were randomly allocated to FD and 112 to the ATEP. Study patients perceived significantly less pain and better function after intervention, regardless of which group they were allocated to (P<0.01). Subjects randomly allocated to the flexion-distraction group had significantly greater relief from pain than those allocated to the exercise program (P=0.01). Subgroup analysis indicated that subjects categorized as chronic, with moderate to severe symptoms, improved most with the flexion-distraction protocol. Subjects categorized with recurrent pain and moderate to severe symptoms improved most with the exercise program. Patients with radiculopathy did significantly better with FD. There were no significant differences between groups on the Roland Morris and SF-36 outcome measures. Overall, flexion-distraction provided more pain relief than active exercise; however, these results varied based on stratification of patients with and without radiculopathy and with and without recurrent symptoms. The subgroup analysis provides a possible explanation for contrasting results among randomized clinical trials of chronic low back pain treatments and these results also provide guidance for future work in the treatment of chronic low back pain."

CD007431,0,15129048,0,Sexual responsiveness in women with spinal cord injuries: differential effects of anxiety-eliciting stimulation.,"Sexual dysfunction is a common problem in women after spinal cord injuries (SCIs). Recently, the use of anxiety-provoking stimulation has been explored as a means of improving sexual responses in able-bodied sexually functional and dysfunctional women. In this laboratory-based study, we assessed the sexual and autonomic responses of women with SCIs with varying degrees of preservation of sympathetic innervation to their genitals to respond to anxiety-provoking audiovisual (AV) stimulation. Subjects were 45 women with SCIs and 11 able-bodied women. For purposes of analysis, SCI subjects were grouped on the basis of the degree of preservation of sensation in the T11-L2 dermatomes. Results revealed that women with low sensory scores in these dermatomes achieved higher vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) responses to audiovisual erotic stimulation after anxiety preexposure than after neutral preexposure; however, women with SCIs and the greatest degree of preservation of sensory function in the T11-L2 dermatomes, as well as able-bodied controls, did not. Moreover, these same 2 groups of subjects had a decrease in VPA responses during baseline periods in which an anxiety-provoking video sequence was shown, but not during the neutral sequence. It is concluded that these findings are due to the proximity of sensory and autonomic neurologic elements in the spinal cord. Moreover, they demonstrate the differential effects of sympathetic stimulation on genital sexual arousal."
CD007431,0,2527432,0,[Backache--risk of disability?].,"Low back pain and lumbo-ischialgia are symptoms of degeneration of the intervertebral disc with protrusion. The possible invalidity in these patients is difficult to assess. Several factors do influence the outcome of conservative and/or neurosurgical treatment: Some patients are treated as out-patients only instead of the necessary in-patient treatment. Only in case of a paresis or disturbances of the urine bladder function, operation must be done without pretreatment. The quality of the postoperative treatment decides on the later result! The clinical assessment of a patient is not possible without examination and intensive questions about the circumstances of daily life, holiday activities, hobbies and so on. Discrepancies between the result of examination and the answers to these questions give a signal to a very critical evaluation of this patient."
CD007431,0,15082121,0,Possible association of interleukin 1 gene locus polymorphisms with low back pain.,"Based on a hypothesis that interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity is associated with low back pain (LBP), we investigated relationships between previously described functional IL-1 gene polymorphisms and LBP. The subjects were a subgroup of a Finnish study cohort. The IL-1alpha(C(889)-T), IL-1beta(C(3954)-T) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN)(G(1812)-A, G(1887)-C and T(11100)-C) polymorphisms were genotyped in 131 middle-aged men from three occupational groups (machine drivers, carpenters and office workers). A questionnaire inquired about individual and lifestyle characteristics and the occurrence of LBP, the number of days with pain and days with limitation of daily activities because of pain, and pain intensity, during the past 12 months. Lumbar disc degeneration was determined with magnetic resonance imaging. Carriers of the IL-1RNA(1812) allele had an increased risk of LBP (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0-6.0) and carriers of this allele in combination with the IL-1alphaT(889) or IL-1betaT(3954) allele had a higher risk of and more days with LBP than non-carriers. Pain intensity was associated with the simultaneous carriage of the IL-1alphaT(889) and IL-1RNA(1812) alleles (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.9). Multiple regression analyses allowing for occupation and disc degeneration showed that carriage of the IL-1RNA(1812) allele was associated with the occurrence of pain, the number of days with pain and days with limitations of daily activities. Carriage of the IL-1betaT(3954) allele was associated with the number of days with pain. The results suggest a possible contribution of the IL-1 gene locus polymorphisms to the pathogenesis of LBP. The possibility of chance findings cannot be excluded due to the small sample size."

CD007431,0,2138156,0,Diurnal changes in spinal mechanics and their clinical significance.,"Diurnal changes in the loads acting on the spine affect the water content and height of the intervertebral discs. We have reviewed the effects of these changes on spinal mechanics, and their possible clinical significance. Cadaveric lumbar spines subjected to periods of creep loading show a disc height change similar to the physiological change. As a result intervertebral discs bulge more, become stiffer in compression and more flexible in bending. Disc tissue becomes more elastic as its water content falls, and its affinity for water increases. Disc prolapse becomes more difficult. The neural arch and associated ligaments resist an increasing proportion of the compressive and bending stresses acting on the spine. Observations on living people show that these changes are not fully compensated for by modified muscle activity. We conclude that different spinal structures are more heavily loaded at different times of the day. Therefore, the time of onset of symptoms and signs, and any diurnal variation in their severity, may help us understand more about the pathophysiology of low back pain and sciatica."

CD007431,0,6497609,0,On the pathogenesis of spondylosis deformans and arthrosis uncovertebralis: comparative form-analytical radiological and statistical studies on lumbar and cervical vertebral bodies.,"To investigate the etiopathogenesis of the common clinical symptoms of the lower lumbar spine (LS) and cervical spine (CS) (lower back pain and local cervical spine syndrome), the dimensions of the third to fifth lumbar vertebral bodies (LVB) and the fifth to seventh cervical vertebral bodies (CVB) were studied quantitatively and morphometrically in frontal and sagittal planes, as a function of sex and age, in 105 human cadavers of both sexes aged between 16 and 91 years. The evaluation was done in X-ray pictures of 100-micron-thick polished bone sections with the aid of the Macro Facility of the Leitz Texture Analysis System. In each case, the maximum and minimum heights and widths and depths and the computed differences in heights, widths, and depths were determined. The results were evaluated statistically and compared within and between the two regions of the spine, using regression-correlation analyses. The heights, widths, and depths of the VB are all greater in men than in women; their behavior during ageing is, however, identical for both sexes. The heights of all the VB examined remain constant throughout life after termination of growth. The maximum widths and the width differences reveal an increase in both LVB and CVB in old age. All depth parameters reveal constancy in the case of the LVB but an increase in the case of the CVB in old age. The correlation coefficients of the maximum width of the VB within the spinal regions are very high in the LVB, but lower in the CVB. Between the two regions, in contrast, they are very low. This behavior suggests a superordinate action principle within each of the spinal regions which is based on characteristic anatomical construction and functional stressing. The static stressing of the LVB leads, laterally to disc protrusions. As a result of this, traction forces acting on the weak lateral elements of the anterior longitudinal ligament, stimulate the accretion of spondylotic osteophytes at the point of insertion of the ligament on the vertebral body. Anteriorly, in contrast, the particular strong anterior longitudinal ligament prevents such a remodelling process. Posteriorly, the longitudinal ligament is attached to the intervertebral discs, and can thus not stimulate the vertebral body to produce osteophytes. The dynamic stressing of the CVB leads laterally to friction between the VB in the region of the uncovertebral joints and to the formation of arthrotic osteophytes. Anteriorly, owing to the weak configuration of the anterior longitudinal ligament in this aspect, disc protrusion occur and, subsequently, spondylotic osteophytes accrete."

For a differential classification of TMJ diseases, we developed an electronic axiography system which facilitates a recording of lower jaw movements. It works 3-dimensionally and relates to the joints. The measuring system, which was internationally patented, is based on a linear resistive foil for the sagittal plane and an inductive gauge for the horizontal plane. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the usefulness of our electronic axiography system in obtaining a differential diagnosis of craniomandibular disorders. We examined 30 patients (60 joints) with complaints in the TMJ area (pain and TMJ sounds). Clinical examinations yielded only uncertain indications of TMJ disease. With the help of electronic axiography we could differentiate the TMJ diseases into microtrauma and macrotrauma. Both forms may show a loss of function and an audible TMJ clicking. 23 joints had a macrotrauma (disk displacement with reduction, 20 times; disk displacement without reduction, 3 times). In 8 joints, a microtrauma was found. 3 joints showed a subluxation. In 4 uncertain cases, the diagnosis was confirmed with the help of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients with a diagnosed arthrogenic disorder received adequate treatment with reposition splints. Our initial results show that 3-dimensional electronic axiography can be a good aid in further characterization of craniomandibular disorders and permits an effective therapy."
CD007431,0,6475211,0,[Computerized tomography in lumbar compression syndrome].,"Computertomography has been shown to be a reliable method for evaluation of lumbar compression syndromes. Excellent apparative equipment and differentiated examination techniques are required. As compared with myelography CT offers the advantages of a non-invasive procedure. Due to simultaneous axial visualisation of bone and soft tissue all components contributing to lumbar compression syndromes are included. This so far cannot be achieved by conventional radiographic methods. CT is superior to myelography concerning specificity and sensitivity of the diagnosis of primary and surgically treated herniated discs. It demonstrates extreme lateral dislocation of disc tissue as well as centrally located disc material at the L5/S1 level. Furthermore, compressing structures such like monosegmental osseous stenosis and stenosis of the spinal canal are well to be recognized. Tumors may be ruled out. Verification of postoperative hematoma and scar formation is of high clinical value. Myelography, however, remains being the method of choice when clinical symptoms are not to be appointed to a certain segment."

We have introduced some measurements to document asymmetrical holding of the body and limbs: the distance between the sternoclavicular joint-spina iliaca ant. sup. and the distance between the acromion and spina iliaca post. sup. We found that in the distension (blockade) of the 5th rib, constant spasms are present in m. abdominis obliquus ext., in the most lateral part of the adductors and in the most medial part of the great gluteal muscle. In 6th rib distension, spasms in the external part of the m. rectus abdominis, and in the mediolateral fascicles of thigh adductors and in the external part of m. glutaeus max. could be palpated. In 7th sternocostal distension there are spasms in the most medial parts of m. rectus abdominis, and of thigh adductors and m. glutaeus medius of the same side. After mobilization, statistically significant improvement of body asymmetry (p less than 0.01), improvement of anteflection, bending to the side, Laségue's and Patric's phenomena were found. Surgery was indispensable only in 6% of our patients suffering from severe lumbar disc hernianion (in 3 out of 50). The CT appearance of the prolapse remained unaltered even after clinical remission. There were some changes before and after mobilization in the CT picture of sternocostal joints. The importance of strengthening of the great pectoral muscles--in which preexistent relative weakness was found--is stressed. The beneficial effect of mobilization of the respective sternocostal blockade on the pain syndrome, body asymmetry and mobility is described."

CD007431,0,3883019,0,Charles Lasègue and his 'Considerations on Sciatica'.,"The eponym Lasègue sign has been applied to the increase in sciatic pain caused by flexing the extended lower extremity on the abdomen. The sign was never put into writing by Lasègue but by his pupils. He did not describe the test in the usual reference, ""Considerations on Sciatica,"" in 1864. That article has to do with his analysis of then-current theories of sciatica and his own clinical observations. Sciatica was divided into a benign and a serious form, and two examples of each were described. Emphasis was laid on the constant, fixed sciatic pain, as contrasted with the irregular, largely nocturnal, episodes of lancinating pain. Atrophy of leg muscles was not to be explained on the basis of disuse but by a disorder of the nerve, which also was responsible for the typical neuralgia, unlike that of any other part of the body except possibly neuralgia of the brachial plexus. Treatments currently available (cupping, vesicants, and injections of atropine solution) were unavailing. The steps are unknown by which Lasègue came to modify his 1864 views that any sort of flexion or extension of the lower extremity did not exacerbate the pain; in the 1881 thesis of his pupil, Forst, that straight-leg raising sign is described and illustrated and ascribed to his teacher, Professor Lasègue."

CD007431,0,10212604,1,Diagnosis and prognosis in lumbar disc herniation.,"In a prospective 2-year followup study of 160 consecutive patients undergoing primary surgery for suspected lumbar disc herniation, the authors studied the diagnostic and prognostic factors by using stepwise logistic regression analysis. When the different factors were entered in the same order as presented clinically, history and pain analysis contained most of the predictive information available. When all factors were entered simultaneously in the computations, the following factors (in order of relative importance) predicted relief of sciatica after 2 years: rupture of the anulus (as opposed to bulging disc or negative exploration), no preoperative comorbidity, and male gender. The following factors predicted return to work at 2 years: no preoperative comorbidity, duration of sciatica less than 7 months, education or vocational training in addition to compulsory school, age younger than 41 years, male gender, and no previous nonspinal surgery. Return to work does not seem to be a valid result parameter in lumbar disc surgery. The most important physical signs were root tension tests and lumbar range of motion, whereas neurologic signs were of secondary importance. Many people have asymptomatic herniations, and today supersensitive diagnostic imaging is widely available. Thus, the importance of clinical evaluation has increased, and most of the relevant information can be obtained by listening to the patient. A simple anamnesis apparently is a good alternative to psychologic tests in surgical triage."

CD007431,0,3581573,0,Effects of joint pathology on muscle.,"The muscle wasting associated with joint damage may be highly selective; knee disorders produce quadriceps wasting but little change in the size of the hamstrings. This causes isolated quadriceps weakness, so predisposing to a position of knee flexion. Nociceptors and other receptors in and around the joint can have flexor excitatory and extensor inhibitory actions. At the knee, these receptors are likely to excite hamstrings and inhibit quadriceps. Although other actions could occur, quadriceps inhibition may be favored by a position of knee extension. Quadriceps inhibition will weaken voluntary contraction, reduce tone, and contribute to wasting of the muscle, further predisposing to a position of knee flexion. The potency of quadriceps inhibition may be considerable, even in the absence of perceived pain. A small, apparently trivial effusion (or even a clinically undetectable effusion) may cause important inhibition. In order to improve the orthopedist's ability to prevent flexion contracture of the injured or operated joint, he must look not only for ways of reducing joint pain, but also for ways of preventing activity in other joint afferents. For example, he must consider the possible effects of joint position, intraarticular pressure, suture-line tension, and afferent blockade."

Kappa coefficients indicated a higher reproducibility of neurological tests than of e.g. muscular tenderness or scoliosis. All patients were diagnosed by CT-scan and a disc herniation was found in 20. The clinical diagnosis was more in agreement with the CT-diagnosis after than before treatment. By discriminant analyses six variables were found to classify the clinical diagnosis correctly in 32 of the 33 patients: sensory loss, ankle jerk, soreness of back extensors, lumbosacral soreness, radiating pain and back extension test. Similarly, the CT-diagnosis was classified in 25 of 33 patients by the variables: sensory loss and limping."

Thirty-eight (72%) of these investigations were performed as a routine pre-operative procedure to identify occult spinal dysraphism in patients with childhood scoliosis; the remainder were because of the ""orthopaedic syndrome"", cervical radiculopathy, back pain and patients with clinical findings to suggest spinal dysraphism. In the 20 patients (38%) with idiopathic scoliosis, there was no case of spinal dysraphism and CT myelography provided no additional information to the myelogram. In the seven patients with spinal dysraphism the plain radiographic abnormalities identified were lumbar vertebral abnormalities (five), thoracic vertebral abnormalities (one), and sacral agenesis (one). Diastematomyelia was found in four patients, a low tethered cord and lipoma in two patients and a large lipoma in one patient. In all of these cases the myelogram indicated the intraspinal abnormalities; however, CT myelography provided more precise anatomical detail. We conclude that CT myelography is not indicated in the initial preoperative assessment of idiopathic scoliosis but should be reserved for patients with congenital or complicated scoliosis where the association with dysraphism is well recognised."

Discogram pattern was divided in four types: normal disc, degenerative pattern, degenerative pattern with extravasation, and annular injection. The myelograms were graded into a mild defect, a moderate defect, or a severe defect. Follow-up averaged 20 months. Conclusions of this study were Chymopapain can be considered as an alternative to lumbar laminectomy for relief of sciatica secondary to herniated disc. Statistically significant improved postinjection results were noted when patients presented with three out of four objective physical findings consisting of positive straight leg raising, reflex change, dermatomal paresthesia pattern, and/or mild motor weakness. Placement of the needle within the nucleus leads to a statistically significant improved result over placement of the needle into the annulus.

Positive straight leg raising test, paresis, altered sensibility, reduced reflexes, and type of treatment were related to the CSF protein concentrations in 180 patients with sciatica caused by verified lumbar disk herniation. Significantly higher values of the CSF/serum albumin ratio and the CSF/serum immunoglobulin G ratio were found both in patients with positive straight leg raising test results and paresis compared with patients with no clinical findings. In the patients who had undergone emergency surgery, the same ratio parameters were significantly higher when compared with those who had undergone routine surgery and those had not undergone surgery.

CD007431,0,1869942,0,Treatment of chronic pain by epidural spinal cord stimulation: a 10-year experience.,"Epidural spinal cord stimulation by means of chronically implanted electrodes was carried out on 121 patients with pain of varied benign organic etiology. In 116 patients, the pain was confined to the back and lower extremities and, of these, 56 exhibited the failed-back syndrome. Most patients were referred by a pain management service because of failure of conventional pain treatment modalities. Electrodes were implanted at varying sites, dictated by the location of pain. A total of 140 epidural implants were used: 76 unipolar, 46 Resume electrodes, 12 bipolar, and six quadripolar. Patients were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 10 years, with a mean follow-up period of 40 months. Forty-eight patients (40%) were able to control their pain by neurostimulation alone. A further 14 patients (12%), in addition to following a regular stimulation program, needed occasional analgesic supplements to achieve 50% or more relief of the prestimulation pain. Pain secondary to arachnoiditis or perineural fibrosis following multiple intervertebral disc operations, when predominantly confined to one lower extremity, seemed to respond favorably to this treatment. Uniformly good results were also obtained in lower-extremity pain secondary to multiple sclerosis. Pain due to advanced peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs was well controlled, and amputation below the knee was delayed for up to 2 years in some patients. Pain due to cauda equina injury, paraplegic pain, phantom-limb pain, pure midline back pain without radiculopathy, or pain due to primary bone or joint disease seemed to respond less well. Patients who responded to preliminary transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation generally did well with electrode implants. Notable complications included wound infection, electrode displacement or fracturing, and fibrosis at the stimulating tip of the electrode. Three patients in this series died due to unrelated causes. Epidural spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective and safe means of controlling pain on a long-term basis in selected groups of patients. The mechanism of action of stimulation-produced analgesia remains unclear; further studies to elucidate it might allow spinal cord stimulation to be exploited more effectively in disorders that are currently refractory to this treatment modality."

A preliminary report of a double-blind study.,"Sixty patients with unilateral sciatica resulting from lumbar intervertebral disc herniation were entered into a double-blind study. All patients had failed to respond to conservative management, and the diagnosis had been confirmed by metrizamide myelography. Following a randomized schedule, 30 patients had intradiscal injections of chymopapain and 30 patients had intradiscal injections of an equivalent volume of normal saline solution. Complete relief of sciatica was obtained in 63% of patients treated with chymopapain, compared with 27% of saline-injected patients. Six weeks after the injection, 73% of patients treated with chymopapain and 37% of patients treated with saline solution considered that the treatment was successful. The success rate at six months was 80% for patients treated with chymopapain and 57% for saline-injected patients. From the preliminary results of this study, chymopapain is recommended for the treatment of sciatica from intervertebral disc herniation when conservative measures have failed and before disc fragment excision is considered."

Patients were examined 4 times at 1-week intervals for their capability to do daily tasks, for their capacity for forward bending, thoraco-lumbar torsion, straight leg raising, static hip flexion and sit-ups, and for subjective assessment of pain. Side-effects were recorded on a questionnaire. Both treatments produced marked improvement in most of the parameters assessed, often within the first week and, overall, the results were similar with the two drugs.

CD007431,0,3346682,1,The value of accurate clinical assessment in the surgical management of the lumbar disc protrusion.,"One hundred patients with lumbar disc protrusions were studied. Thirty six ""control"" patients were admitted in the same time period with low back pain and sciatica but with subsequently ""normal"" myelograms and no surgery. The aim of this paper was to relate history and clinical signs to the myelograms and surgical findings. Ninety nine per cent of our patients presented with sciatica (controls 94%). The most frequently found sign in patients with a disc protrusion was reduction of ipsilateral straight leg raising (98%). However, 55% of controls also showed this sign. There were three signs that, when present, particularly indicated a disc protrusion; ""crossed straight leg raising"" (pain on contralateral straight leg raising), measured calf wasting and impaired ankle reflex: the latter being especially indicative of an L5-S1 disc protrusion. There were two further important signs, weakness of dorsiflexion of the foot and scoliosis of the lumbar spine. However, such signs occurred in about half the patients and so clinical diagnosis in the remaining half depended on obtaining a good history of sciatica, and paying due regard to severity of the pain, the mobility of the patient, the ability and desire to work and the overall personality. Satisfactory results of surgery simply depend on finding and removing a definite disc protrusion. Using these methods of selection, 98% have returned to their original employment, 86% within 3 months of the operation.

Candidates for this procedure should be carefully evaluated on the basis of precise clinical criteria and instrumental diagnosis. The goal is to select patients in whom excellent results can be achieved, recognizing the limitations as well as the merits of the technique. The surgical approach is described and the potential difficulties are discussed, since this technique must be performed with precision and without trauma in order to obtain good results. The clinical results of 500 patients treated by the Onik method of automated percutaneous lumbar diskectomy are reported. The follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 2 1/2 years. The patients were divided into three groups according to the strength of the indication for A.P.L.D.; the quality of the result is reported for each group."

The aim of the current studies was to determine whether the annular tear of a painful disc proved by discography is the cause of radiating leg pain (radiculopathy) in patients with discogenic low back pain. Forty-two patients with discogenic low back pain at single disc level with concomitant radiating leg pain were studied in order to analyse the relationship between site of annular tear and side of radiating leg pain. Electromyogram and motor nerve conduction velocity were monitored to examine nerve root injury. The current studies found that there was a significant positive correlation between the site of annular tear and the side of radiation pain. Abnormalities of electromyogram and reduction of motor nerve conduction velocity were found on the side of radiating leg pain. The studies indicated that leakage of chemical mediators or inflammatory cytokines, which are produced in the painful disc, into epidural space through annular tear could lead to injury to adjacent nerve roots, and it might constitute the primary pathophysiologic mechanism of radiating leg pain in patients with discogenic low back pain but with no disc herniation."

The intervertebral foramen is a three-dimensional area demarcated primarily by the pedicles; we call it the lateral interpedicular compartment. The extraforaminal zone is the space outside the lateral border of the pedicles. All patients were evaluated by computed tomography (CT), water soluble myelography, postmyelographic CT scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging. Fifteen patients consecutively underwent disco-enhanced CT to adjust a correct diagnosis and to distinguish extraforaminal from foraminal herniation. In 10 cases of extraforaminal herniation, a selective radicular decompression with good-to-excellent clinical results was achieved by an extra-axial lateral decompression of the interpedicular compartment, with preservation of the facet joint. The operative target was the lateral aspect of the pars interarticularis and not the intertransverse space, as previously described. In two cases of both foraminal and extraforaminal herniation, the same technique was used. Fourteen patients with foraminal disc herniation and three patients with both foraminal and extraforaminal herniation underwent a standard intervertebral foraminotomy.

EMG was abnormal in 34.4% and H reflex in 30.4% of the affected limbs. Furthermore, the EATR taken separately was more sensitive than the H-reflex (42.8% versus 30.4%). Pathological ETR were elicited in a considerable percentage of the clinically normal tendon reflexes (TR): 7.3% of the knee and 14.1% of the Achilles TR. On the other hand 65% of the clinically absent ATR were recorded electrically producing abnormally low and delayed muscle evoked potentials."

Much has been written on the subject of cervical discography. However, little is of use to the clinician seeking objective validation of this procedure. Many papers relate to specific workers' own experiences and one cannot but be disturbed at the wide diversity of opinion that has been expressed on the efficacy of cervical discography. In this paper, we review the extensive literature on cervical discography and present our own findings from both in vitro and clinical studies. We conclude that as a technique to locate symptomatic levels, cervical discography is worthless but that the findings of a normal nuclear image will probably indicate an asymptomatic level.

One hundred patients underwent surgery solely on clinical grounds. Fifty-eight had disc herniation. The level of disc herniation was correctly predicted in three quarters of patients with a prolapsed disc. The outcome after surgery was good in 77 patients. Only few clinical features, namely male sex and scoliosis were predictors of a good outcome. Lasegue's sign was indicative of root compression in 90%, but only two-thirds had disc herniation. Conversely one-third had disc herniation in spite of a ""negative"" test. Lasegue's sign was not superior to other clinical tests in predicting outcome. The most important indicator of a good outcome was the presence of disc herniation at surgery. Patients with disc pathology other than true disc herniation fared equally with patients, who had normal discs disclosed at surgery. Myelography was undertaken in all patients prior to surgery, the results of which are analysed in the following paper.

CD007431,0,17909209,0,Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: a joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society.,"RECOMMENDATION 1: Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low back pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain, back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause. The history should include assessment of psychosocial risk factors, which predict risk for chronic disabling back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: Clinicians should perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed tomography only if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 6: For patients with low back pain, clinicians should consider the use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back care information and self-care. Clinicians should assess severity of baseline pain and functional deficits, potential benefits, risks, and relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For most patients, first-line medication options are acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RECOMMENDATION 7: For patients who do not improve with self-care options, clinicians should consider the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits-for acute low back pain, spinal manipulation; for chronic or subacute low back pain, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)."

This study evaluates the clinical hypothesis that strain in the nerves around the ankle and foot caused by ankle dorsiflexion can be further increased with hip flexion. Linear displacement transducers were inserted into the sciatic, tibial, and plantar nerves and plantar fascia of eight embalmed cadavers to measure strain during the modified SLR. Nerve excursion was measured with a digital calliper. Ankle dorsiflexion resulted in a significant strain and distal excursion of the tibial nerve. With the ankle in dorsiflexion, the proximal excursion and tension increase in the sciatic nerve associated with hip flexion were transmitted distally along the nerve from the hip to beyond the ankle. As hip flexion had an impact on the nerves around the ankle and foot but not on the plantar fascia, the modified SLR may be a useful test to differentially diagnose plantar heel pain. Although the modified SLR caused the greatest increase in nerve strain nearest the moving joint, mechanical forces acting on peripheral nerves are transmitted well beyond the moving joint."
CD007431,0,1783549,0,Extraforaminal lumbar disk herniation. Clinical features and computerized tomography.,"Disk herniation lateral to the intervertebral foramen is defined as extraforaminal. Its particular anatomical site makes its clinical and neurologic features completely different from those of posteromedial and posterolateral disk herniations. Prior to the advent of computerized tomography, only diskography was capable of preoperatively identifying this rare disease. We present 5 cases of extraforaminal disk herniation, the clinical and tomographic diagnosis of which was confirmed at surgery. All patients had severe motor deficit and reported sciatica as prevalent over low back pain. The herniated disk was L4-5 in 2 cases and L5-S1 in 3 cases. The CT scan suggested disk protrusion in 2 cases, extrusion in 2 cases, and sequestration in 1 case. Four of these findings were confirmed intraoperatively. Diskectomy was done after hemilaminectomy and partial or total facetectomy. The clinical result was excellent in 2 cases and good in 3 cases after an average follow-up of 10 months. The use of CT scan as part of the routine diagnostic procedure in patients with radicular pain has lowered the number of cases which the surgical findings were inexplicably negative for disk herniation without having to resort to more complex and invasive diagnostic techniques such as myelo-CT and disk-CT. Moreover, preliminary tomographic localization of the extraforaminal disk herniation makes it possible to operate on the affected level using more conservative techniques. In any case, thorough clinical examination is essential for both correct interpretation of the CT scan and appropriate choice of treatment."

In a controlled clinical trial, 27 low back pain patients (mean age 40 years, range 25-48) with a mean duration of symptoms of 7.4 years, were randomized to mobilizing (n = 12) or stabilizing (n = 15) daily half hour exercise for an eight weeks period. A clinical overall score (COS) based on pain intensity (VAS), physical signs, functional status (Oswestry) and analgetics was used as outcome criterion. The treatment results were best for the group undergoing stabilizing treatment. They achieved a 17% reduction in COS, compared to a 10% increase in the group undergoing mobilizing treatment (p = 0.02). These types of exercises are discussed in relation to the instability theory in disc degeneration."

To get a comprehensive picture of the appropriateness of a new technology the latter factors need to be explored and included in an assessment. In a prospective study, eight patients with signs of lumbar disc herniation underwent myelography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A structured patient interview on attitudes to these technologies was carried out after all three examinations had been carried out. Myelography was most often reported painful and unpleasant among the three modalities. Discomfort due to magnetic resonance imaging stem from the narrow calibre of the machine and the noise. In computed tomography immobilization was the main reason for discomfort. Altogether most patients preferred computed tomography. In view of the fact that myelography must be considered as diagnostically inferior to the other two examinations, the reported discomfort from myelography indicates that computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging should be the primary examinations for patients with lumbar disc herniation."

Ten patients also had a herniated disk. There were no deaths and only two patients had serious complications (persistent foot drop in one and left-sided hemiplegia in the other). Results were evaluated immediately after surgery and after three and 12 months. The overall result on pain and walking-related disorders was good in 53% of cases, acceptable in 32%, and poor in 15%. Our data suggest that surgery is a reasonable alternative in symptomatic elderly patients who are in good general health. Satisfactory results can be obtained although disabling complications can occur."

Imaging of osseous structures in the axial plane by CT was excellent in all cases, even in the lower part of the cervical spine where soft-tissue discrimination is often impossible because of shoulder artifacts. In about half of the patients with nerve-root symptomatology as well as with signs of involvement of long tracts, narrowing of the foramen intervertebral, respectively of the spinal tract, was seen, attributable to degenerative osseous apposition with excellent clinical segmental and (according to radicular symptoms) side correlation. In contrast to these results the group of patients with posttraumatic clinical symptoms showed almost 50 per cent less preexisting degenerative disorders of the cervical spine. In conclusion, we assume that high-grade osseous appositions of the dorsal part of the vertebral body play an important role in the development of radicular symptomatology and cervical myelopathy, respectively. Hypertrophic changes of the processus articularis with narrowing of the spinal canal occurred in 14 per cent and were therefore of minor clinical significance."

CNS infections caused by staphylococci and Borrelia burgdorferi were most frequent, followed by those due to pneumococci, meningococci and other streptococci. CNS infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae were less frequent. In comparison to the CNS infections due to other bacteria, the pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitic infections were associated with more pronounced CSF alterations (on the average, there were higher white blood cell counts, and higher CSF protein and lactate). Pneumococci predominated in older patients and those with an impaired immune system, or infections of organs neighboring the CNS. Meningococci were most frequent in young and previously healthy individuals. All patients with CNS listeriosis had predisposing conditions.

CD007431,0,8988096,0,Hyperactive pectoralis reflex as an indicator of upper cervical spinal cord compression. Report of 15 cases.,"Myelopathy from cervical spondylosis is often accompanied by hyperreflexia of the upper-extremity deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). Reflexes such as the pectoralis jerk and the deltoid jerk may only be apparent in the context of hyperreflexia. Although the nerve roots involved in the reflex arcs are well described, levels of cervical spinal cord compression that lead to the hyperreflexia are not as clear. This is of particular significance for patients with multilevel cervical spondylosis in determining the levels responsible for their symptoms. The authors examined 15 consecutive patients who presented for treatment of cervical myelopathy. The clinical examination was then correlated with levels of cervical spinal cord compression by cervical magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography with intrathecal contrast enhancement. The presence of a prominent pectoralis jerk was seen only in patients with spinal cord compression at the C2-3 and/or C3-4 levels (nine patients). No patient with compression at or below the C4-5 disc space without coexisting compression at a higher level had hyperactive pectoralis reflexes. This association between the C3-4 level and a hyperactive pectoralis reflex was significant (p < 0.004, Fisher's exact test). The deltoid reflex was tested in the last nine consecutive patients. It was present in patients with compression of the upper spinal cord at levels C3-4 and C4-5 (four of five patients) but appeared in only one of four patients with compression below C4-5. This association did not attain statistical significance. The presence of a hyperactive pectoralis reflex is specific for lesions of the upper cervical spinal cord. Examination of upper-extremity DTRs may be helpful in planning the appropriate levels for surgical decompression in patients with multilevel spondylosis and myelopathy."

At a second lumbar puncture 5 months after operation, SPLI had decreased, but was still significantly higher than in the controls. No difference in CSF SPLI was seen in the patients with herniated lumbar disc compared to the controls, neither before treatment, nor at follow up CSF postoperatively. The results suggest that nociceptive joint pain is consistent with increased SPLI in CSF. Differences in SPLI in CSF may be useful to differentiate pain from various origin, and may also increase our understanding of different pain mechanisms."

CD007431,0,12905053,0,The effect of perioperative corticosteroids on the outcome of microscopic lumbar disc surgery.,"Eighty adult patients with lumbar disc herniation verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical findings corresponding to the radiological level underwent microscopic disc removal to evaluate the outcome of perioperatively given corticosteroids in a prospective randomized double-blind study. In the treatment group the patient received 250 mg Solu-Medrol intravenously and 160 mg Depo-Medrol intramuscularly. Before closure of the wound, a free fat transplant soaked in 80 mg Depo-Medrol was placed on the dural sac. In the control group the same procedure was performed, but sodium chloride was given instead of Depo-Medrol. All patients underwent a clinical examination before surgery and at 2, 6, 12, 26, 52 and 104 weeks postoperatively, rating their pain with the visual analog scale (VAS) and function with the Disability Rating Index (DRI). The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter (P=0.01) in the treatment group (1.7 days) compared to the control group (2.3 days). Time taken to return to full-time work was also significantly shorter in the treatment group (P=0.003). VAS-W (Worst Pain during last week) was significantly lower in the treatment group (P=0.02). Postoperative spondylitis occurred in one patient in the control group and no adverse corticosteroids effect was seen. Our study shows that perioperatively given corticosteroids improve the outcome of microscopic disc surgery in terms of length of hospital stay and time taken to return to full-time work. The results also indicate that corticosteroid treatment reduces pain and improves functional outcome."

The clinical syndrome is a typical one with compression signs of the lateral, extra-foraminal nerve root and minimal lumbar pain. A reliable diagnosis can be made only since high resolution spinal computed tomography has become available. Surgical treatment will be rendered difficult by the ""hidden"" localisation of the disc fragments. A total number of 15 patients has been operated on in our department during the last year. In 10 patients, we used the lateral microsurgical approach proposed by REULEN, in five cases a combined procedure with lateral sequestrotomy and medial nucleotomy. In the first group, re-sequestration occurred in three cases and further surgery including medial nucleotomy was performed then.

CD007431,0,8686536,0,Transpedicular reduction and stabilization for postlaminectomy lumbar instability.,"This study retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 17 patients with postlaminectomy lumbar instability treated by transpedicular reduction and stabilization. The criteria of instability were defined strictly by both the clinical symptom of ""instability catch"" and the radiological findings that fulfilled Nachemson's criteria. Low back pain and/or sciatica that interfered largely with the patients' work or quality of life were the indications for this treatment. All the operations were performed by one surgeon with the same spinal instrumentation system-""AO internal fixator"". The follow-up period was between 16 and 36 months (mean 24 months). Face to face questionnaire revealed that this treatment modality is encouraging. Fourteen patients (82%) had complete or nearly complete relief from all the pre-operative symptoms. Two (12%) had partial relief of the symptoms that required a subsequent discectomy or wider laminectomy. Only one case (6%) with osteoporosis remained unchanged after the operation. On the follow-up radiographs, sixteen patients (94%) showed good alignment and solid arthrodesis of the treated motion segment. These radiological findings correlated quite well with the absence of the clinical symptom of ""instability catch"". A common, but acceptable, complication found in this series was a variable degree of low back stiffness secondary to the instrumentation. Fracture of the screw was found in one patient and pull out of the screw was found in another patient. However, they did not elicit detectable symptoms. Osteoporosis, concomitant disc herniation and persistent spinal stenosis at/or adjacent to the operated level were the three main factors that may contribute to unsatisfactory results secondary to this treatment. These problems remain to be resolved in the future."

Although considerable time had elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the operation, most of the patients improved, at least partially. The syndrome is a rare complication of a common condition of the lower spine. Awareness of its possibility and identification of the early clinical picture are essential. An accurate history and detailed physical examination are the most important factors in early diagnosis. In 5 women and 4 men, who ranged in age from 28-60 and averaged 41 years, the disks involved were L5-S1 in 6, L4-L5 in 2 and L1-T12 in 1 case. Persistent disability was found in most of the patients, including 4 with bladder and 4 with sexual dysfunction. In 7 there was residual sensory loss and in 5 some degree of motor weakness. Earlier surgical treatment seems to be the most effective method for improving the results of treatment."
CD007431,0,15262072,0,A preclinical post laminectomy rat model mimics the human post laminectomy syndrome.,"Chronic low back pain with sciatica complicating post laminectomy surgery is poorly understood. It is likely that some aspects of persistent pain of the syndrome results from spinal facilitation in which there is lowering of pain excitation levels. A small animal preclinical model is needed that mimics the clinical condition to permit detailed studies of the underlying altered neurochemistry of the sensory pathways. We propose herein a rat laminectomy model containing the elements required for study of the neurobiology of the condition. The model consists of a surgical laminectomy that includes L5 spinal nerve manipulation and disc injury, elements necessarily employed in human disc herniation surgery. At 8 weeks post laminectomy the proposed model demonstrates paraspinous muscle spasm, tail contracture, behavioral pain behavior, tactile allodynia, epidural and nerve root scarring, and nerve root adherence by scar to the underlying disc and adjacent pedicle. Two underlying pain facilitation states are invoked in the clinical condition: (1) an inflammatory state required to achieve wound healing; and (2) a nerve injury state resulting from nerve manipulation and subsequent epidural scarring, spinal nerve scarring, and spinal nerve tethering to the adjacent disc and pedicle. Both pain facilitation states are active in the model."

CD007431,0,10507101,0,[Evaluation of ambulatory orthopedic-traumatologic rehabilitation by compensation insurance. A comparison with inpatient rehabilitation].,"In 1994, ""Ambulant Orthopaedic-Traumatologic Rehabilitation"" (AOTR) was introduced by the Ersatzkassen health insurance funds. This study investigated structural, process and outcome quality. One of the study questions asked is whether AOTR is as effective for (1) patients with low back pain and clinical signs of disc problems and (2) patients with cruciate ligament injury as the routinely practised inpatient rehabilitation. In a quasi-experimental cohort study patients from five AOTR centers were compared to patients from five orthopedic rehabilitation clinics with regard to their rehabilitation outcome measured on the clinical, disability and handicap level. At the beginning (t0) and the end (t1) of the rehabilitation, data were collected from patients and therapists and 6 months later (t2) only from patients by means of questionnaires. The inclusion criteria for patients with back problems had to be broadened (""patients with low back pain"") because of difficulties with patient sampling. Sample sizes were n = 166 (AOTR: 100, inpatient: 66) for t0 and t1 and n = 101 (AOTR: 47, inpatient: 54) for t0, t1 and t2. At baseline, ambulant patients with low back pain were younger (43 vs. 49 years) and better off with regard to disabilities and handicaps than patients from rehabilitation clinics. Clinical signs (e.g., neurological signs, Lasègue sign, flexibility of the spine) showed smaller differences. At t1 clinical, disability and handicaps variables had improved considerably in both groups. At t2 the improvements had stabilized or had become greater. Analyses of variance showed that improvements in the ambulant group were not much greater after accounting for the different baseline status. The sample size of patients with knee ligament injury was n = 66 (AOTR: 50, inpatient: 16). Ambulant patients considerably improved with regard to knee function and handicaps. Despite of small sample sizes this study provides some evidence that (1) AOTR and inpatient rehabilitation both are effective for treating subgroups of patients with low back pain and (2) AOTR is effective for treating patients with cruciate ligament injury."
CD007431,0,1485138,0,[Diagnosis of extruded herniated disks].,"In a patient with disk herniation it is often difficult to establish that the disk is free in the spinal canal. A retrospective medical record study comparing 65 cases of free herniated disk (FHD) confirmed upon surgery and 65 cases of disk protrusion (DP) demonstrated that FHD was more common in young male blue collar workers, especially those who worked in the sitting position. No clinical findings were diagnostic of FHD although the straight-leg raising test was positive at smaller angles than in disk protrusion. In this study, sensitivity and specificity of CT scan for the diagnosis of FHD were 75% and 80%, respectively. CT scan findings suggestive of FHD included a free disk fragment, found in 22.5% of cases, and an acute connecting angle. Saccoradiculography was more sensitive but less specific than CT scan in this study. In FDH, migration was common and ragged hernia contours were seen on the saccoradiculography images."

CD007431,0,8172510,0,Instrumental straight-leg raising: results in patients.,"Straight-leg raising is used as a diagnostic test for both elastogenic (passive muscle stretch test) and nonelastogenic (Lasègue's test) pathology in patients unable to bend forward from the standing position while holding the knees in extension. The test assessment is based on the range of the leg excursion and the type of pain that is provoked. An instrumental version of Lasègue's test (instrumental straight-leg raising) provides information about the extensibility, elasticity and electrical activity of the hamstrings and back muscles and about pelvic rotation. To investigate the diagnostical value of the additional information, both clinical and instrumental straight-leg raising was done by 30 patients who were unable to touch the ground while bending forward from the standing position with the knees extended. In one group of patients, the electrical activity of the muscles was comparable to that observed in the muscles of a control group of healthy volunteers; in a second group, however, the electrical muscle activity was aberrant. Muscle extensibility and passive muscle elasticity was comparable in patients in the first group and the healthy controls. In the patients with aberrant muscle activity, the elasticity of the passive muscles was not different from the control group, but both leg excursion and muscle extensibility were much smaller. Comparison of the clinically and experimentally diagnosed cause (elastogenic or non-elastogenic) of the movement restriction showed a remarkable discrepancy. We conclude that instrumental straight-leg raising provides valuable additional diagnostical information."

CD007431,0,3263774,0,CT-guided nerve root block and ablation.,"We report our experience in performing 52 CT-guided peripheral nerve root blocks and 27 CT-guided nerve root ablations. The nerve root block procedures were performed as diagnostic tests to determine the clinical significance of equivocal herniated disk or foraminal stenosis (n = 33) and before nerve root ablations (n = 19). To evaluate the clinical significance of these nerve root blocks, we performed 52 procedures at the vertebral level where a herniated disk or foraminal stenosis had been identified on CT or MR images. In 51 of 52 cases, the procedures were successful in anesthetizing the intended nerve root, which allowed us to determine whether that particular nerve root was the source of pain. By relieving or not relieving pain, the results of the diagnostic nerve root blocks helped determine whether a protrusion or foraminal stenosis was clinically significant. The nerve root ablations were done exclusively for treatment of pain in patients with malignant disease. Significant relief of pain was obtained in 17 (63%) of 27 patients. The thoracic nerve ablations were the most successful (9/10 or 90%) because the correct thoracic nerve innervation to the offending lesion could be identified. The lumbosacral nerve ablation procedures were the least successful (6/14 or 43%) because the innervation of the pelvic neoplasms was complex, arising from multiple lumbosacral nerves that often were bilateral. Equivocal foraminal stenosis and disk protrusion are common findings on CT and MR imaging, and CT-guided nerve block procedures can help determine which of these findings are clinically significant. CT-guided nerve root ablations have limited efficacy but can help control pain in patients with a malignant disease, especially when the pain is in the distribution of a thoracic nerve dermatome."

A herniated disk resulting in nerve root impingement was found in 79 patients (83 herniated disks) and lumbar spinal stenosis in 21. The level of nerve root compromise was L2-L3 in eight cases, L3-L4 in 35 cases, and L4-L5 in 40 cases. Herniated disks were divided into several groups based on their location with regard to the intervertebral foramen: posterolateral herniations were entirely contained within the spinal canal (n = 12; 14.5%), whereas far lateral, or foraminal, herniations (n = 71; 85.5%) involved the intervertebral foramen. Twenty-nine foraminal herniations (34.9%) had a component located within the spinal canal (medioforaminal herniations), 33 (39.8%) were entirely contained within the foramen (pure foraminal herniations), and nine (10.8%) were located lateral to the foramen (lateroforaminal herniations). As compared with posterolateral herniations, foraminal herniations were associated with shorter symptom duration at admission (p < 0.05), a greater likelihood of nocturnal exacerbation of pain (p < 0.001) and of a positive femoral stretch test (p < 0.01), and failure of the pain to worsen during Valsalva maneuvers (p < 0.01)."

CD007431,0,10631642,0,Measurement of the effect of a bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen by a repetitive movement test.,"We assessed the repetitive movement (RM) test for measuring the effect of a trial bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen on spasticity. The RM test measures passive range of motion (ROM) by electrogoniometry and stretch reflex activity (SRA) of the flexors and extensors of the knee and ankle by surface electromyography. The SRA has a dynamic component (dynamic stretch reflex, DSR) and a tonic component (tonic stretch reflex, TSR). Four hypotheses were formulated: (a) RM results show a negative relationship between SRA and ROM; (b) values on the RM test are correlated with clinical scores of tonus and spasticity; (c) RM results show a reduction in SRA after administration of the clinically optimal dose of baclofen; and (d) RM results show a dose-dependent effect of intrathecal baclofen on SRA. Twenty-four patients were selected because they had impairments and disabilities caused by intractable spasticity. A bolus of baclofen was administered with incremental doses (25-150 micrograms) until an optimal effect or no effect was obtained. The main outcome measures were RM test and clinical assessments of the Ashworth and spasm score. The results were (a) For the ankle a negative correlation was found between ROM and TSR of the flexor and extensors; for the knee a significant negative correlation was found only with the DSR of the biceps femoris. (b) A positive correlation was found between the Ashworth score and TSR of the extensors and between the spasm score and DSR and TSR of the gastrocnemius muscle. (c) Significant differences were found between baseline measurements and the optimal dose of baclofen for all measures. (d) A significant dose-dependent effect of intrathecal baclofen on the level of SRA was observed. The RM test is thus a useful clinical tool for objectively measuring the effect of intrathecal baclofen administration on spasticity in patients with an upper motor neuron syndrome."
CD007431,0,10631640,0,MRI findings in Hirayama's disease: flexion-induced cervical myelopathy or intrinsic motor neuron disease?,"Hirayama's disease is a benign juvenile form of focal amyotrophy affecting the upper limbs. Previous studies have suggested that the disorder is a neck flexion induced cervical myelopathy. We report clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings in nine patients with Hirayama's disease. Cervical imaging of seven patients revealed spinal cord changes consisting of focal atrophy and foci of signal alterations. On neck flexion a forward movement and mild reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the lower cervical cord against the vertebral bodies was noted in affected individuals as well as in five normal controls. In contrast to earlier reports, none of our patients showed complete obliteration of the posterior subarachnoid space. Measurement of the anteroposterior spinal cord diameter in each vertebral segment (C4-C7) revealed no significant differences in the degree of spinal cord flattening between the two groups. Furthermore, two of our patients had significant degenerative changes in the cervical spine (disc herniation, retrospondylosis) contralateral to the clinically affected side. These degenerative changes resulted in a marked cord compression on neck flexion but were not associated with ipsilateral clinical abnormalities or spinal cord alterations. Our results argue against a flexion-induced cervical myelopathy and support the view that Hirayama's disease is an intrinsic motor neuron disease."

CD007431,0,11383229,0,Therapeutic efficacy of selective nerve root blocks in the treatment of lumbar radicular leg pain.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness of nerve root blocks (i.e., periradicular injection of bupivacaine and triamcinolone) for lumbar monoradiculopathy in patients with a mild neurological deficit. We have retrospectively analysed 30 patients (29-82 years) with a minor sensory/motor deficit and an unequivocal MRI finding (20 disc herniations, 10 foraminal stenoses) treated with a selective nerve root block. Based on the clinical and imaging findings, surgery (decompression of the nerve root) was justifiable in all cases. Twenty-six patients (87%) had rapid (1-4 days) and substantial regression of pain, five required a repeat injection. 60% of the patients with disc herniation or foraminal stenosis had permanent resolution of pain, so that an operation was avoided over an average of 16 months (6-23 months) follow-up. Nerve root blocks are very effective in the non-operative treatment of minor monoradiculopathy and should be recommended as the initial treatment of choice for this condition."

Ex-vivo, GCH1 upregulation and BH4 production after forskolin stimulation were reduced, while baseline BH4 concentrations were not affected. This suggested that the haplotype may mainly exert its modulating function when the GCH1 system is provoked. The present study aimed at (i) testing this hypothesis and (ii) independently reproducing the pain-decreasing effects of a particular GCH1 haplotype having been previously associated with pain protection."

There were no complications. At a minimum of 1 year postoperatively, 63% of patients had complete relief of back pain and 73% had complete relief of leg pain. A discriminant analysis equation was derived which assessed the relative significance of factors as determinants of outcome. A method is given for estimating whether a patient will have a good or a poor outcome following the discectomy. Factors shown to be of significance should be recorded in prospective series to allow for comparison as to the efficacy of different methods of treatment. The results are better than those described for chemonucleolysis."

CD007431,0,129856,0,[Ischias without intervertebral disk prolapse: the compression of lumbar nerve roots in the lateral recess of the spinal canal].,"In some cases with the clinical and myelographic diagnosis of lumbar root compression due to disc herniation, exploration fails to reveal any lesion of the intervertebral disc. Sometimes the source of the root compression is found to be articular: process impingement in stenotic recessus lateralis of the spinal canal. Pathogenesis and surgical therapy of such lesion are discussed. It is suggested that in such cases radical exposure of the nerve root should be undertaken, even if it should prove necessary to sacrifice articular facets."
CD007431,0,17075165,0,Finite element analysis of the spondylolysis in lumbar spine.,"Spondylolysis is a fracture of the bone lamina in the pars interarticularis and has a high risk of developing spondylolisthesis, as well as traction on the spinal cord and nerve root, leading to spinal disorders or low back pain when the lumbar spine is subjected to high external forces. Previous studies mostly investigated the mechanical changes of the endplate in spondylolysis. However, little attention has been focused on the entire structural changes that occur in spondylolysis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical changes in posterior ligaments, disc, endplate, and pars interarticularis between the intact lumbar spine and spondylolysis. A total of three finite element models, namely the intact L2-L4 lumbar spine, lumbar spine with unilateral pars defect and with bilateral pars defect were established using a software ANSYS 6.0. A loading of 10 N.m in flexion, extension, left torsion, right torsion, left lateral bending, and right lateral bending respectively were imposed on the superior surface of the L2 body. The bottom of the L4 vertebral body was completely constrained. The finite element models estimated that the lumbar spine with a unilateral pars defect was able to maintain spinal stability as the intact lumbar spine, but the contralateral pars experienced greater stress. For the lumbar spine with a bilateral pars defect, the rotation angle, the vertebral body displacement, the disc stress, and the endplate stress, was increased more when compared to the intact lumbar spine under extension or torsion."
CD007431,0,206669,0,Clinical and electrophysiological appraisal of the significance of radicular injury in back pain.,"Clinical electrophysiological studies were analysed in 60 consecutive patients with back pain with or without other evidence for a radiculopathy. These studies included needle EMG of relevant limb and paraspinal muscles as well as F responses and H reflexes recorded from the soleus muscle. Segmental denervation was found in 29 of the 60 patients. In 57 patients, abnormal slowing of the F response was present in 27, either unilaterally (25) or bilaterally (two). In 18 of 47 patients with H reflex studies, the H reflex was either unilaterally absent (12), asymmetrically prolonged (five), or bilaterally prolonged (one). Statistically significant (P less than 0.05) associations were found between (1) abnormalities of H reflexes and F responses, (2) F response slowing and radicular injury shown by EMG, (3) segmentally consistent radiographic defects and abnormalities of both H reflexes and F responses, and (4) depressed Achilles reflexes as well as sensory loss and abnormal H reflexes. No significant association, however, was present between abnormalities of EMG, F responses, or H reflexes and pain radiation by history or positive straight leg-raising tests. These data suggest that pain in radicular syndromes is related to the functioning of smaller afferent fibres."
CD007431,0,10150250,0,Reflex sympathetic dystrophy following total knee replacement.,"Twenty-nine patients who eventually had a diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) following total knee replacement were treated with lumbar sympathetic blocks with local anesthetic. The diagnosis was made based on the complaint of constant pain unrelated to physical activity in the absence of overt sepsis or implant loosening. In six of these cases, other factors may have clouded the diagnosis. Thirteen (44.8%) patients obtained complete relief following an average of 1.8 blocks. Three of these patients had symptoms for more than two years. Twelve patients had complete or partial relief for varying periods of time, but the relief was not sustained. Three obtained no relief at all, and in one the block could not be successfully carried out. This success rate, while shedding no light on the etiology or diagnostic accuracy, has encouraged the authors to continue with this method of treatment in such cases."
CD007431,0,9811096,0,Surgical treatment of internal disc disruption: an outcome study of four fusion techniques.,"Surgical treatment for internal disc disruption remains controversial in terms of efficacy of spinal fusion and optimal fusion method. The present study was carried out in 56 consecutive patients, with the diagnosis confirmed by computed tomographic (CT) discography, who were operated with one of four different lumbar fusion procedures. Outcomes were determined by postoperative pain questionnaires, independent clinical assessment, and radiographic evaluation. Simultaneous anterior interbody fusion using BAK cage and posterior facet fusion provided the highest rate of fusion (88%) and clinical satisfaction (63%). Pain scores were also significantly lower than facet screw augmented posterolateral fusion, and anterior interbody fusion with fibula allograft, but not significantly different from pedicle screw instrumented posterolateral fusion. Patients who achieved successful lumbar fusion had better clinical outcomes and a better chance of work resumption."

All patients complained of low back pain and nine had additional radicular pain. Bilateral posterolateral fusion using the sacrospinalis muscle as a muscle pedicle bone graft was carried out in all patients. Decompression was added in patients with radiculopathy. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 28 months. Pain relief was graded as excellent in 18 patients, radiographic fusion as excellent in 17 patients and functional outcome as excellent in 19 patients."
CD007431,0,12152441,0,Electrodiagnostic approach to the patient with suspected radiculopathy.,"Cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathies are among the most common causes of referral to the electromyographic (EMG) laboratory. Among all the other electrodiagnostic studies (nerve conduction studies, late responses, somatosensory evoked potentials, root electrical and magnetic stimulation studies), the needle electrode (needle EMG) examination is the most specific and sensitive. A good grasp of the anatomic, clinical and electromyographic myotomal charts is essential to localize radiculopathies to single (or more) root lesions."
CD007431,0,6318336,0,[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Evaluation criteria in discal sciatic neuralgia].,"Few controlled trials have been carried out with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs in this indication, mainly as a result of methodological difficulties. A prerequisite for correct evaluation is compliance with certain fundamental principles. The study must be controlled (i.e. comparative, prospective randomized, double-blind, with data quality control and statistical analysis). The sample size must be consistent with the objectives (at least 40 patients per group). The selection criteria must be well specified and the comparability of baseline data assessed. The most appropriate study design for assessing clinical efficacy is to compare two parallel groups of out patients treated during five to fifteen days. The main criterion of efficacy should be based on the judgments of both patients and physician. Time course of pain, improvement in the patient's functional capacity, improvement in physical findings (Schober, Lasègue), dosage of concomitant analgesic treatments when these are allowed, and evaluation at three and six months can also be used as efficacy criteria. Assessment of clinical and biological tolerance is mandatory. Considering the frequent use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs in treating sciatica, there is a strong need for rigorous investigations."
CD007431,0,6983719,0,The value of dorsal column stimulation in multiple sclerosis.,"Ten patients with definite and one with probable MS, all markedly inflicted, but with a varying degree of motor and bladder dysfunction were subjected to spinal cord stimulation in a controlled study. None of the patients exhibited appreciable fluctuation in symptoms in the pre-study period. Bladder symptoms were most markedly influenced by electrical stimulation. The reduction in hesitancy and urgency was of great importance to the patients. In 9 of 10 patients reduction in voiding frequency took place, the all over reduction being 8%. Maximum extension torque increased by 9% and flexion torque by 29% during the stimulation when compared to the first placebo period. In selected MS patients, i.e. patients with bladder dysfunction and with a certain muscular reserve, electrical spinal cord stimulation may have an indication."
CD007431,0,842090,0,[Clinical signs of the narrow lumbar spinal canal (author's transl)].,The syndrom of the narrow spinal canal is today to be separated from other lumbar diseases by its nosological entity. It starts slowly and becomes manifest in middle and advanced age. Claudicatio intermittens is the characteristic symptom of this disease the aetiology of which is multifactory. Most patients show in the myelogram konstitutionell alterations combined with localized or generalized degenerative narrowing of the spinal canal. The clinical findings correspond to the lumbar segments affected. With localized narrowing the differential diagnosis of disc herniation is generally possible by myelography. This is of therapeutic consequence because in this cases a removal of the disc is unnecessary.

CD007431,0,6719259,0,The role of surgery in nerve root compression.,"If nonoperative treatment fails to relieve the symptoms of nerve compression in a 6-8 week period, surgical decompression may be indicated. Prior to embarking on such a course the surgeon must have a precise neurologic diagnosis. This diagnosis must be clinical, with corroborating radiographic, electrodiagnostic and nerve block evidence. The important concept is: think nerve root. Surgical management must be tailored to the individual, depending on that individual's local anatomy and local pathology, be it disc or lateral bony entrapment. The surgeon should not have preconceived ideas about the cause of nerve compression and should be guided by the findings at operation. To prevent intractable back pain following nerve decompression, those patients with spondylolisthesis or segmental instability should be considered candidates for a spinal fusion."
CD007431,0,11320971,0,Lumbar discectomy and the diabetic patient: incidence and outcome.,"Medical records of 363 patients who had a diagnosis of lumbar disc disease and were managed by a posterior approach lumbar discectomy over a 7 year period were reviewed: 33 patients had a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes, an incidence in this patient population of 9.1%. The results for these 33 patients who had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were compared with those of 33 age and sex matched nondiabetic (control) patients who had a similar operative approach. Twenty-five of the diabetic and 28 of t he control patients were available for long term follow up. The results were positive (good to excellent) for 24 of the 28 (86%) control patients and 15 of the 25 (60%) diabetic patients. Seven of the 25 (28%) diabetic patients had reoperation for recurrent disc herniation at the same level following the initial procedure compared with one of the 28 (3.5%) control patients."
CD007431,0,8316881,0,A preoperative and postoperative study of the accuracy and value of electrodiagnosis in patients with lumbosacral disc herniation.,"Twenty patients with a radicular syndrome, who underwent surgery for unilevel lumbosacral disc herniations verified by computed tomography were investigated with neurophysiologic tests (electromyograms, F-responses, dermatome somatosensory evoked potentials) preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. At least one test revealed a pathologic abnormality preoperatively in 13 patients, but in 5 patients only the nerve root level corresponded to computed tomographic findings. Discordance between neurophysiologic and radiologic findings did not predict a surgical success rate. if all neurophysiologic tests were normal the outcome was significantly worse than if any of the tests showed an abnormality (P < 0.01). Four patients who were improved after surgery still had abnormal neurophysiologic findings. In conclusion, neurophysiology is not useful to diagnose the exact level of a nerve root lesion, but may reveal whether it is present. Electrodiagnosis is recommended if radiology and clinical testing conflict. If positive, it may then serve to justify surgical exploration."
CD007431,0,9148533,0,[Lumbar disk prolapse surgery with or without free fat transplantation. A prospective triple-blind randomized study].,"The aim of this prospective triple-blind randomized study was to determine if a free fat transplant used in operation in lumbar disc herniation could reduce the degree of intraspinal scar tissue and to evaluate whether the scar tissue could lead to symptoms. Ninety-nine patients were subsequently examined after median 376 days. The clinical outcome was scored using the Low Back Pain Rating Scale. Enhanced CT-scanning was assessed regarding the degree of scar tissue and survival of the fat transplant. There was no difference in the clinical outcome between the two groups. Significantly fewer had dural scarring in the group who had a free fat transplantation, but there was no difference regarding the degree of radicular scarring. The transplant was shown on CT-scan at the follow-up examination in 66% of the patients who had a fat transplantation. Free fat transplantation can reduce the degree of dural scar tissue after operation for lumbal disc herniation, but does not result in a clinically better outcome."
CD007431,0,8316882,0,Radiographic changes after lumbar discectomy. Sequential enhanced computed tomography in relation to clinical observations.,"Fifty patients, with single-level disc herniations verified by computed tomography, took part in a study where they were randomized to either microsurgery or standard surgery. The aim of the study was to describe the changes on a series of radiographic examinations after disc resection, and to relate these changes to clinical symptoms. The study was prospective and the patients were examined with contrast-enhanced computed tomography during the first postoperative week, after 1-2 months, and after 1 year. At 1 year after surgery 16 patients showed posterior disc protrusion, 47 showed scar tissue, and 13 showed nerve root displacement. Microsurgically operated patients did not show less scar tissue. None of the postoperative radiographic changes had any definite correlation to remaining back pain or leg pain."
CD007431,0,6223390,0,Low back pain.,"Low back pain probably always will be a problem because of the anatomic arrangement of the lower spine and posture in standing and walking. However, during recent years, new attempts at diagnosis and treatment of this difficult problem have occurred, and it is now possible, in most cases, with a good history, physical examination, and diagnostic work-up to determine the cause of the problem. The injuries are still difficult to treat in many cases, but often with a thorough explanation to the patient about the underlying problem and mechanism of pain, and with use of the ""back school"" and conservative measures, most of the patients can continue on with daily activities. Formal surgery is playing less of a role in the treatment of back problems, with the development of various injections and percutaneous techniques. Still to be addressed, and where considerable effort and energy should be spent, is in the prevention of back problems with changes in daily habits and in increased awareness of ways to avoid back injuries."
CD007431,0,6222488,0,Quantitative power measurement of extensor hallucis longus. A simple objective test in evaluation of low-back pain with neurological involvement.,"Clinical evaluation of a patient with low-back problem is based mainly upon the subjective impressions of the physician. Accuracy in neurologic evaluation and follow-up of these patients depends upon objective and quantitative procedures. A handy instrument, simple to use by the clinician in his office, was developed in our laboratory and tested on healthy volunteers and patients with low-back problems. The instrument measures or records the power of the extensor hallucis longus. Weakness of this muscle represents the vast majority of root involvement in discogenic lesions. The measurement is compared with the result obtained on the contralateral side. The instrument includes a mobile mechanical spring gauge of 100-2000-gr range and a leg splint. A single channel polygraph can be connected to record the measurement. The technique was tested on healthy volunteers and good reproducibility and accuracy were found. Seventy-five patients were examined and the power of EHL measured. The patients were divided into three groups according to the nature of their back problems: 1) acute discogenic; 2) chronic low back problems with acute exacerbations; and 3) acute trauma. The quantitative measurements of EHL were of great help in evaluating and following treatment of patients with discogenic lesions and in deciding further surgical treatments. The test was valuable in evaluating malingeres and compensation cases. Eight of the patients with chronic, recurrent low-back problems were found to have weakness of EHL; further investigations showed root pressure mostly due to osteophytes pressing on the nerve roots. After acute trauma, the EHL power test also revealed weakness in patients with higher lumbar injuries, probably because of spreading."

The average age at diagnosis was 9 years (range, birth-32 years). All patients had a clinical neurologic and orthopaedic examination. Ten patients (45%) had abnormal findings on clinical examination, and 15 patients (68%) had at least one complaint that could be related to the syndrome. The roentgenograms were unremarkable in all patients, except for the typical findings of congenital fusion; no vertebral subluxation or stenosis was noted in any patient. The magnetic resonance images revealed degenerative changes in the disks of 100% of the patients, evidenced by a low-intensity signal on the T2-weighted images. Nineteen patients (86%) had abnormal findings on the magnetic resonance imaging scans, including disk protrusion (16 patients), osteophytes (four patients), syringomyelia (four patients), and narrowing at the level of the craniovertebral junction (six patients). Our results confirm the well-held belief that the Klippel-Feil syndrome can cause problems in adult life."

The authors' purpose was to define the diagnostic value of lumbar phlebography in the investigation of intervertebral disc lesions and to compare these results with those obtained from clinical examination and plain X-rays. They conducted a retrospective study of 200 cases of patients hospitalized for sciatica who were investigated by lumbar phlebography using selective catheterization, without any prior neuro-radiological examination. 104 of these cases were operated on. The lumbar phlebography was interpretable in 99 p. cent of cases. Severe thrombo-embolic episodes occurred in two cases. In the 104 patients who went to operation, the surgical procedure confirmed the presence of a herniated disc (suspected on phlebography) in 96 p. cent of cases. Topographical agreement between the phlebographic data and the operative findings was observed in 81 p. cent of cases. Phlebography proved to be more reliable at L4-L5 than at L5-S1. In the patients in whom clinical examination and plain X-ray findings provided coherent information as to the site of the herniated disc, phlebography was considered to be of no use. In those patients for whom this examination did not provide coherent information, phlebography proved to be valuable in the topographical diagnosis of the herniated disc."

All patients had minimal or no intrinsic hand muscle atrophy. Only one patient had cervical ribs. Nerve conduction studies were normal, and electromyography (EMG) showed mild chronic neuropathic changes in 2 patients. None of the patients responded to conservative therapy over a prolonged period (7-12 months). A compressive brachial plexopathy from abnormally attached or enlarged scalene muscles that affected both upper and lower trunks of the brachial plexus was found at surgery in all patients. In 13 patients, at least one fibrous band compressed the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. Therefore, neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome can occur from cervical bands and scalene muscle anomalies without intrinsic hand muscle atrophy, cervical ribs, enlarged C7 transverse processes, or EMG abnormalities."

CD007431,0,3737692,0,Hamstring muscle strain treated by mobilizing the sacroiliac joint.,The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two types of treatment of hamstring muscle strains. Twenty patients with hamstring muscle strains were assigned randomly to an Experimental Group (n = 10) or a Control Group (n = 10). Peak torque production of the quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles and hamstring muscle length were measured before and after treatment. The hamstring muscles of the Experimental and Control groups were treated with moist heat followed by passive stretching. The Experimental Group also received manipulation of the sacroiliac joint. The change in hamstring muscle peak torque was significantly greater for the Experimental Group than for the Control Group (p less than .005). No significant differences existed between the two groups in either quadriceps femoris muscle peak torque or hamstring muscle length. The results of this study suggest a relationship between sacroiliac joint dysfunction and hamstring muscle strain.

While upper limb motor and sensory loss are doubtless due to nerve root compression in cases of ""pure' brachial neuritis, they are more likely to be due to cord damage in cases with myelopathy (with spastic paraparesis of lower limbs). In either group of cases, neurological features in the upper limbs are not very helpful in localizing the level of significant intervertebral disc pathology. Contrast radiology (myelography and possibly discography) is a reliable guide judging by the excellent results obtained by anterior route (Cloward's) operation at specific disc levels in a series of cases with longstanding complaints unrelieved by conservative treatment.

There was considerable interobserver variation among three observers concerning the measured angle at which pain was elicited. However, in 2/3 to 3/4 of the cases the variation amounted to 10 degrees or less. There was also some discordance in the classification of the type of pain that was elicited.

Some of them undergo risky weight reducing methods, surgical procedures, etc, to reduce their body weight and to release mentally stressing body deformities. Aim of the work is to quantify negative impaction of obesity on functionality of the knee, the key joint in everyday body activities (rising, standing, walking, and climbing). Study has analyzed 22 randomly chosen patients (5 male, 17 female) with strong degenerative alteration of the knee (osteoarthritis), who were treated on the Department for orthopedic and traumatology, Clinical center Sarajevo during 2005 and 2006. Average age was 63.6 +/- 10.6 (54-76) years, with Body Mass Index (level of obesity) 31.1 +/- 3.5 (27-38) points, and average duration of symptoms 9.1 +/- 7.4 (1-25) years. The knee functionality was assessed by Knee Society Knee Score (KSKS). Completely healthy knee has 200 points--50 points for pain free knee, 25 points for stabile knee, and forfull extension-flexion arch, both, 50 points for normal walking and stairs climbing, both. Average value of KSKS was 118.1 +/- 35.0 points. As it was expected, there were strong significant correlation between KSKS and age (r = -0.50, p = 0.015). The duration of disability correlated with KSKS (r = -0.5, p = 0.02), and level of pain (r = 0.60, p=0.00). The obesity has significantly increased level of pain in the knee (r = -0.44, p = 0.04), all patients were obese persons. Persons with reduced functional abilities avoid body activity, it causes increasing of obesity, and one makes other worse. Concerning on incidence of described problem and its impaction on society in general, it is necessary to make every effort in prevention and treatment of obesity, as important risk factor and consequence of reduced functional abilities and risk factor of most common nowadays diseases."

A retrospective analysis of the findings from the clinical and arthrographic examination at the first consultation revealed that the intensity of temporomandibular joint pain during chewing and the degree of disturbed joint function were more pronounced and the frequency of temporary locking was higher in the patients who progressed to closed lock compared with those who did not progress to closed lock. A deep anterior recess of the lower joint compartment was found in ten (83%) of the twelve joints that progressed to closed lock. This type of a deep anterior recess was seen in only five (11%) of the forty-nine patients who did not progress to closed lock.

The open-door laminoplasty procedure presently reported consisted of the same approach evaluated by Hirabayashi in 1977, except that the authors of this report used three rib allografts to anchor the ""open door,"" rather than spinous process sutures or autologous bone grafts. Posterior foraminotomies and decompression were performed in patients with clinical radiculopathy and radiographic evidence of foraminal stenosis. Preoperatively, gait disturbance was present in all patients. All 25 patients (100%) had long-tract signs on presentation. Nondermatomal upper-extremity symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain) were quite common in this group of patients. Bowel, bladder, and/or sexual dysfunction was found in 13 (52%) of 25 patients. Preoperative radiographic studies showed a mean midline anteroposterior diameter spinal canal/vertebral body (SC/VB) ratio of 0.623 and a mean compression ratio (sagittal/lateral diameter ratio x 100%) of 37%. This procedure was quite successful in relieving preoperative symptoms and few complications occurred. Gait disturbance was improved in 21 (84%) of 25 patients and hand numbness and tingling were improved in 13 (87%) of 15 patients. Bowel or bladder function improved in 10 (77%) of 13 patients. Radiculopathy, when present, was alleviated in all four patients after the decompressive procedure. The postoperative SC/VB ratio, as measured by plain lateral radiographs and/or computerized tomography scans, was improved to 0.871, a 38% improvement. In a comparison with the preoperative SC/VB ratio using the two-tailed t-test, alpha was less than 0.001. The compression ratio improved to 63% postoperatively, which yielded an alpha of less than 0.005 according to the two-tailed t-test. Only one postoperative complication, an anterior scalene syndrome, was encountered. Various predictors of surgical outcome based on gait improvement were evaluated. Age greater than 60 years at the time of presentation, duration of symptoms more than 18 months prior to surgery, preoperative bowel or bladder dysfunction, and lower-extremity dysfunction were found to be associated with poorer surgical outcome. Even when these conditions were present, gait improvement was noted in at least 70% of the patients."

CD007431,0,8410084,0,The utility of F wave chronodispersion in lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"The sensitivity of F wave chronodispersion (Fc) in evaluating nerve root pathology is unknown. We compared Fc in 91 patients with clinical and EMG evidence of L5 or S1 radiculopathy with Fc in 81 controls in order to evaluate its sensitivity in lumbosacral radiculopathy. F waves were obtained by stimulating the peroneal and tibial nerves behind the knee and recording from the extensor digitorum brevis (L5 predominant) and flexor hallucis brevis (S1 predominant) muscles, respectively. Fc was calculated by subtracting the shortest F wave latency from the longest and, in controls, ranged from 0.2 to 23.4 ms in the peroneal nerve, and from 1.2 to 13.4 ms in the tibial nerve (95th percentile = 13 ms for the peroneal nerve and 9.2 ms for the tibial nerve). In the patient group, Fc also ranged from 0.2 to 23.4 ms in the peroneal nerve, and from 0.4 to 18.2 ms in the tibial nerve. Only 5 (5.5%) and 8 (11.3%) patients for the peroneal and tibial nerves, respectively, had Fc values which fell beyond the 95th percentile, a percentage far below the sensitivity of F wave latency measurement and not substantially different from chance. Thus we conclude that Fc has no substantial additional value in evaluating lumbosacral radiculopathy over that of F wave latency."

Forty cases were randomly selected from studies performed from 1984 to 1987 and the T1- and T2-weighted images of each case were separated and interpreted blindly and independently by two neuroradiologists. Our results indicate no significant difference between T1- and T2-weighted images in the depiction of disc protrusion. The T2-weighted images were superior in depicting disc dessication, but the clinical significance of identifying a dessication disc remains uncertain. No significant difference in the depiction of osteophytes was seen between T1- and T2-weighted images. Cases of tethered cord, metastatic disease, and arachnoiditis were better delineated with T1-weighted images. The increase in signal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with T2-weighting often obscured lesions within the spinal canal. In a signal case of postoperative discitis, the T2-weighted images disclosed disc space abnormalities and epidural fluid collections not appreciated on T1-weighted images. The T1-weighted images, however, did show thecal sac and adjacent epidural extension more clearly. In cases of metastatic disease, increase in the signal of metastases with T2 weighting often rendered them isointense to surrounding medullary bone. Given the lack of superiority of T2-weighted images over T1-weighted images in evaluating intervertebral disc protrusions and the superiority of T1-weighted images in depicting nearly all other abnormalities observed in this series, we no longer acquire T2-weighted images of the lumbar spine on a routine basis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The neurologic signs in cases of cauda equina compression, most often caused by massive disc protrusions (20 patients), vary considerably and rarely correspond to the gross myelographic findings. Bilateral neurologic symptoms of any degree with or without sphincter disturbance were observed in 21 among 27 cases and are signs of cauda compression. In contrast to cases of sciatica with unilateral root compression and radicular symptoms neurological symptoms are not reliable in revealing the site of the lesion in cases of massive central disc protrusions.

The objective of this study is to report clinical results and implant-related complications in anterior cervical fusion using titanium mesh and anterior plating. Twenty-four cases with anterior cervical fusion using a titanium mesh with local autograft and anterior plating were reviewed. One-level fusion was performed in 7 cases, and 17 patients underwent two-level fusion with corpectomy. The mean follow-up period was 27 months. Radiographic assessment included sagittal alignment, fusion status, and complications related to cage implants. Iliac bone graft harvesting was obviated in all the patients, whereas 15 patients required concomitant use of ceramic bone substitute. Sagittal alignment of the operative level was lordotic in 19 cases (79%) and neutral in 5 cases (21%) at the final follow-up. No late kyphotic collapse was observed. Twenty-three cases (96%) achieved a solid fusion, whereas the time to fusion was averaged 6.2 months. Cage subsidence frequently occurred in 42% of upper vertebrae and 50% of lower vertebrae. The use of titanium mesh and local autograft for anterior cervical fusion obviated the need for harvesting iliac bone block and provided structural anterior column support. However, it required a longer period to achieve a solid fusion when compared with tricortical iliac autograft. Cage subsidence was frequently observed in the early postoperative period."

CD007431,0,16047210,0,The pathogenesis and clinical significance of a high-intensity zone (HIZ) of lumbar intervertebral disc on MR imaging in the patient with discogenic low back pain.,"Recently, the presence of a high-intensity zone (HIZ) within the posterior annulus seen on T2-weighted MRI has aroused great interest and even controversy among many investigators, particularly on whether the HIZ was closely associated with a concordant pain response on awake discography. The study attempted to interpret the correlation between the presence of the HIZ on MRI and awake discography, as well as its characteristic pathology. Fifty two patients with low back pain without disc herniation underwent MRI and discography successively. Each disc with HIZ was correlated for an association between the presence of a HIZ and the grading of annular disruption and a concordant pain response. Eleven specimens of lumbar intervertebral discs which contain HIZ in the posterior annulus from 11 patients with discogenic low back pain were harvested for histologic examination to interpret the histologic basis of a nociceptive response during posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF). The study found that in all of 142 discograms in 52 patients, 17 presented HIZ. All 17 discs with HIZ showed painful reproduction and abnormal morphology with annular tears extending either well into or through the outer third of the annulus fibrosus. The consecutive sagittal slices through the HIZ lesion showed that a notable histologic feature of the formation of vascularized granulation tissue in the outer region of the annulus fibrosus. The current study suggests that the HIZ of the lumbar disc on MRI in the patient with low back pain could be considered as a reliable marker of painful outer anular disruption."

The effect of lumbar intrathecal fentanyl on reported pain, nociceptive flexor withdrawal reflexes, a monosynaptic motor arc (H-reflex), and supraspinal effects such as miosis, nausea, respiratory depression was evaluated. In five of eight subjects the flexor withdrawal reflex was completely abolished within 15 min. In the others the reflex was significantly depressed from control values. Decreases in reported pain paralleled the decrease in the flexor reflex, H-reflexes remained unchanged, and no supraspinal side effects were observed. It is likely that these selective changes observed were from the isolated effect of fentanyl modulating nociception at the spinal cord level."

Eighty patients with monoradicular pain corresponding to the fifth lumbar or the first sacral nerve root were included. Pre-operatively a number of clinical parameters were recorded and compared to the intra-operative finding of a disc herniation. The parameters were analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results from the available literature were analysed by ROC curves for comparison. In 76% of the cases a disc herniation was discovered. The level of the disc herniation was correctly predicted in 93% of these cases by the location of the pain alone or supplemented by neurological signs. Apart from radicularly distributed pain, all parameters in the present study and in the literature had no or low diagnostic accuracy. Thus, in patients with monoradicular sciatica further clinical parameters do not add to the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation."

CD007431,0,6646382,0,Degenerative spondylolisthesis with an intact neural arch: a review of 60 cases with an analysis of clinical findings and the development of surgical management.,"The treatment over the past 12 years of 60 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis with an intact neural arch is reviewed. The patients averaged 65 years of age, with women outnumbering men by a ratio of 2:1. Symptoms in the lower extremities had been present for 3 months to 10 years, although varying back pain had existed for longer periods. Two-thirds showed signs of motor dysfunction. Sensory alterations and a positive Las ègue's sign could be demonstrated in only one-half of the patients studied. Four of 5 patients developed intermittent neurogenic claudication, with varying evidence of painful radiculopathy. The marked disability caused by claudication contrasted sharply with the lesser neurological changes, and these patients required early surgical decompression. Diagnostic studies included electromyography, plain x-ray films, tomography, computed tomographic scanning, and myelography. The latter outlined a relative stenosis caused by olisthesis as well as arthrotic and spondylotic changes that determined the extent of decompressive operation required. The L-4, L-5 interspace was involved in 56 patients, L-3, L-4 was involved in 2, and L-5, S-1 was involved in 2. The ideal operation with L-4, L-5 olisthesis included complete laminectomy of L-4 and L-5 with unroofing of the lateral recesses and foraminotomy. This more extensive procedure was justified because of the failures encountered in previous patients in whom inadequate decompression had been performed. Among failures, obesity, diabetes, hyperlordosis, and extensive long-standing dysfunction were prominent. The relief of symptoms of intermittent neurogenic claudication was the most gratifying response observed. There was no unusual morbidity."

In all patients the clinical diagnosis was confirmed using a CT-Scan. After 1.7 y a clinical follow-up was performed. Four patients have required surgery in the meantime. Ninety percent of the patients treated conservatively experienced marked pain relief and generally appreciated the results of conservative treatment. Nevertheless, 67% had some complaints. The neurological findings showed essential improvement even in cases of severe paresis. Follow-up CT scans performed in 35 of these patients and in a control group of 23 patients showed partial regression of the prolapse at an average of 48.3% and 50.4%, respectively. The NP disappeared in 3 with no regression in 2 cases. If regression occurred, it apparently took place during the first 6 months. Regression of NP and clinical improvement showed no positive correlation. The investigation demonstrated fair results with conservative therapy even in cases with minor regression."
CD007431,0,2416544,0,Validity of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials in the diagnosis of supraclavicular brachial plexus lesions.,"Experience with median nerve SEPs in the diagnosis of brachial plexus lesions is analysed in 49 patients selected from a total material of 264 cases with brachial plexus problems tested by SEP techniques. Median nerve SEPs were always compared with the results of SEPs after stimulation of at least one other nerve relevant to the site of the lesion as suspected clinically and electromyographically. All patients presented with unilateral brachial plexus problems and all root lesions were verified by clinical presentation, EMG studies, myelogram or surgery. There were 19 brachial plexus injuries, 13 cases with cervical spondylopathic radiculopaties without myelopathy and 7 patients presented brachial plexopathy with systemic cancer. It was found that median nerve SEPs were always normal in injuries of upper trunk and root avulsions confined to one or two root levels. Median nerve SEPs were abnormal in multiple trunk lesions and multiple root avulsions. In patients with spondylopathic radiculopathies median nerve SEPs were normal apart from one case where involvement of multiple roots was present. Median nerve SEPs were useful in assessing patients presenting brachial plexus problems in the presence of systematic cancer apart from cases where lower trunk involvement was present. In general, median nerve SEPs are useful if they are combined with SEP testing of other nerves anatomically more closely related to the problem as outlined clinically and electromyographically."
CD007431,0,15972911,0,Health-related quality of life in patients before and after surgery for a herniated lumbar disc.,"We investigated the pre-operative and one-year post-operative health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcome by using a Euroqol (EQ-5D) questionnaire in 263 patients who had undergone surgery for herniation of a lumbar disc. Data from the National Swedish Register for lumbar spinal surgery between 2001 and 2002 were used and, in addition, a comparison between our cohort and a Swedish EQ-5D population survey was performed. We analysed the pre- and post-operative quality of life data, age, gender, smoking habits, pain and walking capacity. The mean age of the patients was 42 years (20 to 66); 155 (59%) were men and 69 (26%) smoked. Pre-operatively, 72 (17%) could walk at least 1 km compared with 200 (76%) postoperatively. The mean EQ-5D score improved from 0.29 to 0.70, and the HRQOL improved in 195 (74%) of the patients. The pre-operative score did not influence the post-operative score. In most patients, all five EQ-5D dimensions improved, but did not reach the level reported by an age- and gender-matched population sample (mean difference 0.17). Predictors for poor outcome were smoking, a short pre-operative walking distance, and a long history of back pain."

All patients in this study were treated nonoperatively for radicular pain and neurologic loss. The following questions were addressed: 1) Does perithecal or perineural fibrosis result when extrusions are not removed surgically, and 2) Do disc extrusions spontaneously resolve, and, if so, how rapidly? The study population consisted of 11 patients with extrusions and radiculopathy. All patients were successfully treated nonoperatively. All had a primary complaint of leg pain and all had positive straight leg raising reproducing their leg pain at less than or equal to 60 degrees. Additionally, 87% had muscle weakness on a neurologic basis in a root level distribution corresponding to the site of disc pathology. Computed tomographic (CT) examinations were obtained on all patients at the inception of treatment. These studies were compared with follow-up MRI studies. The initial CT scans were evaluated for the following criteria: disc size and position, thecal sac effacement, nerve root enlargement or displacement, and evidence of central or intervertebral canal stenosis. In addition to the pathomorphology evaluated on the CT scans, follow-up MRI studies also evaluated disc hydration at the herniated and contiguous levels, and the presence of perithecal or perineural fibrosis. The following grading system was used to evaluate change in fragment size on the follow-up studies: Grade 1-0 to 50% decrease in size; Grade 2-50 to 75% decrease in size; Grade 3-75 to 100% decrease in size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,8719827,0,Revisional lumbar microdiscectomy: an analysis of operative findings and clinical outcome.,"Forty-one consecutive patients who underwent a revision microlumbar exploration for recurrent or persistent sciatica were reviewed retrospectively to analyse the operative findings and assess the clinical outcome following surgery. Thirty-three (80%) patients were found to have a recurrent intervertebral disc protrusion at the previous site, two patients had a disc herniation at a new site, one had severe perineural scarring, two had lateral recess stenosis, one patient had undergone previous exploration at an incorrect site and in two patients no cause for ongoing symptoms was found. Nineteen of the 33 patients with a re-prolapse presented with persistent or recurrent sciatica within 1 year of their first operation. The other 14 patients presented with a late re-prolapse (after 1 year) and their clinical outcome was better than for those patients with an early re-prolapse (12/14 vs 11/19 satisfactory result, respectively). The result of operating on patients with a late re-prolapse was comparable to the 80-95% satisfactory outcomes following primary lumbar microdiscectomy reported by other authors."

There were 88 subjects: 53 normals, 17 L-5, and 18 S-1 radiculopathy subjects. The clinical EDBR revealed a 91% specificity, with 18% sensitivity for L-5, and 11% for S-1. The electrodiagnostic EDBR yielded increased sensitivities of 35% for L-5 (P = 0.07) and 39% for S-1 (P = 0.04), with 87% specificity. H-reflexes showed 50% sensitivity for the S-1 group (P = 0.0006) and 91% specificity. EDBR latencies were significantly related to age and leg length (r2 = 0.46, P < 0.0001). Age alone explained 26% (P < 0.0001) of the EDBR variability and leg length 20% (P < 0.0001). EDBR clinical and electrodiagnostic reflexes have low sensitivities, high specificities, and do not discriminate L-5 from S-1 root involvement."

CD007431,0,8413372,0,Peripheral neuromuscular manifestations in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).,"Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is thought to be the least likely of the collagen vascular disorders to cause nervous system damage. We evaluated the peripheral neuromuscular manifestations in 32 patients with scleroderma. A clinically defined peripheral nervous system (PNS) lesion was manifest in 5 of 32 patients (16%), including 2 patients with trigeminal neuropathy and single cases of polyneuropathy, brachial plexopathy, and lumbosacral radiculopathy. Neurophysiological studies suggested subclinical PNS involvement in 6 additional patients (3 with distal axonal polyneuropathy, 1 with probable myopathy and superimposed polyneuropathy, 1 with trigeminal neuropathy, and 1 with focal ulnar neuropathy). Even though subjective muscular complaints were numerous (16 patients, 50%), a defined primary muscular disease could be demonstrated only in 5 patients (16%). Our results indicate that peripheral neuropathy in scleroderma is not as uncommon as previously estimated."

CD007431,0,12489347,0,Changes in alpha-motoneuron excitability with positions that tension neural tissue.,"The slump test assesses the contribution of neural tissue to the referred symptoms associated with spinal pain and musculo-skeletal injuries of the lower limb. The limitation to full range of movement in performing this test has, in the past, been attributed to a mechanical restriction in mobility of neural tissue. Recent literature suggests that the limitation may be caused by protective reflex muscle action. The purpose of this study was to establish whether the slump test was associated with an increase or a decrease in excitability of alpha-motoneurons and, therefore, an alteration in muscle activity at the end of the range of movement of the test. Forty-three normal subjects and eight subjects with abnormal neural tension participated in this study. Changes in alpha-motoneuron excitability in neck flexion, moderate slump, and maximum slump positions were assessed by observing changes in H-reflex recruitment curves. Linear regression analysis on the rising portion of the H-reflex recruitment curve enabled calculation of the dependent variable Hslp for statistical analysis. Normal subjects in the moderate and maximum slump positions demonstrated a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the slope of the H-reflex recruitment curve. Subjects with abnormal neural tension showed a non-significant increase in slope when in these positions. Subject flexibility had a significant influence on motoneuron excitability in the moderate neural tension position with inflexible subjects demonstrating a significant inhibition of motoneurons. The difference between the flexible or moderately flexible subjects and inflexible subjects was not significant in the maximum neural tension position. These findings have important implications for the rationale for treatment selection and success of treatment outcomes in the clinical setting."
CD007431,0,3160681,0,The diagnosis of lumbar stenosis. Analysis of clinical and radiographic findings in 43 cases.,"This study is based on 43 cases of lumbar spinal stenosis-37 involving the spinal canal and 6 involving isolated radicular canals. The clinical features are analysed, also the radiographic investigations currently used in the investigation of this pathological condition. Three distinct clinical syndromes are differentiated; continuous (acute or chronic), intermittent, combined. The last is the most frequent type. All the patients with stenosis of the canal showed significant radiographic changes, the most frequent being total or subtotal block on myelography with posterior impingement on the dural sac. In stenosis of the radicular canal the affected root was either displaced medially or cut off (amputated). Computerised tomography gives less precise results than radiculography."
CD007431,0,981929,0,[Arthrotic sciatica caused by radicular compression of osteophytic origin in the lateral recess.

The authors study the clinical and radiological characteristics that may indicate the diagnosis and discuss the different mechanisms by which vertebral arthrosis can lead to radicular compression. When surgery is necessary because of the persistent nature of the sciatica, a broader approach should be undertaken than that required for excision of the disc, in order to explore fully the roots, the multiplicity of possible compression sites being one of the essential characteristics of these cases of arthrosic radiculopathy. Study of the literature and of the series of sciatica patients operated upon by the authors shows that although discal hernia is far from being the most frequent cause of common sciatica, arthrosic compression is a cause that cannot be ignored, especially in aged subjects."

CD007431,0,8800224,0,Estimating mechanical parameters of leg segments in individuals with and without physical disabilities.,"Methods are described for estimating the inertia, viscosity, and stiffness of the lower leg around the knee and of the whole leg around the hip that are applicable even to persons with considerable spasticity. These involve: 1) a ""pull"" test in which the limb is slowly moved throughout its range of motion while measuring angles (with an electrogoniometer) and torques (with a hand-held dynamometer) to determine passive stiffness and 2) a ""pendulum"" test in which the limb is moved against gravity and then dropped, while again measuring angles and torques. By limiting the extent of the movement and choosing a direction (flexion or extension) that minimizes reflex responses, the mechanical parameters can be determined accurately and efficiently using computer programs. In the sample of subjects studied (nine with disability related to spinal cord injury, head injury, or stroke, and nine with no neurological disability), the inertia of the lower leg was significantly reduced in the subjects with disability (p < 0.05) as a result of atrophy, but the stiffness and viscosity were within normal limits. The values of inertia were also compared with anthropometric data in the literature. The identification of these passive parameters is particularly important in designing systems for functional electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles, but the methods may be widely applicable in rehabilitation medicine."
CD007431,0,4021986,0,Lumbar spinal-lateral recess stenosis.,"The syndrome of a lumbar spinal and lateral recess stenosis is characterized by pain and a variety of paresthetic symptoms occurring principally when the patient stands or walks. Sitting or lying down alleviate the symptoms promptly. The neurologic examination is characterized by a negative straight leg-raising test and a paucity of abnormal neurologic findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by a high-resolution CT scan. If conservative treatment fails, a myelogram is in order to establish a definitive diagnosis and assess the severity of neural compression prior to placing the indication for a surgical decompression of the stenotic spinal canal. The surgical procedure consists of a laminectomy and a partial facetectomy of the hypertrophied portion of the facet joint that compresses the adjacent lumbar nerve root from a dorsal direction. It is important to recognize all associated pathologic processes that must be dealt with accordingly at the same time in order to assure success of the operative procedure. The results of a surgical decompression for a lumbar spinal and lateral recess stenosis are excellent."

CD007431,0,2319192,0,[Clinical and experimental studies on ascending cauda equina action potential (A-CEAP) in lumbar lesion with reference to positivisation].,"The phenomenon of positivisation in ascending cauda equina action potential (A-CEAP) was evaluated in 114 patients with lumbosacral lesions. These patients were divided into two groups, i.e., non-positivisation and positivisation group. In the former, positive wave ratio was highest at the L5/S upon stimulating the peroneal nerve. In the latter, the positivisation at the L4/5 upon stimulating the peroneal nerve spread not only to the cranial level but also to the caudal-L5/S level. Based on these experimental results, the factors causing positivisation in the L5/S level without lesion were: 1) curving effect of the L5 nerve root, 2) augmentation of current density within the spinal canal and 3) the amount of individual impulses propagating along the L5 and S1 root."
CD007431,0,2972071,0,Annular protrusion: pathophysiology and roentgenographic appearance.,"The degenerative changes of the lumbar spine in 100 patients with symptomatic low-back pain were reviewed using plain roentgenograms and computed tomographic scans in order to determine the relationship between degeneration and annular protrusion. Additionally, the lumbar spinal units of 25 fresh cadavers were roentgenographed, injected with a mixture of methylene blue and renografin-60, dissected, and studied. The state of degeneration of each of the intervertebral units of both groups was graded on a four-point scale based on the roentgenographic presence or absence of osteophytes and facet joint changes, and the intervertebral disc height. The degree of annular protrusion was measured by dividing the anteroposterior diameter of the intervertebral disc by the anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral plate as determined on the radiographic studies. In the clinical group, 39 intervertebral discs having Grade II and III degeneration exhibited a statistically higher annular/vertebral diameter ratio (A/V index) of 1.30 as compared to the normal invertebral discs, with an A/V index of 1.12 (P less than 0.001). The dissection of the disc spaces of the cadavers with radiographic evidence of disc space narrowing and marginal osteophytosis, Grade II and III degeneration, displayed significant interruption and tearing of the annular fibers and peripheral migration of collagenized nuclear fragments. In both the clinical and pathologic groups, there was a direct correlation between the size of the annular bulge, as indicated in the A/V index, and the degree of narrowing of the disc space. Therefore, this study indicated that annular protrusion is an intricate part of the degeneration process."
CD007431,0,10853164,0,Epidural corticosteroid injection in the conservative management of sciatica.,"In this prospective randomized clinical trial, the results of epidural corticosteroid injections were evaluated in patients with lumbosciatic pain caused by herniated nucleus pulposus. Thirty-six patients with radicular lumbosciatic pain and positive straight leg raising test because of confirmed prolapsed intervertebral lumbar discs were randomized into two groups with (17 patients) and without (19 patients) epidural corticosteroid injection. Members of the treatment groups received three injections of 100 mg methylprednisolone in 10 mL bupivacaine 0.25% each. Additional therapy was standardized and identical in both groups. Followup examinations were performed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months. The examinations included pain level (visual analogue scale), straight leg raising test, and functional status (Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire). At 2 weeks, patients receiving methylprednisolone injection showed a significant improvement in straight leg raising test results compared with patients in the control group. Results were better in the methylprednisolone group, although not statistically significant for pain relief and mobility. At 6 weeks and 6 months, pain relief, improvement of straight leg raising, and improvement of functional status showed no statistical significance. Epidural corticosteroid injections can be recommended as additional therapy only in the acute phase of the conservative management of lumbosciatic pain."

Preoperatively and 3 and 6 months after surgery, patients were assessed on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and on a visual analogue scale (VAS) for the subjective perception of pain. At 3 and 12 months, we found that patients with lower SDS scores (n=41) had a better outcome regarding pain than patients with relevant depressive symptoms (n=32). In agreement with the literature, our results confirm the negative role of depression in outcome after lumbar disc surgery. We emphasize the consideration of psychological factors in the management of lumbar disc herniation."

CT is now used to detect lesions formerly difficult to diagnose, such as subluxation, arthrosis, facet osteophytes, and stenosis of the vertebral canal, as well as herniated disks and lateral disks. The findings in over 1,000 patients examined by CT for lumbosacral spinal pathology are documented.

CD007431,0,11812711,0,Epidural infusion pressure in degenerative spinal disease before and after epidural steroid therapy.,"The analgesic mechanism of epidural steroids in reducing pain associated with degenerative spinal disease (DSD) is poorly understood. We report increased inline epidural infusion pressure in patients with DSD and assess whether this phenomenon is affected by administration of an epidural steroid injection. We collected data during epidural placement for routine surgery or epidural steroid therapy. Using a 17-gauge Tuohy needle, with patients in the right lateral decubitus position, loss of resistance to 2 mL of saline identified the epidural space. Two minutes later the needle was attached to saline-filled tubing connected to a pressure transducer (Baxter PX 260 pressure monitoring kit with Truwave TM disposable pressure transducer). In the first part of the study, 4 successive boluses of 3 mL of local anesthetic were administered at a rate of 6 mL/min to 15 patients (age 47 +/- 6 yrs) with radicular back pain and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) evidence of DSD, and to 8 control patients with no history of back pain (age 44 +/- 5 yr) while inline epidural infusion pressure was measured. In the second part of the study 44 patients with low back pain and MRI or CT evidence of DSD presenting to the pain clinic were infused with 8 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine and 40 mg of methylprednisolone (20 mg/mL) at a rate of 6 mL/min while inline epidural infusion pressure was measure and recorded. This was repeated 3 wk later. Initially, DSD patients had significantly increased infusion pressures over normals, which most likely reflects outflow resistance or obstruction. A significant decrease in inline epidural infusion pressure was observed after epidural steroid treatment. This change in pressure may indicate efficacy from epidural steroid injection."
CD007431,0,2925709,0,Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the knee. Treatment using continuous epidural anesthesia.,"We retrospectively reviewed the cases of fourteen patients who had reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the knee. All fourteen were hospitalized, and epidural block anesthesia was instituted with an indwelling catheter for an average of four days, during which continuous passive motion, manipulation (as necessary), stimulation of muscles, and alternating hot and cold soaks were used. The average length of follow-up was thirty-two months. Eleven patients had complete resolution of the symptoms, two had sufficient intermittent aching with changes in the weather to need medication, and one had no relief. The diagnosis was confirmed if the symptoms were relieved by a lumbar sympathetic block. Pain that was out of proportion to the severity of the injury was the most consistent finding, being present in all fourteen patients. However, variation in clinical severity is characteristic of the syndrome. Eleven of the fourteen patients had had a previous patellar operation. After the onset of the symptoms, nine patients had two or more arthroscopic examinations, without notable findings. All fourteen patients had had extensive physical therapy and medical treatment before the epidural block was performed."
CD007431,0,11430790,0,Isokinetic evaluation of the ankle before and after surgical treatment of the lumbar disc herniation.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the ankle strength before and after surgical treatment for herniated lumbar intervertebral disc. DESIGN: Isokinetic test of ankle joint and statistical analysis were designed to evaluate the results before and after surgery. BACKGROUND: Assessments of the results before and after treatment of lumbar herniation of intervertebral discs (HIVD) in previous papers were all based on patients' symptoms, activity, working condition, the angle of straight leg raising test, and requirement of pain medication. We designed a prospective study of isokinetic measurement of the ankle joints in those patients with HIVD to try to find a quantitative method of evaluation. METHODS: The criteria of selecting patients were single level disc herniation of lumber spine, without associated major neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorder, normal mental status and cooperative, clinically evident radiculopathy, failure of conservative treatment, and age under 45. The isokinetic strengths of the ankle joints, of both involved and uninvolved limbs, were evaluated with plantarflexion or dorsiflexion, in the velocities of 30, 60, 120, and 180 degrees s(-1), according to their affected levels. Standard laminotomy with removal of intervertebral disc was undertaken for all patients under general anesthesia. The isokinetic strength of the ankle joints were evaluated with Kin-Com dynamometer before surgery, and post-operatively at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months, and 3 months. All data were collected and analyzed with linear mixed model for analysis of variance with repeated measures. RESULTS: From January, 1996, 5 patients entered this study, 2 patients were L4-L5 herniation, and 3 for L5-S1. The estimated mean strength ratio and standard error was 55.04 +/- 2.21% preoperatively, 46.42 +/- 2.22% postoperatively at 1 week, 64.35 +/- 2.23% postoperatively at 2 weeks, 73.93 +/- 2.23% postoperatively at 4 weeks, 100.40 +/- 2.22% postoperatively at 2 months, and 104.55 +/- 2.21% postoperatively at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary prospective study, there seems no correlation between duration of the symptoms and isokinetic strength of the ankle joint. There is, however, marked improvement of isokinetic strength of ankle joint postoperatively at 2 months, which was statistically significant."
CD007431,0,16133074,0,Intervertebral disc degeneration in relation to the COL9A3 and the IL-1ss gene polymorphisms.,"Disc degeneration is a complex condition in which environmental factors and multiple genes are expected to act together to determine the degenerative phenotype. Recently associations of COL9A2 (Trp2 allele) and COL9A3 (Trp3 allele) polymorphisms with lumbar disc disease characterized by sciatica have been reported. However, it is not known whether the Trp2 or Trp3 alleles contribute to disc degeneration (DD). In this study, the association between the collagen genes polymorphisms and lumbar DD was investigated. Furthermore, the influence of the IL-1beta(C(3954)-T) polymorphism on the association of collagen genes polymorphisms with DD was examined. Lumbar intervertebral discs of 135 middle-aged occupationally active men were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, using decreased signal intensity of the nucleus pulposus, disc bulges, and decreased disc height as signs of degeneration. Blood samples were analysed for the presence of COL9A3 and COL9A2 tryptophan alleles (Trp3 and Trp2 alleles). The COL11A2, COL2A1 and IL-1beta(C(3954)-T) polymorphisms were also analysed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis allowing for occupation and body mass index showed that the carriage of the Trp3 allele in the absence of the IL-1betaT(3954) allele increased the risk of dark nucleus pulposus (OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.3-38.8) and joint occurrence of degenerative changes (OR 8.0, 95% CI 1.4-44.7). There was no effect of the Trp3 allele on DD in the presence of the IL-1betaT(3954) allele. The carriers of the COL11A2 minor allele had an increased risk of disc bulges (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0-4.2) as compared with non-carriers. The results suggest that the effect of the COL9A3 gene polymorphism on DD might be modified by the IL-1beta gene polymorphism."

There has been no direct prospective comparison, however, between SCS and other techniques for pain management. Therefore, we have designed a prospective, randomized comparison of spinal cord stimulation and reoperation in patients with persistent radicular pain, with and without low back pain, after lumbosacral spine surgery. Patients selected for reoperation by standard criteria are randomly assigned to initial treatment by one or the other technique. The primary outcome measure is the frequency of crossover to the alternative procedure, if the results of the first have been unsatisfactory after 6 months. Results for the first 27 patients reaching the 6-month crossover point show a statistically significant (p = 0.018) advantage for spinal cord stimulation over reoperation. Many other potentially important outcome measures will now be followed long-term as a larger overall study population accumulates."

CD007431,0,11293373,0,Predicting factors of successful recovery from lumbar spine surgery among workers' compensation patients.,"It is commonly believed that patients who are compensated for a work-related injury have less incentive to return to work. This study evaluated how various factors affected the outcomes of lumbar spine surgery in terms of pain relief, functional status, return to work, and general health. Eighty-seven workers' compensation patients had spinal fusion or microdiskectomy. Subjects were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively using the Oswestry disability scale and the Visual Analog Scale for Pain. The type of surgery performed significantly affected patient outcomes, while such factors as gender, age, smoking, and litigation were insignificant. Microdiskectomy patients, for example, had greater reduction in pain and disability than did fusion patients (P < .01). Return-to-work status was negatively affected by fusion (P < .01). Overall, 55% of patients did return to work in some capacity, but the rate was 72% for microdiskectomy patients versus 43% for fusion patients. While outcomes significantly improved, postoperative scores remained severe. This did not correlate with return-to-work rates, suggesting that outcomes measures may not be effective."

CD007431,0,14526194,0,Posterior lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative disc disease using a minimally invasive B-twin expandable spinal spacer: a multicenter study.,"Acquired degenerative disc disease causes gradual disc space collapse, concurrent discogenic or facet-induced pain, and possible compression radiculopathy. Surgical treatment aims to re-expand the intervertebral space and stabilize the involved segment in balanced alignment until fusion is complete. The prevailing methods make use of a twin cage device of predetermined size. Their implantation requires extensive exposure, entailing the sacrifice of posterior stabilizing structures. The procedure also results in significant traction on the dural sac and the cauda equina and is thereby a potential source of neurologic damage. The new expandable spinal spacer (ESS) was designed to mitigate all the shortcomings alluded to above. A prospective multicenter clinical study was conducted of 87 patients with chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease, treated by posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using a newly designed ESS. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of all the participating institutions. The objective was to test the safety and efficacy of the device. Each participant was followed periodically for >1 postoperative year. The ongoing record included intraoperative difficulties and complications, if any, radiologic evidence of fusion and clinical outcome as scored by pre- and postoperative questionnaires pertaining to pain intensity and degree of disability. No dural lacerations or neurologic deficit occurred. There were no mechanical failures of the spacer. Radiologic study demonstrated fusion in all but one patient. Disc space height that averaged 7.53 +/- 2.42 mm before surgery increased to 10.03 +/- 2.00 mm at the time of surgery and stabilized at 9.47 +/- 2.10 mm upon final follow-up. Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Index decreased by 60% and 58%, respectively. PLIF using the ESS achieves the same ultimate outcome as do other methods currently in use but does not share the handicaps and hazards and is more user-friendly to the surgeon."

The aim of the study was to establish normal values for L3, L4, L5 and S1 dermatomes and to introduce this method for the neurophysiological diagnosis of chronic lumbosacral pain and disc disease. The signature areas of dermatomes in both legs separately were stimulated according to the method described by Sedgwick and Katifi (1985). DSEPs were recorded from the scalp electrodes placed at Cz', referred to Fpz. The latencies and amplitudes of consecutive components of DSEPs: N33, P40, N50, P60, N75 and side to side differences were measured and evaluated. Statistical analysis of the results revealed significant positive correlation of DSEPs latencies as a function of height. The correlation of amplitudes with height was less significant. Age, on other hand, showed only negative correlation with amplitudes of later DSEP components. On the basis of the performed analysis the latency of P40 and amplitude of P40-N50 seem to be the best parameters for the evaluation of pathological DSEPs. The range of normal value of latencies for stimulated roots should be calculated from regression equation with the subject's height. As regards amplitude, side to side mean value difference above two standard deviation appears to be more useful."
CD007431,0,14526193,0,Prospective study evaluating total disc replacement: preliminary results.,"For many years, there has been an interest in disc replacements. There are a few retrospective studies from Europe reporting promising results for these devices. The purpose of this study is to review the preliminary results of the SB Charité disc replacement device in a prospective study. The study group consists of a consecutive series of our first 57 patients who received the Link SB Charité device implanted through a mini-open anterior approach. The primary clinical indications for disc replacement were single-level symptomatic disc disease at L4-L5 or L5-S1 and no significant facet joint changes. The outcome data include the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessing pain intensity and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire. Data were collected prior to surgery and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. Twenty-four-month follow-up data are currently being collected. The mean VAS score improved 50.8% by the 6-week follow-up, and significant improvement was maintained throughout follow-up. The mean Oswestry score improved 38.7% at the 6-week follow-up, and further slight improvement was noted during the later follow-up periods. This study found that significant improvements were achieved by the 6-week postoperative visit in the pain and disability scores following disc replacement surgery. Significant improvement was maintained through the 12-month follow-up visit. Although these preliminary results are encouraging, long-term follow-up and a greater number of patients are needed to further evaluate the outcome of these devices."
CD007431,0,14526191,0,Long-term flexion-extension range of motion of the prodisc total disc replacement.,"The rationale for total disc replacement is avoidance of the junctional degeneration seen after arthrodesis by preservation of segmental motion. To justify the use of disc prostheses, it is essential to document maintained range of motion (ROM) and sagittal alignment at long-term follow-up. This is a retrospective radiographic study of 42 patients who had placement of 58 first-generation Prodisc prostheses at a mean follow-up of 8.7 years. Flexion-extension ROM was measured by Cobb's method. Junctional levels were evaluated for junctional degeneration. Pre- and postoperative global and segmental lordosis were measured. Prognostic patient factors predicting ROM of <2 degrees were evaluated. We observed ROM of at least 2 degrees in 66% of Prodisc prostheses at 8.7-year follow-up, although ROM was less than that reported in asymptomatic normal individuals. Mean ROM for disc prostheses with motion was 7.5 degrees at L3-L4, 6.2 degrees at L4-L5, and 4.1 degrees at L5-S1. Mean ROM for all prostheses was 3.8 degrees. The incidence of radiographic junctional degeneration was 24%, although no patients required surgery for symptomatic junctional degeneration. Mean ROM of prostheses below a degenerated junctional disc was 1.6 degrees compared with 4.7 degrees below a normal junctional disc (P < 0.035). Females were 3.5 times more likely to have ROM of <2 degrees. This is the longest published follow-up study of a lumbar disc replacement. The data show that ROM is preserved at long-term follow-up in the majority of patients. Global and segmental sagittal alignment improve after surgery. Furthermore, there is an association between ROM of disc prostheses and the development of junctional degeneration."

Clinical syndrome and operative experience with Cloward's technique.,"The paper gives a survey, based on literature reports and our own experiences in 59 cases. According to Kilian (1853) spondylolisthesis is defined as ventral slipping of a vertebral body together with the pedicles. In pseudospondylolisthesis (Junghanns) the whole vertebra slips ventrally. Elongation of the isthmus of the pedicle or a cleft in the interarticular portion are prerequisites for spondylolisthesis. A dysplastic origin during childhood and adolescence is assumed. The relation of males to females is 2 : 1. Evolution of spondylolisthesis occurs during childhood and adolescence. The slipping process is finished in adults. Most often the condition is encountered in the lumbar, in particular in the lumbosacral, region. A third to one half of patients with spondylolysis (5-7%) demonstrate spondylolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis is usually an accidental finding, although the condition may lead to low back pain and sciatica. The earlier symptoms arise the gloomier usually is the prognosis. Very rarely a herniated disc in the cause of symptoms. Sciatica is mostly due to irritation of a nerve root by compression on the vertebral edge. Low back pain is caused by arthrogenic, pseudoarthrotic, and spondylotic degenerative disease. Diagnosis is established by AP, lateral, and oblique X-rays, and functional investigations. Myelogram and ossovenogram demonstrate compression of caudal sac and nerve roots. Conservative treatment consists of drugs and physical therapy, and cures one fifth of the patients. The best operative results are found after decompression and stabilisation (Cloward)."

The C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known screening parameter for monitoring postoperative infectious complications in other fields. Our objective was to establish the diagnostic significance of CRP-in comparison with ESR and WBC-for monitoring infectious complications after lumbar microdiscectomy. Over a 15 months period we studied prospectively a homogeneous group of N = 400 patients with lumbar disc herniations who were operated on a single level for the first time. CRP, ESR and WBC values were determined in all patients pre-operatively, and on postoperative days 1 and 5. Clinical and laboratory findings were correlated and the diagnostic significance of CRP, ESR and WBC calculated. N = 385 (96%) patients had an uneventful postoperative course. N = 15 (4%) patients developed infectious complications, of which N = 6 (1.5%) were unrelated and N = 9 (2.5%) related to surgery. Evaluation of the laboratory values showed: The CRP baseline is a very individual value of no prognostic relevance. A high postaggression peak is typical and essential as a reference value for only the future time course will disclose any infection. We found 0% false negative and 4% false positive results on day 5. The sensitivity for serial CRP testing was calculated as 100% and specificity as 95.8%. ESR (sensitivity: 78.1%/specificity: 38.1%) and WBC (sensitivity: 21.4%/specificity: 76.8%) both failed to reach such distinct diagnostic significance on day 5. The C-reactive protein has thus proved to be a reliable, simple and economical screening test for infectious complications after lumbar microdiscectomy, superior to classical laboratory parameters."

Lassègue's manoeuvre on the affected side produced a typical radicular pain and resulted in a powerful depression of nociceptive reflexes elicited either in the normal or in the affected lower limb. Simultaneously, patients reported relief of the electrically-induced pain. In contrast, painless Lasègue's manoeuvre on the normal side had no effect on these parameters."

In 18 out of 20 patients with sciatic pain spontaneous activity was observed in the mentalis muscle. Intensification of pain caused by nerve stretching (straight-leg-raising test) evoked activity of these muscles in all studied patients and its intensity was higher. The observed reaction may be an objective evidence of suffering."
CD007431,0,11034886,0,MRI evaluation of lumbar spine flexion and extension in asymptomatic individuals.,"Flexion and extension movements or positions have been advocated in the treatment of various forms of low back dysfunction due to the potential pain relieving effects attributed to displacements of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Objective in vivo determination of the segmental behaviour of the disc to contrasting positions has until recently been difficult. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in this study to evaluate the influence of sagittal plane positions on lumbar IVD height and nucleus displacement in a small asymptomatic population.T2-weighted sagittal plane images from L1 to S1 were obtained from 10 subjects (mean age: 30+/-5 years) positioned supine in lumbar flexion, followed by extension. Changes in disc height and localization of nucleus position (determined by peak MRI signal intensity) between the two positions were calculated. Discs were classified for degenerative changes using a semi-quantitative grading scale. The mean range of lumbar sagittal movement achieved in the MRI was 44 degrees (range: 22-77 degrees ). Between flexion and extension, a significant increase in measured anterior disc height of 1.1 mm (P<0.0001) and anterior displacement of the nucleus of 6.7% (P<0.0001) was observed. Despite the anterior displacement of the nucleus in extension observed in the pooled analysis, 30% of discs did not follow this trend. Nucleus degeneration was observed in at least one disc in nine subjects and in 26% of all discs examined. Lumbar spine position was found to be associated with small measured changes in anterior disc height and nucleus position, however, this response was variable within and between individuals. The theoretical concept of a stereotypical effect of spinal position on the lumbar IVD is challenged by these initial data. Since the health of the disc is often unknown in clinical practice, manual therapy treatment for lumbar spine pain should be based on the symptomatic response to movement and position rather than biomechanical theory."
CD007431,0,3183727,0,Changes in radicular function following low-back surgery.,"Results of neurological assessment 1 year following surgical treatment of herniated lumbar intervertebral discs and lumbar stenosis are reported in 443 patients. The data were collected using separate series of questionnaires to be completed by the patient and the surgeon. Preoperatively, motor loss was reported by 12% of patients, while surgeons found motor weakness in 28%. Postoperative motor loss was still present in 24% and 25% of these cases, respectively; the operation had caused or aggravated motor loss in 5% and 3% of cases, respectively. Sensory phenomena were reported by 53% of the patients, while surgeons found sensory loss in 45%. Sensation was reported as abnormal 1 year after surgery both by patients and by surgeons in one-third of these cases. Sensory loss, considered by the patient to be caused or aggravated by operation, occurred in 15% of cases and in 12% of cases the surgeons agreed. Preoperatively, unilaterally diminished knee and Achilles tendon reflexes were found in 9% and 42%, respectively; at 1 year after surgery, these had recovered in 65% and 57% of cases, respectively. Surgery caused or aggravated unilaterally diminished knee or ankle jerks in 3% and 10% of cases, respectively."
CD007431,0,8267686,0,Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy: surgical technique and preliminary results compared to microsurgical discectomy.,"Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy is a new technique for removing ""contained"" lumbar disc herniations (those in which the outer border of the anulus fibrosus is intact) and small ""noncontained"" lumbar disc herniations (those at the level of the disc space and occupying less than one-third of the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal) through a posterolateral approach with the aid of specially developed instruments. The technique combines rigid straight, angled, and flexible forceps with automated high-power suction shaver and cutter systems. Access can thus be gained to the dorsal parts of the intervertebral space where the disc herniation is located. Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy is monitored using an endoscope angled to 70 degrees coupled with a television and video unit and is performed with the patient under local anesthesia and an anesthesiologist available if needed. Its indication is restricted to discogenic root compression with a minor neurological deficit. Two groups of patients with contained or small noncontained disc herniations were treated by either percutaneous endoscopic discectomy (20 cases) or microdiscectomy (20 cases). Both groups were investigated in a prospective randomized study in order to compare the efficacy of the two methods. The disc herniations were located at L2-3 (one patient), L3-4 (two patients), or L4-5 (37 patients). There were no significant differences between the two groups concerning age and sex distribution, preoperative evolution of complaints, prior conservative therapy, patient's occupation, preoperative disability, and clinical symptomatology. Two years after percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, sciatica had disappeared in 80% (16 of 20 patients), low-back pain in 47% (nine of 19 patients), sensory deficits in 92.3% (12 of 13 patients), and motor deficits in the one patient affected. Two years after microdiscectomy, sciatica had disappeared in 65% (13 of 20 patients), low-back pain in 25% (five of 20 patients), sensory deficits in 68.8% (11 of 16 patients), and motor deficits in all patients so affected. Only 72.2% of the patients in the microdiscectomy group had returned to their previous occupation versus 95% in the percutaneous endoscopic discectomy group. Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy appears to offer an alternative to microdiscectomy for patients with ""contained"" and small subligamentous lumbar disc herniations."
CD007431,0,15906040,0,"Upright, weight-bearing, dynamic-kinetic MRI of the spine: initial results.","The potential relative beneficial aspects of upright, weight-bearing (pMRI), dynamic-kinetic (kMRI) spinal imaging over that of recumbent MRI (rMRI) include the revelation of occult spinal disease dependent on true axial loading, the unmasking of kinetic-dependent spinal disease and the ability to scan the patient in the position of clinically relevant signs and symptoms. This imaging unit under study also demonstrated low claustrophobic potential and yielded comparatively high resolution images with little motion/magnetic susceptibility/chemical shift artifact. Overall, it was found that rMRI underestimated the presence and maximum degree of gravity-dependent spinal pathology and missed altogether pathology of a dynamic nature, factors that are optimally revealed with p/kMRI. Furthermore, p/kMRI enabled optimal linkage of the patient's clinical syndrome with the medical imaging abnormality responsible for the clinical presentation, thereby allowing for the first time an improvement at once in both imaging sensitivity and specificity."

Statistically significant differences in the disc angle of the involved spinal segment were found between the two test groups. Both groups also contrasted significantly with asymptomatic controls. There also appears to be distinct postural complexes associated with these syndromes, although it is not clear if these postural changes were secondary processes such as antalgia, or primary and possibly predisposing."
CD007431,0,1270487,0,Infection of intervertebral discs after operation.,"Infection of the intervertebral space is a rare complication of operation on the disc (Ford and Key 1955). It occurred in five cases in a series of 650 operations for lumbar disc protrusion done by two of the authors of this paper--an incidence of 0-8%. Symptoms began between seven and twelve days after operation. After initial relief of the original sciatic pain, the patients developed severe back pain and muscle cramps in the legs. Straight-leg raising became much more limited than before operation. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was raised in all cases. The diagnosis was confirmed by rescreening the Myodil, when an indentation was seen opposite the intervertebral space from which the disc had been excised. Early removal of infected material from the disc space resulted in complete relief of pain and cure of the infection."

This investigation employs history, physical examination, imaging studies, and electrodiagnostic medicine evaluations to clearly define unilateral/unilevel L5 or S1 nerve root compromise. Inclusion criteria require all of the preceding diagnostic methods to corroborate a specific nerve root lesion. Regression equation analysis for cortical P1 latencies evaluating age and height based on comparable patient and control reference populations reveals segmental and dermatomal sensitivities for L5 radiculopathies to be 70% and 50%, respectively, at 90% confidence intervals. Similar sensitivities are obtained for 2 standard deviation mean cortical P1 latencies. Side-to-side cortical P1 latency difference data reveal segmental and dermatomal sensitivities for S1 radiculopathies to be 50% and 10%, respectively, at two standard deviations. The clinical utility of both segmental and dermatomal SEPs are questionable in patients with known unilateral/unilevel L5 and S1 nerve root compromise."

CD007431,0,14733958,0,Congenital form of spinal muscular atrophy predominantly affecting the lower limbs: a clinical and muscle MRI study.,"We describe clinical and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 11 cases (three familial and eight sporadic) with the form of spinal muscular atrophy characterised by predominant involvement of the lower limbs with weakness of the proximal and distal muscles and marked atrophy of the distal leg and foot muscles. All patients presented at birth with talipes, which were in extension in seven of the 11. Arm muscle and function were preserved and lower limbs appeared to be disproportionately shorter compared to trunk and upper limbs. Functional abilities were markedly affected and only one of the 11 is able to walk independently for long distances, while six require support of crutches and two use callipers for walking. One child lost ambulation following a fall. The course of the disease is relatively stable and the progression of disability appeared to be related mostly to increased contractures rather than to loss of muscle strength. Respiratory and cardiac function were well preserved. A neurogenic disorder was suggested by electromyography and/or muscle biopsy in all patients, while motor nerve conduction was consistently normal. Muscle MRI of the thighs revealed diffuse atrophic appearance with relative hypertrophy of the adductor longus and of the semitendinosus. Genetic studies excluded the involvement of the survival motor neuron gene but none of these families was sufficiently informative to study linkage to the locus on chromosome 12q23-q24 previously found to be involved in patients with similar phenotype. In our experience this form of spinal muscular atrophy affecting predominantly the lower limbs is a relatively common form and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infants with talipes and weakness in the lower limbs. The identical clinical and imaging features of the sporadic and familial cases suggest that these cases are likely to be affected by the same condition."

In most cases clinical symptoms are different from those of disc herniation. Myelography with ""amipaque"" appears necessary to allow a really planified operation, with liberation of all the roots involved by bony compression. In these conditions, a high percentage of good results is obtained. Consequently, after failure of conservative treatment, open release of the compression is advisable, even in elderly patients. In some cases postero-lateral fusion should be performed in addition."

Key to assessing the interest in this new motion technique is evaluating the results in terms of functional and radiologic outcomes. This prospective study reports the outcome of 64 Maverick devices implanted between January 2002 and November 2003. The degree of improvement was equivalent to that obtained with anterior fusion cages using the mini-invasive technique. Radiographic follow-up in this series showed a degree of mobility close to normal. The technique is safe because the intra- and postoperative complication rate is low. The Oswestry score improved for 75% of patients. This improvement is significantly correlated with facet arthrosis and muscle fatty degeneration.

An increase in right atrial filling pressure reflected in elevated paraspinal venous volumes within the reduced confines of a stenotic lumbar spine has been cited as the cause of this syndrome. Six cases of concomitant nocturnal calf cramps and fasciculations associated with the night pain and paresthesias are reported. In all cases a reduction in cardiopulmonary compliance was noted, with clinical and electromyographic evidence of paraspinal and lower extremity fasciculations increasing at night. Symptoms were relieved by assuming an erect or semi-reclining sleep position. In five of the six reported cases of lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis was also present. The motor equivalent of Vesper's curse was evaluated by electromography, evoked potentials, CAT scan, and myelography.

CD007431,0,10398990,0,Long-term outcome of patients suffering from clinical instability after microsurgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation.,"A total of 39 patients suffering from clinical instability of the lumbar spine after microdiscectomy were evaluated for their long-term outcome. Included there were 21 (54%) male and 18 (46%) female patients with a mean age of 55 years. All had been operated on for a virgin single-level lumbar disc herniation between the years 1985-1989 and they were evaluated for the presence of lumbar instability in 1991. Clinical signs and symptoms of segmental instability were then detected in all patients, with the symptom of ""apprehension"" positive in 30. During the follow-up, 2 (5%) patients had been treated by lumbar spondylodesis. At the time of the present investigation, both of them gave the information that their low back pain and sciatica had diminished as compared to the prediscectomy situation; both were retired. The symptom of ""apprehension"" was negative in both. Of the remaining 37 patients, low back pain had completely recovered in 4 (11%) and diminished in 23 (62%) patients, while in 9 (24%) patients, back pain had remained unchanged and become worse in 1 (3%). Further, sciatica had completely recovered in 4 (11%) and diminished in 23 (62%) patients, while in 7 (19%) patients, sciatica had remained unchanged and become worse in 3 (8%). Only 14 (38%) of these patients were able to work. However, evaluated by the Oswestry Index, the overall outcome in daily activities had significantly improved in all 37 patients since 1991 (p = 0.01). The symptom of ""apprehension"" was now positive in 26 patients. A significant correlation was observed between the positivity of this test and the persistence of low back pain (p = 0.02) and a poor outcome in daily activities (p < 0.0001). Comfirming earlier observations, the findings of this study support the concept that patients with postoperative lumbar instability have a poor prognosis.

CD007431,0,7603590,0,Serial MRI in the early postoperative period after lumbar discectomy.,"The aim of this study was to determine MRI findings in patients successfully operated upon for lumbar disc herniation. We investigated 20 patients with a successful outcome after L4-5 or L5-S1 disc operations clinically and with MRI preoperatively, and at 5 days, 6 weeks, and 4 months after surgery. Postoperatively, T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained. At 4 months gadolinium-enhanced images were added. Pronounced intraspinal MRI changes were seen during follow-up. Deformation of the dural sac was seen in 13 patients preoperatively, in 19 at 5 days after operation, in 15 at 6 weeks, and in 12 at 4 months. Nerve root involvement was seen in all cases both preoperatively and at 5 days after operation, in 17 at 6 weeks, and in 15 at 4 months. No correlation between symptoms or the straight leg raising test and the size or nature of the abnormal tissue in the spinal canal postoperatively could be demonstrated. It was concluded that early postoperative MRI after lumbar discectomy must be interpreted carefully, and that oedema and scar formation are probable reasons for difficulties in interpretation."
CD007431,0,10552236,0,Diagnostic value of history and physical examination in patients suspected of sciatica due to disc herniation: a systematic review.,"We conducted a systematic review of the literature from 1965-1994 to assess the value of history and physical examination in the diagnosis of sciatica due to disc herniation; we also included population characteristics and features of the study design affecting diagnostic value. Studies on the diagnostic value of history and physical examination in the diagnosis of sciatica due to disc herniation are subject to important biases, and information on numerous signs and symptoms is scarce or absent. Our search revealed 37 studies meeting the selection criteria; these were systematically and independently read by three readers to determine diagnostic test properties using a standard scoring list to determine the methodological quality of the diagnostic information. A meta-analysis was performed when study results allowed statistical pooling. Few studies investigated the value of the history. Pain distribution seemed to be the only useful history item. Of the physical examination signs the straight leg raising test was the only sign consistently reported to be sensitive for sciatica due to disc herniation. However, the sensitivity values varied greatly, the pooled sensitivity and specificity values being 0.85 and 0.52, respectively. The crossed straight leg raising test was the only sign shown to be specific; the pooled sensitivity and specificity values were 0.30 and 0.84, respectively. There was considerable disagreement on the specificity of the other neurological signs (paresis, sensory loss, reflex loss). Several types of bias and other methodological drawbacks were encountered in the studies limiting the validity of the study results. As a result of these drawbacks it is probable that test sensitivity was overestimated and test specificity underestimated."
CD007431,0,9546444,0,Microsurgical excision of lateral lumbar disc herniation through an interlaminar approach.,"We made a prospective study of 43 consecutive patients treated for intraforaminal (34) or extraforaminal (9) herniations of a lumbar disc by excision through an interlaminar approach, using an operating microscope. The intraforaminal herniations were contained or extruded in 52% and sequestrated in 47%; for extraforaminal herniation the proportions were 66% and 33%, respectively. There was additional posterolateral protrusion or spinal stenosis at the level of the lateral herniation in seven and four cases, respectively. The patients were reviewed at three months and two years after surgery. Radiographs showed three grades of facetectomy: grade I, removal of 50% or less, grade II, excision of 51% to 75%, and grade III, subtotal or total facetectomy. For intraforaminal herniations the results were excellent or good in 88% of patients when reviewed at three months and in 91% at two years. For extraforaminal herniations, there was an excellent or good outcome in 89% of patients in the short term and in all in the long term. The facetectomy had been grade I in 14 and grade II in 25; it had been grade III in four, but only one had had total facetectomy. No patient had developed vertebral hypermobility as a result of the operation. An intralaminar approach using an operating microscope can provide adequate access to a lateral protrusion. It has the advantage of allowing the treatment of posterolateral protrusion or posterior annular bulge and of spinal stenosis at the same level."
CD007431,0,8423717,0,Effectiveness of the Short TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence in MR imaging of intramedullary spinal lesions.,"A Short TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence with spin-echo data collection was compared to a conventional cardiac gated long TR spin-echo (SE) sequence for detecting intramedullary signal abnormalities. The cervical (n = 48), cervico-thoracic (n = 1), and thoraco-lumbar (n = 18) spinal cord was imaged in a sagittal plane with a 0.5 T (n = 61) or 1.5 T (n = 6) MRI unit in 67 patients with clinical evidence of myelopathy of different etiologies (e.g., multiple sclerosis, trauma, herniated intervertebral disk, spondylosis, etc.). In all patients, ungated double or quadruple echo STIR images (TR 1000-1400 msec, TI 100 msec, TE 30-60 or 30-60-90-120 msec) were compared with cardiac gated long TR (1400-2100 msec), double echo (30-100, 50-100, or 50-150 msec) SE images with first order flow compensation for the second echo. Although STIR images appeared ""noisier"" than long TR SE images, they showed fewer ghost artifacts. In 55 patients, single or multiple, focal or diffuse, hyperintense areas within the spinal cord were observed on both long TR SE and (magnitude reconstructed) STIR images. Lesion conspicuity was better on the STIR images in 25 patients, better on the SE images in 14 patients, and equal in 16. STIR sequence provides a valuable alternative to gated long TR SE sequence for the MRI investigation of intramedullary spinal lesions."

All patients were operated upon according to the clinical findings, and the surgical results were used as the final diagnosis. In six patients a new disc herniation was detected. In the remaining cases surgery revealed either scar tissue or nothing to explain the recurrence of the symptoms. The three imaging modalities were analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.68 for MRI, 0.83 for CT, and 0.43 for myelography. The difference in areas between CT and myelography was significant (p less than 0.05). The results indicate that CT has the highest predictive value for demonstrating the recurrence of a lumbar disc herniation."

A prospective two-year evaluation.,"In a prospective, consecutive study 93 patients who had had previous lumbar spinal surgery underwent repeat decompression for persistent or recurrent back and leg pain. The previous operations had been discectomies in 65 patients and decompression for spinal stenosis in 28; two of the latter group had also had posterolateral fusion. At the repeat operation, disc herniation was found in 19 patients, lateral spinal stenosis in 19, central spinal stenosis in 20 and periradicular fibrosis in 35. Ninety-one patients were followed up for two years after surgery; the effect of the operation was recorded using a four-scale grading system. The results were significantly related to the diagnosis. Nerve-root compression due to recurrent disc herniation or to bony compression responded well to repeat decompression. In patients with a single nerve-root compression the results were similar to those obtained in primary operations. Sciatica due to nerve-root scarring was seldom improved by the repeat operation."
CD007431,0,11680522,0,A prospective randomized controlled study of VAX-D and TENS for the treatment of chronic low back pain.,"Low back pain is one of the most significant medical and socioeconomic problems in modern society. International guidelines call for evidence-based management for the pain and disability associated with musculoskeletal disorders. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to address the question of efficacy and appropriateness of vertebral axial decompression (VAX-D) therapy, a new technology that has been shown in clinical research to create negative intradiscal pressures, and has been shown to be effective in treating patients presenting with chronic low back pain (> 3 months duration) with associated leg pain. Successful outcome was defined as a 50% reduction in pain utilizing a 10 cm Visual Analog Pain Scale and an improvement in the level of functioning as measured by patient-nominated disability ratings. Patients were randomly assigned to VAX-D or to TENS which was used as a control treatment or placebo. The TENS treatment demonstrated a success rate of 0%, while VAX-D demonstrated a success rate of 68.4% (p < 0.001). A statistically significant reduction in pain and improvement in functional outcome was obtained in patients with chronic low back pain treated with VAX-D."

CD007431,0,8381518,0,The value of magnetic stimulation in the diagnosis of radiculopathies.,"We studied 42 patients with cervical and lumbar radiculopathies using magnetic stimulation. Prolonged latencies following magnetic stimulation of the brain, the paravertebral spinal nerve, or both, showed a highly significant correlation with muscle weakness in clinical testing (24 of 26 patients with weakness had pathological motor evoked potentials) as well as with spontaneous activity of the target muscles in needle electromyography (24 of 25 subjects). The determination of both the central and the peripheral motor conduction time was found to be essential in patients with radiculopathies, because different patterns of latency changes correlated with different morphological results in computed tomography: in patients diagnosed as having a lateral compression of the nerve root the peripheral nerve latency was delayed; whereas, in patients with more medially localized herniations, a prolonged central motor latency was the most frequent finding. This study posits that combined magnetic stimulation of the brain and nerve root is an effective and painless technique for the noninvasive evaluation of nerve root function."

Such changes may for the first time present a biologic or biochemical basis for the development of sciatica. Disk-related cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have been found to mediate such changes, and clinical trials have now been initiated to assess the possibility of treating sciatica with selective inhibition of TNF."

CD007431,0,128126,0,Clinical and electromyographic evaluation after chemonucleolysis for lumbar disk disease.,"Results in 200 patients with lumbar disk disease who had chemonucleolysis were evaluated by two means. First, the surgeon evaluated the patients clinically from 6 to 30 months after chemonucleolysis by rating each case as excellent, good, fair, or unimproved. Results were judged excellent or good in 91% of the 153 ""clean"" cases (without previous operation) and in 53% of the 36 with previous operation; 11 patients were lost to follow-up. No patients were clinically worse than before treatment. Scond, a physiatrist did a repeat electromyogram three months or longer after chemonucleolysis. He judged a patient improved if there was a decrease or disappearance of the positive waves and/or fibrillation potentials noted on initial electromyogram. Based on these objective findings, 90.5% of ""clean"" cases and 85.4% overall showed improvement. Surgeons' clinical evaluations and the independent physiatrical evaluations based on objective electromyographic findings thus correlated closely."

Data was collected from twenty-two medical centers for patients who received VAX-D therapy for low back pain, which was sometimes accompanied by referred leg pain. Only patients who received at least ten sessions and had a diagnosis of herniated disc, degenerative disc, or facet syndrome, which were confirmed by diagnostic imaging, were included in this study; a total of 778 cases. The average time between the initial onset of symptoms and the beginning of this therapy was 40 months, and it was four months or more in 83% of the cases. The data contained the patients' quantitative assessments of their own pain, mobility, and ability to carry out the usual 'activities of daily living'. The treatment was successful in 71% of the 778 cases, when success was defined as a reduction in pain to 0 or 1, on a 0 to 5 scale. Improvements in mobility and activities of daily living correlated strongly with pain reduction. The causes of back pain and their relationship to this therapy are also discussed."

On admission, all patients were interviewed, and pain at rest, at night and on coughing was recorded. Walking capacity was recorded under four categories: > 5 km, 1-5 km, 0.5-1 km and < 0.5 km. Results of the SLR test were also registered as category data: positive 0-30 degrees, positive 30-60 degrees, positive > 60 degrees or negative. Findings from examination of tendon reflexes and power of the extensor hallucis longus (EHL) muscle were registered, as were sensory disturbances. The above mentioned parameters were analysed separately for five different age groups: 20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years and above 60 years of age. There was an age-related change in the prevalence of certain parameters. Highly restricted positive SLR test results and pain on coughing was most commonly found in the youngest patient group. With increasing age there was a decreasing prevalence of highly restricted positive SLR test results, while the prevalence of severe reduction of walking capacity increased. In short, the youngest patient group showed the most obvious clinical picture of disc herniation and, with increasing age, the clinical picture gradually changed towards the picture associated with spinal stenosis."
CD007431,0,7586844,0,Pain and pathology in lumbar disc hernia.,"The authors analyzed pain drawings of patients having lumbar disc surgery and tried to correlate pain pattern to disc pathology and level. Preoperatively, patients having spinal surgery were asked to draw on a standardized form the localization, postural variation, and modality of their pain. In this study, 185 consecutive patients with unilateral and unisegmental L4-L5 and L5-S1 hernias were analyzed. The pain drawings were coded and read blindly; each drawing was divided operationally into anatomic areas, and the type of pain symbol in each pixel was recorded, digitized, and analyzed by stepwise discriminant analysis. For predicting the level of the lesion, the most important variables were pain on the anterolateral aspect of the leg (L4-L5) and pain radiating to the posterior aspect of the foot (L5-S1). For predicting the grade of herniation, the most discriminative factors were pain radiating to the foot (sequestrated hernia) and bilateral back pain (protruded hernia). Pain drawing facilities communication and documentation. In addition, it is an aid to diagnose the level and degree of the hernia, and therefore is useful for selecting patients who might benefit from disc surgery. For scientific purposes, data are digitized easily, allowing analyses of large populations."

Included were 99 (52%) men and 91 (48%) women with a mean age of 42 years. During the observation period, sciatica had completely recovered or markedly diminished in 172 (90%) patients, and 142 (75%) patients had returned to work. However, as many as 29% of the patients occasionally suffered from low back pain. Clinical examination revealed various signs and symptoms of segmental instability of the lumbar spine in 22% of the surgical patients. There was a significant association between postoperative instability and unsatisfactory long-term outcome: of the 42 patients with instability, 62% suffered from low back pain and 45% were on sick leave or retired because of the back, while the corresponding numbers for those patients without instability were 20% and 8%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the mean value of the Oswestry index in instability patients was as high as 34% (SD 12), indicating moderate disability, whereas a significantly (p = 0.0001) lower Oswestry Index 16% (SD 13), indicating minimal disability, was detected in patients without instability."

It was found that only lumbar phlebography was more accurate than the most simple procedure, the clinical examination. Myelography is more accurate than clinical examination only in making a positive diagnosis. In this case, it equals the reliability of lumbar phlebography, but so does plain film radiography which however leads to a positive diagnosis less constantly. Lumbar phlebography is the most accurate procedure for making a negative diagnosis, mainly by avoiding a false negative conclusion. A comparison is made with the statements in the literature and the complementary use of the different procedures is proposed for the investigation of low back pain and sciatica."

The beds employed were an ""orthopedic"" hard bed with 720 reinforced coils and a built-in bed board, a softer 500 coil bed, a standard 10 in. thick waterbed, and a hybrid bed of foam and water. Subjectively the majority of patients preferred the hard bed and felt that their back pain improved to a greater extent after 2 weeks on the hard bed as compared to the other beds. The next largest group of patients to show improvement used the waterbed. Limitations in performing the straight leg raising test coincided with the subjective complaints. Significantly improved straight leg raising was observed after use of the hard bed or waterbed in 25% of the patients using those beds. No other objective signs were altered. The 500 coil bed and the hybrid bed proved of no benefit to any patient in this study group. This limited study indicates that hard beds should remain the first choice of patients with chronic low back pain. However, if relief is not obtained for these chronic pain patients, a trial on a waterbed may prove beneficial."

Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) of the lower back and low-back pain were examined in 52 patients (13 of 52 presenting sciatic scoliosis) with lumbar disc herniation who complained of radicular pain and in 15 normal subjects. PPTs were measured at five points bilaterally using an electronic pressure algometer. Low-back pain was evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings. All patients complained of radicular leg pain and were divided into the following three groups according to the presence of and the region of low-back pain: no low-back pain group, low-back pain with no laterality group, and low-back pain dominantly on the herniation side group; the VAS rating on the side ipsilateral to the herniation side was higher than that on the contralateral side. In the normal subjects, there were no statistically significant differences between sides in mean PPTs at all sites examined. PPTs were not lower in the spasmodic side (concave side) than the convex side in patients with sciatic scoliosis. PPTs on the herniation side were significantly lower than those on the contralateral side in patients with low-back pain dominantly on the herniation side. Furthermore, the areas of low PPTs were beyond the innervation area of dorsal ramus of L5 and S1 nerve root. It was considered that not only the peripheral mechanisms but also the hyper excitability of the central nervous system might contribute in lowering PPTs of the lower back on the herniation side."

The authors defined these neurological deficits as ""skip lesions"", and reviewed the neurological deficits in tethered cord syndrome. Among 29 cases, inconsecutive segmental motor weakness in 3 cases, inconsecutive segmental sensory impairment in 6 cases, positive Babinski reflex in 8 cases, supranuclear neurogenic bladder in 3 cases and lumbago or leg pain in 4 cases were observed and they were thought to be compatible with the neurological deficits called ""skip lesions"". The basic mechanism of this sign is that the cephalic portion of the spinal cord is functionally impaired during flexion of the lumbosacral spine, while the caudal spinal cord with decreased visco-elasticity dose not elongate. Inconsecutive motor-sensory disturbance, accelerated deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, positive Babinski or other pathological reflexes in the lower extremities, uninhibited neurogenic bladder, lumbago and pain in the legs were considered to belong to the category of ""skip lesions"" and they can be treated by the untethering procedure. The authors concluded that preoperative careful insight into the mechanism of ""skip lesions"" revealed surgical efficacy for the reversible neurological deficits by the untethering procedure, or the efficacy of decompression of the lipoma or neurolysis around the involved spinal nerve roots."

The studies demonstrated that oil and gaslike contrast substances penetrate into the vein and create a threat of embolia formation. For epidurography the most acceptable are water-soluble contrast substances. The method of an ascending verografin epidurography was elaborated and used in clinical practice. Some indications and contraindications for epidurography are outlined. A group of 396 patients with osteochondrosis of the lumbar part of the spine was examined. The method allowed a topic diagnosis of the disc hernia not only along the spine, but in the cross-section of the motor segments (median, paramedian and lateral hernias). The studies make it possible to exclude a disc prolapse in a nonhernial form of osteochondrosis. In 32 patients with spinal tumors epidurography permitted to determine the initial growth of the tumor, its size and relation to the dura mater."

The improved postoperatively in radicular sheath was 67% of the cases of disc herniation, 60% of spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, and 36% of degenerative spondylolisthesis. Postoperatively, no abnormal findings of dural tube were observed in the lateral view in 80% of the cases of disc herniation, and 78% of those of spondylolytic spondylolisthesis.

This study includes 20 consecutive patients with a contained lumbar disc herniation. Sequential MRI were performed immediately before and after surgery, on the day of surgery, and 6 weeks after surgery. The development of pain, nerve root tension sign (SLR), and neurological findings were analyzed, as was the need for subsequent open surgery. There was no significant difference in the maximum protrusion of the disc herniation between the three measurements. The sciatic pain improved significantly on the first day after surgery but not at 1 week or 6 weeks after surgery. The SLR was reduced significantly after surgery and at 1 and 6 weeks after surgery. There was no correlation between the MRI findings and the early clinical outcome. Seven patients needed subsequent open surgery. The findings indicate that the effect of APLD is not mediated by reducing the size of the disc herniation. In this small series of patients, APLD was ineffective in the treatment of a contained lumbar disc herniation. There was no correlation between the MRI findings and the early clinical outcome."

The main aim of the present study of false positive P1 latency prolongation in lumbosacral sensory nerve SEP was to investigate whether elicitation of such symptoms secures adequate sensory nerve stimulation. Nerve roots were studied on the asymptomatic side in 64 patients with unilateral sciatica. Saphenous (L4), superficial peroneal (L5), and sural (S1) nerve SEP were registered in all patients. Pretibial dermatomal SEP were registered in ten of them. Stimulation was equidistant from the registration electrode in all SEP registrations. The false positive rate was lower in saphenous nerve SEP with than without verified supramaximal stimulation (1/30 vs. 6/22, P = 0.03) in spite of radiating stimulus-related sensory symptoms in both groups. This difference was not caused by subclinical myelographic nerve root compression or general peripheral nerve dysfunction. The P1 latency was longer in the pretibial dermatomal SEP than in the saphenous and superficial peroneal nerve SEP with the same conduction distance (mean difference 4.7 (95% CI = 3.8 to 5.6) and 4.4 ms (95% CI = 3.4 to 5.4), respectively). It is concluded that dermatomal SEP have longer P1 latency than sensory nerve SEP. Verified supramaximal nerve simulation is recommended to avoid false results due to admixture of dermatomal to sensory nerve SEP."

The findings by venography and by myelography were compared with those revealed by operative exploration. Only sixty-one patients had venography, myelography, and operative exploration. In fifty of these patients with no previous disc surgery, the diagnostic accuracy of venography was 98 per cent and of myelography, 90 per cent. Venography had limited value in the other eleven patients who had had one or more prior disc operations because it did not distinguish between scarring and recurrent disc herniation at the levels previously explored. Selctive ascending lumbosacral venography is indicated both in patients who have not had a prior disc operation, as a guide to whether myelography should be performed when the clinical picture is ambiguous, and in patients whose myelogram is normal or equivocal but whose signs and symptoms are strongly suggestive of disc herniation."

To gain an understanding of the underlying mechanisms, this study questioned whether muscle strength was related to task performance and low back load in nursing tasks. Trunk extension, elbow flexion and knee extension strength were therefore measured in 17 nurses. The independent effects of muscle strength on task duration, jerkiness of effort and L5-S1 torque were investigated as the nurses performed several patient handling tasks. Despite a large variation in muscle strength within the subject population, no effect of strength on task duration, jerkiness or L5-S1 torques was observed. In conclusion, poor muscle strength was found not to be related to increased low back load. If 'weaker' nurses were to be at a higher risk, it would be due to a reduced capability to withstand the mechanical load, rather than to an increased mechanical load."

CD007431,0,1345657,0,[MRI and computerized tomography in the evaluation of lumbar spine after herniated disk surgery].,The authors analyze the results of comprehensive radio-diagnosis in 44 patients previously operated on for lumbar hernias. All the findings of magnetic resonance tomography and computer-aided tomography were divided into 3 groups: (1) natural consequences of a surgical intervention without clinical manifestations; (2) complications after a surgical intervention; (3) recurrent hernias or hernias on an adjacent level. The most intricate problem was the differential diagnosis between a recurrent hernia and a postoperative epidural cicatrix. Criteria to distinguish between these two conditions are suggested. The authors emphasize that the optimal variant for examination of the patients operated on is a combination of magnetic resonance tomography and computer-aided tomography.
CD007431,0,6449823,0,Bone scanning in lumbar disc herniation.,"99m technetium methylene diphosphate was used for whole body scanning and linear multiplane tomoscanning in 10 patients with typical clinical symptoms of prolapsed disc, in order to investigate whether there would be an increased focal accumulation corresponding to the bone structures adjacent to the affected disc. The diagnosis of a prolapsed disc was confined by amipaque myelography, carried out in 9 patients, and finally verified at operation. In none of the 10 cases could accumulation of radioactivity in the bony structures of the affected lumar segment be demonstrated. Consequently this method has not been adopted for the diagnosis of prolapsed lumbar discs. However it was demonstrated that 99m technetium methylene diphosphate scintillography is useful in the differential diagnosis of anchylosing spondylitis and discitis."

We hypothesise that the electrophysiological recordings, especially SSEP, indicate a lumbar nerve involvement that is complementary to the neurological examination and can provide confirmatory information in less obvious clinical cases. In a prospective cohort study, 54 patients scheduled for surgery due to LSS were enrolled in an unmasked, uncontrolled trial. All patients were assessed by neurological examination, electrophysiological recordings, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine. The electrophysiological recordings focused on spinal lumbar nerve involvement."
CD007431,0,9582228,0,Facilitation of a nociceptive flexion reflex in man by nonnoxious radiant heat produced by a laser.,"Electromyographic recordings were made in healthy volunteers from the knee-flexor biceps femoris muscle of the nociceptive RIII reflex elicited by electrical stimulation of the cutaneous sural nerve. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce a moderate pricking-pain sensation. The test responses were conditioned by a nonnoxious thermal (</=40 degrees C) stimulus applied to the receptive field of the sural nerve. This stimulus was delivered by a CO2 laser stimulator and consisted of a 100-ms pulse of heat with a beam diameter of 20 mm. Its power was 22.7 +/- 4.2 W (7.2 mJ/mm2), and it produced a sensation of warmth. The maximum surface temperature reached at the end of the period of stimulation was calculated to be 7 degrees C above the actual reference temperature of the skin (32 degrees C). The interval between the laser (conditioning) and electrical (test) stimuli was varied from 50 to 3, 000 ms in steps of 50 ms. It was found that the nociceptive flexion reflex was facilitated by the thermal stimulus; this modulation occurred with particular conditioning-test intervals, which peaked at 500 and 1,100 ms with an additional late, long-lasting phase between 1,600 and 2,300 ms. It was calculated that the conduction velocities of the cutaneous afferent fibers responsible for facilitating the RIII reflex, fell into three ranges: one corresponding to A delta fibers (3.2 m/s) and two in the C fiber range (1.3 and 0.7 m/s). It is concluded that information emanating from warm receptors and nociceptors converges. In this respect, the present data show, for the first time, that in man, conditioning nonnociceptive warm thermoreceptive A delta and C fibers results in an interaction at the spinal level with a nociceptive reflex. This interaction may constitute a useful means whereby signals add together to trigger flexion reflexes in defensive reactions and other basic motor behaviors. It also may contribute to hyperalgesia in inflammatory processes. The methodology used in this study appears to be a useful noninvasive tool for exploring the thermoalgesic mechanisms in both experimental and clinical situations."
CD007431,0,8184498,0,[Postoperative rehabilitation of patients operated for lumbar disk prolapse. An analysis of the socioeconomic consequences].,"A new postoperative rehabilitation program consisting of intensive back training without low back pain being the limiting factor has been tested in a clinical trial and found effective compared to a more traditional training program. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the social economic consequences (cost-effectiveness analysis) of the introduction of this new program as a general offer for all patients undergoing first time discectomy for a herniated lumbar intervertebral disc in Denmark. Ninety-six consecutive patients operated on at the Dept. of Neurosurgery. Copenhagen County Hospital of Glostrup were randomized into two intervention groups. One group was offered intensive back training and the other group was offered traditional back training. A historical control group was also selected. The effectiveness of the training programmes was evaluated by a ""Low Back Pain Rating Scale"" and by the number of patients out of employment one year after operation. The social economic evaluation showed that the new intensive training programme was more effective. Savings in medical expenditure are to be expected if the new programme is offered. Further, as more people are to be expected to keep their employment, a production gain for the society can be expected as well as reduced public expenditures on social benefits."

CD007431,0,12691388,0,A new endoscopic technique to decompress lumbar nerve roots affected by spondylolysis. Technical note.,"The authors describe a new endoscopic technique to decompress lumbar nerve roots affected by spondylolysis. Short-term clinical outcome was evaluated. Surgery-related indications were: 1) radiculopathy without low-back pain; 2) no spinal instability demonstrated on dynamic radiographs; and 3) age older than 40 years. Seven patients, four men and three women, fulfilled these criteria and underwent endoscopic decompressive surgery. Their mean age was 60.9 years (range 42-70 years). No subluxation was present in four patients, whereas Meyerding Grade I slippage was demonstrated in three. For endoscopic decompression, a skin incision of 16 to 18 mm in length was made, and fenestration was performed to identify the affected nerve root. The proximal stump of the ragged edge of the spondylotic lesion, and the fibrocartilaginous mass compressing the nerve root were removed. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 22 months (mean 11.7 months). Clinical outcome was evaluated using Gill criteria; in three patients the outcome was excellent, and in four it was good. This new endoscopic technique was useful in the decompression of nerve roots affected by spondylolysis, the technique was minimally invasive, and the clinical results were acceptable."

Seven patients (18.4%) had occipital neuralgia in accordance with the IHS criteria and 16 (42.1%) if the IASP criteria were used. Four patients (10.5%) had oromandibular dysfunction, 20 (52.6%) had periarticular shoulder disorder, and 12 (31.6%) had thoracic outlet syndrome. Five (13.2%) had chronic mechanical low back pain and two (5.3%) segmental instability of the lumbar spine. Four (10.5%) had symptoms concurring with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.

CD007431,0,2746269,0,Magnetic stimulation in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy.,Five patients presenting with sensory-motor disturbances consistent with a clinical diagnosis of L5 or S1 radiculopathy were studied. All had conventional nerve conduction tests and electromyography. The lumbosacral roots were stimulated in the lumbosacral region by using the Cadwell MES-10 Magneto-electric stimulator. The compound muscle action potentials were recorded bilaterally by surface electrodes applied to the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles. The latencies to the affected muscles were significantly prolonged. The appropriate root dysfunction was confirmed at operation or by the imaging techniques. It was concluded that surface stimulation of the lumbosacral roots by a magnetic coil is a potentially useful technique for the non-invasive evaluation of the function of the lumbosacral roots.
CD007431,0,18340368,0,Surgical treatment of isthmic spondylolisthesis with radicular pain in adults.,"A common consensus has not yet been reached on surgical management of isthmic Spondylolisthesis especially regarding the optimal surgical procedure. This prospective study was carried to see the outcome of Posterolateral fusion with instrumentation without decompression. Eight consecutive patients, aged between 43 to 55 years, underwent primary surgery for isolated L4, L5 lumbar isthmic Spondylolisthesis of less than grade II that presented with radicular pain and exhibited instability on dynamic radiograph. The surgical procedure consisted of instrumentation with pedicle screws and rods (Moss Miami System) and posterolateral fusion in situ by placement of autogeneous bone graft, harvested from posterior iliac crest. Postoperatively Clinical and Radiological status were assessed and were graded according to Stauffer and Coventry method. The patients were followed up for one to three years. Radiological evidence of fusion was clearly evident by six months in all cases. Symptomatically all were relieved of radicular pain completely. One patient had recurrent backache due to causes unrelated to the illness of surgical procedure requiring occasional analgesic. No serious complication was encountered. This lead to conclusion that in adults of our population with low grade isthmic spondylolisthesis and radicular pain Instrumentation with Posterolateral fusion without decompression was sufficient to relieve symptoms."
CD007431,0,158315,0,Normative data on low back mobility and activity levels. Implications for neuromuscular reeducation.,"Low back mobility and electromyographic movements were performed in 121 normal subjects, grouped by age and sex. Women tended to show greater ranges of motion for straight leg raising, trunk rotation and lateral bending while vertebral separation (forward flexion) was greater in men. A sex-age interaction was observed only in lateral bending, thus implying that for other mobility measurements, data within the age groupings employed in this study can be combined for men and women. Electromyographic data were integrated and quantified using EMG biofeedback equipment for unilateral or bilateral recordings made primarily from the erector spinae muscle between lumbar 3-4 and lumbar 4-5 levels, three centimeters lateral to the spinous processes. Dynamic (trunk flexion-extension, lateral rotation-standing, stooping) and static (quiet sitting, rotation-sitting) movements were performed over a ten second interval. Data analyses verified previous electromyographic studies by demonstrating the trunk extensor function of the erector spinae and the relatively greater unilateral activity when turning to the opposite direction in the erect posture. EMG silence was seen during full trunk flexion. Noticeable sex-age interaction were observed for all dynamic movements but not for static activities. Therefore, it is suggested that EMG data during dynamic movements in a normal population cannot be grouped for men and women within a specified age distribution. These data represent one series of baselines to which mobility and movement patterns in a back pain patient group can be compared. Suggestions are offered for the use of EMG biofeedback during dynamic lower back movements as a possible method of alleviating the pain state, perhaps by altering the patient's posture."

CD007431,0,2987771,0,[Clinical aspects of the narrow spinal canal].,"Not infrequently the lumbosacral root-compression syndrome is due to stenosis of the lumbal spinal canal. The clinical symptoms, usually emerging in the middle-aged, may be characterized by either simple radicular pain with or without neurological deficit or by exercise-dependent transient functional disturbance of the cauda equina, namely, the so-called neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC). In most cases, NIC is due to mechanical compression of the cauda fibers as a result of extension of the patient's lumbar spine. In some patients, exercise-induced ischemic radiculopathy is assumed to be the main factor. Differential diagnosis must take into account true intermittent claudication, certain rare myopathies (if the exercise-dependent pain is the main feature), and certain transient disturbances in spinal cord function (if a motor and/or sensory deficit arises during the NIC attack)."
CD007431,0,4049113,0,A prospective study of lumbar spinal movements before and after discectomy using biplanar radiography. Correlation of clinical and radiographic findings.,"The significance of alteration of lumbar spinal motion in cases of herniated disc was examined using a three-dimensional x-ray technique (biplanar radiography) before and 3 months after discectomy. Fifteen consecutive cases of disc herniation were studied prospectively. Predictions of clinical examination, myelography, and motion study for the level and site of the lesion were correlated with the operative findings for their accuracy in localization of the lesion. Changes in lumbar spinal motion after surgery were also correlated with the clinical results. The clinical and myelographic predictions were similar to previously published studies. The present study showed that patients with a sequestrated or prolapsed disc lesion (as opposed to bulging disc) had an abnormally large lateral bend or axial rotation during flexion and extension at the level above, which reduced after surgery. Primary lumbar spinal motions (flexion and extension) were generally reduced to half of the normal value and were not significantly altered by surgery. The restriction of lumbar spinal motion was not significantly reflected in the clinical results, which were satisfactory in most cases. Discectomy by fenestration and minimal resection of the lamina did not produce instability."

Muscle tone and deep-tendon reflexes were evaluated in three patients with hereditary spastic paraparesis after a double-blind, cross-over bolus injection of intrathecal baclofen. Patients underwent placement of a subcutaneous pump for continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen. Three months after implantation the muscle tone decreased 2.04 points (p less than .0001) and the reflex score decreased 2.25 points (p less than .001). Patients initially reported subjective weakness, but muscle testing revealed either an increase or no change in voluntary motor function. Baclofen doses of 60 to 264 micrograms per day were required for effective control of muscle tone and spasticity. Much of the disability in familial spastic paraparesis may be related to the loss of suprasegmental inhibition of spinal reflexes overwhelming the residual voluntary motor function."

CD007431,0,8849475,0,[Spondylodiscitis after operation for lumbar disc herniation].,"Postoperative spondylodiscitis (POD) is a rare but severe complication of lumbar disc surgery. There were five patients with POD among 875 patients undergoing surgery for herniated lumbar discs, in the last 16 years. For detecting risk factor of discitis, a POD group of 5 patients was matched to a control group of 870 patients with respect to sex, age, disc type and operation. In five patients with POD follow-up evaluation of clinical symptoms, laboratory data were obtained, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed. A significant difference between the POD group and the control group was confirmed in sex, operation time and the volume of bleeding during operation. However, there was no significant difference confirmed due to age, disc type, disc level and operative procedure. In the case of males or prolonged operation time or increase of the volume of bleeding, POD may be more frequently observed. All five patients had a period of pain relief after their operations and then reported increasing low back pain with no focal signs. At diagnosis of POD all patients had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 30 per hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) higher than 2.5. After treatment by antibiotics, low back pain gradually receded along with decrease of ESR and CRP. About 40 days later, these patients were almost free of back pain and ESR and CRP were within normal range. MRT1-weighted image during the acute phase demonstrated remarkably decreased signal intensity with loss of distinction between vertebral body and disc space. T2-weighted image showed increased signal intensity in the adjacent vertebral bodies and end-plates. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image had homogenous enhancement of vertebral body and disc space. During the subacute phase, however, T1-weighted image demonstrated moderately decreased signal intensity noted in the posteroinferior portion of the L5 vertebral body and the narrowed L5/S1 disc space. T2-weighted image showed iso signal intensity in L5 and S1 vertebral bodies. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image had mild homogenous enhancement in the posteroinferior portion of the L5 vertebral body. Three months after treatment of POD, there was major signal change in neither T1 nor T2 weighted images, though T2 showed subtle abnormalities with decreased signal intensity adjacent to the L5/S1 disc space."

All patients had signs, symptoms and radiological abnormalities related to a herniated lumbar disc. Each patient received an extradural injection of either 2 ml (80 mg) methyl prednisolone or 2 ml normal saline solution. Neurological examination and interview of the patients with the aid of a questionnaire before and after extradural injection failed to demonstrate any statistically significant difference in outcome between the two groups. At follow-up 14 +/- 6 months after extradural injection 58.3 per cent of the patients in the control group and 51.9 per cent of the patients in the treatment group had undergone surgical treatment with laminectomy. Our results indicate that a single extradural injection of methyl prednisolone (80 mg) is no more effective than a placebo injection in relieving chronic symptoms due to myelographically demonstrable lumbar disc herniation."

Analysis of serial 24 hour urine collections showed a significant increase in urinary glycosaminoglycan after chemonucleolysis. This was not detected in four patients undergoing routine discography. Enzymic analysis of urinary glycosaminoglycan after chemonucleolysis suggested that the increase in levels was largely due to an increase in the amounts of chondroitin sulphate present, probably resulting from proteoglycan breakdown in the intervertebral disc. Eight of the patients treated by chemonucleolysis underwent serial computed tomography (CT). One month after the injection the only change seen was a loss of definition of the disc prolapse, which could be interpreted as a loss of turgidity in the disc as a result of proteoglycan breakdown by chymopapain. By six months the CT of those patients whose symptoms had improved showed that the degree of disc prolapse was usually less marked and the disc margin more clearly defined, suggesting that by this stage anatomical remodelling had occurred."
CD007431,0,531621,0,A comparison of radiographic findings in fusion and nonfusion patients ten or more years following lumbar disc surgery.,"Ninety-six patients who had undergone disc excision and midline spinal fusion and 36 patients who had had simple disc excision had spinal radiographs made 10 or more years postoperatively. Claw spurs were found most commonly at the L2-3 and L3-4 levels in fusion patients, particularly male laborers. Traction spurs with segmental hypermobility were found more commonly at the L4-5 level in patients whose spines were not fused, particularly women. Total lumbar flexion-extension was greater in nonfusion than in fusion patients, but the L1-3 mobility was greater in those who had undergone fusion, suggesting a compensatory increase in the range of lumbar motion. Segmental mobility at levels of surgery in nonfusion patients was similar in those with good and those with poor clinical results. Disc space narrowing was common at levels of operation, but did not correspond to the clinical result. Pseudarthrosis was demonstrated in 26% of fusion patients, but was of no clinical significance. Although complex radiographic changes follow lumbar disc surgery, with or without failure, it is concluded that the plane radiograph is of little aid in determining the source of postoperative pain. The sole exception is that of acquired spondylolysis, which was found in 2.5% of this group of fusion patients, and was clearly associated with a poor clinical outcome. Symptomatic degenerative disc disease at levels above lumbar spinal fusions appears to be an uncommon clinical problem."

Thirty-nine patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and regular dialysis were operated. Their ages were 47 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD) years and duration of dialysis was 70.5 +/- 35.8 months. The clinical symptoms included bone pain in 23 patients (59%), skin itching in 21 (53.8%), general weakness in 13 (33.3%), conscious disturbance in 2, chest tightness in 1, and failure to thrive in 1. Total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation of 60 mg of parathyroid gland into subcutaneous tissue was done routinely. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and left proximal femur, expressed as grams per square centimeter and as fracture risk. The extension force of the quadriceps muscle was measured at 60 degrees of right knee flexion, expressed as newtons (N) in a peak force and an average force. Three months after operation the BMD of the study group increased (in g/cm2) from 1.063 +/- 0.181 to 1.148 +/- 0.149 (p < 0.001) in L2-4 (n = 25), from 0.792 +/- 0.14 to 0.875 +/- 0.161 (p < 0.001), in femoral neck (n = 25), from 0.672 +/- 0.171 to 0.754 +/- 0.21 (p < 0. 001) in Ward's triangle (n = 25), and from 0.69 +/- 0.149 to 0.738 +/- 0.143 (p < 0.001) in trochanter (n = 25).

Muscle force (in newtons) increased from 264.8 +/- 110. 5 to 326 +/- 110.9 (p = 0.023) in peak force (n = 18) and from 195.3 +/- 90.4 to 258 +/- 99 (p = 0.012) in average force (n = 18). The patients with general weakness had improved muscle force more prominently than those without general weakness. In addition to skin itching, bone pain, and soft tissue calcification, general weakness that causes disability is an indication for surgery in secondary hyperparathyroidism. After parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation, the muscle force tends to increase, especially in those with general weakness. An increment of BMD and reduction of fracture risk are also found after surgery."

CD007431,0,9703438,0,True neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: electrophysiological diagnosis in six cases.,"We report 6 patients with true neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. All were female and presented unilateral severe atrophy of the thenar muscles. Pain in the affected upper limb was frequently reported, but sensory deficit was slight or absent. Reduced amplitude of ulnar and median compound muscle action potential associated with a normal amplitude of median sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and a reduced amplitude of ulnar SNAP was indicative of a chronic axon loss in the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. The absence of the medial antebrachial cutaneous SNAP in 5 patients and a reduction in amplitude compared to the unaffected side in the other patient indicated a C8-T1 postganglionic radicular lesion or a lower brachial plexus neuropathy. Radiography showed a rudimentary bilateral cervical rib or an elongated C7 transverse process in all cases. Surgery was performed, and in each case the lower part of the brachial plexus was found to be stretched and angulated over a fibrous band, which was removed. Pain was relieved after 1-4 weeks, but at 1 year, there was only minimal motor improvement and the electrophysiological results were unchanged."
CD007431,0,16523129,0,Surgical treatment of spinal brucellosis.,"We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients with spinal brucellosis of the thoracic and lumbar spine who were treated successfully with a combination of surgery and antibiotics. All patients had back pain; six patients had radiculopathy and one patient had paraparesis. Patients with spondylodiscitis without epidural abscesses (n = 3) had transpedicle discectomy and drainage. Epidural abscesses in the lumbar area caused by spondylodiscitis (n = 3), spondylitis (n = 2), and discitis with infected disc herniation (n = 1), were drained using a posterior approach combined with posterolateral fusion in two patients with spondylodiscitis and discectomy in the patient with a herniated disc. One patient presented with a pathologic fracture and neural compression and was treated with anterior corpectomy and reconstruction. Antibiotic treatment was given for 3 to 9 months. Mean followup was 3 years. Back pain improved soon after surgery. Recovery from radiculopathy and paraparesis was complete. One patient had recurrence of infection 9 months after initial treatment. Clinical manifestation of spinal brucellosis can include spondylitis, spondylodiscitis, discitis, epidural abscess, paraspinal abscess, and vertebral collapse. Transpedicle drainage allows tissue diagnosis and facilitates treatment. Because brucellosis usually responds to antibiotics, surgery is considered as the last resort in treating spinal brucellosis, but severe neurologic deficit and incapacitating back pain often necessitate surgical intervention."

Of the 87 patients with a failed back syndrome, 12 were confirmed to have tuberculous infection of the same disc interval. These patients responded satisfactorily to bracing and a short course of anti-tubercular chemotherapy. Histopathological confirmation of the disease was obtained by CT guided biopsy, and only a few of the patients required repeat surgery. This study highlights one of the atypical presentations of tuberculosis of the spine as a herniated lumbar intervertebral disc and a cause of a failed back syndrome. Advanced imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans are helpful in the early detection of such conditions."
CD007431,0,3591130,0,[Differential diagnosis of arterial and venous spondylogenic lumbosacral radiculomyeloischemia].,"The authors have analyzed 200 clinical cases of ischemic damage to the lower half of the spinal cord secondary to surgery-verified hernia of a lumbar intervertebral disk. In many patients the surgical findings, in addition to a compressed spinal radicle, included compression of an arterial or a venous vessel. Clinical characteristics were compared in patients with compression of the radiculo-medullar artery (n = 100) and of the large radicular vein (n = 100). Significant for the differential diagnosis are the rate of myeloischemia evolution, characteristics and the time-course of the pain syndrome, the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid and the topography of ischemia in the transverse section of the spinal cord. The necessity of differentiating between arterial and venous radiculomyeloischemia is dictated by the advisability of the inclusion into the therapeutic complex of special vasoactive drugs (improving the arterial blood flow) or venotonics. Indications for the surgical treatment of such patients are presented."

CD007431,0,15744815,0,Surgical treatments for lumbar disc disease in adolescent patients; chemonucleolysis / microsurgical discectomy/ PLIF with cages.,"The herniated lumbar disc (HLD) in adolescent patients is characterized by typical discogenic pain that originates from a soft herniated disc. It is frequently related to back trauma, and sometimes it is also combined with a degenerative process and a bony spur such as posterior Schmorl's node. Chemonucleolysis is an excellent minimally invasive treatment having these criteria: leg pain rather than back pain, severe limitation on the straight leg raising test (SLRT), and soft disc protrusion on computed tomography (CT). Microsurgical discectomy is useful in the cases of extruded or sequestered HLD and lateral recess stenosis due to bony spur because the nerve root is not decompressed with chymopapain. Spinal fusion, like as PLIF, should be considered in the cases of severe disc degeneration, instability, and stenosis due to posterior central bony spur. In our study, 185 adolescent patients, whose follow-up period was more than 1 year (the range was 1-4 years), underwent spinal surgery due to HLD from March, 1998 to December, 2002 at our institute. Among these cases, we performed chemonucleolysis in 65 cases, microsurgical discectomy in 94 cases, and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with cages in 33 cases including 7 reoperation cases. The clinical success rate was 91% for chemonucleolysis, 95% for microsurgical disectomy, and 89% for PLIF with cages, and there were no non- union cases for the PLIF patients with cages. In adolescent HLD, chemonucleolysis was the 1st choice of treatment because the soft adolescent HLD was effectively treated with chemonucleolysis, especially when the patient satisfied the chemonucleolysis indications."
CD007431,0,8500936,0,The results of surgical treatment of lumbar arachnoiditis.,"Forty patients with lumbar arachnoiditis, following previous operations, were classified into 4 myelographic types. Most patients with type I images had herniated disc symptoms with unilateral leg pain and limited straight-leg raising. Patients with types II and III myelographic appearances had bilateral leg pain, absent ankle jerks, weakness, cramps and signs of diffuse sensory deficit; some also had neurogenic claudication and urinary sphincter dysfunction. All patients with type IV had dysesthesia. Twenty-three of the 40 patients underwent reoperation and those with types I and II had acceptable results, but poor results occurred in those with types III and IV myelograms."
CD007431,0,2967924,0,Microsurgical versus standard lumbar discectomy.,"Two hundred seventy consecutive patients operated upon by standard discectomy were compared to 270 patients treated with microlumbar discectomy. All patients had back and leg pain, as well as positive clinical findings and positive myelograms suggestive of disc herniation. The results demonstrated a 98% success rate in the microsurgical group as compared to a 95% success rate in the standard laminectomy group. Of microdiscectomy patients, 95% had an excellent result, as compared to 89% of the standard laminectomy group. Patients with pending compensation cases did only slightly poorer than those with no secondary gain regardless of what procedure was used. The postoperative hospital stay of the microsurgical patients averaged 3.7 days as compared to 7.1 for the standard technique. The time before return to work was significantly shorter in patients undergoing microdiscectomy. Microdiscectomy proved to be superior in both clinical results and cost effectiveness."

The majority had lesions involving three or more vertebral bodies. Paraplegia occurred in 8 patients and was always associated with bladder and bowel dysfunction. Lesions located at T4/5 were most commonly accompanied by paraplegia. Deterioration of the neurological status was related to the degree of spinal stenosis, whereas the degree of kyphosis was of less importance. Radiculopathy is rare in children with Pott's disease."
CD007431,0,1951193,0,Overbite and overjet characteristics of refined diagnostic groups of temporomandibular disorder patients.,"Overbite and overjet were studied as continuous variables to examine for any relationship to diagnostic groups of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) compared with symptom-free controls. This avoided the bias of arbitrary definitions of normal and abnormal for these occlusal variables and also avoided the masking effect of studying symptoms rather than diagnostic entities. Incisal overbite in primary osteoarthrosis (OA) was shifted toward the minimal and open bite ranges as compared with the controls (p less than 0.02). Open bite occurred in only the two OA classes studied and in a few cases with myalgia only but was absent in the symptom-free controls. Overbite in myalgia was slightly skewed to the lower range. Deep bite was not more common in the myalgia, disk displacement (with or without reduction), or the OA groups. Increased overjet characterized OA groups, especially when there was a history of derangement (p less than 0.004), but did not characterize the other diagnostic groups. Except for open bite, overbite and overjet characteristics as isolated variables did not distinguish TMD patient groups. It is hypothesized that open bite in OA can be the result of joint changes rather than a predisposing occlusal cause."

CD007431,0,11888226,0,Clonidine for treatment of postoperative pain: a dose-finding study.,"The aim of this double-blind randomized study was to evaluate the optimal intravenous dose of clonidine administrated during the peri-operative period, after lumbar hemilaminectomy for herniated disk repair. The ""optimal intravenous dose"" was defined as that providing minimal analgesic request, stable haemodynamic profile and a minimal sedation score during 12h after extubation. Eighty adult patients, ASA physical status I-II, undergoing lumbar hemilaminectomy for herniated disk (L(4)-L(5), L(5)-S(1)) were included in the study. All the patients were randomly assigned to one of four study groups (A, B, C, D), 20 patients each. The same standardized general anaesthesia was performed for each group. Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, group A, B and C patients received three different loading doses of intravenous clonidine (5 microg/kg, 3 microg/kg, 2 microg/kg respectively), followed by the same infusion of intravenous clonidine (0.3 microg/kg per hour). Group D patients received a bolus dose and a continuous infusion of NaCl 0.9%. In the recovery unit, postoperative pain was treated by a patient-controlled analgesia device, containing morphine. Pain relief was evaluated by the total morphine requirement during the postoperative period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate and sedation were also noted during the first 12h postoperatively. Intravenous clonidine decreased morphine requirements in a dose-dependent manner. Group A, B, C and D patients requested 5 +/- 2, 11 +/- 3, 19 +/- 4 and 29 +/- 8 doses of morphine respectively. Clonidine also affected SBP in a dose-related manner. Group A, B and C patients had an SBP decrease respectively of 26 +/- 3%, 7 +/- 4% and 2 +/- 2% compared with basic values while, at the same time, in group D patients no SBP variation was registered. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, when sedation and analgesic effect of clonidine is required, 3 microg/kg bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion of 0.3 microg/kg per hour has to be considered the optimal intravenous dose. The higher dose of intravenous clonidine (5 microg/kg) produced better analgesia but the degree of hypotension and sedation was more severe and longer lasting; it required ephedrine administration and careful monitoring of the patient. On the other hand, the bolus of intravenous clonidine 2 microg/kg (group C) was less effective in terms of pain relief but with similar side-effects to the 3 microg/kg dosage (group B)."
CD007431,0,12027817,0,Possible role of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament in women with peripartum pelvic pain.,"To enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology of women with peripartum pelvic pain, it is necessary to couple anatomical insights with relevant clinical research. In this context, the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament is especially of interest because it was noticed that women diagnosed with peripartum pelvic pain frequently experience pain within the boundaries of this ligament. Njoo (1) found a high intertester reliability and a high specificity for long dorsal sacroiliac ligament pain. The present article focuses on the possible role of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament in the pain pattern of women with peripartum pelvic pain. The diagnostic and therapeutic consequences are considered."
CD007431,0,8995852,0,The inter-observer reproducibility of Lasègue's sign in patients with low back pain in general practice.,"The spectrum of low back pain patients in general practice differs significantly from that in an orthopaedic clinic. The most frequent specific cause of low back pain is nerve-root irritation or compression caused by intervertebral protrusion, and the diagnosis is still problematic. Testing for Lasègue's sign could be a useful way of detecting high-risk patients, but so far the reproducibility of the test has been measured only in hospital-based studies."
CD007431,0,8367787,0,Straight leg raising. Anatomical effects on the spinal nerve root without and with fusion.,"Straight leg raising (SLR) is a useful clinical test to demonstrate an inflammatory compressive process across a spinal nerve root. Several previous studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of SLR on nerve root motion, but the exact direction and amount of this motion is still unclear. Components of the SLR test that have not been adequately addressed include the effect of SLR on the intact dural-nerve root system, motion of the nerve tissues as distinct from the dura, and nerve root strain. Separately, spinal fusion is occasionally used as an adjunct to discectomy to decrease instability and subsequent ""nerve root irritation."" The effect of a one-level fusion on in situ nerve root biomechanics, however, has not been evaluated. Ten fresh human cadavers underwent posterior lumbar laminectomies. Spinal nerve root motion was studied while a SLR maneuver was performed. Data was recorded photographically and statistically analyzed. The results were as follows: 1) SLR induced both linear motion (0.5-5 mm) and strain (2-4%) in spinal nerves L4, L5, and S1; 2) The dura moved less than the intrathecal nerve root at the pedicle and experienced more strain (P < .05). 3) The nerve roots moved laterally toward the pedicle and thus would move into a posterolaterally herniated disc. 4) Rigid anterior stabilization did not decrease nerve root motion or strain."
CD007431,0,11284597,0,Treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain with epidural steroid injections.,"Fifty patients with an average age of 47 years received epidural steroid injections for lumbosacral radicular pain due to disk herniation or spinal stenosis. All patients had failed previous conservative treatment. Mean follow-up was 24 months (range: 12-36 months). Immediately after injection, all 50 patients reported various degrees of relief from leg and back pain. At the last follow-up examination, 68% of patients were asymptomatic, 20% had no change in preinjection radicular symptoms, and 12% had various degrees of relief. No significant correlation was found between pain relief, age, or number of injections. Early pain relief may be anticipated after epidural steroid injections in 80% of patients with radicular symptoms due to disk herniation or spinal stenosis."
CD007431,0,3952633,0,Osteoid osteomas of the spine.,"Seven patients with spinal osteoid osteomas are reported and another 110 cases from the literature are reviewed. Among the patients spinal pain is the constant clinical complaint, while radicular pain and scoliosis are present in half of the patients. Whereas radiograms and tomograms of the spine are sometimes inadequate for diagnosis, bone scanning is positive in 100% of patients and is useful for directing spinal computed tomography at the exact level of the lesion. Complete removal of the tumoral nidus produces remission of pain in more than 95% of cases. The possibility of an erroneous diagnosis of a lumbar protruded disk and the necessity of a bone scan in young patients with spinal or radicular pain are emphasized."
CD007431,0,8836692,0,Changes in motor activity and biomechanics during balance recovery following cutaneous and muscular deafferentation.,"The effects of lower limb deafferentation were examined during execution of a balance recovery step following a forward fall induced by release of an initial inclined posture. The subjects were healthy control subjects and patients with a unilateral loss of the Achilles tendon reflex following S1 radiculitis. Deafferentation of healthy subjects was obtained by unilateral leg ischemia (four subjects) and by foot anesthesia (five subjects). The balance recovery step was characterized by the surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of right and left soleus and tibialis anterior muscles and the kinetics of the center of gravity and center of foot pressure. Experimentally induced and pathological deafferentation decreased the EMG activity of the ipsilateral soleus and lowered the vertical ground reaction force. The lower limb motor activity was more affected by loss of muscle proprioceptive afferents than by loss of plantar cutaneous afferents. Patients showed early and bilateral changes in soleus and tibialis activities, whichever side was affected. The step length of patients was also shorter than that of controls, but it remained similar before and after deafferentation in the healthy subjects. The results are discussed in terms of ipsilateral and crossed pathway connections and functional adaptive strategies."

Included were 28 (62%) woman and 17 (38%) men, with a mean age of 46 years. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 2 years. Intra-operatively, disc herniation was graded as a protrusion in 23 (51%) patients and as a prolapse in 22 (49%) patients. During the follow-up, sciatic pain completely recovered or markedly diminished in 38 (84%) patients and 35 (78%) patients returned to work. The occupational outcome of the patients operated on for a protrusion was inferior to that of the patients operated on for a prolapse: only 22% of the patients who underwent surgery for a protrusion reported to manage their work well, while as many as 41% of those with a prolapse managed well (p = 0.04). Pre-operatively, clinical examination revealed segmental instability of the lumbar spine in 11 (24%) patients. There was a significant association between instability and unsatisfactory long-term outcome: of the patients with pre-operative instability, 45% were postoperatively retired or on sick leave because of the back, as compared to 15% of the 34 patients without instability (p = 0.03). Furthermore, patients with instability suffered from sciatica and low back pain significantly (p = 0.02) more often than those without instability. Surgical complications were infrequent.

Forty-two patients had abnormal EMG findings that could be explained on the basis of anatomical defect(s) seen on CT. Nine had normal CT scans but abnormal EMGs, and five patients had normal EMGs but abnormal CT scans. Thirteen of the 80 patients were further investigated with myelography, 22 patients underwent surgical exploration, and the remainder received conservative therapy. In the majority of cases, surgery confirmed the abnormal CT and EMG findings; in some instances, however, myelography and/or surgery confirmed the abnormality only at the level demonstrated on EMG. The CT and EMG often agree. However, an abnormal EMG seems to correlate better with the demonstrated course of radiculopathy than CT."

The purpose was to present our experience and discuss the utility of electromyography, electroneurography and somatosensory evoked potentials after ulnar nerve stimulation in patients with surgically verified neurovascular compression at the thoracic outlet. Twenty patients (median age 29.5, 16 women) with operatively verified neurovascular compression by a cervical rib or band were examined. All complained of pain and paraesthesias in the hand. In 12 vasomotor disturbances (pallor or lividity, low skin temperature, Raynaud's phenomenon) were also observed. Clinical diagnosis was supported by the provocative tests (Adson, Wright, costoclavicular) in 14persons. Neurologic signs were present in 2 patients in ""pseudoulnar"" distribution. Anterior scalenectomy was performed with success in 15 cases, 4 remained unchanged and 1 worsened. Electrodiagnostic tests were normal in all 18 patients without neurologic signs. We note a tendency for the digital nerves sensory action potentials in patients with TOS to be higher than usual It is concluded that electrodiagnosis is useless in confirming the presence of TOS, but it is very useful to exclude other painful conditions that require other treatments (carpal and cubital tunnel syndromes, cervical radiculopathies etc)."
CD007431,0,16768220,0,[Therapeutic effect of dexalgin on disturbances of vertebrogenic and nonvertebrogenic mechanisms in back pain].,"To evaluate the effect of Dexalgin on dysregulation mechanisms in the complex therapy of dorsalgia, 39 patients have been studied. They were divided into 2 groups: with vertebrogenic (23 patients) and without vertebrogenic (16 patients) pain syndrome. Dexalgin was prescribed in dosage 75 mg daily during 5 days. Its efficacy was measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire, OBPDQ in case of low back pain. Electromyographic (EMG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed in radiculopathic patients receiving dexalgin. The results revealed a statistically significant decrease of the VAS values at the control examination in both groups of patients (p<0,001) with background RI values being 18,4 +/- 9,7 and 21,2 +/- 11,7, respectively. The considerable reduction of RI to 14,6 +/- 9,2 was observed in the second group (p=0,044) on day 5. Dynamic examination showed the predominant decrease of OBPDQ percentage values in patients with myofascial back pain (p=0,038). The EMG data demonstrated a tendency to reduction of spontaneous activity in muscular fibers and normalization of the H-reflex latency during the tibial nerve conduction study in patients with vertebrogenic dorsalgia (p=0,058 and p=0,064, respectively). Dexalgin is the new generation of nonsteroid analgesics possessing potential in treatment of both, acute and exacerbations of chronic dorsalgias.

Part I: Etiology, pathogenesis, pathomorphology, and clinical features.","The authors analyze the clinical features and the results of various imaging studies in 77 patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. The most commonly olisthetic vertebra was L-4, followed by L-3. The extent of the olisthesis ranged from 8-43%. Forty-two percent of the patients with L-3 or L-4 olisthesis had reduced mobility of the underlying vertebra. Five different clinical pictures were present: no symptoms except occasional low back pain; chronic low back pain with no radicular symptoms; radicular symptoms and no signs of nerve root compression, with or without low back pain; radicular symptoms with neurologic deficit; intermittent claudication. Various pathological conditions were identified: slight narrowing of the central spinal canal without compression of neural structures; isolated stenosis of the nerve root canal; stenosis of both the nerve root canal and the central spinal canal. The onset of degenerative spondylolisthesis seems to be connected to excessive shear forces on the olisthetic vertebra. The extent of neural structure compression, and thus the clinical picture, depends on three factors: the primitive size of the spinal canal, the extent of degenerative changes in the zygapophyseal joints, and the extent of olisthesis."
CD007431,0,2718865,0,The anatomic basis of vertebrogenic pain and the autonomic syndrome associated with lumbar disk extrusion.,"Extruded lumbar intervertebral disks traditionally have been classified as posterior or central in location. A retrospective review of 250 MR imaging examinations of the lumbar spine that used mid- and high-field imagers revealed 145 positive studies, which included a significant number of extrusions extending anteriorly. With the lateral margin of the neural foramen/pedicle as the boundary, 29.2% of peripheral disk extrusions were anterior and 56.4% were posterior. In addition, a prevalence of 14.4% was found for central disk extrusions, in which there was a rupture of disk material into or through the vertebral body itself. The clinical state of neurogenic spinal radiculopathy accompanying posterior disk extrusion has been well defined; however, uncomplicated anterior and central disk extrusions also may be associated with a definite clinical syndrome. The vertebrogenic symptom complex includes (1) local and referred pain and (2) autonomic reflex dysfunction within the lumbosacral zones of Head. Generalized alterations in viscerosomatic tone potentially may also be observed. The anatomic basis for the mediation of clinical signs and symptoms generated within the disk and paradiskal structures rests with afferent sensory fibers from two primary sources: (1) posterolateral neural branches emanating from the ventral ramus of the somatic spinal root and (2) neural rami projecting directly to the paravertebral autonomic neural plexus. Thus, conscious perception and unconscious effects originating in the vertebral column, although complex, have definite pathways represented in this dual peripheral innervation associated with intimately related and/or parallel central ramifications. It is further proposed that the specific clinical manifestations of the autonomic syndrome are mediated predominantly, if not entirely, within the sympathetic nervous system. The directional differentiation of lumbar disk extrusions by MR, together with a clarification and appreciation of the accompanying clinical somatic and autonomic syndromes, should contribute both to understanding the specific causes as well as to establishing the appropriate treatment of acute and chronic signs and symptoms engendered by many nonspecific disease processes involving the spinal column."

CD007431,0,11793155,0,[Discogenic low back pain and degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis - how appropriate is surgical treatment?].,"Surgery in acute and/or chronic low back pain is still a matter of intensive and controversial discussions. A vast number of minimally invasive or so called semi-invasive procedures have been published in the last 3 decades, but evidence-based data on efficacy and benefit of most of these techniques are still lacking. However, empirical data suggest good or at least satisfactory clinical results for a limited number of procedures if they are applied under restrictive indication criteria. Discogenic low back pain and lumbar spinal stenosis belong to the most frequent diagnoses associated with low back pain. This article gives a survey on definitions, indication criteria and modern surgical or semi- invasive techniques used for the treatment of these two pathologic entities. Discogenic low back pain: This clinical and morphological entity is defined as low back pain arising mainly from disc degeneration. Pain generators are usually nociceptors in the cartilaginous endplates, in the outer anulus fibrosus as well as in the periosteum of the vertebral bodies. Clinical symptoms correlate with morphologic changes detected with MR-imaging (modic type I) or with contained disc protrusions mainly without neurological symptoms. Surgery is rarely indicated, spontaneous remissions occur in more than 60% of all cases. Spinal fusion has been the only surgical option in cases which did not respond to conservative therapy. Recently, electro-thermal modulation of the posterior anulus fibrosus has been published as a semi- invasive technique to relieve low back pain generated by fissures in the outer anulus and ingrowing nociceptors (intradiscal electro-thermal therapy, IDET(TM)). First results are promising, however, prospective randomised studies comparing this technique with conservative therapy are still lacking. The same is true for artificial nucleus pulposus replacement using hydrogel cushions implanted in the intervertebral space after removal of the nucleus pulposus from posterior or through an anterior approach (PDN, prosthetic disc nucleus(TM)). In cases with severe disc degeneration total disc replacement is another innovative option (ProDisc(TM)). Two metal endplates with titanium surface coating are implanted through a minimal invasive anterior approach (mini-laparotomy). A polyethylene inlay anchored in the caudal endplate holds the distance between the endplates and preserves the physiological range of motion between the two vertebral bodies. Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis: Narrowing of the spinal canal due to degenerative changes of the disc, the facet joints and thickening of the yellow ligament is a geriatric disease which is diagnosed in increasing numbers within the last 10 years. More than 80% of the patients present with low back pain in association with neurogenic claudication. Neurological symptoms at rest are less frequently found. The spontaneous course shows progressive symptoms in more than 50% of all patients. More than 35% of the patients have associated diseases which might influence the perioperative course, complication rates and outcomes of surgery. Surgery is indicated in patients with progressive neurological symptoms, unacceptable decrease of quality of life or progressive intractable pain. In patients with mainly ""leg symptoms"" microsurgical mono- or multisegmental decompression is the procedure of choice. If low back pain is predominant and associated with degenerative instability such as degenerative spondylolisthesis or lumbar scoliosis, decompression must be combined with instrumented spinal fusion. In general a restrictive indication for surgery must be recommended especially for spinal fusion procedures. Non-fusion techniques such as intradiscal electro thermal therapy or spine arthroplasty with replacement of nucleus pulposus or total disc show promising early results; however, little is known about the long-term effect. It should be a principle to apply surgery in the least invasive way."
CD007431,0,11793154,0,[Relevance of nerve blocks in treating and diagnosing low back pain--is the quality decisive?].,"Diagnostic nerve blocks: The popularity of neural blockade as a diagnostic tool in painful conditions, especially in the spine, is due to features like the unspecific character of spinal pain, the irrelevance of radiological findings and the purely subjective character of pain. It is said that apart from specific causes of pain and clear radicular involvement with obvious neurological deficits and corresponding findings of a prolapsed disc in MRI or CT pictures, a diagnosis of the anatomical cause of the pain can only be established if invasive tests are used [5]. These include zygapophyseal joint blocks, sacroiliacal joint blocks, disc stimulation and nerve root blocks. Under controlled conditions, it has been shown that among patients with chronic nonradicular low back pain, some 10-15% have zygapophyseal joint pain [58], some 15-20% have sacroiliacal joint pain [36, 59] and 40% have pain from internal disc disruption [60]. The diagnostic use of neural blockade rests on three premises. First, pathology causing pain is located in an exact peripheral location, and impulses from this site travel via a unique and consistent neural root. Second, injection of local aneasthetic totally abolishes sensory function of intended nerves and does not affect other nerves. Third, relief of pain after local anaesthetic block is attributable solely to block of the target afferent neural pathway. The validity of these assumptions is limited by complexities of anatomy, physiology, and psychology of pain perception and the effect of local anaesthetics on impulse conduction [28]. Facet joints: The prevalence of zygapophyseal joint pain among patients with low back pain seems to be between 15% and 40% [62], but apparently only 7% of patients have pure facet pain [8, 29]. Facet blockade is achieved either by injection of local anaesthetic into the joint space or around the medial branches of the posterior medial rami of the spinal nerves that innervate the joint. There are several problems with intraarticular facet injections, mainly failure to enter the joint capsule and rupture of the capsule during the injection [11]. There is no physiological means to test the adaequacy of medial nerve block, because the lower branches have no cutaneous innervation. Medial ramus blocks (for one joint two nerves have to be infiltrated) are as effective as intraarticular joint blocks [37]. Reproducibility of the test is not high, the specifity is only 65% [61]. For diagnosis of facet pain fluoroscopic control is always necessary as in the other diagnostic blocks. Sacroiliacal joint: Definitely the sacroiliacal joint can be the source of low back pain. Stimulation of the joint by injection in subjects without pain produces pain in the buttock, in the posterior thigh and the knee. There are many clinical tests which confirm the diagnosis, but the interrater reliability is moderate [53]. Intraarticular injection can be achieved in the lower part of the joint with fluoroscopic guidance only, but an accurate intraarticular injection, which is confirmed by contrast medium, even at this place is often difficult. It is not clear whether intraarticular spread is necessary to achieve efficacy. Discography: Two primary syndromes concerning the ventral compartment have been described: anular fissures of the disc and instability of the motion segment. In the syndrome of anular tear, leakage of nucleus pulposus material into the anulus fibrosus is considered to be the source of pain. The studies of Vaharanta [71] and Moneta [41] show a clear and significant correlation between disc pain and grade 3 fissures of the anulus fibrosus. intervertebral discs are difficult to anaesthetize. Intradiskal injections of local anaesthetics may succeed in relieving the patient's pain, but such injections are liable to yield false negative results if the injected agent fails to adequately infiltrate the nerve endings in the outer anulus fibrosus that mediate the patient's pain. In the majority of cases MRI provide adaequate information, but discography may be superior in early stages of anular tear and in clarifying the relation between imaging data and pain [71]. Selective spinal nerve injection: In patients with complicated radiculopathy, the contribution of root inflammation to pain may not be certain, or the level of pathology may be unclear. Diagnostic root blocks are indicated in the following situations: atypical topography of radicular pain, disc prolapses or central spinal stenosis at more than one level and monoradicular pain, lateral spinal stenosis, postnucleotomysyndrome. Injection of individual spinal nerves by paravertebral approach has to be used to elucidate the mechanism and source of pain in this unclear situations. The premise is that needle contact will identify the nerve that produces the patient's characteristic pain and that local anaesthetic delivered to the pathogenic nerve will be uniquely analgesic. Often, this method is used for surgical planning, such as determining the site of foraminotomy. All diagnostic nerve root blocks have to be done under fluoroscopic guidance. Pain relief with blockade of a spinal nerve cannot distinguish between pathology of the proximal nerve in the intervertebral foramen or pain transmitted from distal sites by that nerve. Besides, the tissue injury in the nerve's distribution and neuropathic pain (for instance as a result of root injury) likewise would be relieved by a proximal block of the nerve. Satisfactory needle placement could not be achieved in 10% of patient's at L4, 15% at L5 and 30% at S1 [28]. The positive predictive value of indicated radiculopathy confirmed by surgery ranged between 87-100% [14, 22]. The negative predictive value is poorly studied, because few patients in the negative test group had surgery. Negative predictive values were 27% and 38% of the small number of patients operated on despite a negative test. Only one prospective study was published, which showed a positive predictive value of 95% and an untested negative predictive value [66]. Some studies repeatedly demonstrated that pain relief by nerve root block does not predict success by neuroablative procedures, neither by dorsal rhyzotomy nor by dorsal gangliectomy [46]. Therapeutic nerve blocks - facet joints: Intraarticular injection of steroids offer no greater benefit than injections of normal saline [8, 15] and long lasting success is lacking. In this case, a denervation of the medial branches can be considered. To date three randomized controlled studies of radiofrequency facet denervation have been published. One study [20] reported only modest outcomes and its results remained inconclusive, another study [72] with a double blind controlled design showed some effects in a small selected group of patients (adjusted odds ratio 4.8) 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, concerning not only reduction of pain but alleviating functional disability also. The third study (34a) showed no effect 3 months after treatment. Discogenic pain: Intradiscal radiofrequency lesions, intradiscal injections of steroids and phenol have been advocated, but there are no well controlled studies. Just recently, intradiscal lesion and denervation of the anulus has been described with promising results, but a randomized controlled study is lacking up to now [31, 55]. Epidural Steroids: Steroids relieve pain by reducing inflammation and by blocking transmission of nociceptive C-fiber input. Koes et al. [33] reviewed the randomized trials of epidural steroids: To date, 15 trials have been performed to evaluate the efficacy, 11 of which showed method scores of 50 points (from 100) ore more. The trials showed inconsistent results of epidural injections. Of the 15 trials, 8 reported positive results and 7 others reported negative results. Consequently the efficacy of epidural steroid injections has not yet been established. The benefits of epidural steroid injections seem to be of short duration only. Future efficacy studies, which are clearly needed, should take into account the apparent methological shortcomings. Furthermore, it is unclear which patients benefit from these injections. In our hands the injection technique can be much improved by fluoroscopic guidance of the needle, with a prone position of the patient, and lateral injection at the relevant level and with a small volume (1-2 ml) and low dose of corticosteroid (20 mg triamcinolone in the case of a monoradicular pain, for example). In the case of epidural adhesions in postoperative radicular pain [50], the study of Heafner showed that the additional effect of hyaloronidase and hypertonic saline to steroids was minimal. In our hands there was no effect in chronic radicular pain 3 months after the injection."
CD007431,0,1570708,0,[Regression of motor symptoms after intervertebral disk displacement-induced spinal nerve root lesion. Clinical study].,"Ever since the causal relationship between backache, radicular pain and intravertebral disc herniation was established [25], there have been different opinions about the degree of recovery of motor lesions of the nerve root caused by disc herniation. Of 123 patients with a severe motor deficit of the L5 nerve root, 95 patients were available for a follow up examination 4 to 8 years after the operation. The statistical evaluation showed that the degree of recovery of the root lesion was mainly dependent on the age of the patient and the time interval until operation. Even a prior herniation of the disc without much compression of the nerve root can cause chronic damage to the nerve through traction at the trilamellar nerve root fixation. So even in the case of only a small disc hernia with a corresponding nerve root lesion, we would recommend immediate operative therapy."

A new therapeutic modality.,"The authors present a new advance in the treatment of herniated disc disease using percutaneous Nd:YAG laser to vaporize a small portion of nucleus pulposus, thereby decompressing the disc. In vitro and in vivo animal data are presented. Three hundred seventy-seven magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan-documented, herniated, nonsequestered lumbar intervertebral discs with corresponding clinical findings in 333 patients were so treated in an outpatient setting. The longest follow-up was 62 months, with a mean of 26 months. According to the Macnab criteria, there was a good to fair response in 261 patients (78.4%), and a poor response in 72 (21.6%); 166 patients experienced relief of pain during the procedure. One-third of repeat magnetic resonance imaging scans at 4-6 months postlaser treatment showed modest to moderate decrease of disc herniation."
CD007431,0,8915639,0,Determination of trunk motion patterns associated with permanent or transient stenosis of the lumbar spine.,"Dynamometric devices used to assess back function are becoming increasingly used in research as well as in clinical practice. These devices provide values for a variety of movement variables such as torque, displacement, and velocity, but they also enable the study of movement patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the movement patterns of patients presenting with specific spinal pathologies. Thirteen patients with spinal stenosis and 14 patients with degenerative changes and a borderline spinal canal diameter, as well as a control group of 30 symptom-free subjects, were studied. An isoinertial trunk-testing dynamometric device was used. Sagittal velocity and position were measured against a resistance set to 50% of the subject's maximum isometric torque. A phase plane analysis (velocity against position) was performed for each subject. An ensemble averaging technique was used to average the repetitions of every subject and a normalization technique was employed to draw an average graph for each group. This graph showed distinct patterns of movement for the three groups. The differences appeared mostly during the extension phase of movement, as confirmed by statistical analysis. The spinal stenosis group showed lower velocities than the controls during the entire extension phase (P < 0.05), while the borderline spinal canal group demonstrated a significant decrease in velocity at the end of the extension phase (P < 0.01). These findings can be related to the increase in disk bulge and decrease in the diameter of the spinal canal during extension. This study shows the relation between some spinal pathologies and movement patterns. This type of functional assessment may be a valuable tool for assessing the relation between anatomical lesions and function and for determining the responsibility of findings such as bulging disk and/or facet syndrome in causing a patient's complaints."
CD007431,0,8441936,0,Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of percutaneous discectomy. A preliminary report.,"Twenty-one consecutive patients (27 lumbar discs) were treated by percutaneous discectomy for lumbar herniated disc disease from July 1988 through March 1989. Twenty-six discs in 20 patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance images graded by a neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical and prior imaging results. Fifteen patients were treated by one-level percutaneous discectomy and six patients by two-level percutaneous discectomy. The disc herniations were graded with respect to size, type, location, and hydration status on the magnetic resonance image scans. The postoperative magnetic resonance images were obtained 2-6 months after percutaneous discectomy. Early clinical outcomes after percutaneous discectomy were compared with the various magnetic resonance imaging parameters. Overall, treatment for thirteen patients (62%) was considered clinically successful (decrease or elimination of pain) after percutaneous discectomy, whereas treatment for eight (38%) patients was considered to clinically fail (persistence of pain) with follow-up ranging from 1 to 6 months postoperatively. Three of the patients in whom treatment failed have been subsequently treated successfully by laminotomy and discectomy. On the average, there is a small absolute decrease (5% of the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal) in the size of disc herniations when treated by percutaneous discectomy. Although this study is limited by a small sample size and lacks statistical significance, it appears that an early clinical success after percutaneous discectomy may be related to a few magnetic resonance imaging parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,8915635,0,Lumbar disc herniation in patients with developmental spinal stenosis.,"Lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation are usually regarded as two pathogenetically different conditions, but in the literature lumbar disc herniation in patients with developmental spinal stenosis has been rarely documented. In a clinical retrospective study, 42 lumbar disc herniations with developmental spinal stenosis were reported and analyzed. Discectomy was performed after laminotomy. The patients were followed-up for an average of 4.4 years (range 2-7 years). The preoperative symptoms disappeared completely in 28 patients, in 13 patients some degree of backache remained although their nerve root pain had been relieved, and in 1 patient intermittent claudication reappeared after 6 years resolution of their preoperative pain. We conclude that when developmental spinal stenosis is combined with disc herniation, discectomy through laminotomy rather than laminectomy is usually sufficient for decompression."

Thirteen of 16 patients (81%) who had successful fusion of pseudarthrosis had a satisfactory outcome, whereas only 3 of 13 patients (23%) who had failed pseudarthrosis repair had a satisfactory outcome. Successful pseudarthrosis repair is the key to a high clinical success rate in revision surgery for failed back surgery syndrome. Pseudarthrosis repair by conventional posterolateral fusion with postoperative lumbosacral corset immobilization showed a high failure rate. The success rate of reoperation on failed back surgery syndrome patients is low."
CD007431,0,8594287,0,Diagnosis and management of lumbar disk disease.,"Acute low-back pain is one of the most common problems encountered by primary-care physicians. A few patients have severe neurologic impairment or evidence of cancer or other serious underlying systemic illness. For such patients, a broad differential diagnosis must be considered, and a prompt work-up and specialty consultation may be necessary. For most patients with acute low-back pain, extensive laboratory and imaging tests are unnecessary, and rapid improvement can be expected with only simple treatment measures. Physical therapy is useful in patients with refractory symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging and other sophisticated spinal imaging should usually be reserved for patients who are being considered for an operation. Surgical referral should be considered for the patient with a documented lumbar disk herniation that correlates precisely with clinical findings. Surgical treatment is usually elective in patients with persistent radicular pain and a mild to moderate neurologic deficit, urgent in patients with severe or progressive monoradiculopathy, and emergent in patients with the cauda equina syndrome. Lumbar diskectomy with magnified vision is the surgical procedure of choice, and success rates of 80 to 90% can be expected in properly selected patients."
CD007431,0,15830972,0,Percutaneous cervical nucleoplasty using coblation technology. Clinical results in fifty consecutive cases.,"Conventional open cervical discectomy, with or without bony fusion, in common neurosurgical knowledge is considered the standard treatment for cervical disc herniation. Percutaneous procedures are minimally invasive and offer decreased morbidity, require no bone graft and promise shorter recuperation time. Nevertheless, candidates for a percutaneous procedure as inclusion criteria must complain of symptoms related to contained herniated disc or focal protrusion. It does not substitute conventional open procedures required for extruded discs. We used the coblation technology for nucleoplasty of the cervical intervertebral discs. Early and long-term effects and/or complications observed with this procedure have not been reported yet. Fifty consecutive patients presenting with contained herniated cervical disc or focal protrusion causing compression of the cervical roots or cervical pain underwent a nucleoplasty procedure on the pathological disc. A randomized control group of twenty patients was treated conservatively with medical and physical therapy in the same period and completed the identical follow-up form. In the nucleoplasty group results were complete resolution of symptoms in 80% of cases, only 10% referred some residual cervical or radicular pain and are still under follow-up with a wait-and-see prospective. Patients who did not have a clinical resolution were treated with alternative traditional methods (10%). Despite the relative low cases number and the limited follow-up the encouraging results induce us to utilize this technique in well-selected cases."
CD007431,0,6456101,0,The present status of spinal fusion in the treatment of lumbar intervertebral joint disorders.,"Every type of fusion has its enthusiastic supporters. Unfortunately, the literature includes comparative analyses of various fusion procedures. Much of the effort spent in the clinical assessment of spinal fusion must be reinvested; neither the indications for diskectomy nor spinal fusion have been sufficiently clear-cut and accurately recorded. Moreover, spinal fusions often have not been applied to treat the disorder or to correct the deformity. It is essential at the outset to establish the mechanical fault; this is achieved only by a thorough understanding of the underlying pathologic lesion. Diagnosis follows a careful history and physical examination assisted by plain radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension, radiographs (anteroposterior in left and right lateral bending), and by information obtained from the CAT scan. We have designed a protocol for a prospective investigation wherein a specific fault with a specific etiology and pathologic anatomy is identified and submitted to a surgical procedure in a specified sequence. In future reviews, emphasis must be paid to selection of patients, the individual joint requiring stabilization and the type of fusion performed.

The survey of 50 reviewed cases after evaluation of the subjective and objective clinical pictures according to the Cabot method allowed us to come to the conclusion that this percutaneous methodology is suitable to relieve damaged discs from compression. It is also well accepted by patients because it is not too traumatic, it requires short-term hospitalisation, presents no risk of post-operative fibrosis and does not create complications for the eventual traditional operation when unsuccessful. It is extremely important to accurately select the candidates keeping in mind the original indications given by Onik for percutaneous discectomy for which--in case of contained disc herniation--leg pain (sciatalgia) is more severe than low back pain affecting the lumbar region."

CD007431,0,16552534,0,In vivo quantification of human lumbar disc degeneration using T(1rho)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.,"Diagnostic methods and biomarkers of early disc degeneration are needed as emerging treatment technologies develop (e.g., nucleus replacement, total disc arthroplasty, cell therapy, growth factor therapy) to serve as an alternative to lumbar spine fusion in treatment of low back pain. We have recently demonstrated in cadaveric human discs an MR imaging and analysis technique, spin-lock T(1rho)-weighted MRI, which may provide a quantitative, objective, and non-invasive assessment of disc degeneration. The goal of the present study was to assess the feasibility of using T(1rho) MRI in vivo to detect intervertebral disc degeneration. We evaluated ten asymptomatic 40-60-year-old subjects. Each subject was imaged on a 1.5 T whole-body clinical MR scanner. Mean T(1rho) values from a circular region of interest in the center of the nucleus pulposus were calculated from maps generated from a series of T(1rho)-weighted images. The degenerative grade of each lumbar disc was assessed from conventional T(2)-weighted images according to the Pfirmann classification system. The T(1rho) relaxation correlated significantly with disc degeneration (r=-0.51, P<0.01) and the values were consistent with our previous cadaveric study, in which we demonstrated correlation between T(1rho) and proteoglycan content. The technique allows for spatial measurements on a continuous rather than an integer-based scale, minimizes the potential for observer bias, has a greater dynamic range than T(2)-weighted imaging, and can be implemented on a 1.5 T clinical scanner without significant hardware modifications. Thus, there is a strong potential to use T(1rho) in vivo as a non-invasive biomarker of proteoglycan loss and early disc degeneration."

CD007431,0,15681269,0,The impact of neurodynamic testing on the perception of experimentally induced muscle pain.,"Neurodynamic tests such as the straight leg raising (SLR) and slump test are frequently used for assessment of mechanosensitivity of neural tissues. However, there is ongoing debate in the literature regarding the contributions of neural and non-neural tissues to the elicited symptoms because many structures are affected by these tests. Sensitizing manoeuvres are limb or spinal movements added to neurodynamic tests, which aim to identify the origin of the symptoms by preferentially loading or unloading neural structures. A prerequisite for the use of sensitizing manoeuvres to identify neural involvement is that the addition of sensitizing manoeuvres has no impact on pain perception when the origin of the pain is non-neural. In this study, experimental muscle pain was induced by injection of hypertonic saline in tibialis anterior or soleus in 25 asymptomatic, naive volunteers. A first experiment investigated the impact of hip adduction, abduction, medial and lateral rotation in the SLR position. In a second experiment, the different stages of the slump test were examined. The intensity and area of experimentally induced muscle pain did not increase when sensitizing manoeuvres were added to the SLR or throughout the successive stages of the slump test. The findings of this study lend support to the validity of the use of sensitizing manoeuvres during neurodynamic testing."

The rate of finding of NRA by operation was 0.34%, that was far lower than by myelography and autopsy. Careful exploration can increase the finding rate. NRA can induce backache and sciatica by itself. Its clinical distinguishing features were severe symptoms, compression of multiple nerve roots slight or negative Lasegue sign. The principle of treatment of NRA was adequate decompression, but should be careful to avoid injury of displaced and tensile nerve roots. In this paper, the matters needing attention in operation was discussed as well."

CD007431,0,17460175,0,Lumbar spinal stenosis in elderly patients.,"Over a 3-year period in our clinic, surgeons operated on 32 persons over 65 years old with lumbar spinal stenosis. This article presents the retrospective analysis of the clinical, radiological, and short-term surgical outcomes. The stenosis seen most commonly among the elderly develops focally at the intervertebral junctions as a result of a complex process of disc degeneration, facet arthropathy, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, spondylosis, and sometimes spondylolisthesis. All patients underwent a midline decompressive laminectomy with foraminotomies at the affected levels, and discectomy was performed in persons with lumbar disc hernia. Average age was 71.15 +/- 5.09 (65-80); 50% (16) were women, and 50% (16) were men. The most frequent symptoms were pain (96.9%) and neurological claudication (90.6%). The average preoperative duration of the symptoms was 139.87 +/- 115.03 weeks. The most frequent neurological symptoms were reflex disturbances (62.5%), Lasèques's sign (SLR) (+)(53%), and motor deficit (50%). The anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal was less than 11.5 mm in 71.9% of the cases. In 62.5% of the patients, partial recovery was observed in the short term; 68.8% of the patients underwent laminectomy. Of those, 87.5% had total and 12.5% had partial laminectomies. In addition to laminectomy, discectomy was performed in 31.3% of the patients. Total laminectomy was more likely to be performed on patients older than 65 years, because the anteroposterior diameter was more likely to be below 11.5 mm in this cohort of patients. In lumbar stenosis, surgical treatment-decompression-is an effective method. Surgery has been demonstrated to be effective even in patients over the age of 75 years."

The characteristic symptoms of pain, sensory changes, and intermittent pseudoclaudication in connection with the extent of nerve root compression confirmed by laboratory examinations and the operative findings allow the author to stress the following points. (1) In Greece, lumbar spinal stenosis syndrome is not a very common entity. (2) Spinal stenosis cases of acquired type are the most common while those of developmental character are very rare, only two in this series, (3) Surgical intervention, which is the treatment of choice, includes a generous decompressive procedure that must free all the neural elements. Sometimes it is necessary to remove part or all of the facets in one or more levels. (4) The rate of complications is low, and complications are of minor character. (5) The results on the whole are very satisfactory and lasting, provided the planning and execution of the operation are based on sound preoperative assessment using both clinical examination and laboratory investigation. (6) Development of the acquired form of stenosis of the spine seems not to be preventable. The pathogenesis of the syndrome has not been fully established."

Soleus muscles were used for S1, tibialis anterior (TA) for L5, and rectus femoris (RF) muscles for L4 roots. According to the clinical or radiological diagnosis (CAT, MRI and/or myelography) conventional needle EMG was capable to localise the root lesion in 16 of 20 patients (80%) and ES localised the root involvement in 18 of 20 patients (90%); the diagnostic value of MCS was lower, about 65% (13 of 20 patients). Although ES is uncomfortable and invasive, it is superior to needle EMG in localising unilateral or multiple lumbosacral root involvement. At present, MCS is not suitable for the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy."

CD007431,0,6741627,0,The syndrome of the central L-3-herniated disc with special emphasis on motor involvement.,"Literature about the clinical characteristics of herniation of the lumbar intervertebral disc is profuse. Due to their predominant frequency, attention was almost entirely devoted to the L-4 and L-5 prolapses. As clinical accuracy still remains a very important target, specially in departments where myelography is not used for the diagnosis of this entity, the authors thought it of interest to describe the clinical picture of the L-3-herniated disc. Special stress is placed on the motor involvement. Fourteen cases form this series. They were all central soft herniations. Cases of spondylotic narrow spinal canal were excluded. The special features were their predominance in people above 50 years old and the compromise of the hip abductors and internal rotator muscle groups making it impossible for the patient to stand on the affected limb (Trendelenburg sign). An abnormal knee jerk was a frequent accompaniment. Contrary to common knowledge the quadriceps muscle strength was almost unaffected. Sensory disturbances were not useful for location. The L-3 section of the lower lumbar spine is the narrowest explaining the reason why 3/4 of the patients had a more or less complete cauda equina syndrome. It was therefore a very dangerous herniation that crippled quickly, needing usually an emergency operation with all the risks involved in this older age group of patients."
CD007431,0,3004115,0,Intradiscal collagenase for treatment of lumbar disc herniations. A comparison of clinical results and computed tomography follow-up.,"In a series of 34 patients with herniated lumbar discs, treated by intradiscal injection of highly purified collagenase, the post-treatment course has been followed-up clinically and by repeated computed tomographies (CT). Good or excellent results have been achieved in 17 patients. An only slight improvement of pain was noted in 2 patients. Fifteen patients had to be operated on due to not improved or worsened clinical symptoms. The most striking result of our CT follow-up was a tendency of the disc herniation to increase initially after collagenase injection. About two thirds of the patients had such an increase at the one week after injection control. After 6 weeks this rate had decreased to only about one quarter, but in the meantime 13 patients had to be operated. Only after 6 months most hernias of the up till then not operated patients were smaller and none were larger than before treatment. There was also a transient density decrease of the treated disc, most pronounced one week after collagenase injection. At controls 6 months later density had reached again pre-treatment levels. It is likely that the volume increase tendency of the disc material after collagenase injection is responsible for a worsening of the clinical symptoms, which not seldomly occurs during the initial post-treatment period, and in some patients makes an operation necessary."

Dural or radicular scar tissue was present by computed tomography in 88% of the patients, but the findings could not be correlated with the clinical outcome. Recurrent or persistent disc herniation was found in 9% of the patients. The clinical outcome of patients with abnormal computed tomography did not differ significantly from patients without this finding. A relation between facet joint degeneration and less successful clinical outcome was demonstrated. Computed tomography (without contrast) 3 months after surgery gave little information which could be correlated with the clinical outcome.

The patient will have leg pain as the dominant symptom and a 50% reduction in straight-leg raising with or without bowstring discomfort and crossover pain. Neurologic symptoms and signs are usual, as are abnormal results of contrast studies, which will verify the level of involvement. In 220 randomly selected patients who met criteria for the diagnosis of sciatica due to a herniated intervertebral disc and did not have psychogenic or nonorganic spinal pain, a spinal stenosis or a history of a previous, unsuccessful operation to relieve the sciatica, chemonucleolysis had a success rate of 80%. The only complications were a severe anaphylactic reaction in two patients and lesser, delayed reactions in five others. All of the reactions were successfully treated. Of the 45 patients in whom chemonucleolysis was unsuccessful, 38 underwent a laminectomy. In 3 of the 38 the results of chemonucleolysis were initially good, but later the disc herniation recurred; thus, the long-term treatment failure rate was 1.4%."

CD007431,0,3296236,0,Chemonucleolysis versus surgery in lumbar disc herniations: correlation of the results to preoperative clinical pattern and size of the herniation.,"A prospective study was carried out on the results of chemonucleolysis or surgery in 156 patients who had lumbar disc herniations. All patients were considered as potentially good candidates for chemonucleolysis. Seventy-two received a chymopapain injection and 84 underwent surgery. Based on computerized tomography (CT) scan and/or myelography the herniations were distinguished as small, medium, and large. Also distinguished were three types of preoperative clinical patterns, Type A, Type B and Type C, corresponding to slight, moderate, and severe nerve root compression, respectively. Follow-up evaluations were made 1 month, 3 months, and an average of 2.8 years after treatment. The patients with a small disc herniation, who underwent chemonucleolysis, did slightly better as a group than those treated surgically. At 1 month, the proportions of satisfactory results were 75% in the chemonucleolysis group and 62% in the surgery series. At final follow-up, the proportions were 84% and 82%, respectively, but the ratio of excellent-to-good results was higher in the chemonucleolysis group. In the latter, most patients with satisfactory outcomes had a Type A or Type B clinical pattern. In medium-size herniations the results of surgery were slightly better than those of chemonucleolysis. At 1 month, 55% of patients in the chemonucleolysis group had satisfactory results compared with 74% of those in the surgery series; at final follow-up the proportions were, respectively, 76% and 86%. In the chemonucleolysis group most satisfactory outcomes were found in patients with a Type A or Type B clinical pattern. The results of chemonucleolysis in patients who had large herniations were significantly inferior to those of surgery: at final follow-up the results were satisfactory in 50% of patients in the chemonucleolysis group and 89% of those in the surgery series. Chemonucleolysis appears to be the treatment of choice in most patients with small disc herniations and an effective alternative to surgery in most patients with medium-size herniations when the preoperative clinical pattern indicates a slight or moderate nerve root compression. In all large herniations and in small- or medium-size herniations causing a severe nerve root impingement, surgery should be preferred to chemonucleolysis."
CD007431,0,3464087,0,On assessment of shoulder exercise and load-elicited pain in the cervical spine. Biomechanical analysis of load--EMG--methodological studies of pain provoked by extreme position.,"Biomechanical analyses of load on locomotor structures are essential parts of physical therapy. Load moments of force, compressive and shear joint forces are associated with the risk of eliciting pain or causing excessive load during work and leisure activities as well as during rehabilitative training exercises. Two common therapeutic exercise movements were analysed with special emphasis on the effects of patient positioning on the load relations. Resistance was provided by an ordinary pulley apparatus. A computerized static model was developed, where positioning angle, pulley cord force and pulley distance could be varied. The best adaptation between the curves for induced load moment about the shoulder joint and maximum isometric muscle moment through joint angles was obtained when the subject during internal rotation exercises sat with the pulley located 40 degrees anterior to, and during external rotation exercises 20 degrees posterior to, a frontal plane through the shoulders at a distance of 1.3 m from the joint. EMG was recorded from the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and anterior deltoid muscles during internal rotation exercises, and from infraspinatus, deltoid and trapezius during external rotation. Pectoralis major and infraspinatus were the most active muscles during internal and external rotation respectively. Two methodological studies were made concerning pain provoked by loading joints in maintained extreme positions (i.e. positions at the limit of the motion sector). Sensations of discomfort/pain from healthy elbow and knee joints maintained in an extreme position increased with duration of provocation and decreased slowly after removal of loading weight. Using such joint loadings, a comparison of the Visual Analogue Scale with Borg's category-ratio scale showed that both be can be used for reliable assessments of load-elicited pain intensity. In one study cervical spine extreme position was found to be associated with sitting work postures where the thoraco-lumbar spine was slightly inclined backwards or where the whole spine was flexed. Healthy subjects participated in an experimental study in which a position involving extreme flexion of the lower-cervical-upper-thoracic spine (similar to a common work posture) was maintained. Pain was experienced by all ten subjects within 15 minutes, disappeared 15 minutes after the end of provocation, but was again experienced by nine subjects the same evening or the next morning and lasted up to four days. Neck extensor muscle activity was low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,3887196,0,[Chymopapain allergy. Diagnostic value of a skin test before and after chemonucleolysis].,"Chemonucleolysis with Chymopapain (Chymodiactin, Disease) bears the risk of unpredictable anaphylactic reactions. The rate of anaphylaxis is reported to be between 0.35 and 1.5%. Serological in vitro tests such as RAST (Radio Allergo Sorbent Test) or ChymoFAST (Fluorescent Allergo Sorbent Test) are used to determine increased specific IgE antibody titres against chymopapain in patients submitted to chemonucleolysis for lumbar disc disease. Alternatively skin prick tests have also been applied in clinical trials. A skin prick test including Discase, Chymodiactin and Solutrast 250 M, which is a radiopaque dye used for discography, has been performed in a total of 208 patients. One-hundred and seventy-seven patients were tested before, 31 patients were tested after chemonucleolysis with chymopapain. From the group tested before chemonucleolysis, 2.3-3.5% had positive skin testes. After chemonucleolysis, the overall allergy rate to chymopapain increased to 41.9%. Positive skin reactions seem to be time-dependent: Between the 3rd and 12th week after chemonucleolysis more than 70% of the patients had positive skin tests. There was no correlation between a history of previous allergy and the skin test result. Patients with positive skin tests should be excluded from chemonucleolysis. This procedure increases the safety for patients submitted to chemonucleolysis. No anaphylactic reaction has been observed hitherto in nearly 350 patients who were treated with the intradiscal injection of chymopapain following a negative skin prick test."

Clinical aspect and surgical management].,"We report a retrospective analysis of a series of 32 cases of lumbar synovial cysts. Clinically, two populations were identified: patients who presented radicular pain mimicking the clinical diagnosis of disk herniation (group I) and patients who presented neurogenic claudication consistent with a diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis (group II). The radiological work-up consisted in standard X-rays and CT-scan for all patients. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) was performed in 14 patients. All the patients were operated on. The surgical technique consisted in foraminotomy for patients in group I and more or less extensive laminectomy for patients in group II. Functional outcome was marked by a significant improvement in 96.9% of the patients and those who presented a motor deficit recovered in 83% of the cases. Based on the findings in this series, we discuss the clinical aspects and the therapeutic management of this pathological entity."
CD007431,0,2027513,0,Motor compensatory reactions following a forward fall in subjects with unilateral abolition of the triceps-surae H reflex.,"The electromyograms of the right and left soleus and tibialis anterior muscles of 6 subjects with unilateral abolition of Achilles tendon reflex due to S1 radiculitis were recorded during a forward fall involving stepping to recover balance. Each subject took part in two series of experiments, one in which the step was performed with the unaffected leg and a second in which the affected leg was used. A unilateral deficiency of peripheral proprioceptive afferents affected ankle muscles EMG activities bilaterally, except for the EMG activity of the soleus of the starting foot. The tibialis anterior of both the affected and the unaffected side, showed either a normal pattern (i.e. a phasic contraction after soleus contraction stopped), or an early contraction. On the stance side, the early contraction was associated with a depressed soleus EMG activity. Some abnormal motor patterns could be due to the ipsilateral deficiency of the Ia inhibitory projection from soleus to tibialis anterior. The presence of abnormal patterns on the unaffected side indicates that the motor activity in one lower limb can be modified by a loss of peripheral afference in the contralateral limb. This suggests that crossed pathways between lower limbs are involved in balance recovery movement."

CD007431,0,9795811,0,The correlation between magnetic resonance imaging and the operative and clinical findings after lumbar microdiscectomy.,"Fifty-four consecutive patients were studied prospectively with magnetic resonance imaging before microdiscectomy, and the findings correlated with clinical symptoms before and after operation. A sequestrated fragment was found in 59% of cases, a subligamentous disc sequestration in 25% and a disc protrusion in 16%. The levels operated on were L4/5-36%, L5/S1-62.5%, and one at L3/4; 71% were laterally placed, 10% lay intraforaminal and 10% medial. The diameter of the protrusion was 4 mm to 13 mm for the craniocaudal extension, and 5 mm to 18 mm for the anteroposterior extension. No correlation could be found between a neurological deficit and the size of the prolapse. A positive correlation was present between the increasing degree of canal obstruction and the degree of disc degeneration determined by imaging for extrusions, subligamentous disc sequestrations and free sequestrations. Nerve root inflammation and enlargement was seen in 36% of the images, corresponding to an operative finding of 32%. Magnetic resonance imaging is a helpful pre-operative diagnostic investigation which shows structural changes in the disc and the correct localisation and size of the disc sequestration, but there was no correlation between the imaging findings and the clinical symptoms."

To investigate if low-dose chymopapain could reduce this adverse reaction, without modifying the efficacy, 118 patients with persistent low-back and radicular pain due to a lumbar disc herniation underwent chemonucleolysis. 60 patients were randomly selected to receive 2 mL of standard-dose chymopapain (4,000 units) and 58 to receive 2 mL of low dose (2,000 units). The clinical outcome was assessed on study days 1, 30, and 60, and after 1 year by physicians who were unaware of the treatment, and on the basis of the patients' self evaluation. At day 60, Chemonucleolysis was rated as successful in 81% of the cases by the investigator and in 80% by the patient's self assessment. The percentage of good results was remarkably similar in the two treatment groups and this finding was confirmed after 1 year. There was some evidence that the low-dose treatment resulted in less frequent postoperative back pain but the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, a comparable incidence of acute low-back pain and spasm was observed in the two treatment groups. Low-dose chemonucleolysis appears to be as effective as the standard dose, but the use of 2,000 units does not significantly lower the postoperative back pain."

Five readers interpreted the thermograms in a blinded fashion. A moderate degree of agreement was noted in tests of intraobserver and interobserver variability. The sensitivity of thermography ranged from 78% to 94% compared with 81% to 92% for imaging studies and 77% for EMG. The specificity of thermography ranged from 20% to 44%. Thermography predicted the level of the radiculopathy correctly in less than 50% of cases. Thermography has little or no utility in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy.

There is almost general agreement that neither neurosurgical treatment nor chemonucleolysis is appropriate in patients with this clinical pattern. We used chemonucleolysis in 19 patients with recurrent episodes of isolated low back pain and one patient with severe permanent isolated low back pain dating back to a conservatively-treated episode of sciatica. All 20 patients had disk herniation documented by imaging studies. A very good or satisfactory outcome was recorded in ten patients after three months, 11 after six months and 12 in March 1993 after a mean follow-up of 72 months. The treatment was well tolerated, even in those patients who were not improved; a single patient developed an episode of acute low back pain that required surgical treatment. In patients with low back pain and disk herniation, there is currently no means of determining whether a causal relationship links these two abnormalities. Nevertheless, we believe that chemonucleolysis can be proposed in severe forms, provided the patients are apprised of current success rates."

Each group was treated for four weeks and patients were reviewed at the end of this period and at 12 months after entry to the trial. The prescription of analgesics and the pain score were significantly reduced in all three treated groups, but there was no difference between the three groups.

CD007431,0,2397046,0,Prognosis for recovery of bladder function following lumbar central disc prolapse.,"From a retrospective review of 932 patients undergoing surgery for prolapsed lumbar intervertebral disc a group of 33 cases with acute urinary retention was studied. There was no identifiable factor which predisposed this subgroup of patients to cauda equina compression. The mean duration of bladder paralysis prior to operation was 3.6 days. Ultimately almost 79% of patients claimed full recovery of bladder function, but only 22% were left without sensory deficit in the limbs or perineum. There was no correlation between recovery and the duration of bladder paralysis before surgery, except in three patients in whom there was no sciatica and where the correct diagnosis was delayed for many days. Retention developing less than 48 h after an acute prolapse was associated with a poorer prognosis. Despite claims that bladder paralysis should be treated with the same urgency as an extradural haematoma, there is no evidence in this study or in the literature to support the view that emergency surgery has any bearing upon the degree of clinical recovery. The exception may be if decompression can be undertaken within 6 h, the time estimated for axonal ischaemia to become irreversible. This should not however engender complacency in the management of this condition, which still requires prompt treatment. Whilst any apparent delay to surgery may have medicolegal implications should the patient fail to recover completely, in the majority of cases the die is cast at the time the prolapse occurs."

Diagnostic-accuracy data varied significantly between studies; therefore meaningful pooled summary statistics could not be reported. Twenty-seven studies had major methodologic flaws including biased test interpretations, faulty cohort assembly, poor clinical descriptions, and small sample size.

CD007431,0,7679625,0,"Tibialis anterior R-1 response: physiological behaviour, normative data and clinical utility in L4-L5 radicular compression.","A modified H-reflex, known as R-1 response, was recorded in healthy subjects by averaging 200 responses from the moderately contracting tibialis anterior muscle (TA) after repetitive submaximal stimulation of common peroneal nerve. Physiological changes to different modes of stimulation and recording were studied and normative data obtained at the most reliable parameters. Subsequently, the test is applied to 36 patients with clinical and myelographic evidences of L5 or L4-L5 radicular compression (with or without S1 radicular compression). Increasing the force of muscle contraction resulted in increase in amplitude up to a certain limit, with no change in latency. Increasing the current from subliminal to submaximal stimulation caused initial increase and subsequent fall in the amplitude without change in the latency. The change in the stimulus frequency from 0.5 to 3 Hz did not alter latency or amplitude but the higher frequencies sometimes did. On changing the position of the foot from plantarflexed to dorsiflexed, an increase in amplitude and reduction in duration of the response was noted. Fifty subjects were studied using stimulus intensity just enough to produce 200-400 microV M-response, stimulus duration of 1.0 msec, stimulus rate of 3 Hz and the muscle force sufficient to keep the foot in complete dorsiflexion. The tibialis anterior R-1 response (TAR-1) could be recorded reliably from both legs in all the subjects. The take-off point was sharp and in no subject was there any difficulty in measuring the latency to onset point. On repeating the test, the onset point of the response was superimposable. Latency showed linear correlation with height and age. Among the patients, 21 out of 25 cases of unilateral (84.0%) and 10 out of 11 cases of bilateral (90.9%) radicular compression had abnormal findings. Abnormalities included significant a right-left latency difference within the normal range of absolute latencies, unilateral or bilateral prolongation of latency to onset point and attenuation or absence of the response. It was concluded that the TAR-1 is an important and reliable test for the study of functional integrity of L4-L5 spinal segments in lumbo-sacral sensorimotor root lesions."
CD007431,0,11734957,0,CT-guided injection of botulinic toxin for percutaneous therapy of piriformis muscle syndrome with preliminary MRI results about denervative process.,"Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is a cause of sciatica, leg or buttock pain and disability. The pain is usually increased by muscular contraction, palpation or prolonged sitting. The aim of our paper was to evaluate the feasibility of CT-guided percutaneous botulinic toxin (BTX) injection for the purpose of PMS treatment. Thirty patients suffering from PMS, suspected with clinical and electrophysiological criteria, after imaging examinations excluding other causes of sciatic pain, resulted positive at the lidocaine test and were treated by intramuscular injection of BTX type A under CT guidance. The follow-up (12 months) was performed with clinical examination in all cases and with MR 3 months after the procedure in 9 patients to evaluate the denervative process entity of the treated muscle. In 26 cases relief of symptoms was obtained after 5-7 days. In 4 patients an insufficient relief of pain justified a second percutaneous treatment which was clinically successful. No complications or side effects were recorded after BTX injection. The MR examination showed a signal intensity change of the treated muscle in 7 patients due to the denervative process of PM, whereas in the remaining 2 cases only an atrophy of the treated muscle was detected. Larger series are necessary to confirm these MRI preliminary results. The CT-guided BTX injection in the PMS is an emergent and feasible technique that obtains an excellent local therapeutic effect without risk of imprecise inoculation."

During a two year period 616 patients were operated, 47 patients had to be excluded, 107 patients did not receive HDHE desired by the surgeon; 462 patients received HDHE as described in the protocol. Because the distribution of age, sex, duration of hospitalisation of the 107 patients without HDHE is the same as in the HDHE group, this group can be used as control group.

Of these patients, those with spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis or those who had had previous surgery were excluded. The patients were treated by chemonucleolysis or by surgery. The information in the various parts of the protocol allowed: (1) identification of the joint at risk, (2) the generic type of injury (torsion or compression), and (3) the procedure of choice for each patient. The outcome was predicted from the operation report using a demerit system for each deviation from the procedure of choice. It was possible to predict from this information only, with a high degree of accuracy (94%), the outcome 2 years later. It was also possible to compare the efficacy of the various types of intervention, especially chemonucleolysis versus a variety of surgical procedures."

Symptoms remained significantly improved 1 year or more after injection for 55% of those treated with chymopapain and for 46% of those treated with placebo. The difference is not statistically significant. However, to discard chemonucleolysis on the basis of this one small clinical trial may be premature. Since continuing controversy has re-established a climate in which another double-blind study of chemonucleolysis is ethically feasible and scientifically desirable, we favor additional clinical trials under a tightly controlled protocol to help resolve the issue."
CD007431,0,3833967,0,The multiply operated lumbar spine.,"In conclusion, it needs to be stressed that the physician should take an organized approach in evaluating the multiply operated spine patient. The origin of the problem in most patients is a faulty decision to perform the original procedure. Further surgery on an ""exploratory"" basis is not warranted and will lead only to further disability. Another operation is indicated only when there are objective findings to justify it. Multiply operated back patients need a total assessment. The cause of each patient's complaints must be accurately localized and identified. In addition to the orthopaedic evaluation, the patient's psychologic and general medical status must be thoroughly investigated. Once the spine is identified as the source of his symptoms, specific features should be sought in the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and roentgenographic studies. The number of previous operations, characteristics of the pain-free interval, and predominance of leg versus back pain are the major historical points. The neurologic examination and the presence of a tension sign are the important physical findings. Plain roentgenograms, motion films, metrizamide myelography, and computerized axial tomography have a specific place in the work-up. When all the information is integrated, the physician can separate patients with mechanical problems from those with arachnoiditis. If repeat surgery is undertaken, the approach must be a new level because the dura has no osseous protection at the previous laminectomy site. The midline scar tissue should be left intact and the nerve roots exposed laterally. Finally, the surgeon should be prepared to repair a dural tear, for this is the most common complication of a repeat laminectomy."

Preoperative affliction and postoperative recovery in 150 cases.,"We studied prospectively 165 consecutive patients operated on for lumbar disc herniations. Neurologic examination was performed preoperatively and at 4, 12, and 24 months postoperatively according to a protocol. Preoperatively 69% of the patients showed a neurological disturbance corresponding to the level of disc herniation and 62% a corresponding sensory deficit. Recovery of the neurological deficit was seen in half of the cases at 2 years postoperatively, the main part of this improvement occurred within 4 months after the operation. Neurologic recovery correlated to a good surgical outcome, and a short history of disc herniation prior to the operation correlated to postoperative neurologic improvement. The straight leg raising test correlated to preoperative neurologic deficit, but not to postoperative recovery. Motor power disturbance of the extensor hallucis longus muscle recovered in more patients than reflex disturbances. Sensory disturbances had the lowest recovery rate.

Patients with intact anulus drew fewer modalities, but more often marked pain in the trunk, neck and upper extremities, than those with ruptured anulus. Certain pain-drawing patterns--e.g., extra text, arrows and nonanatomical pain distribution--have previously been shown to correlate to unfavorable pathological traits in psychometric tests in populations of patients with chronic low back pain. In our study, most of these so-called nonorganic pain-pattern items occurred equally often in the 2 groups. In fact, one third of the patients with ruptured anulus produced pathological drawings according to the scoring system designed by Ransford et al. (1976). Although pain drawings help the investigator to obtain a rapid overview of the patient's pain pattern, the use of penalty points as a preoperative psychological screening instrument in patients with pain that is not chronic may be questioned."
CD007431,0,6719256,0,The relationship of structural pathology to the nerve root.,"Lumbar spinal nerves may be entrapped (a) at the back of the disc (b) laterally in the central canal, (c) in the cauda equina, (d) more laterally in the nerve canal, and (e) posteriorly in the zygapophyseal joints. There is a spectrum of degenerative change in both joints and disc. Changes at these three sites can produce (a) dysfunction, (b) disc herniation, (c) instability, (d) lateral entrapment, and (e) central stenosis. The clinical significance is that many patients become symptom free on nonoperative treatment. Some with nerve entrapment require decompression. Those with instability may need a fusion. The pain from a disc lesion or from stenosis may come from irritation and inflammation of the dura. The motor loss in these lesions may be due to reflex inhibition and vascular insufficiency rather than from nerve compression. It is vitally important to identify accurately the nerve that is entrapped."

CD007431,0,6719254,0,Anatomic and clinical studies of radicular symptoms.,"Anatomic studies using cadavers showed that three factors are responsible for radicular symptoms. The first is congenital or acquired abnormalities of nerves and nerve roots--the intradural segmental arrangement of rootlets, congenital anomalies of the nerve roots, and the furcal nerve. Another factor is changes of bone and soft tissue around nerves and nerve roots--indentation of nerve roots and extremely transverse courses of nerve roots. The third factor is a correlation of two other factors--spatial relationship of the nervous tissue to osseous and nonosseous elements of the spinal canal and the intervertebral foramen. In the intervertebral foramen, the nerve root is surrounded by a rather thick membranous structure, an epiradicular sheath, which is responsible for a tubular form obtained in nerve root infiltration. Anatomic abnormalities can be observed in contrast studies, but the defects revealed do not correspond necessarily with neurologic symptoms. In such cases, nerve root infiltration is very useful for a functional diagnosis. The analysis of radicular symptoms with nerve root infiltration showed that radicular pain and/or claudication are caused mainly by single nerve root involvement, irrespective of the findings obtained by contrast studies. Furthermore, therapeutic effect of nerve root infiltration can be expected in any disease and it can be applied as a final trial of conservative treatment."
CD007431,0,1830437,0,[Pain in chronic arterial occlusive disease--the effect of improved macrocirculation on pseudo-radicular irritation].,"In chronic obliterating arteriopathy the maximum walking distance does not correlate well with the ankle arm index of arterial pressure measured by Doppler ultrasound. Beside reduced macrocirculation and microcirculatory maldistribution in skeletal muscle, pseudoradicular irritation was established as a relevant factor for the onset of pain during walking. The present study investigates the influence of the macrocirculation on hyperalgesia at rest in intermittent claudication. In 35 patients with chronic obliterating arteriopathy of the lower limbs (stage II according to Fontaine) the ankle/arm index of arterial pressure and the walking tolerance, as well as the pain at rest on applying pressure to the calf muscles were determined before and 3 weeks after percutaneous transluminar angioplasty (PTA). All 3 parameters improved after dilatation. Improved macrocirculation leads not only to a decreased production and improved clearance of pain-inducing metabolites in muscle tissue, but also--through a decrease of sympathetic stimulation of the muscle--to an elevation of the pain threshold. Apart from the reduction in pain-inducing metabolites, an absence of booster effects on pseudoradicular irritation and the regeneration of sensitive cutaneous afferents with resultant inhibition of reflex pain development are considered as possible factors in the achievement of pain relief following PTA."

Thirty patients, 18 female, 12 male, mean age 43.1 years, with primary BPS have been studied. In 83% of patients, BPS was caused by muscle tonic syndrome and in 17% the latter was combined with radiculopathy. Meloxicam therapy was conducted using intramuscular injections of 15 mg daily during 5 days with following oral drug intake (1 tablet daily). Treatment duration was 2 weeks. This treatment regime proved to be highly effective. The subjective meloxicam efficacy was the following: moderate--7%; good--30%; very good--33%; excellent--30%. Side effects, such as transient stomach pain, was observed only in 6.6% of patients. The main factors reducing meloxicam efficacy were affective disorders, namely, a level of depression and anxiety, and radiculopathy."

Forty patients with sciatica due to this diagnosis (confirmed by imaging) were treated either by chemonucleolysis or manipulation. Outcomes (leg pain, back pain and self-reported disability) were measured at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 months. The mean values for all outcomes improved in both groups. By 12 months, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome between the treatments, but manipulation produced a statistically significant greater improvement for back pain and disability in the first few weeks. A similar number from both groups required additional orthopaedic intervention; there were no serious complications. Crude cost analysis suggested an overall financial advantage from manipulation. Because osteopathic manipulation produced a 12-month outcome that was equivalent to chemonucleolysis, it can be considered as an option for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation, at least in the absence of clear indications for surgery. Further study into the value of manipulation at a more acute stage is warranted."
CD007431,0,6458028,0,Conservative management of low back pain.,"Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain may well have seen more progress in the past five years than in the previous 50. Specific diagnoses can be made by history and physical examination and can often be objectively documented by modern high-resolution computed tomographic scanning of the lumbar spine. A number of innovative conservative treatment modalities show great promise in decreasing the need for surgical intervention. Surgery is indicated only when appropriate conservative measures have failed. However, the greatest changes are yet to come. These will relate to prevention of low back pain through professional instruction of patients regarding activities, exercises, and life-style beneficial to the lumbar spine."

CD007431,0,3895860,0,Chymopapain chemonucleolysis: correlation of diagnostic radiographic factors and clinical outcome.,"The therapeutic response to treatment of lumbar disk herniation with chymopapain chemonucleolysis is significantly influenced by the criteria used for patient selection. Although careful clinical selection of patients reduces the frequency of treatment failure, some patients do not achieve satisfactory relief of pain with chemonucleolysis. In an attempt to identify objective pretreatment radiographic findings that might refine selection criteria and further reduce the failure rate of chemonucleolysis, a retrospective correlation of pretreatment radiographs and clinical responses was made of 200 consecutive chemonucleolysis patients. Marked improvement in sciatica occurred in 79.9% and 79.3% of patients at early and late follow-up, respectively. There was a significantly higher response rate, however, in patients who had definite radiographic evidence of focal disk herniation and in those patients with definite radiographic evidence of nerve-root compression (marked nerve-root deviation, nerve-root flattening or edema, root-sleeve amputation) by disk material. Those patients with a preinjection disk height greater than the mean had a slightly better response rate (91.1%) than those whose disk height was smaller than the mean (80.0%). Most cases of treatment failure could be attributed to an incorrect radiographic diagnosis, treatment of patients with equivocal diagnostic studies, the presence of ""free"" disk fragments, and causes of nerve-root compression unresponsive to chymopapain."

Although anatomy of the lumbar intervertebral foramen (including static and dynamic pathologic compression of the exiting nerve root) has been described, few studies have focused on the clinical and radiographic features of foraminal stenosis requiring surgical intervention. We retrospectively studied 65 patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis for presenting clinical and radiographic features and intraoperative findings. Symptoms included leg and back pain (100%), paresthesias (45%), and subjective weakness (31%). Examination revealed lumbar tenderness (71%), limited lumbar extension (57%), focal motor weakness (48%), and positive tension signs (42%). The L5 nerve root was most often involved (75%). Almost 50% of patients had already undergone spinal decompression surgery. Surgical procedures included laminectomy and foraminotomy (52 patients) and laminotomy and foraminotomy (23 patients). A concomitant arthrodesis was performed in 63 patients. There were 29 excellent, 25 good, 6 fair, and 5 poor results based on a modified outcome scale at 32.5-month follow-up. Findings suggest that foraminal stenosis is a frequent cause of persistent symptoms after surgery, is most common at the lumbosacral junction, is best identified on parasagittal magnetic resonance images or on images reconstructed with computed tomography, and may be static or dynamic in etiology."

The midline disk herniation is identified as a focal midline dural sac compression and is better seen on the lateral myelogram and computed tomography scan. Of the 22 patients in this study, 14 had midline lumbar disk herniations at L4-5. Their presenting symptoms including back pain with sciatica, were similar to those of lateral disk herniations. On physical examination, however, patients commonly had only positive root tension signs with few nerve root deficits. The incidence of cauda equina syndrome was 27%. The results of treatment were much poorer in these patients than results reported with lateral herniations; 41% were good, 27% fair, and 32% poor. Surgical decompression yielded the best results. A wide exposure is usually needed to provide adequate decompression."

We compared 100 patients with disc herniation (mean age 43 years), 100 with lataral spinal stenosis (41 years) and 100 with central spinal stenosis (65 years), using a standard protocol of common signs and symptoms. The diagnoses were established by one or more of myelography, CT, MRI and nerve-root block, and all were confirmed at operation. The preoperative duration of symptoms was significantly shorter in patients with disc herniation. Pain at rest, at night, and on coughing was as common in lateral stenosis as in disc herniation, but regular consumption of analgesics was more common in patients with disc herniation. Positive straight-leg-raising tests were more common in disc herniation than in lateral stenosis and were uncommon in central stenosis. Motor disturbances were seen most often in central spinal stenosis, especially patellar reflex changes. Sensory disturbances were most common in patients with complete disc herniation."
CD007431,0,1991739,0,Spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer.,"Fifty-five patients with severe pain from spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer were referred to Hope Hospital, none being judged to be in a terminal condition. One patient had too extensive disease for surgery so 54 were treated by 55 spinal stabilisations; 49 obtained complete relief of pain and two had partial relief. There were three failures. Twenty-eight of the patients had clinical evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and were decompressed at the time of stabilisation. Of these, 20 had major recovery of neurological function. Patients with pre-operative evidence of extradural tumour had 'prophylactic' decompression at the time of stabilisation; none of these patients later developed signs of cord or cauda equina compression. The results suggest that alleviation of pain and restoration of mobility are best achieved by segmental spinal stabilisation; a few patients require a combined anterior and posterior stabilisation. Postoperative radiotherapy should be given whenever possible, and the causative tumour should be treated by endocrine or chemotherapy, as indicated."

CD007431,0,16421746,0,Magnetic resonance image findings in the early post-operative period after anterior cervical discectomy.,"If early neurological deterioration occurs following anterior cervical discectomy, the patient should be evaluated by urgent MRI scanning. In order to interpret such a scan it is essential to know what the normal post-operative MRI appearance is following an uncomplicated procedure. In the lumbar spine it is well recognized that early post-operative imaging following discectomy is difficult to interpret with a high rate of false positive scans. The normal appearance of MRI in the early post-operative period was evaluated prospectively in 15 patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy without fusion for either cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy. MRI was performed on the first post-operative day, at 6 weeks and 6 months. The successful outcome of the procedure was validated by uniform improvement of Visual Analogue Scale measurement for neck and arm pain, the Neck Disability Index and European Myelopathy Score as appropriate. In contrast to the established findings following lumbar discectomy, only two cases showed a persistent epidural mass in the first post-operative scan and this had completely resolved at 6 months. All patients had foraminal narrowing and root or cord compression pre-operatively. Sixty six percent of cases showed persistent foraminal narrowing on sequential imaging up to 6 months despite showing good symptomatic improvement. All cases demonstrated high signal in the operated disc space on T2 weighted imaging on the first post-operative day and this finding persisted in 13 of 15 scans performed at 6 weeks. Post contrast imaging demonstrated no enhancement of operated disc space and adjacent vertebral body on the first post-operative day, whereas all scans at 6 weeks showed enhancement and such enhancement persisted at 6 months in 50%. Persistent epidural filling defects are uncommon following successful anterior cervical discectomy but persistence of foraminal narrowing is common despite successful outcome. Enhancement of the disc space is also common and does not in itself imply infection."
CD007431,0,9402567,0,The slump test: the effects of head and lower extremity position on knee extension.,"Maitland's slump test is a widely used neural tissue tension test. During slump testing, terminal knee extension is assessed for signs of restricted range of motion (ROM), which may indicate impaired neural tissue mobility. A number of refinements that modify hip and ankle position has been added to the basic slump test procedure, but no research to date has measured the effects of ankle and hip position on knee extension ROM during testing. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of neural tension-producing movements of the cervical spine and lower extremity on knee extension ROM during the slump test. Thirty-four males with no significant history of low back pain were tested in the slump position with the cervical spine flexed and extended in each of three lower extremity test positions: neutral hip rotation with the ankle in a position of subject comfort (neutral), neutral hip rotation with ankle dorsiflexion (ankle dorsiflexion), and medial hip rotation with ankle dorsiflexion. Results showed significant decreases in active knee extension ROM (F1,198 = 29.53, p < 0.0001) in the cervical flexion compared with the cervical extension conditions. Subjects also exhibited significant decreases in active knee extension ROM (F2,198 = 56.76, p < 0.0001) as they were progressed from neutral to the ankle dorsiflexion to the medial hip rotation with ankle dorsiflexion positions of the lower extremity. The results of our study indicate that limitations in terminal knee extension ROM may be considered a normal response to the inclusion of cervical flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, or medial hip rotation in the slump test in young, healthy, adult males. In addition, the presence of a cumulative effect on knee extension ROM with the simultaneous application of these motions is noted. These findings may assist clinicians when assessing knee extension ROM during slump testing."

The gold standard was set by the consensus opinion of two consultant musculoskeletal radiologists on the available plain radiographs of the lumbar spine. MRI was found to have a sensitivity of 57% to 86%, specificity of 81% to 82%, positive predictive value of 14% to 18% and negative predictive value of 97% to 99% for the diagnosis of a pars defect."
CD007431,0,12544950,0,Incidence of intravascular penetration in transforaminal cervical epidural steroid injections.,"STUDY DESIGN A prospective, observational, human, study was conducted. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence of vascular penetration during fluoroscopically guided, contrast-enhanced transforaminal cervical epidural steroid injections, and to determine whether the observation of blood in the needle hub can be used to predict a vascular injection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Incorrectly placed intravascular cervical spinal injections result in medication flow systemically and not to the desired target. A recently published study demonstrates a high incidence of intravascular injections in transforaminal lumbosacral epidural injections. No studies so far have evaluated the incidence of vascular injections in transforaminal cervical epidural steroid injections, nor have they calculated the ability of observed blood in the needle hub to predict a vascular injection in the cervical spine.METHODS The incidence of fluoroscopically confirmed intravascular uptake of contrast was prospectively observed in 337 patients treated with cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections. The ability of observed blood in the needle hub to predict intravascular injection was also investigated. For each subject, the injection level was chosen on the basis of the clinical scenario including history, physical examination, and review of imaging studies. Some patients had multilevel injections. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the authors placed a 25-gauge needle into the epidural space using a transforaminal approach according to accepted standard technique. Needle tip location was confirmed with biplanar imaging. The presence or absence of blood in the needle hub spontaneously (""flash"") and after attempted aspiration by pulling back on the syringe's plunger was documented. Contrast then was injected under real-time fluoroscopy to determine whether the location of the needle tip was intravascular. The results were recorded in a prospective manner indicating the presence or absence of blood in the needle hub and whether a vascular pattern was noted with contrast injection, and these were correlated. Relevant epidemiologic data also were recorded. RESULTS The study included 504 transforaminal epidural steroid injections. The overall rate of fluoroscopically confirmed intravascular contrast injections was 19.4%. Use of observed blood in the needle hub to predict intravascular injections was 97% specific, but only 45.9% sensitive. There was no significant difference in intravascular rates related to age or gender. CONCLUSIONS As compared with a previous study of lumbosacral epidural steroid injections, there is an overall higher incidence of intravascular injections with cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections. Use of observed blood in the needle hub to predict an intravascular injection is not sensitive, and therefore the absence of blood in the needle hub despite aspiration is not reliable. The reported sensitivity and specificity rates are similar to lumbar data. Fluoroscopically guided procedures without contrast confirmation instill medications intravascularly, and therefore not in the desired epidural location. This study confirms that there is a need not only for fluoroscopic guidance, but also for contrast instillation in cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections."

Discomfort and changes of the neurological status, emerging during the walk, were accepted as test results. They were noted in a decision matrix and the positive and the negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) calculated. The PPV of any symptom or any deterioration of the neurological status, resulting from this test as signs of a myelographical abnormality, was calculated to be 86 and 89 per cent, respectively, the corresponding NPV's being 50 and 40 per cent, respectively. The NPV of these parameters as signs of a myelographically verified lumbar spinal stenosis was calculated to be 100 per cent, the corresponding PPV's being 38 and 44 per cent, respectively. The development of ""symptom-march"" or of bilateral neurological signs during the walk was found to be of approximately the same diagnostical value. We conclude, that this function test may serve as a screening procedure in patients complaining of neurogenic intermittent claudication."

We thought that the resulting changes of LSA and back muscle activity when wearing belts with different mechanical characteristics should be different. Eighteen healthy male subjects participated in this study. Though we failed to identify a significant belt effect on the back muscle EMG, the radiographic data revealed an interactive effect of postures and belts on the change of LSA. In standing, the belts increased LSA by increasing almost every lumbar vertebral angle. In erect sitting, the lumbar belt had no effect but the pelvic belt decreased LSA through a decrease in the L1/L3. While sitting slump with a trunk flexion of 15 degrees, both belts increased LSA by restricting the movement of the pelvis. Belt effect on LSA was accompanied with a change of pelvic angle. Significant correlation was found between the backward rotation angles of the pelvis and the angles of LSA (r = 0.692, p < 0.0001), also between the decrease of pelvic angles and the increase of back muscle EMG (r = -0.4, p = 0.017). A change in LSA and pelvic angle after wearing a belt along with posture change seems lead to an increase of the myoelectric activities on the back."
CD007431,0,12585585,0,The knee-spine syndrome. Association between lumbar lordosis and extension of the knee.,"Degenerative changes of the knee often cause loss of extension. This may affect aspects of posture such as lumbar lordosis. A total of 366 patients underwent radiological examination of the lumbar spine in a standing position. The knee and body angles were measured by physical examination using a goniometer. Limitation of extension of the knee was significantly greater in patients whose lumbar lordosis was 30 degrees or less. Lumbar lordosis was significantly reduced in patients whose limitation of extension of the knee was more than 5 degrees. It decreased over the age of 70 years, and the limitation of extension of the knee increased over the age of 60 years. Our study indicates that symptoms from the lumbar spine may be caused by degenerative changes in the knee. This may be called the 'knee-spine syndrome'."

Of the 67 patients who underwent laminoplasty, 10 patients (14.9%) postoperatively showed cervical radioculopathy. The preoperative radiographical findings had included cervical lordosis, intraspinal cord centering, and anterior protrusion of the apex of the superior articular process. Needle electromyography, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) were preoperatively examined in 42 cases. There was no relationship between the postoperative radiculopathy and the preoperative radiographical findings. Six (100%) of 6 cases preoperatively diagnosed as C5 radiculopathy (postganglionic type) with Erb-P 14 interpeak latency of dermatomal SEPs and SNAP, developed postoperative C5 radiculopathy. One (25%) of 4 cases preoperatively diagnosed as C6 radiculopathy developed postoperative C6 radiculopathy. No case preoperatively diagnosed as C7 or C8 radiculopathy developed postoperative radiculopathy. This study suggested that an important risk factor for postoperative radiculopathy was subclinical C5 radiculopathy (postganglionic type) that could be preoperatively evaluated using electrophysiological studies."

The percentage with an excellent result remained relatively constant (88-89%) throughout the study. No reliable predictors of long-term outcome were identified. The results suggest that microlumbar discectomy compares favourably with other surgical techniques with regard to long-term outcome."

In addition to bilateral median and ulnar SEPs, evoked potentials were recorded after stimulation of C6 and C8 dermatomes from the first and fifth digits, respectively. The patients were classified into 3 groups according to the nature of their clinical condition. The abnormality rate for both ulnar and C8 dermatomal SEPs was 100% in a small group of patients with severe neurological signs like atrophy. In groups of patients with lesser degrees of neurogenic damage, abnormality rates for ulnar and C8 dermatomal SEPs on affected limb(s) were 67 and 50%, respectively. Same abnormality rates were 25 and 18% in patients with only subjective symptoms. In patients with objective neurological signs, the major increase in sensitivity was with electromyography (EMG). Abnormalities of routine nerve conduction studies and F-wave latency were observed in patients with severe neurogenic damage. We concluded that the most useful tests in the diagnosis of neurogenic TOS are needle EMG and ulnar SEPs."

No one study was consistently abnormal; however, epidural venography was diagnostic in 74% of cases. CT scanning and electromyographic examination, when used in combination, were found to be reliable in confirming the diagnosis of lumbar disk rupture in 84% of cases.

In this paper, microdiscectomy and chemonucleolysis are evaluated and compared with respect to achieving these goals. Two groups of successive, noncompensation patients numbering 50 each were studied. All patients met standard clinical and imaging criteria for an isolated lumbar vertebral disk herniation. One group was treated with chemonucleolysis and the second with micodiscectomy. Average follow-up exceeded 3 years.

Seventy-nine patients (34 women, 45 men) with a unilateral, single-level lumbar disc herniation were included in this study. Forty-one patients in whom closed-suction drainage was implanted were compared with 38 patients in whom the drain was not implanted. We have used a new grading system for the extent of epidural fibrosis, on the basis of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging findings. Pain intensity was evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS), and the patients' function and working ability were measured according to the Prolo functional-economic scale. We conclude that, in patients operated on for unilateral, single-level lumbar disc hernias, implantation of closed-suction drainage into the operation site results in less formation of EF radiologically and yields better clinical outcome."

However, no such investigation has yet been done in middle-aged patients. Trunk muscle strength and the effect of trunk muscle exercises were investigated in patients with CLBP aged more than 40 years. Trunk muscle strengths were measured in a LBP group (52 patients) and a control group (60 volunteers) and the results for the two groups were compared. The LBP group was divided into three subgroups. Group A had only age-related spondylosis and group B had disk herniation and spondylolisthesis with age-related spondylotic change. Both these groups were able to continue exercises. Group C was made up of patients who had abandoned the exercise program. Trunk muscle strength and symptoms were assessed in each group. Both flexion and extension strength were decreased in the LBP group compared with the control group, with the reduction in extension strength being most marked. In both groups A and B, muscle strength increased and clinical symptoms improved. In contrast, no change was seen in group C. In older patients with CLBP, reduction of muscle strength was more marked in the spinal extensors than in the spinal flexors. It was confirmed that trunk muscle strengthening exercises are useful for increasing muscle strength and improving symptoms in such patients."

The surgery was done by the senior one of us (J.M.) between 1972 and 1982. The duration of symptoms ranged from two months to three years. Pain in the lower limb was the predominant symptom in forty-eight patients. Reduction of the amount of straight leg-raising by 50 per cent or more, with or without pain in the ipsilateral hip when the asymptomatic limb was lifted (cross-over pain) and with or without pain radiating up or down the lower limb when the tibial nerve was pressed in the popliteal fossa (bowstring discomfort), was considered evidence of tension on or irritation of the nerve root and was present in all patients. Chemonucleolysis was considered as an alternative to discectomy and was performed only after the patient failed to respond to conservative management. An anaphylactic reaction occurred in one patient and was treated successfully. The most common symptom after injection was increased back pain, and it was controlled with medication. One patient had transient weakness of the extensor hallucis longus after injection. The length of follow-up ranged from two to twelve years (average, four years and six months), excluding one patient who was killed in an accident six months after injection. Chemonucleolysis did not relieve the symptoms in eleven of the fifty-five patients. These eleven patients all subsequently had surgical excision of the disc, and in them the chemonucleolysis was considered to have failed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Based on these findings, preoperative CTD of lumbar disc herniation was investigated. In the discs of human cadavera, the contrast medium mainly invaded the fissures of nucleus pulposus and the ruptures of annulus fibrosus and then diffused to the surrounding tissues. These ruptures were classified into two categories: radial and circumferential. This identification was possible only in CTD and was obscure in the usual discogram. Not all the ruptures could be dyed in a severe degenerative disc, and a rupture which was not communicated with nucleus pulposus was not dyed in a mild degenerative disc. In the preoperative CTD of lumbar disc herniation, the posterior radial ruptures representing the route of herniated nuclei were characteristic and the circumferential ruptures were found complicated."

CD007431,0,10819259,0,Outcome in Cloward anterior fusion for degenerative cervical spinal disease.,"The Cloward ventral interbody fusion is often employed for treatment of cervical degenerative disease. The present study was aimed at evaluating results and complications in this classical type of autologous bone graft procedure in a cohort of patients with radiculopathy (RP) or myeloradiculopathy (MRP). Indications for and limitations of the technique were investigated by retrospective data analysis in a series of 106 patients (30 females and 76 males). These underwent single or multiple level Cloward fusion in a total of 145 levels. Neuroradiological investigations included lateral and antero-posterior cervical spine X-rays, axial CT scans, and MRI. The presence of postoperative ossification and stable bony fusion in the fused segments was confirmed by X-rays and, when necessary, by CT. The median postoperative follow-up period was 6.5 years (range 4-10.5 years). Short term outcome in RP patients was good in 26 cases (92.9%) and fair in 2 cases (7.1%). A good short term outcome was seen in 55 MRP patients (70.5%), a fair outcome in 20 patients (25.6%), and a poor outcome in 3 patients (3.8%). Patients having myelopathy signs for less than 1 year had a significantly better outcome than those with clinical signs for more than 1 year (p < 0.05). MRP patients below the age of 40 years had a significantly better outcome than those above the age of 40 (p < 0.05). In the long term, radiculopathy was cured or significantly improved in 92.8% of cases, and myeloradiculopathy in 64%. One year after surgery, there were 139 stably fused segments (96%) and 6 segments showing osseous non-union (4%). Plain lateral radiographs demonstrated, besides the bony fusion in the respective segment, relatively frequent graft collapse with slight to severe correction losses and kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine. However, these findings did not necessarily correlate with the clinical outcome. Autologous bone graft harvesting caused a rather high short-term morbidity with donor site pain and/or wound haematoma in 33% of the cases. These surgery-related complications, however, were of a temporary nature, as long-term complications (cutaneous hypaesthesiae) were found in 2 patients (1.8%) only. In conclusion, Cloward anterior cervical fusion for degenerative spinal disease is a relatively simple and safe surgical procedure with favourable short and long term results. In our hands, graft donor site complications dominate the side effects of surgery, and the percentage of non-unions is rather low. Because of the relatively frequent bone graft collapse and the late loss of postural correction of the spine, we cannot recommend the Cloward type fusion for multisegmental procedures. In such cases, an instrumented plate fusion should be carried out in order to prevent graft collapse and non-union, and to allow for a shorter convalescence period."

These three subgroups showed no significant differences in height, weight, Davenport Index, lumbar lordosis, or leg length inequalities. LBP patients had less flexor and extensor strength and were flexor overpowered, had diminished range of motion for spinal extension and axial rotation (P = 0.003, P = 0.0005), and diminished straight leg raising capacity (P = 0.04).

However, the ability of discography to distinguish asymptomatic morphologically abnormal discs from those that are symptomatic has been understudied.

Postoperative changes in the initial abnormalities and their relationship with improvement in clinical findings were examined. Results from conventional motor nerve conduction study at knee-ankle segment are also discussed. The subjects were 30 patients with unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy caused by herniated disc. F-waves were obtained from abductor hallucis and extensor digitorum brevis by supramaximal stimulation to tibial and peroneal nerves, respectively, at the ankle. Minimal latency (Fmin), maximal latency (Fmax), chronodispersion (Fdif) and duration (Fdur) were used as the parameters. No subject had abnormal motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) throughout the course of this study, and there was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative levels. Peroneal Fmin, Fmax, Fdif and tibial Fdur all showed significant (p < 0.05 in Wicoxon signed-rank test) improvement after surgery. Moreover, these overall improvements significantly (p < 0.05 in chi 2 test) correlated with recovery in muscle weakness. However, normalization of F-wave was not always associated with full recovery in muscle weakness at that time. These findings suggested that follow-up examination of F-wave was of value for objective assessment after operation."
CD007431,0,10413345,0,The value of MR imaging in differentiating between hard and soft cervical disc disease: a comparison with intraoperative findings.,"The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of MRI alone in the differentiation of soft cervical disc protrusion from osteophytic compression in cervical disc disease. In a retrospective study, the MRI scans of 41 patients with cervical disc disease, who had previously undergone surgery, were presented to three independent observers, randomly on two different occasions, to identify the accuracy of the diagnosis of the presence of hard or soft disc or both as a cause of compression. The observers (two neurosurgeons and one neuroradiologist) were not involved with the treatment of the cases at any stage and were unaware of the surgical findings. Their observations were compared with those of the surgeon recorded at operation. The intra-observer agreement was poor for diagnosis into three categories as hard or soft disc or both. In distinguishing between the presence or absence of hard disc, there was moderate to good (Kappa = 0.6) intra observer and fair to moderate (Kappa = 0.4) interobserver agreement. The sensitivity of diagnosis of a hard disc was high (87%) but specificity was low (44%), due to the overestimation of the presence of hard disc. There was a significantly higher incidence of hard disc in the elderly age group (76% over the fifth decade, P = 0.0073). It is concluded that MRI alone is not a very efficient diagnostic tool in distinguishing between hard and soft disc in the cervical disc disease."

The first favourable clinical experiences with analysis of the LT in sitting position stimulated our previous anatomical, biometrical and clinical investigations (Mandić and col. 1970.). There has been established the stretching of the ischial nerve in classical LT to 12.7 cm, in sitting position to 4.8 cm, and the changing of position from supine to sitting to 6.4 cm. That means that the stretching in sitting LT is greater then in classical way/i.e. 13.26 cm/. The stretching forces in both ways were equal (0-3.7 kp/. The multicentric investigation included 330 patients of both sexes, aged 15-62 years. In 57 patients/17.3%/was LT in sitting position positive and in supine negative. That demonstrate the higher degree of reliability 17.3%. These quantitative results will be continued in qualitative investigation of statistical correlation of relative flexion degrees. The advantages of sitting LT are:more simple, more quick, the taking off patient's clothes is not needed, and the result is more suitable for the objective evaluation of psychogenic complaints superposition or simulation."

Physical findings include sensory loss in a specific nerve root dermatome, weakness and atrophy of the muscle supplied by that nerve root, and reflex changes appropriate to the specific nerve root. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by one or several corroborative tests, the most frequently used of which are computed tomography, myelography, and electrodiagnostic studies."
CD007431,0,14563144,0,Low-dose radiotherapy for the inhibition of peridural fibrosis after reexploratory nerve root decompression for postlaminectomy syndrome.,The authors of clinical studies have demonstrated a significant association between the presence of extensive post-lumbar discectomy peridural scar formation and the recurrence of low-back and radicular pain. Low-dose perioperative radiotherapy has been demonstrated to inhibit peridural fibrosis after laminectomy in animal models. The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of preoperative irradiation in patients with failed-back surgery syndrome due to peridural fibrosis who underwent reexploration and nerve root decompression.
CD007431,0,10190857,0,Ten- to 15-year outcome of surgery for lumbar disc herniation: radiographic instability and clinical findings.,"The most appropriate treatment for radiculopathy associated with disc pathology is still controversial. Since 1934, surgical treatment has consisted of hemilaminectomy and removal of the herniated material. Many authors believe that these procedures may cause degenerative spondylosis and vertebral instability. Several surgical methods have been proposed, but the long-term effects are still being debated. In addition there appear to be few well-designed outcome studies on the management of this disease. In the present study, 150 patients were selected for surgery with strict criteria and all treated with the standard technique. The series was evaluated by subjective analyses (Roland questionnaire; 120 patients), objective examinations (68 patients - 56.6%) and radiographic studies including dynamic views (analyzed by the Taillard and Boxall methods) to establish the presence of vertebral instability (50 patients - 41.6%). The subjective and objective analyses showed a high rate of good results. Radiographic studies showed vertebral instability in 30 cases, but only 9 were symptomatic. Recurrences were not observed and only a few patients suffered from leg pain. The standard procedure for lumbar disc herniation showed good results at 10- and 15-year follow-up."
CD007431,0,2329182,0,[Peridurograms in patients with lumbar disc herniations].,"The epidural space lies between the dural tube and the inside wall of the spinal canal. It contains fibrous tissues which adhere snugly to both walls filling the dead space between them. In the space, there are a large number of venous vessels anteriorly, a little fat tissue posteriorly and nerve roots laterally. The space can be examined clinically by a peridurographic technique in which the epidural space is filled with an iodine contrast medium. In patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), this examination is useful to determine the location of the prolapsed nucleus pulposus and the pathological adherent condition by the filling defect of contrast medium. For the purpose of determining the pathology of the prolapsed nucleus pulposus, peridurographic examinations were performed on 40 patients with IDH and the following results were obtained: 1) The existence and location of the IDH were shown by the peridurograms. 2) Adhesion around the involved and uninvolved nerve roots was shown in proportion to clinical symptoms."

The validity was investigated regarding radicular pain, neurologic signs, and root compression signs in myelography. All tests were highly specific for the validity parameters. However, the sensitivity was low; it ranged from 26 to 50% for the three single validity parameters in roots C6-8, and from 40 to 64% for combined neurologic and radiologic signs. It is concluded that, despite low sensitivity, these tests are a valuable aid in the clinical examination of a patient with neck and arm pain."

The study was carried out in 100 cases of lumbar discopathy treated at the Department of Spondyloneurosurgery Institute of Rheumatology in Warsaw. Both radiculography and resonance tomography were found to be of equal diagnostic value in the verification of the clinical symptoms of this discopathy. The detection rate of lumbar discopathy by both methods was much higher than based on clinical symptomatology alone. The use of both methods was not equivalent diagnostically (often they replace one another, but often also they supplement one another), and for that reason combined examination by both methods is frequently of high importance in practice, when the line of management is to be set down."

CD007431,0,7142502,0,Computed tomography of herniated and extruded nucleus pulposus.,"Computed tomography (CT) is an accurate method of diagnosing herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) in patients with back pain and radiculopathy. We evaluated 188 patients with 244 disk space explorations for the treatment of back pain and radiculopathy. In predicting HNP, CT was 92% accurate and myelography was 88% accurate. The only significant difference between the two modalities is at L5-S1. Here CT was 92% accurate in predicting HNP and myelography was 70% accurate, a difference that is statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The dural sac separation reduces the myelogram accuracy at L5-S1. In detailed evaluation of 188 patients with both CT-diagnosed and surgically confirmed HNPs, these HNPs were classified by location, calcification, size, and extrusion. If the maximum anteroposterior diameter of the HNP was less than one-half the anticipated normal sagittal diameter of the dural sac, the incidence of extrusion was less than 10%. If it occupied one-half or more of the anticipated normal sagittal diameter of the dural sac, the incidence of extrusion was greater than 90%. This difference is highly statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Thirty-five percent of the HNPs exhibited some degree of migration with the cephalic direction more common than the caudal direction. Computed tomography and myelography are both satisfactory methods of diagnosing HNP. The noninvasive CT gives direct anatomical information and is more accurate at L5-S1. If the physical examination correlates with the CT examination, then myelography may be bypassed and the patient treated with a high degree of confidence."
CD007431,0,3813219,0,Differentiation of vascular and neurogenic claudication.,"Lower extremity pain caused by exercise but relieved by rest is usually a reliable symptom of chronic arterial insufficiency. However, similar discomfort often occurs in patients who have neurospinal compression. Furthermore, both arterial occlusive disease and neurogenic causes of lower extremity discomfort may present simultaneously. Forty patients with symptoms that suggested intermittent claudication comprised our study group. All had non-arterial cause of their complaint. The nonvascular origin of the symptoms was suggested initially by clinical evaluation in 30 patients and by noninvasive evaluation in 25 patients. The neurospinal origin of symptoms was obscured in 15 patients because of the concomitant presence of significant arterial occlusive disease as demonstrated by noninvasive arterial testing. Twelve of these 15 patients underwent arterial reconstruction, which did not relieve their symptoms. Subsequently, the neurospinal origin of their symptoms was proven by appropriate evaluation and therapy. Forms of evaluation that proved helpful in the differential diagnosis were lumbosacral spine x-rays, electromyography, nerve conduction velocity studies, computerized tomography, Doppler noninvasive assessment and, at times arteriography and contrast myelography."

CD007431,0,11166937,0,Imaging the pain of low back pain: functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with monitoring subjective pain perception allows the study of clinical pain states.,"Most brain imaging studies of pain are done using a two-state subtraction design (state-related design). More recently event-related functional magnetic reasonance imaging (fMRI) has also been used for studying pain. Both designs severely limit the application of the technology to clinical pain states. Recently we demonstrated that monitoring time fluctuations of perceived pain could be used with fMRI to identify brain regions involved in conscious, subjective perception of pain. Here we extend the methodology to demonstrate that the same approach can be used to study clinical pain states. Subjects are equipped with a finger-spanning device to continuously rate and log their perceived pain during fMRI data collection. These ratings are convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function to generate predictor waveforms with which related brain activity can be identified. Chronic low back pain patients and a normal volunteer were used. In one series of fMRI scans the patient simply lies in the scanner and indicates spontaneous fluctuations of the subjective pain. In other fMRI scans, a straight-leg raising procedure is performed to exacerbate the back pain. In the normal volunteer, fMRI scans were done during painful and non-painful straight-leg raisings. The results indicate the feasibility of differentiating between different pain states. We argue that the approach can be generalized to identify brain circuitry underlying diverse clinical pain conditions."
CD007431,0,7351440,0,Computerised tomography in lumbar stenosis. A preliminary report.,"Cross-sectional studies of the lumbar spinal canal were performed by computerised tomography in asymptomatic subjects and in patients with myelographic and clinical findings suggestive of lumbar stenosis. In most cases stenosis was found to be developmental or combined in nature. Computerised tomography is a useful adjunct to myelography in the evaluation of lumbar stenosis as it enables an accurate assessment to be made of the type, degree and extent of narrowing of the vertebral canal."
CD007431,0,547193,0,[The narrow lumbar canal: 53 operated cases (author's transl)].,"These 53 operated patients were divided into 2 groups: 29 had an intermittent claudication as Verbiest first described it soon as 1949, whereas 24 had permanent radicular pain in legs as Epstein emphasized it. We think emulsified Duroliopaque myelography to be the best investigation to make sure the diagnosis and to forecast the operative tactics: we gave up Dimer X myelography which occasioned serious complications in 2 cases and gas myelography which seems to us inadequate to this radicular pathology. Total-Body Scanner is rather an elegant method but a discontinuous one. The radiographic and operative findings have shown the stenosis of the lumbar canal to be congenital in 5 cases, development in 20 cases, degenerative in 27 cases (with 15 pseudo-spondylolisthesis) and tabetic in one case. A disc herniation was found in 25 cases over 53. The extent of the bone resection has been in relation with clinical picture, myelography and mainly operative findings, aiming at a ""cut-to-measure costum"". In every case the initial laminectomy was made easier by trenching the thickened laminae on each side of the spinal process prior to remove it. Only soft disc hernations were removed; the dura was never opened; no vertebral fusion was performed; for 2 years we have tried to avoid the ""laminectomy membrane"" by interposing an autogenous fat and aponevrotic graft between the dura and the overlying paraspinal muscles. The operative results are satisfactory with 75% of excellent and good; they are much better in patients with intermittent claudication than in those with permanent radicular pain. It is a question of functional surgery in one case, of pain surgery in the other. The major trick seems to us to be that of the associated disc hernation with the risk of missing the narrow canal."
CD007431,0,4089482,0,"[Diagnosis of lumbar intervertebral disk prolapse by computed tomography. A comparative clinical study between myelographic, computed tomographic and the surgical research results with 158 patients].","The diagnostic accuracy of CT in cases of lumbar disk prolapse was investigated on the basis of a group of 158 of our own patients who were divided into three separate groups. CT findings were compared on the one hand with myelograms and on the other with results of surgery. Simultaneously performed myelographic and CT examinations produced different diagnostic findings in 7 out of 80 lumbar disks (approx. 9%). These deviating findings ranged from gradual differences (in 3 cases) to completely contradictory findings (in 4 cases). In 31 patients who underwent surgery, approximately the same amount of false-positive and false-negative findings were obtained in preoperative diagnosis using CT as with myelography. The overall accuracy calculated for non-invasive computerized tomography was 93.7%, while for myelography it was 90.7%. Out of a further 91 patients in whom myelography was not performed and whose condition was checked surgically, the diagnosis had been established correctly by CT in 88. This represents a degree of accuracy of 96%. The vertical and lateral location of the disk prolapses as determined by CT corresponded with findings at surgery in every case. It is concluded from the results of these investigations that CT should be given absolute priority over myelography in the diagnosis of lumbar disk prolapse and that if there is a correlation between clinical history, neurological deficiency symptoms, and CT findings, myelography is unnecessary, even for surgery. Only if there are discrepancies between the findings myelography is indicated as a supplementary examination. CT and myelography are examination methods which complement, rather than complete with one another."

The positive predictive value of disturbed sensation in the L5 dermatome, paresis of dorsiflexion of the foot and extension of the 4 lateral toes as signs of a herniation from the fourth lumbar disc was calculated to be 76 per cent, 69 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively, and the negative predictive value in each case to be approximately 50 per cent. The positive predictive value of altered sensibility in the S1 dermatome as a sign of a herniation from the fifth lumbar disc was found to be 50 per cent and the negative predictive value to be 62 per cent. It is concluded, that these tests very often give diagnostically specific information in patients with a herniation from the fourth lumbar disc and should therefore be performed if a lumbar root compression is suspected. They are, however, of limited value in the case of a protrusion from the fifth lumbar disc."

Their clinical and myelographic differentiation is difficult, yet important because reoperation is not always beneficial for scar removal. This article examines the usefulness of intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography for this problem. Forty-five postsurgical patients were studied; eight had subsequent surgery. In the four with hypertrophic scars, intravenous contrast enhancement of the scar allowed its recognition in each case; in the four with recurrent disk herniation, nonenhancement of the extruded disk allowed its recognition in three. In the other 37 patients who were not reoperated, 33 were believed to have scar on the basis of contrast enhancement. Continuous contrast infusion during scanning, absolute avoidance of patient movement, and careful consideration of other structures in the spinal canal are important in interpretation. The method seems promising for more accurate evaluation of failed back surgery, including the recognition of diskitis."

Postoperative symptomatic spondylolisthesis had not been noted at mean 52.1 months postoperatively. However, new juxtafacet cysts were later detected on the contralateral side to the initial lesion in two patients. Surgical removal of juxtafacet cysts is recommended for immediate symptomatic relief. Concomitant spinal fixation to prevent progression of spinal spondylolisthesis or cyst recurrence depends on cyst size, involvement of surrounding structures, degree of preoperative spondylolisthesis, and facet joint destruction."

Evaluation of canal to body ratio using plain radiographs of lumbo-sacral spine based on the Jones and Thomson technique and myelography were found very useful in diagnosing spinal canal pathology preoperatively. Spinal stenosis is more common in males, predominantly in the fourth decade. Extensive decompression laminectomy in appropriately selected cases yielded satisfactory results, any associated prolapse intervertebral disc requiring excision of the herniated disc in addition to laminectomy."

Two hundred and thirty eight patients were operated on by APLD between 1988 and 1990. The questionnaire returned by 182 patients (76.4%) was suitable for evaluation. The mean follow-up was 2.5 years. Overall, 60% reported pain relief and 52% were satisfied with APLD. Conventional operations were carried out subsequently on 45 patients (25%). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done for preoperative (age, gender, neurological deficit, Lasegue's sign, sports activity), perioperative (weight of disc material removed, level of APLD) and post-operative (conventional nucleotomy, change in condition, pain relief, satisfaction, sports activity, return to work, compensation claims) parameters. The only significant parameters for improvement in condition and pain relief was age, where patients younger than 41 do better. Risk factors for reoperation were a positive Lasegue's sign and over 41 years of age. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher for patients without sensory deficit preoperatively."
CD007431,0,12402294,0,Inhibition of maximal voluntary contraction force by experimental muscle pain: a centrally mediated mechanism.,"Muscle weakness frequently accompanies conditions with musculoskeletal pain. It is not clear if this attenuation of force is due to peripheral or central processes. The effect of experimental muscle pain on maximal voluntary contraction torque and peripheral contractile properties was therefore assessed. Experimental muscle pain reduced the torque produced by isometric knee extension, but the contractile properties assessed by twitch interpolation were not affected. This indicates that force inhibition by muscle pain is centrally mediated. This has clinical implications for rehabilitation and training of patients with musculoskeletal pain."

The most frequently encountered anomaly were: common dural origin of 2 nerve roots and common exit of 2 nerve roots through the intervertebral foramen. Other anomalies comprised: interradicular connections and Y-shaped or horizontla course of the nerve root. Multiple anomalies were not encountered. In 9 out of 20 patients in the own series and in 6 out of 18 patients reported in the literature, history and clinical findings suggested prolapsed intervertebral disc, operation revealed only nerve root anomalies. Decompression produced improvement or complete relieve of previously existing signs and plain X-rays is not possible. The diagnosis is based on myelographic findings. The pathogenesis of the anomalies is discussed. It is suggested that they should not be considered as a causative factor of low back pain or sciatica."
CD007431,0,3035838,0,[Dynamics of clinico-electromyographic indices in reflexotherapy of radicular syndromes of lumbar osteochondrosis].,Using electromyography the authors studied the functional status of the segmentary apparatus of the spinal cord in 58 patients with compression of S1-radicle secondary to vertebral osteochondrosis. The findings obtained included changes in the interferential EMG and reciprocal reflexes and decreased reflectory activity of alpha-motoneurons predominantly on the side of radicular involvement with the simultaneous intensification of gamma-loop effect. Acupuncture was followed by pain alleviation and normalization of the functional activity of the segmentary apparatus of the spinal cord mainly at the expense of this activity reduction on the healthy side. Clinical recovery was observed following the compensation of neuroreflectory activity of the segmentary centres on a new functional level. The advisability of the use of acupuncture in the treatment of the radicular syndrome of lumbar osteochondrosis is justified.

A different distribution of the antigens in cases with the major clinical forms of lumbar osteochondrosis was noted. Patients with discogenic lumbosacral radiculitis differed from normal subjects by the same antigens as all NMLO patients. For patients with lumbar ischialgia increased concentrations of B7 and B18 antigens were characteristic, whereas in radicular ischialgias A11 and B15 antigens were less incident and B40 one, more incident. The findings confirm the polygenic nature of hereditary predisposition to NMLO."
CD007431,0,3035832,0,[Decimeter radiothermometry in neurologic manifestations of lumbar osteochondrosis].,"Using radiothermometry, a new noninvasive method based on recording the thermoradiation of tissues, the authors studied the in-depth temperature of tissues in 106 patients with lumbar osteochondrosis. A radiothermometer adjusted to a wave length of 30 cm was utilized. The accuracy of measurements was +/- 0.1 degree C. The findings showed an elevation of the in-depth temperature of lumbar tissues by 0.3 degree C as compared with the temperature of the mid-thoracic portion of the vertebral column. The elevation was maximal at the site of the involved intervertebral disc imaging. In the tissue of the leg on the side of pain the in depth temperature was 0.4-0.6 degrees C lower. The authors consider that temperature elevation in the lumbar tissue of the vertebral column is a manifestation of the attendant reactive inflammatory process while a decrease in the temperature of tissue on the side of pain is due to the neurodystrophic process with thermal disturbances. Decimetric radiothemometry may be used for the preoperative localization of intervertebral disk hernias."
CD007431,0,1533326,0,"Is there a role for diskography in the era of magnetic resonance imaging? Prospective correlation and quantitative analysis of computed tomography-diskography, magnetic resonance imaging, and surgical findings.","We herein report the results of a prospective study to define the role of diskography in the diagnosis of low back pain in an emerging era of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study involved 32 patients (78 disks) with a clinical diagnosis of lumbar disk herniation; all were studied by computed tomography-diskography (CT-D), and 25 (51 disks) were also examined using MRI. The disks were graded on these studies according to a staging scheme modified from Modic. Ten of the patients (13 disks) having both CT-D and MRI underwent exploratory surgery, and the staging at surgery served as the standard against which the evaluative studies were judged. Surgical staging was compatible with the CT-D and MRI results in five disks, while in another five disks it was compatible only with the CT-D results. In the remaining three disks, both CT-D and MRI misidentified the stages. In six disks, CT-D more accurately defined the stage of disease than did MRI, whereas MRI was more precise than CT-D in only one disk. While having documented the value of CT-D as a source of information, particularly when surgery is contemplated, and as an effective means of staging disk herniation, we recommend MRI as the ideal screening test for lumbar radiculopathy and low back pain, reserving diskography for problematic cases."

Thirteen of 152 patients underwent exploratory surgery at two vertebral spaces as a result of their neuroradiological examinations. All patients were examined clinically before of instrumental devices. CT-scan was performed on 113 patients, 62 underwent myelography and 36 electromyography. The authors verified reliability of clinical and instrumental devices on the basis of surgical results. Clinical examination was reliable in 83% of cases, electromyography in 78%, myelography in 83% and CT-scan in 87%. The percentage of false positive was 11% for the clinical examination, 9% for CT-scan, 8% for myelography and 11% for electromyography. The percentage of false negative was 6% for the clinical examination, 4% for CT-scan, 9% for myelography, and 11% for electromyography. The authors conclude that the CT-scan is the most reliable method of examination. This is even truer when dealing with extreme lateral disk herniation."
CD007431,0,2943255,0,On the usefulness of somatosensory evoked responses for the evaluation of lower back pain.,"Electrodiagnostic and concurrent computed tomographic (CT) scan data were reviewed from 30 patients with lower back pain and unilateral radicular symptoms. Electrodiagnostic examination included somatosensory evoked responses (SSEPs) of the L-4, L-5, and S-1 roots stimulating specific sensory nerves. In three patients with normal CT scans, electrophysiologic studies were unrevealing. In the remaining 27 patients, CT scans were consistent with root injury, as were 15 of 17 myelograms. In 21 of these 27 patients, SSEP abnormalities consistent with focal root dysfunction and the radiographic findings were present. Other electrodiagnostic abnormalities (ie, electromyographic F response or H reflex) were limited to the six patients with clinical signs. These data indicate that SSEPs are valuable for evaluating root injury in patients with lower back pain, particularly where focal sensorimotor or reflex signs are absent."
CD007431,0,12920567,0,Diagnosing tuberculous spondylitis: patients with back pain referred to a rheumatology outpatient department.,"The onset of tuberculous spondylitis is insidious in nature, with various clinical presentations, slow development of radiographic abnormalities, and nonspecific constitutional symptoms. This lack of specific symptoms causes delays in diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates osteitis, intraosseous abscesses, paravertebral and epidural soft tissue extensions and abscesses, discitis, multilevel involvement of spinal cord or nerve root compression, and scoliosis. We present six patients with tuberculous spondylitis referred to our outpatient department with back pain resistant to medical therapy. All of them were women aged from 25 to 58 years (mean 44.6). The diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis was based on clinical presentation, radiographic and/or MRI evidence of focal destructive vertebral lesions (with paravertebral mass), and positive bacteriological findings of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The combined antituberculous chemotherapy consisted of 1.0 g/day streptomycin for 1 month, 25 mg/kg ethambutol or 25 mg/kg pyrazinamide, 600 mg/day rifampicin, and 300 mg/day isoniazid. The duration of therapy was 12 months. All the patients recovered without any sequelae. The mean follow-up period was 28 months (range 12-48). Magnetic resonance imaging is considered the main imaging modality for patients with suspected tuberculous spondylitis; it must be included in differential diagnosis of back pain and, if it is diagnosed in early stages, antituberculous chemotherapy enables satisfactory outcome."

Pathological T-wave responses were found in 11 (73%) patients. Patients with radiological correlate showed electromyographic (EMG) pathology in 60% but a pathological T-wave response in 90%. All patients with radiological correlate also showed pathological electrophysiological tests (EMG or T-wave responses). Electrophysiological measurement of the T-wave response appears to be a potentially useful tool in the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathies.

CD007431,0,2063004,0,Thoracic disc disease and stenosis.,"Disc herniation and stenosis in the thoracic spine are relatively uncommon compared with their occurrence in the cervical or lumbar spine. They are usually degenerative, although trauma may be an aggravating or initiating factor. The clinical presentation includes local and/or radicular pain with or without signs and symptoms of cord dysfunction. Radicular pain may be secondary to mechanical compression or vascular impingement. MR imaging is the best way to define the specific abnormality as well as the effect on the adjacent spinal cord. CT after myelography may be useful as well, especially in those patients in whom there is involvement of the posterior ligamentous and osseous structures of the thoracic spinal canal. MR imaging may finally reveal the true incidence of thoracic disc herniation."
CD007431,0,3361331,0,The tibialis anterior reflex in healthy subjects and in L5 radicular compression.,"Phasic stretch reflexes were evoked in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, by tapping the dorsal side of the foot with a hand-held reflex hammer. The responses were recorded by means of surface electrodes. The TA reflex was examined in 70 healthy subjects and in 18 patients with L5 radicular compression. In 58 (83%) of the healthy subjects the reflex could be recorded bilaterally, in eight (11%) subjects no reflex was found on either side, and in four (6%) it was absent in one leg. Simultaneous recordings from the gastrocnemius-soleus showed that TA responses were not caused by volume conduction from that muscle. In the 18 patients with L5 radicular compression the TA reflex was absent on the affected side 13 times (72%) and present bilaterally in the other five cases. If asymmetry of the reflex (unilateral absence) is considered as a test for the presence of L5 radicular compression, the likelihood ratio for a positive test is 12.0, and for a negative test 0.3. The examination of the TA reflex is easily performed and can be useful in the diagnosis of L5 radicular compression."

The mean age of the patients was 45 years and 28 of them had previously undergone spinal operations. Pain in the leg was the predominant symptom, with evidence of motor involvement in half of the patients. Signs of nerve root tension were found in only one-third of the patients. The principal factor in the aetiology was degenerative change in the posterior facet joints. Decompression was achieved by a partial undercutting facetectomy. Fifty-nine per cent of the patients obtained a ""good"" result and 85 per cent were satisfied with the result of their operation. Successful partial facetectomy for bony entrapment of lumbar nerve roots produced rapid and lasting relief of pain."

CD007431,0,9755620,0,[Sciatica--diagnosis and surgical management].,"Sciatica (a term used synonymously with lumbar radiculopathy) is usually caused by lumbar disc herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis. Mechanical compression of nerve roots is a predominant factor, and decompression the surgical goal. Emphasis should be placed on clinical identification of the nerve roots causing the complaint. Although computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most important diagnostic tools used today, plain x-ray may be required for correct identification of the lowest mobile segment, and the functional myelography combined with CT may be required if lumbar spinal stenosis is suspected, or if the clinical findings are unclear--especially if the patient has already undergone surgery for sciatica. The proper selection for candidates for surgery seems to be a more important determinant of successful outcome than whether macro- or micro-surgery is used, or whether one or more segments are operated upon (12, 13). Clear clinical identification of the roots affected and corresponding pathological findings at imaging are the best predictors of successful surgical outcome, an additional factor of positive predictive value being psychosocial stability. Impaired fibrinolysis, occurring in smokers and in the sedentary and obese, may be a negative predictive factor (10, 11). Published findings suggest that, unlike the case with disc surgery (9), neither long duration of symptoms nor long preoperative sick leave is associated with poor outcome of surgery for spinal stenosis (14)."

CD007431,0,10758122,0,EMG activities of two heads of the human lateral pterygoid muscle in relation to mandibular condyle movement and biting force.,"Electromyographic (EMG) activities of the superior (SUP) and inferior heads (INF) of the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPT) were recorded in humans during voluntary stepwise changes in biting force and jaw position that were adopted to exclude the effects of acceleration and velocity of jaw movements on the muscle activity. The SUP behaved like a jaw-closing muscle and showed characteristic activity in relation to the biting force. It showed a considerable amount of background activity (5-32% of the maximum) even in the intercuspal position without teeth clenching and reached a nearly maximum activity at relatively lower biting-force levels than the jaw-closing muscles during increment of the biting force. Stretch reflexes were found in the SUP, the function of which could be to stabilize the condyle against the biting force that pulls the condyle posteriorly. This notion was verified by examining the biomechanics on the temporomandibular joint. The complex movements of the mandibular condyle in a sagittal plane were decomposed into displacement in the anteroposterior direction (Ac) and angle of rotation (RAc) around a kinesiological specific point on the condyle. In relation to Ac, each head of the LPT showed quite a similar behavior to each other in all types of jaw movements across all subjects. Working ranges of the muscle activities were almost constant (Ac <3 mm for the SUP and Ac >3 mm for the INF). The amount of EMG activity of the SUP changed in inverse proportion to Ac showing a hyperbola-like relation, whereas that of the INF changed rather linearly. The EMG amplitude of the SUP showed a quasilinear inverse relation with RAc in the hinge movement during which the condyle rotated with no movement in the anteroposterior direction. This finding suggests that the SUP controls the angular relationship between the articular disk and the condyle. On the other hand, the position of the disk in relation to the maxilla, not to the condyle, is controlled indirectly by the INF because the disk is attached to the condyle by tendinous ligaments."
CD007431,0,16963315,0,Clinical experience in cell-based therapeutics: disc chondrocyte transplantation A treatment for degenerated or damaged intervertebral disc.,"Disc herniation treated by discectomy results in a significant loss of nucleus material and disc height. Biological restoration through the use of autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation offers a potential to achieve functional integration of disc metabolism and mechanics. Chondrocytes that have been removed from damaged cartilaginous tissues maintain a capacity to proliferate, produce and secrete matrix components and respond to physical stimuli such as dynamic loading. Nucleus regeneration using autologous cultured disc-derived chondrocytes (ADCT) has been demonstrated in a canine model and in clinical pilot studies. In 2002 a prospective, controlled, randomised, multi-center study, EuroDISC, comparing safety and efficacy of autologous disc chondrocyte transplant, chondrotransplant DISC, plus discectomy (ADCT), with discectomy alone was initiated. A dog model was used to investigate the hypothesis that autologous disc chondrocytes can be used to repair damaged intervertebral disc. Disc chondrocytes were harvested and expanded in culture under controlled and defined conditions, returned to the same animals from which they had been sampled (autologous transplantation) via percutaneous delivery. The animals were analyzed at specific times after transplantation by several methods to examine whether disc chondrocytes integrated with the surrounding tissue, produced the appropriate intervertebral disc extracellular matrix, and might provide a formative solution to disc repair. The clinical goals of the EuroDISC study, were to provide long-term pain relief, maintain disc height and prevent adjacent segment disease. Interim analysis was performed after 2 years; Oswestry (low back pain/disability), Quebec Back-Pain Disability Scale, as well as Prolo and VAS score were used for the evaluation. Disc height was assessed by MRI. In the context of degenerative changes in an injury model: () autologous disc chondrocytes were expended in culture and returned to the disc by a minimally invasive procedure after 12 weeks; () disc chondrocytes remained viable after transplantation as shown by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and maintained a capacity for proliferation after transplantation as depicted by histology; () transplanted disc chondrocytes produced an extracellular matrix that displayed composition similar to normal intervertebral disc tissue. Positive evidence of Proteoglycan content was supported by accepted histochemical staining techniques such as Safranin O-Fast Green; () both Type II and Type I collagens were demonstrated in the regenerated intervertebral disc matrix by immunohistochemistry after chondrocyte transplantation; and () when the disc heights were analyzed for variance according to treatment a statistically significant-correlation between transplanting cells and retention of disc height was achieved. A clinically significant reduction of low back pain in the ADCT-treated group was shown by all three pain score systems. The median total Oswestry score was 2 in the ADCT-treated group compared with 6 in the control group. Decreases in the disability index and VAS score in ADCT-treated patients correlated strongly with the reduction of low back pain. Decreases in disc height over time were only found in the control group, and of potential significance, intervertebral discs in adjacent segments appeared to retain hydration when compared to those adjacent to levels that had undergone discectomy without cell intervention. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation is technically feasible and biologically relevant to repairing disc damage and retarding disc degeneration."

The lumbosacral evoked potentials (LSEPs) were compared with the results of measurements obtained from 19 neurologically healthy subjects. Additional data were collected on each patient to characterize segmental reflex responses and preservation of sensory and motor functions associated with the L5 through S2 segments of the spinal cord.

In this study, we examined sensory detection and pain thresholds above injury level in 17 SCI patients with central neuropathic pain, in 18 SCI patients without neuropathic pain, and in 20 control subjects without injury and pain. The SCI pain group had significantly higher cold and warm detection thresholds compared with the SCI pain free group and controls and higher tactile detection thresholds compared with the SCI pain free group. No difference in pain or pain tolerance thresholds was seen among pain and pain free SCI patients. These data suggest changes in somatosensory function in dermatomes rostral to the segmental injury level linked to the presence of central neuropathic pain in SCI patients.

We undertook this investigation to determine any correlation of orthodontic and dentofacial characteristics with TMJ bilateral disc displacement. The population of patients was selected from a TMJ clinic where a control group of asymptomatic volunteers had been previously established and standardized. Differences in skeletal structural features were determined among three study groups: (1) asymptomatic volunteers with no TMJ disk displacement, (2) symptomatic patients with no TMJ disc displacement, and (3) symptomatic patients with bilateral TMJ disk displacement. Thirty-two asymptomatic volunteers without disk displacement (25 female, 7 male) were compared with the same number each of symptomatic patients without TMJ disk displacement and symptomatic patients with bilateral TMJ disk displacement. All subjects had undergone a standardized clinical examination, bilateral TMJ magnetic resonance imaging, and lateral cephalometric radiographic analysis. The groups were matched according to sex, TMJ status, age, and Angle classification of malocclusion. Seventeen lateral cephalometric radiographic cranial base, maxillomandibular, and vertical dimension variables were evaluated and compared among the study groups. The mean angle of SNB, or the intersection of the sella-nasion plane and the nasion-point B line (indicating mandibular retrognathism relative to cranial base), of the symptomatic patients-with-displacement group was significantly smaller than that in the asymptomatic volunteers and symptomatic patients without bilateral disk displacement (p < 0.05). Female subjects showed smaller linear measurements of mandibular length, lower facial height, and total anterior facial height than male subjects in all three groups (p < 0.05). The mean angle of ANB, or the intersection of the nasion-point A and nasion-point B planes (indicating retrognathism of mandible relative to maxilla), was significantly greater in female than in male subjects, in all groups (p < 0.05). Symptomatic patients with bilateral disk displacement had a retropositioned mandible, indicated by a smaller mean SNB angle compared with that in asymptomatic volunteers and symptomatic patients with no disk displacement on either side. Lateral cephalometric radiographic assessment may improve predictability of TMJ disk displacement in orthodontic patients but is not diagnostic; nor does the assessment explain any cause-and-effect relationship."

The most common intraoperative findings were: a true recurrence at the same level in 43% of cases, a new herniation at another level in 15%, and a small recurrent fragment embedded in epidural fibrosis in 23%. Five percent of patients had severe epidural fibrosis as the only pathology. In 15%, reoperation was performed within 1 month to treat persisting pain, and either a missed disc fragment, an inadequately decompressed lateral recess, or an unrecognized second-level disc protrusion was found. The clinical outcome is affected predominantly by the intraoperative pathology and the time interval between the first and second operation. An excellent or good outcome was usually achieved in patients with a recurrence of pain after 1 year resulting from a true recurrent disc or a new herniation at another level. In contrast, very unfavorable results were noted with most reoperations performed during the 1st year when extensive epidural fibrosis (or fibrosis with a small recurrence) was present."

The mean injection pressure (P0) was 282 kPa, the residual pressure after 60 s (P60) was 181 kPa, and the loss of pressure (LOP) was 34%. P0 and P60 were moderately intercorrelated (r = 0.51). The following associations were significant: low P0 and P60 in advanced annular degeneration and disruption; low P60 and great LOP in large hernias and narrow disks. P0 and P60 were not associated with the pain response at diskography, magnetic resonance signal intensity, or patient age, sex, weight, body mass index, type of occupation, or duration of symptoms. Diskomanometric data seem to be influenced by the level of annular degeneration and disruption, size of herniation and height of the disk space."

CD007431,0,7587694,0,[Foraminal and extraforaminal lumbar disc herniations].,"Between August 1992 to November 1994, 7 cases of foraminal and 3 cases of extraforaminal lumbar disc herniation were diagnosed and operated on, which represented an incidence of 4.1% of all operated lumber disc herniations. Contrasted to the typical disc herniation, foraminal and extraforaminal disc herniations involved the upper nerve root mainly. The dominent symptoms and signs were severe anterior thigh and lower leg pain, positive femoral nerve strech test, impairment of knee jerk reflex and weakness of the quadriceps muscle. Sequestration and extrusion were the most common type of disc pathology. CT/MRI showed the protruded disc in and outside of the foramen clearly. It was thought to be ideal method for the precise diagnosis and guidance of surgery. However the variations of the nerve root or other diseases related to it should be identified. All of the 10 cases underwent surgical treatment with the approach by outer edge of pars interarticularis in 8. The result was encouraging with complete improvement in 8 cases, obvious improvement in 1 case, and partial improvement in another case. It was found that the approach had the advantage of good exposure and effect with the minimal destruction of pars interarticularis and facet joint which would not give rise to lumbar instability."
CD007431,0,1830247,0,The older athlete after lumbar spine surgery.,"Surgery consists of spinal decompression for predominately leg pain problems. The most commonly performed surgery in older patients is the lumbar laminectomy. Total laminectomy is the procedure recommended for central canal stenosis. More commonly, central canal, lateral recess, and foraminal stenosis occur in the same patient. Lateral recess stenosis may be the major offending blockage in the canal. This may be treated with a total laminectomy or a bilateral medial facetectomy performed through the microscope with excellent decompression of the lateral recess. Foraminal stenosis can also be decompressed from a paraspinous position with the foraminotomy performed from the outside in. This can be combined with a microscopic medial facetectomy. Essentially, all these operations remove bone and redundant tissue to allow the nerve adequate freedom in the spinal canal and/or intervertebral foramina. Fusions are performed predominantly for degenerative spondylolisthesis to prevent the recurrence of radiculopathy. Internal fixation may be indicated in any situation in which the surgeon feels that the fusion rate is potentially compromised, but he or she must be aware that internal fixation does not guarantee spine fusion. Spinal instrumentation certainly increases the complication rate. The number of levels fused and the inclusion of the sacrum are important in predicting the fusion rate."

CD007431,0,9597294,0,Suspecting lumbar spondylolysis in adolescent low back pain.,"Spondylolysis in the athletic adolescent and preadolescent is common enough that primary care practitioners should be familiar with its frequency and its progression from pars interarticularis stress fracture to spondylolysis and to spondylolisthesis. One-half of all pediatric back pain in athletic patients is related to disturbances of the posterior elements including spondylolysis, which presents as low back pain aggravated by activity, frequently with minimal physical findings. Failure to suspect, hence to diagnosis, a pars stress fracture or early spondylolysis is common and a misdiagnosis of lumbosacral strain is often made. A complicating factor in early diagnosis is the fact that plain radiographs, even with oblique films, may not be helpful at the stress fracture stage, and other imaging techniques (bone scan possibly with single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) must be used early in the diagnostic process. In the primary care setting, an early diagnosis of posterior element involvement in low back pain either at the stage of pars stress fracture or early spondylolysis can prevent progression of the disease and the need for aggressive intervention for a more significant defect. We present three adolescent and preadolescent athletes with low back pain in whom a high index of suspicion led to the early diagnosis of pars stress fracture or spondylolysis. All three had different stages of spondylolysis, and one illustrates the clinical utility of the one-legged hyperextension test. The ease with which early disease may be treated further supports efforts by primary care practitioners to suspect and diagnose pars stress fracture and early spondylolysis."
CD007431,0,2141743,0,[Treatment of patients with lumbar disc prolapse with ibuprofen. A controlled clinical trial].,"The justification of employing the anti-inflammatory agent, ibuprofen, in the conservative treatment of lumbar disc prolapse was investigated. Forty-two patients admitted with clinical symptoms compatible with lumbar disc prolapse participated in the investigation. They were allotted double blindly at random to treatment with a placebo or ibuprofen as a supplement to the conservative treatment consisting of rest in bed, traction and mild analgesics. The analgesic effect of treatment in the two groups was assessed with the aid of a visual analogue scale and also the amounts of supplementary analgesics necessary. No significant difference in the pain experienced or employment of supplementary analgesics in the two groups could be registered. This investigation has thus not demonstrated further analgesic effect of ibuprofen administered as a supplement to the conservative treatment otherwise employed for lumbar disc prolapse."
CD007431,0,6854345,0,Chronic asymmetrical spinal muscular atrophy.,"The clinical and neurophysiological features of 18 cases of chronic asymmetrical spinal muscular atrophy are described. These were patients presenting with asymmetrical neurogenic atrophy involving one or more limbs who had no evidence of pyramidal tract dysfunction after 3 or more years of symptoms. There were twice as many males as females and the mean age of onset of the disorder was about 32 years. None of the patients had bulbar involvement. The tendon reflexes tended to be depressed. The distribution of muscle weakness in the limbs was very variable, and only slowly progressive. In 5 cases symptoms and signs were confined to the hands and forearms. Motor nerve conduction velocities to wasted muscles were slightly reduced but there was no evidence of generalised neuropathy. A diagnosis of chronic asymmetrical spinal muscular atrophy, as opposed to that of classical motor neurone disease, is favoured by an age of onset under 40 years, an absence of pyramidal signs or bulbar involvement after 3 years or more of symptoms, and depressed or absent tendon reflexes. The 2 conditions appear to be clinically distinct and prognosis is considerably better in chronic asymmetrical spinal muscular atrophy. The aetiology of this condition in unknown; it may be of relevance that 2 patients in this series had close relatives with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease."
CD007431,0,1440010,0,The natural history of sciatica associated with disc pathology. A prospective study with clinical and independent radiologic follow-up.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the natural history of sciatica due to lumbosacral nerve root compromise and to evaluate the pathomorphologic changes that accompany the natural resolution of the disease. One hundred sixty-five consecutive patients, 114 males and 51 females, with an average age of 41 years (range, 17-72) and an average duration of symptoms of 4.2 months (range, 1-72) presenting with sciatica thought to be due to lumbosacral nerve root compromise were admitted to the study. The cornerstone of treatment was the serial epidural administration of steroid and local anesthetic by the caudal route on an outpatient basis. Lumbar epidural injection or periradicular infiltration at the appropriate level, confirmed under image intensifier, was the next step before considering surgical decompression. An average of three injections (range, 0-8) was received by each patient. Patients underwent clinical examination and computed tomography. Twenty-three patients (14%) underwent surgical decompression. The remainder were clinically assessed at 1 year after presentation, and 111 were rescanned at the appropriate levels. All conservatively managed patients made a satisfactory clinical recovery: average reduction of pain on the visual analog scale was 94% (range, 45-100), and 64 (76%) of the 84 disc herniations and 7 (26%) of the 27 disc bulges showed partial or complete resolution (chi-square = 20.27, P = 0.0001). Thus a high proportion of patients with discogenic sciatica make a satisfactory recovery with aggressive conservative management, and this recovery is accompanied by resolution of disc herniations in a significant number. Only a small proportion of patients needed surgical decompression."

CD007431,0,7822353,0,Lumbar foraminal stenosis: critical heights of the intervertebral discs and foramina. A cryomicrotome study in cadavera.,"One hundred lumbar intervertebral foramina from eighteen spines of fresh cadavera were studied to assess the relationship between compression of the nerve root and the height of the intervertebral disc and the morphological characteristics of the intervertebral foramen as determined on cryomicrotome sections. The critical posterior disc height and the critical foraminal height that were associated with entrapment and compression of the nerve root were determined. Significant positive correlations were demonstrated between compression of the nerve root and the posterior disc height, the foraminal height, and the foraminal cross-sectional area for the four intervertebral levels between the second lumbar and first sacral vertebrae. Nerve-root compression was evident in twenty-one of the 100 foramina, in eight of the ten foramina in which the posterior disc height was four millimeters or less, and in four of the five foramina in which the foraminal height was fifteen millimeters or less. These critical dimensions may be indicators of foraminal stenosis in the lumbar spine. However, compression of a spinal nerve root does not always cause sciatica, and the clinical findings must always be taken into account when a diagnosis of stenosis is considered."
CD007431,0,10214570,0,Association between peridural scar and activity-related pain after lumbar discectomy.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between activity-related pain six months after first surgery for herniated lumbar disc, and the extent of lumbar epidural fibrosis present at the surgical site, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. The 298 patients who underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation were studied in a randomized, controlled, double-blind multicenter clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the scar-inhibiting device ADCON-L. Clinical assessments were conducted pre-operatively and at 1, 3, and 6 month intervals post-operatively, and included wound examination, magnetic resonance imaging scar assessment, and the Johns Hopkins activity-related pain questionnaire. In addition, a longer-term follow-up assessment was conducted at 12 months post-operatively. The association between the presence of epidural scar and activity-related pain was analyzed at the 6-month interval, when successful surgical excision of protruding disc material should have eliminated chronic pain. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association (p = 0.02, odds ratio = 0.7) whereby the odds of extensive scar decreased by 30% for every 31% decrease in activity-related pain score. In addition, those patients receiving ADCON-L at surgery developed significantly less scar in the months following operation (p = 0.01, 6 and 12 months post-operatively). Repeated measures analysis demonstrated that patients who received treatment with ADCON-L at the time of surgery experienced less activity-related pain through the 12-month assessment (p = 0.05). A significant association between extensive epidural scar and activity-related pain is demonstrated. Patients with less scar had less activity related pain, confirming the finding that the use of the scar inhibitor ADCON-L has a positive effect on surgical outcome."
CD007431,0,10214571,0,Association between peridural scar and persistent low back pain after lumbar discectomy.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between low back pain persisting six months after first surgery for herniated lumbar intervertebral disc and the extent of peridural fibrosis present at the surgical site, as defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 298 patients who underwent first-time, single-level unilateral discectomy for lumbar disc herniation were evaluated in a controlled, randomized, double-blind multicenter clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the scar-inhibiting device ADCON-L. Clinical assessments were conducted pre-operatively and at 1, 3, and 6-month intervals post-operatively, and included MRI scar assessment and the assessment of low back pain by visual analog scales. There were 267 patients available for low back pain assessments. The data obtained at the 6-month follow-up visit were statistically analyzed for the association between the presence of peridural scar and the persistence of low back pain. Those patients treated with ADCON-L at surgery had significantly less scar than did control patients (p = 0.007), and had less low back pain than did control patients when the pain was most severe (p = 0.047) and when the pain was assessed at the end of the day (p = 0.044). Patients with extensive scar reported continuing and debilitating low back pain more frequently than those with no or minimal scar. These findings demonstrate a direct correlation between persistent low back pain and extensive scar, since patients with increased amounts of scar had increased low back pain, regardless of their treatment group (p = 0.0003)."

Facilitatory influence of AEAP on NFR correlated with hypalgesia, that apparently reflected recovery of the afferent input peculiarities."
CD007431,0,10214573,0,Inhibition of epidural fibrosis with ADCON-L: effect on clinical outcome one year following re-operation for recurrent lumbar radiculopathy.,"In a prospective multicenter study, 20 patients underwent re-operation for recurrent radiculopathy after lumbo-sacral discectomy, and were treated with ADCON-L (Adhesion Control in a Barrier Gel) to inhibit epidural fibrosis following secondary surgery. Outcomes after re-operation were assessed at six and 12 months using: Visual Analog Scales to measure radicular and back pain, straight leg raising exams, and self-assessment of activity-related radicular pain. Each parameter was compared to baseline values, obtained immediately prior to the re-operation. The long term clinical results at 12 months after re-operation (summarized below) demonstrate a significant improvement of all clinical parameters, and correlated with the results seen at six months. Radicular pain, measured when most severe, was reduced from an average pre-operative score of 8.1-3.7 (p < 0.005). The straight leg raising angle increased from an average pre-operative value of 41 degrees-67 degrees (p < 0.005). Activity-related pain mean score was 4.6, vs. 17.0 pre-operatively (p < 0.005). Low back pain, measured when most severe, was reduced from an average pre-operative score of 6.1 to 3.1 (p < 0.012). These clinical findings compare very favorably with data reported in the literature. There were no adverse events or complications related to the use of ADCON-L."
CD007431,0,17103230,0,Dermatomal laser-evoked potentials: a diagnostic approach to the dorsal root. Norm data in healthy volunteers and changes in patients with radiculopathy.,"We conducted a cross-sectional study of 40 radiculopathy patients in comparison with norm data from healthy subjects using a new electrophysiological method. Early manifestations of dorsal root impairment escape objective diagnosis by conventional somatosensory-evoked potentials due to the overlapping innervation of the affected dermatome by thickly myelinated mechanoreceptive afferents projecting to adjacent intact roots. Evidence suggested less intersegmental overlap for thermonociceptive afferents rendering laser-evoked potentials (LEP) sensitive to monosegmental dorsal root damage. Therefore we used this new method to study acute manifestations of monosegmental dorsal root pathology. Dorsal root function was tested in 12 healthy subjects and 40 sciatica patients by intraindividual interside comparison. Mechanosensibility and thermosensibility were clinically investigated. LEP were induced by moderately painful laser stimuli. The LEP were evaluated by amplitude and latency of the averaged electroencephalogram. Normal interside differences of LEP for amplitude were +/-22% (lower limb) and +/-35% (upper limb) and +/-15 to +/-16% for latency. Twenty-six patients (65%) showed significant LEP changes, mainly amplitude decreases. Six of these patients exhibited latency prolongations. Clinical testing yielded more frequent pathological results for pain compared to mechanosensibility. The study confirmed our preliminary evidence of LEP sensitivity to objectively document dorsal root impairment in patients suffering from acute monosegmental radiculopathy. This result opens the perspective of electrophysiologically differentiating the presence or absence of dorsal root pathology in patients with similar clinical symptoms but possibly different prognoses, which require different therapies."

Clinical reports state that subjects with flexion pain disorders of the lumbar spine commonly adopt passive flexed postures such as slump sitting and present with associated dysfunction of the spinal postural stabilising musculature. However, to date there is little empirical evidence to support that patients with back pain, posture their spines differently than pain-free subjects. Subjects included 21 healthy industrial workers and 24 industrial workers with flexion-provoked LBP. Lifestyle information, lumbo-pelvic posture in sitting, standing and lifting, and back muscle endurance were measured. LBP subjects had significantly reduced back muscle endurance (P < 0.01). LBP subjects sat with less hip flexion, (P = 0.05), suggesting increased posterior pelvic tilt in sitting. LBP subjects postured their spines significantly closer to their end of range lumbar flexion in 'usual' sitting than the healthy controls (P < 0.05). Correlations between increased time spent sitting, physical inactivity and poorer back muscle endurance were also identified. There were no significant differences found between the groups for the standing and lifting posture measures. These preliminary results support that a relationship may exist between flexed spinal postures, reduced back muscle endurance, physical inactivity and LBP in subjects with a history of flexion injury and pain."

CD007431,0,1870667,0,Computed tomography of the postoperative intervertebral disc and lumbar spinal canal: serial long-term investigation in 19 patients after successful operation for lumbar disc herniation.,"The first part of this work, published in 1988, included 25 patients who had computed tomographic (CT) scans without contrast enhancement and plain x-rays of the lumbar spine before, 1 week after, and 6 to 7 weeks after a successful operation for lumbar disc herniation. The present study extends the follow-up period to 3 years in 19 of the 25 original patients. Clinical examinations, lateral plain x-rays, and CT scans without contrast enhancement of the operated disc were repeated. The results indicate a decrease or even a disappearance of the hyperdense extradural material thought to represent fibrosis. An image suggestive of persistent disc herniation was still present in 5 of 8 patients with this finding on early postoperative CT scans. Persistent intradiscal gas was seen in nearly half of the patients. Total normalization of the posterior extraspinal structures was the rule. There was no correlation between CT appearance and residual complaints of the patients. CT scans without contrast enhancement may be sufficient to guide the surgeon in postoperative patients with massive signs and symptoms of recurrent root compression in whom a second operation is indicated on clinical grounds. In all other cases, myelography followed by CT scans is considered appropriate to investigate failed back surgery syndrome."

Fifty-eight were treated by placing them in spine-decompressing position, traction and therapeutic exercises. The group of 45 patients had additionally paravertebral blockade (steroid + a local anaesthetic). In the blockade group the therapeutic effects were better, with rapid reduction of acute pain, with wellbeing improvement and better comfort, which facilitated further stages of the treatment.

CD007431,0,6495025,0,A study of computer-assisted tomography. II. Comparison of metrizamide myelography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of herniated lumbar disc and spinal stenosis.,"One hundred twenty-two patients with surgically confirmed pathology consisting of either herniated lumbar disc, spinal stenosis, or both were included in this investigation. For each of these patients, preoperative metrizamide myelography and computerized tomography were performed. Each myelogram and CT scan was read blindly so that the neuroradiologist interpreting the study had no knowledge of the patient's surgical pathology, clinical examination, nor any knowledge of the interpretation of the other preoperative test. A painstaking attempt was made to describe precisely both the exact nature of the preoperative myelogram and CT scan interpretations. The correlations between the preoperative interpretation of each test and the observed surgical findings then were analyzed statistically. Based upon this analysis, myelography was found to be more accurate than computed tomography in the diagnosis of herniated lumbar disc (83% vs. 72%). In the diagnosis of spinal stenosis, myelography was slightly more accurate than computed tomography (93% vs. 89%). Based upon the results of this study, the authors conclude that metrizamide myelography is more accurate than computed tomography in the diagnosis of both herniated lumbar disc and spinal stenosis and remains the diagnostic study of choice for these conditions. Furthermore, metrizamide myelography gives the added advantage of visualizing the thoracolumbar junction and, thus, affords the opportunity to diagnose occult spinal tumors."
CD007431,0,17977204,0,Discal cysts.,"Discal cysts are rare lesions that can result in refractory sciatica. Because they are so rare, their exact origin and details of the clinical manifestations are still unknown. The authors report on five men treated for discal cysts. The mean age of the patients at the time of the surgery was 32 years (range 25-38 years). All patients suffered from lower-extremity pain and the results of the straight leg-raising test were positive in all cases. Three patients reported motor weakness and four had sensory disturbance--symptoms similar to those found in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated spherically shaped extradural lesions of various sizes with low and high signal intensities on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. Discography revealed obvious communication between the cyst and the intervertebral disc with reproducible leg pain in all patients. All patients underwent posterior decompression and excision of the cysts either with or without additional discectomy. The radicular symptoms were remarkably improved in all patients immediately after surgery, and no recurrent lesions were noted during follow up."
CD007431,0,10823430,0,Outcome scores in degenerative cervical disc surgery.,"Forty-six consecutive patients with neck pain and arm radiculopathy were treated with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. All patients had neurological symptoms corresponding to a herniated disc and/or spondylosis at one or two cervical levels, verified by magnetic resonance imaging. The patients were stabilized with an anterior graft and randomized to either fixation with a CSLP plate or no internal fixation. Preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively the patients filled in a questionnaire that included a modified Million Index, a modified Oswestry Index and the Zung Depression Scale. They were also asked to register their pain in the arm and in the neck on a vertical visual analogue scale (VAS). At the 2-year follow-up, an unbiased observer graded the patients' clinical outcome using Odom's criteria. A test-retest procedure was carried out to examine the questionnaire reproducibility. In the group that was operated at one level, there was no significant improvement in any of the scores. Nevertheless, 81% of the patients were satisfied with the outcome of the surgery. All scores improved in the group operated at two levels. The pain in the neck and arm, as measured on a VAS, decreased in both groups. The improvement in arm pain was significantly more pronounced in patients operated with a plate at two levels compared to those who were operated without a plate. At the 2-year follow-up, patients with an excellent or good result according to Odom's criteria had a lower Million Index (P < 0.0005), Oswestry Index (P < 0.0005), and Zung (P = 0.024) score, than the group classified as fair or poor. There was a significant correlation (P < 0.0001 for all scores) between the test and retest results. We conclude that the modified Million Index and Oswestry Index are clinically useful tools in the evaluation of outcome after degenerative cervical disc surgery. The clinical benefits of plate fixation were minimal. The outcome after surgery, measured with the Oswestry Index, Million Index and VAS for arm and neck pain, seems to correlate well with the classification of outcome by Odom."

CD007431,0,9520891,0,Common peroneal nerve block for sciatica.,"The effectiveness of common peroneal nerve block for lumbar disc herniation was evaluated in a double blind study. Common peroneal nerve block was performed near the fibular head in nine patients using 2% lidocaine and in 10 patients using saline. The average pain scale score decreased from 3.1 to 0.6 in the lidocaine group, whereas it decreased from 3.0 to 2.6 in the placebo group. The average result in the straight leg raising test increased from 61 degrees to 84 degrees in the lidocaine group, but from 44 degrees to 50 degrees in the placebo group. Lower leg pain lessened more in the lidocaine group than in the placebo group. The finding that lower leg pain disappeared or decreased with a lidocaine block at a site far distal to the lumbar lesion suggests that impulses that are transmitted distal to the lesion may be important for the generation of sciatic radicular pain."

The resultant symptoms and signs can be explained by the pathomechanics and pathophysiology of the intervertebral disk. Clinical manifestations should be used to differentiate the prolapse from more severe disk protrusions and from other types of spinal pathology, for treatment must be pathology-specific. Primary goals of management should include: resolution of the acute problem, restoration of optimal segmental mechanics, restoration of an optimal activity level, prevention of recurrent physical dysfunction, and prevention of chronic pain behavior patterns."

The multidimensional pain inventory (MPI) has previously identified 3 cognitive-behavioral profiles in TMD and chronic pain patients. Our aims were to replicate these findings in another cultural setting and relate the profiles to the diagnosis and to the treatment demand and outcome. The MPI was administered to 112 referrals comprising 6 categories of patients diagnosed with TMD or intractable orofacial pain. Dysfunctional profiles (high in pain and distress) were most common in patients with orofacial pain of obscure origin and more common in myofascial pain patients than in patients with other TMD diagnoses. Interpersonally-distressed profiles were found in all categories. Among patients with disk displacement, the 3rd profile (adaptive copers with low pain and distress and high control and activity) was most common in earlier successfully diskectomized patients and least common in those about to undergo invasive interventions. A dysfunctional profile was associated with treatment failure, conservative or surgical, and with the demand for radical therapy. Some support for a cyclical causality between pain and psychological factors was found. It is concluded that the robustness of the MPI as a relevant assessment instrument was further strengthened."

The objective of this study was to determine the association between clinical data and urodynamic diagnosis, in order to reveal whether bladder dysfunction can be assessed on the basis of urological symptoms and signs. We prospectively studied 122 patients with lumbar intervertebral disk protrusion. Detrusor areflexia was found in 32 of these patients, while in the remaining 90 detrusor activity was normal. All patients with detrusor areflexia reported difficulty voiding by abdominal straining. The patients with normal urodynamic findings were either free of voiding disturbances (77 patients) or complained of frequent voiding (13 patients). In conclusion, there are cases of lumbar intervertebral disk protrusion in which the presence of bladder dysfunction can be predicted on the basis of clinical urodynamic testing, i.e. clinical neurological alterations, decreased bladder sensation, voiding by straining, increased bladder capacity, residual volume, and intermittent or continuous low flow curve on free uroflowmetry."

CD007431,0,8153806,0,Anatomic and radiographic study of dorsal root ganglia.,"Anatomic and radiographic studies were made to investigate normal variation of dorsal root ganglia in lumbosacral roots. The spinal nerves could be divided into two groups, with and without bifurcation of ventral nerve root and dorsal root ganglion. The bifurcated group was further classified into three types. L4 and L5 nerve roots were all bifurcated, and S1 were all nonbifurcated. The positions of dorsal root ganglia were classified into three types: intraspinal, intraforaminal, and extraforaminal. At L4 and L5 nerve roots, they were mostly intraforaminal, whereas at S1, they were mostly intraspinal. Proximally placed ganglia had a high frequency of ganglionic indentation. The incidence of intraspinal dorsal root ganglia was much higher clinically than in anatomic studies. Variations in connecting patterns or positions of dorsal root ganglia may be related to the occurrence and variety of radicular symptoms. The dorsal root ganglia is clinically important, and its location may correspond to clinical symptoms."

Pain distribution and physical findings were positive for discogenic involvement of long duration prior to chemonucleolysis. Eighteen patients were treated under worker's compensation. Postoperation, significant back pain persisted less than 24 hours in seven patients, less than six days in 133, less than 21 days in 178, from one to three months in nine, and between three and six months in two patients. Leg pain remained less than 24 hours in 32 patients, between one and five days in 212, between six and 21 days in 96, between one and three months in seven, and between six and 12 months in three patients. Similar improvement in extensor hallucis longus weakness and straight leg raising was also noted. Pain relief in the long term showed none persisting in the 158 patients or 44%, mild remaining pain in 107 or 30%, moderate pain in 71 or 20% and some pain in 21 or 6%. Thus the result was graded satisfactory in 74%.

The MHR was tested in the supine patient with the hip slightly flexed, externally rotated and abducted. The ipsilateral knee was semiflexed and supported by one of the examiner's hands. The reflex muscle contraction was elicited by striking the index finger of the supporting hand placed on the tendons in question with a reflex hammer. The positive predictive value of an abnormal MHR as a sign of herniation from the fourth lumbar disc was found to be 85-89 per cent and the negative predictive value to be 51-61 per cent. The corresponding values when considering an abnormal Achilles tendon reflex as a sign of herniation from the fifth lumbar disc were calculated to be 67-84 per cent and 79-84 per cent, respectively. It is therefore recommended to include the MHR in the neurological examination of patients with a suspected lumbar disc protrusion."
CD007431,0,7584187,0,Arthroscopic treatment of the flexed arthritic knee in active middle-aged patients.,"Twenty patients (22 knees) treated by arthroscopic removal of the anterior tibial osteophyte were selected for review from more than 150 arthroscopic debridements of the knee over a 5-year period (1986-1991). All the patients were middle-aged active individuals with competitive sports activity in their past. Their main complaint was flexion deformity of the knee (5 degrees-20 degrees) associated with pain and discomfort in recreational sporting activities and/or in activities of daily living. Roentgenographic examination in all cases showed an anterior tibial osteophyte located just anterior and medial to the anteromedial tibial spine of the intercondylar eminence. No varus or valgus malalignment or subchondral necrosis was detected. Arthroscopic treatment consisting of removal of the anterior tibial osteophyte by shaving and extraction of the bone, followed by a moderate notchplasty, was sufficient to improve the active extension of the knee and to decrease the pain and stiffness of the joint."

In seven patients the history of pain and abnormalities on examination suggested a possible neurological disorder. Fourteen of 29 patients (48%) with femoral or tibial osteomas had localised muscle atrophy, and 10 patients (34%) had diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes in the affected limb. Two patients had painless lesions. Six patients had normal plain radiographs. Delay in the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma may be prevented by the knowledge that pain may be referred or radicular, that the concomitant occurrence of muscle atrophy and depressed deep tendon reflexes are relatively common findings, and that the characteristic radiological features may only appear late in the course of the disease."
CD007431,0,4077903,0,Hip arthrodesis. A long-term follow-up.,"In a retrospective study, we examined twenty-eight patients who had had an arthrodesis seventeen to fifty years previously (average, thirty-five years). Hip and knee ratings were obtained, as well as anteroposterior and flexion-extension radiographs of the lumbar spine and standing anteroposterior radiographs of the knees and hips. About 60 per cent of the patients had pain in the ipsilateral knee (average time to onset, twenty-three years after arthrodesis), and a similar percentage had back pain (average time to onset, twenty-five years after the operation). Pain in the contralateral hip occurred in approximately 25 per cent of the patients (average time to onset, twenty years after arthrodesis). Only one patient was unemployed due to disabling pain in the back or knee. Seventy per cent of the patients could walk more than one mile (1.6 kilometers), and a similar percentage could sit comfortably for at least two hours. Seventy-five per cent of the patients had anteroposterior laxity of the ipsilateral knee, and 80 per cent had mediolateral laxity. The patients whose hip was fused in some abduction more frequently had pain in the ipsilateral knee and the back, and they had greater degenerative changes in the ipsilateral knee than the patients whose hip was fused in adduction or in the neutral position. Six patients had undergone total hip arthroplasty for pain in the back or the ipsilateral knee, or both, and all had marked relief of back pain, while two of four had relief of pain in the knee. Two patients had a total knee arthroplasty for relief of pain in the ipsilateral knee."
CD007431,0,16825999,0,The effect of lumbar total disc replacement on the spinopelvic alignment and range of motion of the lumbar spine.,"A lumbar total disc replacement (TDR) is a type of motion-preserving surgery, which aims to restore and maintain the normal range of motion (ROM) and the sagittal balance of the spine. However, little is known regarding how the spinopelvic alignment and ROM of the lumbar spine are influenced by the lumbar TDR with ProDisc. This study retrospectively analyzed the sagittal alignment and ROM of the lumbar spine in 26 consecutive patients who had undergone the TDR with ProDisc with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. A standing lateral radiograph, which included the femoral heads and dynamic flexion-extension lateral radiographs of the spine were taken before surgery and at the follow-up visit. The radiological parameters included the sacral tilt, the pelvic tilt, and the lumbar lordosis. The segmental lordosis and ROM were also measured at each operative level. Nineteen patients underwent a single-level TDR and 7 patients underwent a double-level TDR. The mean lumbar lordosis increased significantly from 30.5 degrees to 40.8 degrees in all patients who underwent TDR without any significant changes in the sacral tilt and pelvic tilt at the latest follow-up (P<0.05). In the patients who underwent single-level TDR, the mean segmental lordosis at the L5-S1 and L4-5 operative levels increased significantly from 15.8 degrees to 23.2 degrees and from 14.1 degrees to 24.9 degrees, respectively. The mean ROM at L5-S1 and L4-5 increased significantly from 7.1 degrees to 11.2 degrees and from 11.4 degrees to 14.6 degrees, respectively. The sagittal balance and ROM of the lumbar spine improved significantly after the lumbar TDR."

A prospective study in 160 patients.,"In a prospective study of 160 consecutive patients who underwent primary surgery for lumbar disc herniation, we investigated the value of clinical history for diagnosing the degree of herniation-the main prognostic factor for the postoperative outcome. At surgery, the patients were classified into two groups: intact anulus (negative exploration or protruding disc) and ruptured anulus (subligamentary perforation or complete perforation). The strongest variables predicting the degree of herniation were duration of leg pain, progressive leg pain, educational level and whether or not the patient had previously undergone non-spinal surgery. In patients with ruptured anulus, the median durations of low back pain and sciatica were 16 and 10 weeks, respectively. The corresponding figures for the group with intact anulus were 79 and 50 weeks. 18% of those with ruptured anulus and 39% of those with intact anulus were undergoing medical or psychiatric treatment for other diagnoses; 32% and 55% had previously undergone non-spinal surgery. Thus the two groups differed not only in disc pathology but also in medical, behavioral and social factors that must be taken into account in the preoperative assessment and that may explain discrepancies between impairment and disability."
CD007431,0,8277752,0,"Direct and indirect methods for the quantification of leg volume: comparison between water displacement volumetry, the disk model method and the frustum sign model method, using the correlation coefficient and the limits of agreement.","Volume changes can be measured either directly by water-displacement volumetry or by various indirect methods in which calculation of the volume is based on circumference measurements. The aim of the present study was to determine the most appropriate indirect method for lower leg volume calculation using water displacement volumetry as a 'golden standard'. For 20 male volunteers, age range: 20-35 years, the volume of both lower legs was determined directly by water-displacement volumetry, and indirectly by the frustum sign model method and the disc model method. Calculation of the correlation coefficient and the limits of agreement showed that water-displacement volumetry and the disc model method are interchangeable (r = +0.99, mean +/- 2s = -45 +/- 78 ml), whereas this does not hold for the frustum sign model (r = +0.93, mean +/- 2s = 521 +/- 238 ml). In the clinical situation volume measurement can be valuable for monitoring of the severity of oedema or haematoma occurrence after surgery or severe trauma. This non-invasive diagnostic aid may be a valuable adjuvant means of diagnosis for several volume dependent disorders of the extremities."

This anomaly appeared in 4.6% in the normal population. The rate of the transitional vertebra in patients with nerve root syndrome was double (8.4%) whereas that with lumbar disc herniation four time as many as in the normal population. The data demonstrate that the asymmetrical anomalies have more clinical significance. The authors consider, that the role of the transitional vertebra is twofold: it can be consider primary in low back and sciatic pain, but in the formation of lumbar disc herniation is secondary. They find the analysis of the lumbosacral plain x-ray is necessary even in cases with CT and MRI."

The guidelines summarise typical manifestations of discopathy or associated diseases and describe the necessary medical information for the sociomedical assessment of performance. Relevant assessment criteria for the medical history, clinical examination, and for diagnostic tests are illustrated. The assessment of the individual's capacity is outlined, taking occupational factors into account. Following the determination of dysfunctions the remaining abilities and disabilities, respectively, are deduced and compared with occupational demands.

One of the most severe presentations of this parasitosis is the involvement of the spinal cord, which prognosis is largely dependent on early diagnosis and treatment. Reports on this clinical form of schistosomiasis in children are rare in the literature. We present here the clinical-epidemiological profile of schistosomal myeloradiculopathy (SMR) from ten children who were admitted at the Instituto Materno-Infantil de Pernambuco over a five-year period. They were evaluated according to an investigation protocol. Most of these patients presented an acute neurological picture which included as the main clinical manifestations: sphincteral disorders, low back and lower limbs pain, paresthesia, lower limbs muscle weakness and absence of deep tendon reflex, and impairment of the gait. The diagnosis was presumptive in the majority of the cases. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the diagnosis of SMR in pediatric patients coming from endemic areas who present a low cord syndrome, in order to start the appropriate therapy and avoid future complications."

One hundred patients referred for conventional MR imaging of the lumbar spine also had coronal MR (TR 9000 ms, TE 272 ms eff, NEX 3, echo train length 32) myelography performed. Three experienced observers compared magnetic resonance myelography (MRM) with conventional lumbar spine MR using the following variables: visibility of thecal sac and nerve roots, and the presence, location and severity of disc herniation. Disc protrusions were seen at 110 disc space levels on conventional MR images as opposed to 93 on MRM. However, only 72 % of lesions seen on conventional MR were diagnosed by MRM. Similarly, only 63.8 % of nerve root compression abnormalities seen at conventional MR were visualized when compared with conventional MRM. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MRM when compared with conventional MR was 72, 93 and 85 %, respectively. The MRM technique yields images that resemble conventional myelography and may be used to help confirm abnormalities seen on conventional MR in selected cases; however, the large number of false-positive and false-negative examinations indicates that caution should be used in interpreting MRM images."

Preliminary data.,"Penetration of prednisolone across the blood-brain barrier was studied in 17 patients (ten women and seven men) with a mean age of 64 +/- 17 years admitted for nerve root pain warranting a lumbar puncture. One blood sample and one cerebrospinal fluid sample were obtained concomitantly from each patient, two hours (n = 7), four hours (n = 5) or six hours (n = 5) after an oral dose of 40 mg of prednisone. Prednisolone was assayed in all samples using high performance liquid chromatography and its binding to plasma proteins was determined using ultrafiltration. Total plasma prednisolone levels declined over time from 597 +/- 174 ng/ml two hours post-dose to 422 +/- 106 ng/ml four hours post-dose and 250 +/- 85 ng/ml six hours post-dose. Plasma levels of free prednisolone were 95 +/- 21 ng/ml, 59 +/- 17 ng/ml, and 18 +/- 14 ng/ml, respectively, at the same time points. Prednisolone was detectable in all cerebrospinal fluid samples, in levels of 14 +/- 2 ng/ml after two hours, 29 +/- 9 ng/ml after four hours and 17 +/- 7 ng/ml after six hours.

The study was performed on 101 patients with clinical and MRI diagnosis of TMJ internal derangement with closed lock (permanent or episodic). On the MRI survey the following was evaluated: disk displacement, disk mobility, condylar translation, bone, and muscular fatty atrophy. Pain was more frequent in static disks (SD) than in mobile disks (MD) in all types of disk displacements (p < 0.01). Condylar translation was always lower in SD than in MD, independently from the position of the articular disk (p < 0.01). Localized sclerosis was more frequent in joints with SD. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of fatty atrophy considering disk mobility. The results of the study indicate that clinical diagnosis of closed lock with high frequency is related to the presence of a static disk. Clinical diagnosis of SD can be confirmed with a pseudodynamic MRI survey."

CD007431,0,6864039,0,[A clinical and radiological study of posterior nucleotomy for lumbar disc herniation-a review after ten to twenty-five years].,"This study was performed to clarify long-term results of posterior nucleotomy and to investigate the clinical factors which affect the end results. Sixty patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent posterior nucleotomy at the Chiba University Hospital from October, 1954 to December, 1968 were completely reviewed. Fifty-six patients were clinically examined personally, and four patients by questionnaire. Their follow-up period ranged from 10 to 25 years, with an average 17.8 years. They consisted of 41 light, 9 moderate, and 10 heavy manual laborers. The results were as follows: 1) Over-all clinical results were excellent in 19 (32%), good in 32 (53%), fair in 5 (8%), and poor in 4 cases (7%). 2) Preoperative sciatica was completely relieved in 80 percent and straight leg raising test became negative in 88 percent. However, backache was completely relieved only in 38 percent, sensory disturbance in 43 percent, and numbness in 45 percent. 3) Generally, the follow-up X-rays showed stable narrowed intervertebral space at operated level in patients with satisfactory clinical results, while unstable and severely narrowed intervertebral space was seen in some patients with unsatisfactory clinical results. 4) Lumbar adhesive arachnoiditis was found in one fair and two poor cases. Operative trauma was thought to be one of their etiologic factors. Residual symptoms after posterior nucleotomy appeared to be correlated with this operative trauma."
CD007431,0,463603,0,Bladder neuropathy in lumbar disc disease.,"Disturbances of bladder, function often occur in cases of sciatica due to intervertebral disc lesions, although other clinical signs of sacral root compression are absent. In 32 patients, operated upon because of lumbar disc diseases without cauda equina syndrome, micturition symptoms were registered, and bladder function was investigated. Intravesical pressure/volume relations (water cystometry) and simultaneous intravesical pressure/urinary flow relations (urodynamic examination) were recorded preoperatively together with anal sphincter surface EMG. In almost half of the patients cystometry revealed bladder hyposensibility (late first sensation), and a quarter voided mainly by straining (detrusor paresis). These findings were unrelated to the neurosurgical pathology. Pronounced micturition symptoms or abnormal preoperative urodynamic examinations indicated evaluation two months after lumbar disc operation. Two-thirds tended towards recovery, one third remained unchanged."
CD007431,0,1538885,0,Nonoperative management of herniated nucleus pulposus: patient selection by the extension sign. Long-term follow-up.,"We have previously reported that the ability of patients with herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) and radiculopathy to achieve full passive lumbar extension (negative extension sign) is a useful predictor of favorable response to conservative management. Of 154 patients with back pain and radiculopathy seen between 1979 and 1985, 73 were selected for conservative management based on this criterion. We also reviewed results of electromyography (EMG), computed tomography (CT), myelography, straight leg raise, crossed straight leg raise, deep tendon reflex, and dermatomal-sensory and motor deficits. Ninety-four percent of the subjects achieved full extension within 5 days of hospital admission. Although some patients who had full extension on admission subsequently underwent chemonucleolysis or surgery, none of those who could not extend initially and who later gained full lumbar extension required surgery. Of the 33 patients who were available for long-term follow-up, 94% were satisfied with the results, 82% were able to resume working, 73% required no analgesics, and 9% later required chemonucleolysis or surgery. Positive findings on admission EMG (5 of 7 patients), myelography (5 of 8 patients), or CT (9 of 11) did not preclude good results with conservative management. Female patients without complaint at follow-up (53%) outnumbered their male counterparts (25%). Patients (19 of 33) whose extension sign was initially positive on admission and became negative within 5 days of hospitalization (average, 1.6 days) had better outcomes with 95% satisfied, 90% without job changes, 74% not requiring analgesia, and none requiring surgery. At long-term follow-up, the extension sign effectively predicted a favorable response to nonoperative therapy of HNP in 91% of cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,6864036,0,[Anatomical and clinical study on the femoral nerve lesion].,"Neuralgic and paralytic symptoms due to lesions of the femoral nerve or its related nerve roots are not infrequently encountered and therefore, clinically important. In order to clarify their pathomechanism the author has done anatomical, kinesiologic, and clinical studies. The topographic course of the femoral nerve was carefully observed in 40 cadavers (80 nerves) and transverse sections of 4 cadavers cut horizontally at various levels. The interrelation between the nerve and its surrounding organs was thus analysed. The 81 cases (87 nerves) of femoral nerve lesion, including lumbar radiculopathy, femoral neuropathy, and saphenous nerve lesion, were clinically followed up and the mechanism of their production was analysed. Besides, kinesiologic studies using electromyograms of the trunk and lower extremity muscles were performed in 8 cases (9 lesions) and 20 normal male controls. The main results obtained are as follows: 1. From the embryologic and morphologic points of view, the femoral nerve runs a peculiar course and has characteristic shapes in its transverse sections at various levels. 2. As the nerve lies closely adjacent to several pelvic organs, it can easily be influenced by their pathological conditions. 3. When the adjacent organs are treated surgically, it may be rare that the nerve is injured, constituting a complication. 4. The pathomechanism of the femoral neuropathy occurring at the inguinal ligament is quite similar to that of entrapment neuropathy of the peripheral nerve that occurs at a fibro-osseous tunnel. 5. Even if the quadriceps femoris muscle is totally paralysed, extention of the knee joint is possible to some extent because of a compensatory action of the tensor fasciae latae muscle."
CD007431,0,8266201,0,Clinical experience with automated percutaneous discectomy.,"This study was performed to evaluate a group of patients undergoing automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy. All patients had disc pathology at L4/L5 and L5/S1 documented on CT scan and/or MRI. The range of follow-up was between 3 months and 20 months. The average hospital stay was 2 days (range 1-3 days). A total of 21 patients underwent the procedure and 18 were available for assessment. Of these, 12 patients improved. Of the patients that did not, two subsequently underwent surgical discectomy. There was one failed procedure but no other intra- or post-operative complications. The results of the study indicate that percutaneous discectomy has a demonstrable low morbidity and can be performed under local anaesthesia. However, proper patient selection is important for successful results."
CD007431,0,3192567,0,Diagnosis of lumbar disc protrusion. A comparison between magnetic resonance imaging and radiculography.,"Forty-two consecutive patients with suspected lumbar disc protrusions were studied prospectively to compare the diagnostic accuracy of low-field strength MRI with that of radiculography. Thirty patients subsequently underwent surgical exploration at 33 levels and the operative findings were compared to both methods of diagnostic imaging. All patients had MRI studies, whilst 29 patients also had radiculography. Both studies were evaluated without prior knowledge of the clinical signs, operative findings or the results of other imaging techniques. MRI predicted the correct diagnosis in 29 of the 33 levels explored, an accuracy of 88%. All discs proven to be abnormal demonstrated a reduced signal from the nucleus pulposus. There were two false positive results and two doubtful cases but no false negatives. Radiculography predicted the correct diagnosis in 24 of 32 levels explored, an accuracy of 75%. There were two false positive results, five doubtfuls and one false negative. The overall accuracy when both tests were considered rose to 94%. Of the remaining 12 patients all except one showed good correlation between the MRI and radiculographic findings. These results indicate that low field strength MRI is slightly better than radiculography in diagnosing lumbar disc protrusions."
CD007431,0,17952276,0,Is preoperative occupation related to long-term pain in patients operated for lumbar disc herniation?,"Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common cause of back and sciatic pain. When clinical treatment fails, surgery may be indicated in selected patients. Although surgery is effective in most cases, some of these patients may have a poor outcome. Different factors may influence these results and poor adaptation at work is one well-known cause of treatment failure. This study examines 350 patients on long-term follow-up after surgery for first-time LDH. The relationship was analyzed between occupation before surgery and outcome (maintenance of lumbar and leg pain, satisfaction with the surgical treatment and return to work). The preoperative occupation (employed in public or private services, autonomous, unemployed, housewife, retired or student) and the exertion at work were analyzed as prognostic factors for different clinical outcomes. Although unemployed people had higher numerical analog scale for lumbar pain and retired patients had a higher leg pain, this difference was not statistically significant. Retired people were significantly less satisfied with the surgical result. Higher exertion at work showed a statistically insignificant higher level of pain and lower degree of satisfaction. The authors conclude that preoperative occupation was not a statistically significant factor in this series of patients."
CD007431,0,8826493,0,"Specificity of diagnostic nerve blocks: a prospective, randomized study of sciatica due to lumbosacral spine disease.","Temporary nerve blocks using local anesthetic are employed extensively in the evaluation of pain problems, particularly lumbosacral spine disease. Their specificity and sensitivity in localizing anatomic sources of pain have never been studied formally, however, and so their diagnostic and prognostic value is questionable. There have been anecdotal reports of relief of pain by temporary blocks directed to areas of pain referral, as opposed to areas of documented underlying pathology; but there has been no study to define the frequency or magnitude of this effect. We have examined the specificity and sensitivity of a battery of local anesthetic blocks in a series of 33 patients with a chief complaint of sciatica, attributable in all cases to spinal disease (radiculopathy, with some clinical features of arthropathy). As determined by blinded patient analog ratings in randomized sequence, three different nerve blocks were significantly more effective than control lumbar subcutaneous injection of an identical volume of 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (P < 0.05). Not only paraspinal lumbosacral root blocks and medial branch posterior primary ramus blocks (at or proximal to the pathology), but also sciatic nerve blocks (distal or collateral to the pathology) produced temporary relief in a majority of patients. This confirmed the study hypothesis that false positive results are common, and specificity is low. For sciatic nerve blocks, specificity was between 24% and 36%. Patterns of responses specific to the established diagnosis of radiculopathy (i.e., root block most effective) had sensitivities between 9% and 42%. Statistical analysis of clinical and technical prognostic factors revealed that the only association with pain relief by any block were the effects of other blocks. The strongest association was between relief by sciatic nerve block and relief by medial branch posterior primary ramus (facet) block (P = 0.001, odds ratio 16.0). There were no associations between the results of blocks and clinical findings (history, physical examination, diagnostic imaging) in these patients, chosen for their homogeneous clinical presentation and absence of functional signs. Our findings indicate a limited role for uncontrolled local anesthetic blocks in the diagnostic evaluation of sciatica and referred pain syndromes in general. Negative blocks or a pattern of responses may have some predictive value, but isolated, positive blocks are non-specific. This lack of specificity may, however, be advantageous in therapeutic applications."

The L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs were investigated by both techniques in all patients. In addition, the L3-L4 disc was investigated in 20 patients. The 220 investigated discs were sorted out into 6 CT categories according to morphologic and technical criteria. They were also classified into 3 discographic groups according to morphologic and clinical criteria. Based on morphologic considerations alone, the false-negative CT rates varied from 0 to 64% and the false-positive rates varied from 0 to 19%, depending on the category under consideration. Based on both morphologic and clinical consideration, the false-negative CT rates varied from 34 to 57% and the false-positive CT rates varied from 23 to 50%. Thus, high-resolution CT does not constitute an adequate means of investigation for this category of patients and discography appears justified before considering any form of radical therapy."

The study population consisted of 240 subjects with knee pain aged 19 to 93 years. A total of 309 knees had a weight bearing AP in extension, lateral, skyline and tunnel view radiographs. Each radiograph was reported with respect to features related to osteoarthritis, modified from the Ahlback system. Each feature was assessed using the tunnel radiograph alone and then the AP, lateral and skyline views in combination without, and blind to, the information from the tunnel view. On the basis of Bowker's test, the tunnel view was more likely to pick up abnormal intercondylar notch and tibial spine osteophytes but not loose bodies. We conclude that the tunnel view is a valuable addition in the routine assessment of the knee joint in osteoarthritis but not for the diagnosis of loose bodies alone."

The study was carried out with 8 inpatients affected with a unilateral sciatica resulting from an X-ray identified dorsal root compression from discal origin. The sural nerve was electrically stimulated at the ankle level while BEPs were recorded monopolarly from the vertex. The stimulus intensity eliciting a liminal nociceptive reflex response in a knee-flexor muscle associated with a liminal pain was selected for this study. Both normal and affected side were alternatively stimulated during several conditions of controls and of Lasègue's manoeuvres performed on the normal and on the affected side. Results show that the Lasègue manoeuvre performed on the affected side induced a significant increase in the amplitude of N150-P220; performed on the normal side, this same manoeuvre resulted in a significant decrease of the N150-P220 amplitude. These variations were observed whatever was the side (normal or affected) under sural nerve stimulation. The possible neural mechanisms of these changes and clinical implications of these data are then discussed."

Ranges of SLR and SLR with dorsiflexion (SLR/DF) to onset of lumbar or leg symptoms (P1) were independently measured using a gravity goniometer by pairs of different physiotherapists at two clinics. Dorsiflexion significantly reduced SLR range by a mean of 9 degrees across both samples. Similar high inter-rater reliability was found for SLR and SLR/DF in both pairs of physiotherapists. These data show that SLR and SLR/DF are reliable procedures when measured to P1 in the clinical environment and support previous findings that dorsiflexion reduces range of SLR.

CD007431,0,9615139,0,[Long-term outcome at adjacent levels of lumbar arthrodesis].,"Posterolateral lumbar fusion is commonly recognized to have a significant effect upon the more proximal unfused segments. Wether these effects are clinically significant remains unclear. Long term studies with standardized follow-up are scarce. The purpose of this study was to examine the long term roentgenographic and clinical effects of posterolateral fusion upon the 3 cephalad unfused segments. The levels below a floating fusion were also examined. The factors promoting the occurrence of degenerative changes on standard or dynamic x rays were also investigated with a multivariate analysis model. 102 patients who underwent a posterolateral fusion were retrospectively reviewed with an average follow-up of 8.9 years. 39 patients (group I) were fused for low back pain caused by isthmic lysis spondylolisthesis, 15 (group II) for degenerative disc disease and 48 (group III) in addition to a posterior decompression for a lumbar spinal stenosis. Pre and postoperative standard and dynamic roentgenograms were compared in order to study: evolution of the disc space height, modifications in the angular and antero-posterior mobility, modifications in the antero-posterior displacement of the vertebral bodies. Degenerative changes were frequent. 49 per cent of the patients demonstrated a severe disc space narrowing, 30 per cent developed a degenerative spondylolisthesis, 32 per cent an angular hypermobility and 35 per cent an antero-posterior hypermobility. Only one factor was found to increase significantly the occurrence of degenerative changes: the indication of lumbar fusion. Degenerative changes were significantly more frequent in group III's patients. However, no significant correlation was found between the roentgenographic findings and the final functional results and only 8 patients required a new surgery. These results may suggest that posterolateral fusion accelerates the development of degenerative changes in adjacent discs if the fusion is performed on a degenerative spine."

Of these three who were hypersensitive to iodine were reoperated at a time when the hospital did not yet possess a CT based on clinical symptoms. In 61 patients the indicated re-operation was supported by the conclusions of periradiculographic, in 21 of native CT and in 17 based on both mentioned examinations. Comparison of the surgical findings with the X-ray findings revealed that on periradiculography the conclusion was in complete agreement in 31 patients, in another 27 partial agreement (a total of 73.3% patients examined in this way), in those examined by CT there was complete agreement in 16 and partial agreement in 11 (i.e. 71.1% on this sub-group).

CD007431,0,8278829,0,Scapulohumeral reflex (Shimizu). Its clinical significance and testing maneuver.,"Searching for a muscle stretch reflex that is innervated by the high cervical cord, the authors discovered the scapulohumeral reflex (Shimizu)--SHR (Shimizu). The testing maneuver, localization of the reflex center, its clinical significance, and the designation of the SHR (Shimizu) are dealt with in this report. The SHR is elicited by tapping the tip of the spine of the scapula and acromion in a caudal direction. The SHR is classified as hyperactive only when an elevation of the scapula or an abduction of the humerus have been clearly defined after tapping at these points. Two hundred twenty-five patients with cervical spine disorders, 90 normal individuals, and 17 patients with cerebrovascular strokes were examined. The incidence of hyperactive SHR was highest among several neurologic abnormalities in spastic cases with craniovertebral or high cervical lesions, and all cases with hyperactive SHR in the cervical spine disorder group exhibited neural compressive factors at the high cervical region. The major muscles participating in the SHR are considered to be the upper portion of the trapezius, the levator scapulae, and the deltoid. According to the anatomic level of compressive factors and the postoperative course of the activity in hyperactive SHR cases, the reflex center of the SHR is clinically presumed to be located between the posterior arch of C1 and the caudal edge of the C3 body. Hyperactive SHR provides useful information about dysfunctions of the upper motor neurons cranial to the C3 vertebral body level."

The nature of the patient's pain--its quality, intensity, location, and profile over time--is an important guide in the evaluation. A careful but directed physical examination is necessary for the clinical evaluation of patients with lumbar spine disease. Evaluation involves inspection of the back and limbs, palpation, and observation of the patient. A careful neurological evaluation, examination of strength, deep tendon reflexes, sensation, and muscular function is necessary. Electromyography is often useful. The most commonly involved nerve roots are L3, L4, L5, and S1. Lesions of each produce distinct symptoms, and other conditions can mimic the radiculopathies. Specific investigation is necessary for an accurate diagnosis."
CD007431,0,16850291,0,Clinical experience in cell-based therapeutics: intervention and outcome.,"Disc herniation treated by discectomy results in a significant loss of nucleus material and disc height. Biological restoration through the use of autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation (ADCT) offers a potential to achieve functional integration of disc metabolism and mechanics. Nucleus regeneration using autologous cultured disc-derived chondrocytes has been demonstrated in a canine model and in clinical pilot studies. In 2002 a prospective, controlled, randomized, multicentre study comparing safety and efficacy of ADCT plus discectomy, with discectomy alone was initiated. The clinical goals were to provide long-term pain relief, maintain disc height, and prevent adjacent segment disease. Interim analysis was performed after 2 years; Oswestry (Low Back Pain/disability), Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale, as well as Prolo and VAS Score were used for the evaluation. Disc height was assessed by MRI. A clinically significant reduction of low back pain in the ADCT-treated group was shown by all three pain score systems. The median total Oswestry Score was 2 in the ADCT group compared with 6 in the control group. Decreases in the Disability index in ADCT-treated patients correlated with the reduction of low back pain. Decreases in disc height over time were only found in the control group, and of potential significance, intervertebral discs in adjacent segments appeared to retain hydration when compared to those adjacent to levels that had undergone discectomy without cell intervention."

The subjects consisted of 56 young conscripts with LDH and 76 controls. All subjects completed Beck's Depression Inventory and Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. To evaluate pain intensity and functional disability, the Visual Analogue Scale and the Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire were used. LDH conscripts had more depression and anxiety than the controls. The functional disability of the LDH conscripts was significantly related to the four variables: pain intensity, depression, state anxiety, and trait anxiety. Pain intensity and state anxiety significantly contributed to the functional disability in the LDH conscripts. This study suggests that LDH conscripts have some psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety, in comparison to healthy controls.

CD007431,0,9686398,0,Selective abnormality of the N13 spinal SEP to dermatomal stimulation in patients with cervical monoradiculopathy.,"Scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) to dermatomal stimulation have so far proved to be only partially useful in the diagnosis of monoradiculopathy, mostly in cases without motor impairment. The aim of our study was to test the sensitivity of the spinal N13 potential in uncovering lesions of single cervical roots. We studied five patients suffering from cervical monoradiculopathy, using a recording technique allowing specific recording of the genuine N13 potential which is probably generated by dorsal horn cells. No patient showed signs of muscle impairment and needle EMG was always normal. In four patients, the N13 SEP was absent following stimulation of the dermatome corresponding to the damaged root, while both the lemniscal P14 and the cortical N20 components were normal. SEP recorded after stimulation of upper limb troncular nerves showed no abnormality in all patients. Our findings suggest that the N13 potential, the loss of which after dermatomal stimulation could be due to deafferentation of dorsal horn neurones, is particularly sensitive to initial root compression. Therefore, our montage allowing analysis of the genuine N13 SEP can improve the sensitivity of dermatomal SEP recording in patients with cervical monoradiculopathies."

CD007431,0,15940017,0,Evaluation of the changes in the muscle sympathetic nerve activity and anterior tibial muscle blood flow caused by the Valsalva maneuver in patients with lumbago and healthy subjects.,"Clinical symptoms affecting the lower extremities are common among lumber spinal disorder patients. Pain, numbness and sensory disturbance are major signs of these symptoms, and have been suggested to be related to sympathetic nerve disturbance. This study was designed to examine whether these patients experience a difference in sympathetic nerve flow in terms of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA) compared to healthy subjects. Five patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation of the spine (LIDH) and four patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS) were examined along with six healthy volunteers. Basic MSAs for IDH and SCS patients that were introduced from a common peroneal nerve were found to be statistically higher than those of the control subjects. MSA behavior and muscle blood flow introduced from the tibialis anterior muscle over 30 seconds while performing the Valsalva maneuver, a well-known technique used to artificially facilitate MSA, were examined for all subjects, and showed relatively slower changes for LIDH and LSCS patients compared to the normal subjects. Muscle blood flow was inversely proportional to MSA for the normal subjects, and this relationship was observed for IDH patients as well as SCS patients. However, MSA and the muscle blood flow of patients gradually changed while performing the Valsalva maneuver relative to the control subjects. This suggests that the systemic physiological response to the maneuver is maintained, but that, some local modification mechanisms exist."

CD007431,0,2303870,0,Posterolateral microdisectomy for cervical monoradiculopathy caused by posterolateral soft cervical disc sequestration.,"The controversy over whether to use a posterior or anterior approach for surgical treatment of soft cervical discs is still largely unsettled. However, although the posterior approach may be underutilized, it has distinct advantages when there are specific indications. Out of a large pool of cases, 53 patients presented with acute monoradiculopathy caused by soft cervical disc herniation. In 36 of these, the disc was sequestered (nonconfined) and was posterolateral to the disc space as seen on computerized tomography-myelography. Distinct motor weakness was a common clinical finding in all 36 cases. These patients were treated by using a 2- to 3-cm skin incision for the posterolateral microsurgical approach. The extent of the lateral facetectomy depended upon the relationship between the nerve root and the disc. All fragments were lateral to the dural sac and were sequestered through the anulus fibrosus and the posterior longitudinal ligament. Sequestrations were removed under direct microscopic vision, but the disc space was not entered. Pain relief and motor-power improvement in the affected radicular distribution were immediate in all patients. Sensory deficit and residual motor loss improved dramatically with normalization at approximately 6 months. No complications occurred and the mean hospital stay was 2 days. The follow-up period varied from 4 to 42 months with a mean of 26 months. Thus far, there have been no recurrences or other associated complications. By using strict selection criteria and a microsurgical posterolateral approach with removal of the sequestered disc fragment, excellent results with normalization of the monoradiculopathy can be obtained. The ease of this technique, low risk, minimal complications, and excellent results make it an attractive alternative to the anterior approach. The clinical presentations, specific indications, surgical technique, and clinical results are discussed; and a prototype of a small cervical self-retaining retractor is described."
CD007431,0,2303871,0,Diagnosis and microsurgical approach to far-lateral disc herniation in the lumbar spine.,"Lumbar-disc herniations that occur beneath or far lateral to the intervertebral facet joint are increasingly recognized as a cause of spinal nerve root compression syndromes at the upper lumbar levels. Failure to diagnose and precisely localize these herniations can lead to unsuccessful surgical exploration or exploration of the incorrect interspace. If these herniations are diagnosed, they often cannot be adequately exposed through the typical midline hemilaminectomy approach. Many authors have advocated a partial or complete unilateral facetectomy to expose these herniations, which can lead to vertebral instability or contribute to continued postoperative back pain. The authors present a series of 25 patients who were diagnosed as having far lateral lumbar disc herniations and underwent paramedian microsurgical lumbar-disc excision. Twelve of these were at the L4-5 level, six at the L5-S1 level, and seven at the L3-4 level. In these cases, myelography is uniformly normal and high-quality magnetic resonance images may not be helpful. High-resolution computerized tomography (CT) appears to be the best study, but even this may be negative unless enhanced by performing CT-discography. Discography with enhanced CT is ideally suited to precisely diagnose and localize these far-lateral herniations. The paramedian muscle splitting microsurgical approach was found to be the most direct and favorable anatomical route to herniations lateral to the neural foramen. With this approach, there is no facet destruction and postoperative pain is minimal. Patients were typically discharged on the 3rd or 4th postoperative day. The clinical and radiographic characteristics of far-lateral lumbar-disc herniations are reviewed and the paramedian microsurgical approach is discussed."

All patients presented with typical trigeminal neuralgia and low-density area in the parapontine region on CT-scans. Neurologically in all cases slight hypaesthesia in various divisions of the trigeminal nerve without other neurological signs was revealed. Trigeminal pain was completely relieved after surgery in all patients.

CD007431,0,7498070,0,Human root and cord potentials evoked by Achilles tendon tap.,"Lumbosacral root potentials and sacral spinal cord segmental responses were recorded epidurally in 24 normal adult subjects by tapping the Achilles Tendon with the electronic hammer (mechanical). The averaged responses were also recorded from the same epidural levels after the electrical stimulation of the Posterior Tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa (electrical). While the dorsal and reflexively evoked ventral root responses were easily obtained by the electrical stimulation; by the mechanical stimulation only a late and small ventral root response with two negative deflections could be evoked at the L4-5 or L5-S1 I.V. (intervertebral) epidural levels. The ventral root responses elicited by mechanical stimulation appeared 4.0 msec later than those elicited by the electrical stimulation. This time interval was exactly the same when the latencies of the Soleus reflexes to both stimuli were compared that for the Achilles tendon reflex being 4.0 msec delayed. When the sums of their afferent and the efferent conduction times (to and from Th12-L1 I.V. levels) were extracted from the total conduction times of the Soleus H and Achilles tendon reflex obtained by the EMG recordings, the sacral cord conduction delay was found 1.8 msec for the H-Reflex and 4.1 msec for the Achilles tendon reflex. It was suggested that the twice longer time delay along the sacral cord to Achilles tendon tap might be due to the oligosynaptic linkage of the Achilles tendon reflex or it may result from highly dispersed afferent volley producing a slowly rising wave or excitation that takes longer to reach threshold for the soleus motoneurone discharges."
CD007431,0,2775595,0,Lumbar spinal canal size of sciatica patients.,"Seven measures at the three lowest lumbar interspaces were recorded from conventional radiographs of the lumbar spines of 160 consecutive patients with low back pain and sciatica admitted for myelography and possible surgery. Eighty-eight patients were operated upon for disc herniation, and of the conservatively-treated 72 patients, 18 had a pathologic and 54 a normal myelogram. The results were evaluated after one year using the occupational handicap scales of WHO. Correlations of radiographic measures to stature were moderate and to age small. After adjusting for stature and age, only the male interpedicular distances and the antero-posterior diameter of intervertebral foramen at L3 were greater than those of females. The males with a pathologic myelogram had smaller posterior disc height at L3 and a smaller interarticular distance at L3 and L4 than those with normal myelogram, likewise the midsagittal diameter at L3 and L4 in females. In all patients other measures besides posterior disc height were smaller than those for low back pain patients (p less than 0.001) or for cadavers (p less than 0.001). The only correlation between measures and clinical manifestations was between pedicular length at L3 and limited straight leg raising. Where the disc material had been extruded into the spinal canal, the interpedicular distance was significantly wider. Only anterior disc height at L3 revealed differences between good and poor outcome one year after surgery, as did the interarticular distance at S1 in patients with normal myelogram after conservative treatment."
CD007431,0,1308095,0,Objective clinical evaluation of physical impairment in chronic low back pain.,"The aim of this study was to investigate physical impairment in patients with chronic low back pain, to develop a method of clinical evaluation suitable for routine use, and to consider the relationship between pain, disability, and physical impairment. Twenty-seven physical tests were investigated. Permanent anatomic and structural impairments of spinal deformities, spinal fractures, surgical scarring, and neurologic deficits were excluded as not relevant to the patient with low back pain in the absence of nerve root involvement or previous surgery. Three consecutive 20-patient reproducibility studies were used to develop reliable methods of examination for 23 of the tests. Only four tests were excluded as unreliable: sacral angle, pelvic tilt, and separate lumbar and pelvic extension, none of which are part of routine clinical examination or have any proven relationship to disability. The remaining 23 physical tests were evaluated in 70 asymptomatic subjects and 120 patients with chronic low back pain. Passive knee flexion, passive hip flexion, hip flexion strength, hip abduction strength, pain reproduction on each of these tests, and the prone extension strength test were excluded because they were too closely related to nonorganic and behavioral responses to examination. Eight tests successfully discriminated patients with low back pain from normal subjects and were significantly related to self-report disability in activities of daily living: pelvic flexion, total flexion, total extension, lateral flexion, straight leg raising, spinal tenderness, bilateral active straight leg raising, and sit-up. Factor analysis failed to demonstrate an underlying statistical dimension of physical impairment. However, an empirical combination of total flexion, total extension, average lateral flexion, average straight leg raising, spinal tenderness, bilateral active straight leg raising, and sit-up provided an equally satisfactory alternative. Simple cut-offs from normal subjects made the scale simple and quick to use. This final scale successfully discriminated 78% of patients and normal subjects and explained 25% of the variance of disability, with a specificity of 86% and sensitivity of 76%. This scale provides an objective clinical evaluation that meets the criteria for evaluating physical impairment, yet is simple, reliable, and suitable for routine clinical use. It should, however, be emphasized that all the tests included in the final scale are measures of current functional limitation rather than of permanent anatomic or structural impairment. This raises questions about the physical basis of permanent disability due to chronic low back pain."

Myelograms of the same reliability as those obtained with other water-soluble contrast media were obtained. However, arachnoiditis as sequelae to previous myelography with oil-soluble and earlier water-soluble contrast media prevented the correct evaluation in some cases.

CD007431,0,2483632,0,[Radiculopathy and the organization of health services: applicability verification of a technic for analyzing time factors in diagnostic procedures].,"The PERT is a SPR (Reticular Programation System) based on statistic-mathematic models. Since some years they are applied to productive processes to increase the efficiency and effectiveness. They all have a same base structure which is the net that is composed by the logical succession of the event and the activity which has the part of the project. Determining the minimum time (to), the maximum one (tp) and the more frequent time (tm) of each activity and applying the statistic method PERT, one gets the probable duration (te) of every activity and the critical path of the net is placed in evidence. This is formed by the chain of those activities whose duration determines the total duration of the project. The Authors have desired to verify the applicability of SPR even to the ""medical industry"" and, more precisely, to the diagnostic process for the verification of radiculoneuropathy. Such pathology affects a large part of the active population. The diagnostic process in this case comprises besides an accurate neurological and clinical examination of the patient, also the x-ray exam, the electromyography, the Computed Tomography (CT) and the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) exam. These last two investigations gives an increase of diagnostic accuracy. With the collaboration of the physicians of the diagnostic Service, the Authors have measured in every step of the diagnostic procedure the waiting time of 48 patients with low back pain. Applying the PERT method, it has been possible to put in evidence in the net the critical activities. They are such that their duration time determines the probable duration of the whole diagnostic process. Such duration in this case it corresponds to 91 days with a standard deviation of 33 days. The delay of any critical activity causes a lealy of the whole route. This delay influences negatively on the patient's health. Besides it determines an economic damage to the system because a relation cost/time exists. The systems of reticular programmation have as objective not only the one of improving the programmation and the control of the processes, but also the attainment of an optimum cost/time ratio, varying in a way that the total cost of the realization of the process is minimum. They represent a useful criterion to direct Quality Assurance (Q.A) in the local political sanitary context, within the bounds of organization of technical - scientific quality. An accurate application of the Q.A. should modify besides the duration of the critical activities."

As for features of the clinical symptoms, the cases were divided into four groups, characterized by symptoms that gradually increased in importance and in frequency, the type of deformity and degree of deviation (scoliosis and lumbar kyphosis are reported). Adult and elderly lumbar spine deformities are often symptomatic, because the degenerative changes of deformed spine and the progression of the deformity. Patients with such a clinical picture need surgical correction of the deformity in order to improve their symptoms. Sometimes these patients undergo disc herniation surgical procedures, because of wrong interpretations of CT scans or MR images. Segmental instrumentation correction devices led to a fair correction of deformities, and improvement of back and radiated pain. Despite the great improvements (both in instrumentation devices and anesthesiological techniques) this surgery remain a major surgery, both of (or) the patient and the surgeon."

Multiple regression analyses were used to identify the best predictor variables of four different outcome measures (i.e. pain relief, reduction of disability in daily activities, return to work and surgical outcome). MRI-identified nerve root compromise and social support from the spouse were independent predictors of pain relief 2 years after surgery (R2 = 0.40, P < 0.01). Return to work 2 years after surgery was best predicted by depression and occupational mental stress (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). MRI-identified extent of herniation and depression were significant predictors of a good surgical outcome after lumbar discectomy (R2 = 0.61, P < 0.001). This study has demonstrated that the outcome of discectomy is critically dependent on which outcome variables are selected and that different sorts of predictor variables have a distinct influence on the various outcome variables. Obvious morphological alterations (i.e. disc extrusions, nerve root compromise) proved to be significant predictors of postoperative pain relief and improvement of disability in daily activities justifying a surgical treatment approach in these cases. The most important finding of this study was that return to work was not influenced by any clinical findings or MR-identified morphological alterations, but solely by psychological factors (i.e. depression) and psychological aspects of work (i.e. occupational mental stress)."

They were assessed before the initial operation, between the two procedures and at a minimum of two years after reoperation. MRI was performed before primary discectomy and reoperation. Fifty consecutive patients who had a disc excision during the study period but did not have recurrent radicular pain, were analysed as a control group. Of the study group 42% related the onset of recurrent radicular pain to an isolated injury or a precipitating event, but none of the control group did so (p < 0.001). T2-weighted MRI performed before primary discectomy showed that patients in the study group had significantly more severe disc degeneration compared with the control group (p=0.02). Intraoperative findings revealed recurrent disc herniation in 24 patients and bulging of the disc in two, one of whom also had lateral stenosis. Epidural scarring was found to be abundant, intraoperatively and on MRI, in eight and in nine patients, respectively.

In a prospective cohort study of 277 patients undergoing surgery for lumbosacral radicular syndrome, the predictive value of preoperatively measured cognitive-behavioral factors (fear of movement/(re)injury, passive pain coping, and negative outcome expectancies) for disability and pain intensity at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery was investigated, taking into account the effect of possible confounding variables. Higher levels of cognitive-behavioral factors were found to be associated with a worse outcome at both 6 weeks and 6 months. These associations remained significant after controlling for possible confounding variables (preoperative disability and pain intensity, age, gender, educational level, duration of complaints, neurological deficits, and intake of analgesics) and pain intensity 3 days postoperatively. In multiple regression analyses, the cognitive-behavioral factors independently predicted different outcomes. Fear of movement/(re)injury predicted more disability and more severe pain at 6 weeks and more severe pain at 6 months; passive pain-coping strategies predicted more disability at 6 months; and negative outcome expectancies predicted more disability and more severe pain at both 6 weeks and 6 months. The findings support the potential utility of preoperative screening measures that include cognitive-behavioral factors for predicting surgical outcome, as well as studies to examine the potential benefits of cognitive-behavioral treatment to improve surgical outcome."

It is postulated that measurements of endurance, kinematics, postural stability, and coordination, in addition to strength, are necessary to fully document the patients' functional capabilities. This research study was conducted in order to understand the effects of fatigue on the above factors. Twelve healthy male subjects performed a repetitive lifting test in which a submaximal load was lifted at a maximal rate. Knee, hip, and trunk motion was measured using videography and electrogoniometry, postural stability was measured using a forceplate, and coordination parameters were determined using phase-plane analysis. Fatigue was documented by a 31% reduction in lifting power. At the end of the endurance test, there was less knee and hip range of motion and greater spine peak flexion, while the coordination measures demonstrated that there was greater hip and lumbar spine extension earlier in the lifting phase. The postural stability declined as the test endured. Utilization of these measures may guide physical therapists in their rehabilitation of low back pain patients."

Ninety-eight patients [mean (SD) age 43 (13), 61% males] undergoing lumbar disc herniation surgery were selected for this clinical 12-month follow-up. Subjective disability and back and leg pain were assessed by ODI version 1.0 and the visual analog scale. Pre-operatively females had a significantly higher mean (SD) total ODI [59(3)] than males [51(2)] (P = 0.030). Females were more disabled in the walking, sex life, social life and travelling items of the ODI compared to males. The total Oswestry decreased by 38 (95% CI - 44 to - 31) in females and by 34 (- 39 to - 30) in males at the 1-year follow-up. Most of the improvement (88% in females and 80% in males) occurred during the first 6 weeks; thereafter the changes were minor. In males the changes were greatest in pain, social life and travelling and in females in walking, social life and travelling. Internal consistency value of ODI was 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.91). Item analysis of the ODI showed that all the items except pain had high corrected item correlation. As recovery following lumbar disc surgery occurred to a great extent during the first 6 weeks, the early post-operative outcome appears to be quite a reliable indicator of the overall post-operative outcome over the 1-year follow-up. The ODI proved to capture a wide range of disability in these lumbar disc surgery patients, thereby supporting the future use of the index. The ""pain intensity"" component, which collects data on the use of painkillers in version 1.0 of the ODI did not support the item structure of the index in this study.

CD007431,0,16293153,0,The effect of delayed-onset muscle soreness on stretch reflexes in human low back muscles.,"The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of moderate delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) on the short latency stretch reflex (SLR) and long latency stretch reflex (LLR) response i.e. electromyographic (EMG) onset latencies and EMG amplitudes in erector spinae (ES). Nine males with muscle soreness (DOMS group) were tested 24, 48 h, and 7 days post-exercise. Eight males (control group) were tested likewise. EMG was measured from ES bilaterally at the level of L3/L4. The SLR was elicited by mechanically tapping the ES at L3/L4, and the LLR was elicited by sudden loadings of the spine. Significant reductions in force during maximal voluntary contractions and range of motion, and a significant increase in muscle soreness (measured by pressure algometry) and subjective experience of soreness in the low back indicated DOMS 24, and 48 h post-exercise in the DOMS group. No changes were observed in the control group. The SLR and LLR response were unaffected by DOMS, i.e. no changes in EMG latencies and amplitudes were observed. In conclusion, despite changes in DOMS indicators, the reflex system protecting the stability of the lumbar spine is apparently capable of maintaining an appropriate triggering of SLR and LLR."
CD007431,0,7810252,0,[Predictors of treatment success after microsurgical operation of lumbar intervertebral disk displacement].,"As far as medical decision making is based on weighing up individual risks and chances of a certain patient receiving a certain treatment, some knowledge is required about signs and symptoms which are associated with a certain outcome: they are called risk factors, or predictive factors. In lumbar intervertebral disc surgery, the most frequent undesired effect of the treatment is unsuccessfulness. Reviewing the literature about risk factors for unsuccessfulness, one recognizes a lot of unconfirmed or even contradictory findings. This inconsistency can possibly be attributed to the common use of a very simplified, unidimensional definition of the target variable ""success of treatment"". That is why we performed a prospective observational trial on 109 patients in whom the success of lumbar intervertebral disc microsurgery was assessed after half a year using six different target variables. The rate of treatment success varied considerably, from 44% (when ""return to previous occupation"" served as the target variable) to 91% (with regard to ""subjective contentedness""). Further target variables were intensity of sciatica, intensity of low back pain, activities of daily living, and postoperative paresis, giving intermediate success rates. We were able to identify some risk factors (for instance, duration of sick leave and of the recent pain episode, preoperative paresis, intensity of psychosomatic complaints), each of them being relevant to some of the target variables, but none of them associated with all of the target variables. We conclude that the multidimensional rating of treatment successes seems to promote risk research in multidimensional diseases."

CD007431,0,12477697,0,Sensory function in spinal cord injury patients with and without central pain.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) frequently results in neuropathic pain. However, the pathophysiology underlying this pain is unclear. In this study, we compared clinical examination, quantitative sensory testing (QST) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in SCI patients with and without pain below spinal lesion level, with a control group of 20 subjects without injury. All patients had a traumatic SCI with a lesion above T10; 20 patients presented with spontaneous central neuropathic pain below lesion level, and 20 patients had no neuropathic pain or dysaesthesia. Patients with and without pain had a similar reduction of mechanical and thermal detection and pain thresholds, and SEPs. SCI patients with central pain more frequently had sensory hypersensitivity (brush- or cold-evoked pain, dysaesthesia or pinprick hyperalgesia) in dermatomes corresponding to lesion level than SCI patients without pain. There was no difference in intensity of pain evoked by repetitive pinprick at lesion level between patient groups. There was a significant correlation between intensity of brush-evoked dysaesthesia at lesion level and spontaneous pain below lesion level of SCI. These data suggest that lesion of the spinothalamic pathway alone cannot account for central pain in SCI patients, and that neuronal hyperexcitability at injury or higher level may be an important mechanism for pain below injury level."

Multicenter study].,"Results are reported of a multicenter analytic-statistical CT study on 128 postoperative lumbar herniated disk (HD) cases (50 at L4-L5, 64 at L5-S1, 2 at L3-L4, 12 multiple). CT was performed from 10 days to 204 months (47.7 months of mean) after surgery, in 51 patients without and in 77 with intravenous contrast medium (42 in bolus, 35 in perfusion). In 59 cases (38%) a recurrent hernia was found, and in 8% a new hernia. In 81% of patients epidural fibrous scars were demonstrated, in a rough 50% of cases associated with recurrent/new hernia: posterior fibrosis was found in 81% of cases, while unilaterally, bilaterally, or anteriorly extended fibroses were present in 20%, in 4.7%, and in 29% of cases respectively. In 72% of the patients injected with contrast medium, various kinds of fibrosis contrast enhancement were detected. In 8% neither fibrosis nor recurrent herniation was found. In 22% of cases lateral and/or central bony canal stenosis was present, in 26% vacuum disk, in 9% intracanalar calcifications, in 39% and in 19.5% dural sac stretching and compression respectively. In 5 cases a pseudomeningocele was found, and in 3 only a postoperative diskitis. Fibrosis is an almost inevitable postoperative consequence (4 out of 5 cases); it can be demonstrated by CT with high sensitivity and good specificity. A series of diagnostic criteria, such as the post-contrast media reaction, allow fibrosis to be discriminated from recurrent hernia. However, the possible association must be kept in mind of both diseases and/or of included roots in the scar. Myelography is hardly ever able to supply further resolutive diagnostic elements, while Myelo-CT is sometimes more useful. The importance of bone changes is questionable, with the exception of evident cases of canal stenosis, also because in most cases the radiologist cannot count on a preoperative CT study. Furthermore, the correlation between CT and clinical findings (possible asymptomatic fibrosis) is often difficult, which gives way to contrasting therapeutic attitudes."
CD007431,0,6456338,0,Prognostic indicators in low back pain.,"Nearly four per cent of the population over the age of 15 years in a Danish general practice reported episodes of low back pain at least once a year. A one-year follow-up of 72 patients provided data regarding symptoms, length of absence from work, use of analgesics and bed rest. An indication of the prognosis was reached by relating these data to the history (including occupation), symptoms and signs noted at the initial interview. The following factors indicated a long or relapsing course:1. More than three previous episodes of low back pain.2. Gradual onset of symptoms.3. Pain referred distal to the femur.4. More than four weeks' delay in reporting symptoms.Other factors of prognostic significance were difficulty in moving, onset in relation to work, absence from work, positive straight leg raising test and unilateral pain in the loin."

(99m)Tc-ciprofloxacin scintigraphy was performed in 71 patients: 30 patients referred for suspicion of osteomyelitis (OM) or septic arthritis (SA) (group 1) and 41 controls (group 2). Imaging was performed at 4 h post injection and, when possible, at 8 or 24 h post injection. Tracer uptake was visually assessed in different joint groups, and in the sites suspicious for infection. Several soft tissue sites were also evaluated. In the group referred for osteo-articular infection, we found a lower specificity (54.5%) than has previously been reported in the literature. Evaluation of tracer uptake at late imaging did not improve discrimination between sterile and non-sterile inflammation. Additionally, articular uptake was seen in many control patients. Infecton uptake in growth cartilage, thyroid gland, vascular pool, lungs, liver and intestines is discussed."

CD007431,0,9479415,0,Early postoperative MRI findings following surgery for herniated lumbar disc. Part II: A gadolinium-enhanced study.,"The aim of our study was to evaluate the contrast-enhanced MR imaging (MRI) findings, in the early postoperative period, in unselected patients undergoing lumbar microdiscectomy (15/16 had total resolution of their symptoms). Contrast-enhanced imaging studies were performed, in all 16 patients of our series, before surgery, and at the third postoperative day and, two months after surgery. Postoperative paraspinal muscles enhancement was present in all patients. In the postoperative period, nerve root enhancement was present in 5/16 patients at the early survey and persisted in one after two months. A pseudohernia depicted as epidural intermediate signal intensity tissue, was seen in 13 patients at the third day MRI, and only in eight after two months. This pseudohernia enhanced peripherally in 8/13 patients and enhanced homogeneously in the remaining five at the first postsurgical examination; in the late MRI the peripheral enhancement was appreciable in only two patients while a homogeneous enhancement was observed in six. Clinical symptoms resolved completely in 14/16 patients on clinical evaluation at the third postoperative day, while the remaining two patients showed residual symptoms and signs of radicular compression. At the early MRI these two patients showed intradural nerve root enhancement. Two months later, one patient did not show the previously described nerve root enhancement and improved clinically, while the other had a positive Straight Leg Raising Sign with persistent intradural nerve root enhancement. In conclusion, no correlation between clinical course and contrast-enhancement of pseudohernia and extradural nerve root was appreciable, although intradural nerve root enhancement seems to represent a clinically relevant finding."

Seven percent had complaints from back and knee, and 3% from the heel. When the hamstrings were so short that one knee had an extension deficit gently measured to more than 40 degrees, when the hip was flexed 90 degrees, the incidence of back pain rose significantly to 15%. Furthermore 18% had complaints from the knee and 35% from the heel when the passive range of motion of the foot was less than 0 degrees of dorsiflexion measured with the knee extended. As 75% of the boys and 35% of the girls over age ten have short hamstrings and 13% of both sexes have short Achilles tendons, it is recommended that school children be involved in a daily stretching programme in order to diminish the complaints from the extremities often seen in this group."

The main conclusions drawn in relation to decision making are as follows: low-back pain is more frequent than sciatica or intermittent claudication, but the latter is more disabling; acute attacks are generally more disabling than chronic pain, and the frequency may be more closely related to poor prognosis than the duration; radiologic findings are of little value in differentiating the incidence and degree of the symptoms during life; myelographic or peridurographic abnormalities do not always suggest poor prognosis."
CD007431,0,1532978,0,Diagnostic utility of the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire for classification of low back pain syndromes.,"Verbal pain description and assessment of functional limitations are key components in the clinical evaluation of patients with low back pain syndromes. Using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) to quantify the pain experience and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) to quantify functional disability, a study was undertaken to determine the efficiency with which the MPQ and ODQ were capable of enhancing the differential diagnosis of three broad categories of low back syndromes. Three discriminative models were employed. The combined discriminant model (MPQ/ODQ) yielded the highest accuracy, 0.90, and it was the only model with acceptable predictive power. The greatest utility of the discriminant models was found to be ruling out nonspecific low back pain and ruling in radiculopathy, with and without neurological deficits. Subjective pain and disability appear to have the potential for successfully differentiating broad categories of low back pain. Further studies need to be performed to assess the discriminant power of the MPQ and ODQ for specific diagnostic entities."

In 3.1% of cases CT was false negative and false positive in 9.4%. The authors think, that if CT picture reveals the level of hernia which correlates with clinical symptomatology it is absolutely sufficient for planning surgery. In cases with divergence between CT picture and clinical findings, myelography should be performed for establishing a proper diagnosis."

CD007431,0,2743656,0,Quantifying postoperative deficits of physical function following spinal surgery.,"This study evaluates the degree of objectively quantified physical deconditioning of spinal surgery patients. The object is to evaluate the data in terms of the pain and disability claimed by 35 male and 11 female patients three months after spinal surgery. Among the males, two subgroups (i.e., disc excision or spinal fusion) were evaluated. All patients reported subjective indices of pain/disability and completed quantified tests of lumbar motion, sagittal trunk strength, lifting capacity, and bicycle ergometry. In general, true lumbar motion was markedly restricted to 50%-60% and trunk strength means were below 50% of gender-specific normative values. There were similar deficits for lifting capacity. Those who had spinal fusions tended to perform poorly, with a relatively high incidence of pain/disability. There were no differences found between the male group and subgroups who were gainfully employed or had a brief period of disability prior to surgery or had low subjective pain/disability. These results indicate that a patient's subjective pain/disability were not a reliable measure of functional capacity by three months postoperatively. Regardless of working status, pain level, or brevity of disability, there was a significant loss of performance ability and risk of persistent dysfunction after surgical treatment."

The normative values from L3 to S1 were defined, as were the parameters of abnormality. In seven patients with pseudoradicular or referred leg pain, a negative neurological examination and images indicative of protrusion or paramedian disc hernia, the DSEPs were normal in six cases and slightly altered in one. In eight patients with deafferentation leg pain, clinical signs of root damage and images indicative of an intraforaminal hernia, the DSEPs showed varying degrees of alteration which could generally be correlated to the severity of the clinical picture. This method can therefore be useful in differentiating pain due to stimulation of the receptors of the osteoarticular structures or the root sheath, in which the DSEPs are normal, from pain due to direct root damage, in which the DSEPs are altered. This functional evaluation of anatomical damage provides further information which may help to achieve a better therapeutic approach."

Thirty-four of these cases had referred pain down the lower limb. They were all treated, at least in the first place, by manipulation. The response to manipulation demonstrates that, in the absence of evidence of interference with nerve root conduction, limitation of SLR is an unreliable sign of possible disc pathology. Furthermore, the immediate response to manipulation, particularly in the known disc protrusions, strongly suggests that muscle spasm plays a major role in limiting SLR. These points are discussed."
CD007431,0,2230187,0,[Neuralgia of the pudendal nerve. Anatomo-clinical considerations and therapeutical approach].,"The anatomic study of the pudendal nerve and its relation allows an approach of the mechanisms of compression likely to engender perineal neuralgia. Two conflictual zones are isolated: the first is linked to the clamp which is produced by the insertion of the sacro-epinous ligament on the ischial spine and the sacro-tuberal ligament; the second is linked to the falciform process of the sacrotuberal which threatens the nerve by its sharp upper edge. This conflict is particularly acute in a sitting position. The relation between the trunk of the nerve, its branches and these zones of conflict may explain the clinical observations. The electrophysiological investigations (detection of neurogenic muscles of the perineal floor. Increased sacral latency, pudendal nerve terminal motor latency) confirm the diagnosis. The anesthetic blocks of the pudendal nerve on the ischial spine only have a complimentary diagnostic value. The peridural blocks may also have an interesting therapeutic action (60% of good results 3 months later). In some persistent cases, the nerve has been decompressed firstly by perineal approach, but latterly by transguteal approach."

CD007431,0,12538197,0,Epidural injections of indomethacin for postlaminectomy syndrome: a preliminary report.,"Since there have been side effects reported with the administration of corticosteroids epidurally, their application has been limited. Because some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have central and spinal antinociceptive actions, we have compared the effects of indomethacin (INM) given by the epidural route to methylprednisolone (MTP). This was a prospective, comparative study in an ambulatory pain care center. Two hundred six patients with recurrent low back pain (Visual Analog Scale >7) and radiculopathy after they had had 2 or more lumbar laminectomies with the diagnosis of ""postlaminectomy syndrome"" were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group I (64 patients) was given 2 epidural injections of lyophilized INM 1 mg. Group II (60 patients) received 2 injections of 2 mg of INM at the same intervals. Group III (82 patients) was treated by 2 epidural injections of MTP 80 mg. In every case, the medication was diluted in 3 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine. Reductions of pain were assessed by changes in the Visual Analog Scale; physical activities, attitude, and medication intake were graded by the Pain Progress Score recorded before each treatment and 2 wk after the last. After each injection, all patients had pain relief to Visual Analog Scale <3. Increased analgesia (P < 0.05) was noted when a double dose of INM was used (Group II) or when 80 mg of MTP was given. The total average scores of the Pain Progress Score showed significant differences at the second injection in Groups II and III only. Physical activity, emotional attitudes, and medication intake were also improved but the changes were not statistically significant. In conclusion, in this group of patients, INM produced adequate analgesia in Groups I and II, with evidence suggesting that 2 mg of INM may produce a similar degree of pain relief as 80 mg of MTP after the second injection. Other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be explored in the future for the same purpose."
CD007431,0,162546,0,A more precise diagnosis for low-back pain.,"Five common syndromes productive of low-back and leg pain are presented as the basis for clinical investigation to arrive at an early and definite diagnosis in low-back pain problems. The five are posterior facet syndromes, sacroiliac-piriformis syndrome, herniated nucleus pulposus, central spinal stenosis, and nerve entrapment in the lateral recess. All may present with a common symptom complex of low-back, buttock, trochanteric, and posterior thigh pain.

Our philosophy is that a biomechanical assessment is one of the disciplines that should be brought to bear on the low-back pain patient. A group of biomechanical tests has been developed by adding quantitative measurement techniques to certain standard clinical maneuvers: muscle testing, range of motion testing, and straight leg raising testing. Moire fringe topography is employed for studying posture. Results of application of these techniques to 117 patients and 10 controls indicate potential utility in the method for epidemiologic and clinical research."

The Achilles tendon reflex was elicited manually with a metal hammer. There was a high correlation between the H-M interval and the Achilles tendon reflex-M interval. The usefulness of the Achilles tendon reflex was evaluated in a selected sub-group of 61 patients with proven L5 or S1 root compression. Neither the H-reflex nor the Achilles tendon reflex appeared to be of any value in detecting L5 root compression.

CD007431,0,8712430,0,Ilioinguinal iliohypogastric nerve blocks--before or after cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia?,"Preoperative local anesthetic blockade of somatosensory pathways involved with skin incision and other noxious perioperative stimuli may ""preempt"" or attenuate the postoperative pain response. Since the Pfannenstiel incision lies within the L1 dermatome, bilateral ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric nerve blocks (IINBs) should provide analgesia after low transverse cesarean section. We designed this study to compare the analgesic effect of IINBs placed before or after cesarean delivery. Forty-six patients undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Before, After, or None. Bilateral IINBs were placed with 0.5% bupivacaine, 10 mL to each side. Twenty-two patients had IINBs placed before surgery (11 failed blocks), 12 had blocks placed after surgery, and 12 had no block. Morphine, through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, provided additional postoperative analgesia. A blinded observer assessed 24-h morphine use as well as patient satisfaction and pain scores (""incisional"" and ""overall"") for 96 h. Although there were no consistent differences in pain scores among the groups, patients in the After group occasionally reported more pain than those in the Before and None groups. Patient satisfaction and morphine use did not differ among the groups. We conclude that there is no benefit to ilioinguinal nerve blocks, either before or after surgery, in patients who receive spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery. Our finding of increased pain in the After group is perplexing and requires confirmation."

The high resolution computed axial tomography (HR CAT) demonstrated laterally herniated discs in all cases. The CAT findings correlated well with the clinical presentations and were proven at surgery to be the cause of lumbar nerve entrapment. The preoperative accurate localization of the lesion resulted in complete postoperative relief of lumbar radiculopathy and back pain in 12 cases with two cases, though relieved of the radiculopathy, had residual mild nondisabling low back pain.

It is used loosely and generally to describe a number of clinical and pathological entities, among which are true primary bursitis, cystic degenerations, calcareous deposits in ligaments and tendons, and so-called ""chronic sprains"" where a calcified deposit cannot be demonstrated. It is possible to differentiate between these four entities in the light of present-day knowledge and to make a more accurate statement of diagnosis. Bursitis is often a symptom... not a primary disease and hence not a proper diagnosis. Calcareous deposits in ligaments and tendons with evident inflammatory reaction have been described in many locations. No area seems to be immune but the rotator cuff and supraspinatus tendon of the shoulder show the greatest incidence. The term inflammatory tendinitis appears to be a reasonably useful one for describing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For further accuracy it can be modified by saying that it is with calcification or without calcification as the case may be. There might be serious consequences from confusing the pain radiation of inflammatory tendinitis (with or without calcification) around the trochanteric region of the hip with true sciatic neuritis arising from a herniated intervertebral disk."

Myelography was performed in all cases, spinal computed tomography scanning in three; three patients underwent surgical treatment with good clinical results. Arachnoidal diverticula are a rare complication of operations on the lumbar spine. Spinal computed tomography scanning is very useful, especially in the investigation of large diverticula and in the radiologic visualization of the arachnoidal stalk. Surgical treatment, which is required in symptomatic cases, results in remission of pain and prevents neurological complications."

CD007431,0,11792473,0,The validity of upright myelography for diagnosing lumbar disc herniation.,"Although computed tomographic (CT) myelography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for assessing lumbar disc herniations (LDH), they cannot provide images when patients are standing or walking, whose CT myelograms and MRI images show only slight disc bulging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of upright myelography. We examined by myelography in both an upright and a lying position for 50 patients with LDH at L4-5 and L5-S1 to assess the difference in disc bulge size. Lateral myelogram was used for evaluating the difference quantitatively. In 29 patients with damage at L4-5, 21 (72.4%) had increased disc bulging when upright, and 22 (75.9%) showed subligamentous LDH. In 21 patients with damage at L5-S1, fewer patients showed increased disc bulging when upright than showed unchanged disc bulging. This upright myelographic technique could show increased disc bulging in patients with mild compression at L4-5 whose sciatica increased in an upright position. Upright myelography seems to be the only method for assessing patients with LDH, especially at the L4-5 level, whose neurological symptoms develop during standing or walking."

Hernia size was expressed as an index relating it to the size of the spinal canal. The limitation of the straight leg raising test was not related to size or position of the hernia. Before treatment, straight leg raising was equally restricted in patients with sharply pointed or blunt hernias, but after 3 months straight leg raising was less limited in patients with sharply pointed hernias, whereas after 24 months straight leg raising was regularly normalized. Size index was lower for sharply pointed hernias at all three computed tomography scans. A decrease in hernia size over time, irrespective of shape, was not correlated to a concomitant improvement in straight leg raising. It must be presumed that additional factors, such as inflammatory reactions affecting the nerve roots, are of importance for the magnitude of straight leg raising."
CD007431,0,2151646,0,[Percutaneous nucleotomy: the indications and limits].,"The authors report the results of automated percutaneous diskectomy in the treatment of the herniated disk. During an 18-month period this procedure was used on 39 patients with both evident radicular pathology that had not regressed even after 4-6 weeks of medical and physical therapy as well as clear disk herniation revealed by diagnostic imaging. The level of the herniated disk was L4-L5 in 30 cases. L5-S1 in 7 cases, and L3-L4 in 2 cases. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan in 20 cases, by both CAT scan and x-ray of the spinal region in 14 cases, and by x-ray only in 5 cases. The patients were reviewed 2, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The results were classified according to Watters' criteria based on both the relief of pain and the resumption of everyday work activity. The satisfactory results (excellent and good) totaled 59% at the 6-month follow-up, with no substantial variation at the 1-year follow-up. Hemilaminectomy was performed in 12 cases with unsatisfactory results, confirming the diagnosis of disk herniation in 10 cases (extruded in 9 cases and protruded in 1 case). Diskectomy is a non-invasive, atraumatic method which is indicated for both protruded (non-sequestrated) and subumbilical hernias and allows rapid functional recovery. The rate of success can be increased with more accurate selection of patients based on imaging diagnosis (CAT scan and MRI)."
CD007431,0,1535430,0,The effect of chymopapain on low back pain.,"One hundred and fifteen patients underwent chymopapain treatment for acute disc protrusion between 1980 and 1988. Sixty-six patients who were treated with single-level injection were reviewed retrospectively with clinical follow-up from 2 to 10 years (mean, 4.6 years). All patients met modified McCulloch criteria (not all patients had leg pain greater than back pain). The presence of pre-existing chronic low back pain (LBP) was recorded in 33 patients and compared to their present low back symptomatology and functional limitations. Patients with pre-existing chronic LBP had a success rate of 52%, whereas patients meeting all the McCulloch criteria without chronic LBP had a success rate of 52%, whereas patients meeting all the McCulloch criteria without chronic LBP had a success rate of 85%. The overall effect of chemonucleolysis on LBP demonstrated no change in 18% and a mild increase in 45% of the patients (even though they had a successful outcome). The pre-existing disc space narrowing and the postoperative change of disc space height of 33 patients assessed on lateral roentgenograms showed no correlation to the clinical response. Temporal sequential computed tomography scan assessment of 56 patients following chemonucleolysis demonstrated little change of disc herniation in the first 3 months, with only a gradual and incomplete resolution in the ensuing 12 months."
CD007431,0,17337916,0,Lumbar disc herniation in adolescence.,"Lumbar disc herniation very rarely occurs in adolescence. The aim of this study was to assess the radiological, clinical and surgical features and case outcomes for adolescents with lumbar disc herniation, and to compare with adult cases. The cases of 17 adolescents (7 girls and 10 boys, age range 13-17 years) who were surgically treated for lumbar disc herniation in our clinic between 1998 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. The mean follow-up time for these cases was 60 months. The collected histories revealed that 14 (82%) of the 17 cases involved trauma or intense sports activity. Low back pain was the most common complaint (15 cases, 88%). None of the 17 patients had major symptoms during follow-up, and most were engaged in intense sports or heavy work-related activities during this period. The main features of lumbar disc herniation in adolescents are different from those seen in adults. Careful assessment is vital to avoid misdiagnosis and prevent undesirable results from inappropriate surgery. When surgery is indicated and patients are carefully selected, the results of lumbar discectomy in adolescence can be satisfactory."
CD007431,0,2818155,0,Natchev's auto-traction for lumbago-sciatica: effectiveness in lumbar disc herniation.,"In Lind's auto-traction (LAT) for lumbago-sciatica, the patient provides traction force by pulling with the arms on a specially designed table, which also allows painless mobilization of the lumbar spine and passive traction. Two studies reported that one to 15 one-hour sessions on successive days might be sufficient to relieve pain in 25% to 90% of cases with verified lumbar disc herniation. Unfortunately, the technique imposes tiring manual efforts on the therapist and requires that the patient be transported by ambulance and confined to bed for a long time. These inconveniences were removed in a new version of the treatment proposed by Natchev. The effectiveness of Natchev's auto-traction (NAT) was evaluated in an open prospective trial on 77 patient with chronic lumbago-sciatica refractory to previous therapies, and herniation of one or more lumbar discs verified by computed tomography (CT) or myelography. Thirty-six of the 77 patients (47%) responded to the treatment in three to ten (median = 5) half-hour sessions. Pain intensity dropped to 27% (median) of the pretreatment intensity. Six months after treatment, 28 of the 36 responders were stable; only four had undergone surgery. By contrast, 20 of the 41 nonresponders had been operated on. The severity of either the radiologic or the neurologic picture was not predictive of the outcome. NAT was as effective as LAT: thus, due to its greater convenience it appears to be suitable as a routine approach in lumbar disc herniation and as a screening technique before surgery."

The reflexes were tested in twenty normal subjects. There were found an intraindividual constancy of the respective reflex time with a maximum deviation of 2 ms as well as a lateral variability up to 1.3 ms. Radicular compressions resulted in an increase in reflex time by 2 to 66 ms or failure of the reflex potential to be recorded. The pathological cases were compared with clinical and neurological studies, positive myelographies using radiopaque substances, and results of surgical operations. Compared with the results of surgical operations, changes in reflex time indicated damage to the reflex arc in ninety percent of the cases."

CD007431,0,2527938,0,Chiropractic distractive decompression in treating pelvic pain and multiple system pelvic organic dysfunction.,"No data are available on the incidence of pelvic pain and organic dysfunction (PPOD) in patients suffering from low back pain. PPOD is not an uncommon finding in the low back pain patient. Women appear to be more frequently involved than men. The results of recent electrophysiologic investigations indicate that many patients with urological, bowel or anorectal dysfunction demonstrate evidence of denervation neuropathy in muscles innervated by the branches of the pudendal nerve. Six patients with low back pain meeting predetermined criteria, indicating the presence of PPOD as a result of suspected lower sacral nerve root compression (LSNRC) secondary to a mechanical disorder of the low back were treated with chiropractic distractive decompressive manipulation of the lumbar spine. Symptoms of PPOD, and indicators of LSNRC were assessed prior to the onset, and following the termination of treatment. It appears that selected indicators of LSNRC represent the most sensitive clinical signs of identifying the presence of PPOD which may respond to manipulative treatment, and may also provide the most sensitive measure of overall PPOD response. These findings, although preliminary suggest a possible etiology of PPOD in the low back pain patient with evidence of LSNRC. Further work in this area is encouraged."
CD007431,0,6460310,0,Low back pain and its treatment by spinal manipulation: measures of flexibility and asymmetry.,"Nineteen low back pain patients and eight patients not suffering from low back pain were given several tests of flexibility and asymmetry by two different examiners. Three criteria of reliability and validity were used: (1) significant agreement between independent observers, (2) significantly different scores in the groups with and without low back pain, and (3) significant improvement following a successful spinal manipulation. Tests of anterior flexion and asymmetry of foot eversion met only the first and second criteria while tests of hamstring tightness and asymmetry of voluntary straight leg raising met only the first and third criteria. Passive and voluntary straight leg raising tests were the only measures that met all three criteria. Therefore, of the objective tests investigated here, only passive or voluntary straight leg raising can be strongly recommended for use in the evaluation of spinal manipulative therapy for low back pain."
CD007431,0,11795726,0,Sensorimotor and balance function in older adults with lumbar nerve root compression.,"The purpose of this study was to determine how sensorimotor status and balance control would be affected by lumbar nerve root compression in older adults. The vibration sense, joint motion sense, and strength of the lower legs of healthy older adults and older patients with lumbar nerve root compression (n = 17 each group) were tested for sensorimotor function. The motion of the center of pressure during quiet standing, center of pressure during forward reach, and the score on Berg's functional balance test were examined for static, dynamic, and functional balance control abilities, respectively. It was found that the patient group had significantly weaker strength, greater center of pressure motion during quiet stance, slower center of pressure motion, shorter distance during forward reach test, and lower functional balance ability. No significant sensory deterioration was found. Older patients with lumbar nerve root compression had weaker leg muscle strength and poorer balance control than healthy older adults. A thorough examination of strength and balance should be included in the clinical treatment for patients with lumbar nerve root compression."
CD007431,0,2326703,0,Diurnal changes in straight leg raising.,"Diurnal changes in straight leg raising were measured in 28 patients with criteria of lower lumbar disc protrusion, having first established an acceptable intra-observer repeatability using an oil-filled precision goniometer. Eight patients showed little change between the straight leg raising after a night of recumbancy, and after 180 minutes in the upright posture. Twenty patients, however, had 10 or more degrees of improvement in straight leg raising, with a mean improvement of 16.9 degrees (SD 7.1 degrees); most of the increase occurred in the first hour of being upright. The measurement returned again to the base level after 120 minutes of further recumbancy. Five of the eight patients who showed little diurnal change had discectomy, and four had a complete annular tear. Only one of the 20 patients with more than 10 degrees of diurnal change required surgery. Diurnal change in straight leg raising is probably related to the disc's proteoglycan content, its hydration, the tension of the protrusion and the presence of intact peripheral annular fibers."

CD007431,0,158935,0,Posterior fusion of the lumbosacral spine. Evaluation of the operative results and the factors influencing them.,"The operative results of 79 patients subjected to posterior fusion of the lumbosacral spine were evaluated on the basis of a follow-up examination performed on average 5.4 years after operation. A method of evaluation was developed which measured the patients' subjective improvement and working capacity. The method proved appropriate for clinical use and gave a more correct picture of the operative result than methods relying on the patients' own opinion or the radiographic assessment as the only criterion. Sixty per cent of the patients were subjectively improved, 40 per cent had returned to their previous or a corresponding occupation and 24 per cent had a good operative result, assessed by the method applied. A statistical analysis was performed in order to find the factors influencing the operative results. Age over 40 years, heavy or moderately heavy preoperative work and over 6 months' preoperative disability had a statistically significant, unfavourable effect on the results. In the case of labourers in heavy occupations, working capacity was seldom restored to a degree sufficient for return to their previous work. The operative technique proved reliable with 91 per cent successful fusions, assessed from functional radiographs. Successful fusion did not imply a good operative result, although it did so more often than non-fusion. On the basis of this study, operative fusion of the lumbosacral spine seems to be of relatively little value in the treatment of patients suffering from low back pain, and factors other than purely medical or surgical have a considerable influence on the operative results."

CD007431,0,8777910,0,MR-myelography: a comparison with conventional myelography.,"After creating a MR pulse sequence, called MR-myelography, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the value of this sequence in comparison to conventional myelography. Twenty consecutive patients were examined with conventional and MR-myelography concerning the clinical questions of chronic lumbago, spinal canal stenosis, herniated disc, spondylolisthesis and instability. Six observers assessed both examinations independently for subjective criteria such as pictorial quality, depiction of the dural sac, the nerve roots and their sheaths, artifacts, and the usefulness of single MR-myelography slices. Furthermore the number and extent of stenoses had to be judged as an objective criteria. The employed MR-myelography technique is not able to concur with the quality of conventional myelography. A high-grade stenosis is usually overestimated and low grade stenosis underestimated by MR-myelography. But it is easier to depict further relevant stenoses in a preexisting high grade stenotic spinal canal with MR-myelography. Artifacts of the introduced MR-technique do not disturb pictorial and diagnostic quality very much. In conclusion MR-myelography cannot replace conventional myelography. But together with conventional MR-sequences, MR-myelography can be helpful in the assessment of spinal canal stenosis."

In particular, it was possible to differentiate between discogenic, cicatrized, haematoma-conditioned and osseous compression. However, two facts have to be reiterated: 1. The reference method in the cases under report was exclusively the surgical finding, representing a relatively clearly defined part of the patient material. 2. It goes without saying that the indication for a repeat operation must be based on the clinical findings as well."

The principle outcome was the overall assessment of the patient 6 months after treatment. Treatment was considered to be successful by 61% of the patients in the chemonucleolysis group compared with 44% in the automated percutaneous discectomy group. At 1-year follow-up, overall success rates were 66% in the chemonucleolysis group and 37% in the automated percutaneous group. Within 6 months of treatment, 7% of the patients in the chemonucleolysis group and 33% in the discectomy group underwent subsequent open surgery. The complication rates of both treatment groups were low, with the exception of a high rate of low-back pain in the chemonucleolysis group (42%). The results of this trial confirm previous controlled studies on chemonucleolysis and suggest that controlled studies should be carried out before automated percutaneous discectomy can be considered a useful intervention."

It was possible to combine the results from these assessments to provide a global subjective index. Repeated measurements by the same observer showed a high degree of reproducibility, but when performed by separate observers discrepancies arose in certain questions. By improving certain questions and standardizing their presentation to the patient, a considerable improvement in the correlation of results between observers was obtained. Objective assessments of spinal motion and straight leg raising and a global objective index showed a high degree of intraobserver reproducibility. This technique was applied to a study of relief of back pain by lumbar corsets when it was found that there was significantly greater relief of back pain by a corset with a lumbar support than one without a spinal support. We conclude that the emphasis in assessing the progress of the back-pain patient must be on the subjective parameters, and the technique developed offers a useful method for reliably assessing patients and following their progress."
CD007431,0,18196407,0,Measurement of hip range of flexion-extension and straight-leg raising.,"We believe there is a degree of inaccuracy in the usual methods of evaluation of range at the hip in the sagittal plane, ie, flexion-extension. We describe a simple method of measuring more accurately the range of hip flexion-extension, presuming such ranges of motion should relate to the anatomic position of the pelvis. We used this technique for the measurement of flexion and extension of the left hip in a cohort of 200 healthy individuals; we found a wide range of both flexion (80 degrees-140 degrees ) and extension (5 degrees-40 degrees ). Especially with respect to extension, we believe more conventional methods underestimate the ranges of motion. As a corollary to this study, we suggest some reappraisal of the straight-leg-raising test by which pain from nerve root tension can be distinguished from a source of pain arising locally in intervertebral joints for mechanical reasons or from the hip itself.

However, it has also been shown that many of these findings are found in asymptomatic athletic people of the same age. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies evaluating the gymnastic spine have not made a distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes. Our hypothesis is that MRI will demonstrate the same types of abnormalities in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic gymnasts."
CD007431,0,7256161,0,[Value of tomodensitometry in the diagnosis of lumbar disk hernias].,The authors relate their experiences concerning tomodensitometric examination to evaluate the herniation of a disk. 45 patients and 50 herniations of a disk have been studied. 39 herniations have sustained surgical procedures. The tomodensitometric examination and the radiculosaccography have been performed among these patients in order to compare the findings. The fact that there has only been 3 failures prove the reliability of tomodensitometric examination; among these failure there is 2 post-operative recurrences and one L4 L5 herniation. The radiculosaccography fails 5 times (1 L4 L5 herniation and 4 L5 S1 herniations). There is not any common negative in the two methods. Because of its total innocuity (no injection of any kind) the tomodensitometric examination seems to be the first exploration to prescribe when an herniation of a disk is resistant to clinical treatment and when a surgery is planned.
CD007431,0,6233709,0,Physical measurements as risk indicators for low-back trouble over a one-year period.,"Of all 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-year-old inhabitants of Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, 82% (449 men and 479 women) participated in a general health survey, which included a thorough physical examination relating to the lower back. The examination was constituted of anthropometric measurements, flexibility/elasticity measurements of the back and hamstrings, as well as tests for trunk muscle strength and endurance. The reproducibility of the tests was found to be satisfactory. Twelve months after the physical examination 99% of the participants completed a questionnaire sent by mail concerning low back trouble (LBT) in the intervening period. The prognostic value of the physical measurements was evaluated for first-time experience and for recurrence or persistence of LBT by analyses of the separate measurements and discriminant analyses. The main findings were that good isometric endurance of the back muscles may prevent first-time occurrence of LBT in men and that men with hypermobile backs are more liable to contract LBT. Recurrence or persistence of LBT was correlated primarily to the interval since last LBT-episode: the more LBT, the shorter the intervals had been. Weak trunk muscles and reduced flexibility/elasticity of the back and hamstrings were found as residual signs, in particular, among those with recurrence or persistence of LBT in the follow-up year."
CD007431,0,9216488,0,Reflexes evoked in human erector spinae muscles by tapping during voluntary activity.,"We studied the stretch reflexes, an early R1 and a late R2, by tapping the voluntarily contracted erector spinae muscles and recording from the same spinal level with the subject in the prone position. The onset latencies increased progressively towards the caudal level from 8.8 +/- 0.7 ms at T5-6 to 15.9 +/- 1.1 ms at L4-5 for R1, and from 33.3 +/- 2.7 ms at T5-6 to 49.1 +/- 2.8 ms at L4-5 for R2. The latency changed significantly (P < 0.05) between two adjacent segments from T5-6/T6-7 through L1-2/L2-3 for R1 and T5-6/T6-7 through L3-4/L4-5 for R2. When recorded remote from the stimulus site, R1, considered segmental in origin, showed, as expected, only a small latency change consistent with the time required for the mechanical event to propagate to the recording site. In contrast R2 was shorter in latency with more rostral stimulation irrespective of the distance to the recording sites. This finding implies a centripetal propagation of the afferent impulse along the central pathway, which shortens with more rostral site of stimulation. Of the two components, the more reproducible R1 has a potential diagnostic value for segmental evaluation of thoracic nerve root compression and truncal neuropathies."
CD007431,0,2463743,0,Automated percutaneous nucleotomy--initial experience in twenty-five cases of contained lumbar disc herniation.,"The posterolateral percutaneous approach using the automated nucleotome system has been used to treat twenty-five patients presenting with lumbar radiculopathy refractory to conservative care. The procedures were performed on an outpatient basis and under local anaesthesia and sedation. The patients were either worked up with the MRI, (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or intra-thecal enhanced CT scan and/or lumbar myelography. All the patients were shown to have a contained central or lateral disc herniation that correlated well with the clinical findings. The overall results within a short-term follow-up period (mean of six months) were comparable to those obtained with standard lumbar discectomy. A low postoperative morbidity was associated with this procedure and no significant intraoperative complications have occurred. The indications as well as the pitfalls and potential complications of this surgical technique are emphasized in this report. This preliminary study suggests that in carefully selected patients and in experienced hands this procedure offers a viable alternative to conventional discectomy."

We have operated on 16 patients with juxta facet cysts during the last 3 years. One cyst was located in the thoracic spine, causing a transverse syndrome; 15 cysts were located in the lumbar spine, causing nerve root compression. Diagnosis was established preoperatively by MR in 10 and CT in 3 cases, respectively. The definite classification of the cystic processes was made by histopathologic examination. Surgical treatment consisted of resection of the cyst. Postoperatively, all but 2 patients were free of complaints and no recurrence was observed in the mean follow-up period of 15.5 months. Juxta facet cysts are an uncommon finding, but must be considered in the differential diagnosis of epidural compressive syndromes of the spine."

Part 2: position changes in pressure on the cauda equina in central lumbar spinal stenosis.,"To define the site, degree, and dynamics of mechanical compression of the spinal nerve roots, pressure was measured in 42 patients with clinical symptoms and myelographic findings indicating central lumbar spinal stenosis. Pathological pressure on the cauda equina was found in 67% of the patients. The pressure in the region of the spinal block was high during standing and walking, and in several patients exceeded mean arterial blood pressure. The block pressure was the main mechanical factor in the central part of the spinal canal causing pain and paresis. Elevated fluid pressure caudal to the block was an additional but usually subordinate factor. In 33% of the patients, normal pressure on the cauda equina was found, and lateral compression of multiple nerve roots seemed to be the only mechanical symptom-causing factor. Clinically, these patients could not be distinguished from patients with central compression. After laminectomy with decompression of the cauda equina, the field should be inspected for lateral narrowing which, if present, should be treated."

All patients had sciatica and conservative treatment had failed for at least 3 months. Using the Nucleotome R system, access to the disk was achieved in all but 6 of 172 disks in 152 patients. Degenerative disk disease or pain was the reason for technical failures. Four other procedures were discontinued because of pain and moderate hemorrhage. Except for one case of diskitis, no serious complications occurred. Of the patients in a prospective study, 63 had a follow-up period of 4 months or more. The overall clinical success rate was 62%, and was not significantly influenced by patient sex or age, duration of symptoms, level treated, disk degeneration or amount of nucleus material removed. The results are promising; however, this study indicates a need for refined patient selection in order to decrease the number of failures."
CD007431,0,16896838,0,Modic changes and their associations with clinical findings.,"It is believed that disc degeneration (DD) is, in general, only mildly associated with low back pain (LBP). MRI-identified Modic changes (MC), probably a late stage of DD, are relatively strongly associated with LBP but it is not known if people with MC also have a specific clinical profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the clinical findings differ in people with Modic changes (MC) as compared to those with only degenerative disc findings or none at all. In a population-based sample of 412 40-year-old Danes, information was collected independently with MRI, questionnaires and clinical examination. Three subgroups of people were created: those with both DD and MC, those with only DD, and those with neither DD nor MC. The clinical pattern was investigated for each subgroup in order to test the assumption that the clinical picture differs in the three groups. It was expected that people with both DD and MC would have a more pronounced clinical profile than those with only DD who, in turn, would differ from those with neither of these two MRI findings. Our findings were generally in concordance with our expectations. MC constitutes the crucial element in the degenerative process around the disc in relation to LBP, history, and clinical findings. People with DD and no MC only vaguely differ from those without. People with LBP and MC may deserve to be diagnosed as having specific LBP."

Eighteen hundred and sixty-one laminectomy procedures are reviewed, the majority of these for simple lumbar disc protrusion and spinal canal stenosis but also 204 cases where patients required a surgical procedure for failed back surgery syndrome. Surgical technique and technology will fail when an inappropriate patient is selected for surgical intervention; failure also occurs particularly in lumbar disc protrusion if lateral recess stenosis is undiagnosed and untreated at the time of surgery. The patient's motivation status also has a significant effect on surgical outcome and the optimum patient to submit to surgery for failed back surgery syndrome has sciatica, more severe than backache, a recurrent or residual disc protrusion associated with the stenosis and excellent motivation which is not affected by workers' compensation or other insurance claims or benefit."

The patients were classified as failures or successes at the 12 month follow up according to a clinical overall score. All the 14 failures were investigated with MRI at the one year follow up, and 40 patients classified as successes were picked at random for MRI. Three patients with signs of recurrent disc herniation on MRI were excluded from the study. The MRI scans were independently read by two neuroradiologists who were ignorant of treatment outcome.

CD007431,0,16463199,0,Misleading history of pain location in 51 patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures.,"The aim of this study was to investigate associations between the location of osteoporotic vertebral fractures and the patient's localization of pain. Fifty-one consecutive patients (m 6, f 45; average age 74.8 years) with diagnosed osteoporotic vertebral fractures between T8 and L2 were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were fractures above T8 and below L2, spondylolisthesis, disc herniations, tumors, infections, and instability. Pain location was assessed by pain drawing, subdivided into thoracic, lumbar, and thoracic plus lumbar pain areas, and pain intensity using a 101 numeric rating scale. Furthermore, the onset of back pain and the lack or the indication of a trigger event at the onset of pain were documented. Only four of 20 patients with thoracic fractures reported thoracic pain, while the other 16 (80%) reported only lumbar pain. The location of the fracture and the patient's pain report were not related (Cohens Kappa=0.046; P=0.438). Patients with thoracic or lumbar osteoporotic fractures report pain mainly in the lumbosacrogluteal area. Therefore, the complaint of low back pain (LBP) in persons at risk for osteoporotic fractures may require both thoracic and lumbar X-rays. LBP patients with a suspect history of an osteoporotic vertebral fracture should also be given an X-ray of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Patients with a thoracic vertebral fracture had more severe pain than patients with a lumbar vertebral fracture. Onset not related to a fall or a false movement related to a significantly longer pain duration."
CD007431,0,163892,0,Study of sensitivity to curare in certain neurological disorders using a regional technique.,"A regional technique for the study of curare sensitivity has been applied to patients with Duchenne type muscular dystrophy, myotonic disorders, certain lower motor neurone disorders, to patients with weakness in the arm after hemiplegia, to patients with hyper-reflexia and hypertonia without weakness, and to Parkinsonism. In the dystrophy patients, sensitivity to curare differs from normal controls in that the neuromuscular block persists. The possibilities that this latent defect of neuromuscular transmission is the result of acetylcholine deficiency due to a prejunctional defect or the result of alterations in the property of the postjunctional membrane are discussed. In the myotonic and lower motor neurone disorders, curare sensitivity was similar to that of normal controls. After hemiplegia, the affected side shows resistance to curare when compared with the unaffected side. In states of hyper-reflexia and hypertonia, however, the sensitivity to curare is greater than in normal controls. In Parkinsonism, sensitivity is similar to that of the controls. The results in upper motor neurone lesions are discussed in relation to the dependence of neuromuscular transmission upon the motor neurone, which, in turn, is dependent upon descending impulses."

CD007431,0,8600326,0,"[Myelography, CT scan, electromyography and neurologic examination in the diagnosis of herniated lumbar disk].","The research was carried out at the Clinical Hospital Osijek during a three-year period. Sixty-nine patients (34 men and 35 women) with the diagnosis of lumbar slipped disc who underwent surgery were followed up. The main inclusion criterion was the surgical finding of hernia. The aim of the study was to obtain a clearer insight into the values of the myelography and CT scan by observing a sufficiently large number of patients with surgically verified hernia of lumbar disc. The characteristics of neurological and EMG findings were surveyed, as well. Thirty-one patients were at the age of 40-49 years and 21 were at 30-39 years of age. Only 5 hernias were at the level L3L4, 28 at the level L4L5, and 46 at the level L5S1. Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of the observed parameters were estimated for 41 leftwards and 30 rightwards located hernias. Myelographic finding, regardless of the observed level of slipped disc, showed excellent sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of diagnosis. CT finding was slightly less sensitive at the level L4L5, it was 0.93, and specific at the level L5S1, amounting to 0.90. Its accuracy was not substantially lower than that of myelography. The pathological EMG was 0.88 sensitive, 0.83 specific and 0.84 accurate. The accuracy was excellent at the level L3L4, it was 0.96, but only very good at the level L5S1, amounting to 0.76. A t-test of linked pairs was used to compare surgical reports and diagnostic findings. There was a great similarity between a CT finding and surgical one in all three levels (t-values 1.00, 0.21 and 0.36). Myeolography was more congruent with the surgical finding in the middle level (t-values 1.65, 0.93 and 1.52). An EMG finding was significantly different from that found by surgery (t-values 1.71, 1.76 and 2.71). The existence of Lasègue's sign for the diagnosis of hernia was 0.93 sensitive, 0.07 specific (remarkably low) and 0.36 accurate. It was particularly inaccurate at the level L3L4, moderately accurate at the level L4L5, and rather accurate at the lowest level L5S1. The weakened Achilles tendon reflex was less sensitive than Lasègue's sign, amounting to 0.80. Its specificity was 0.19 and accuracy 0.40. The highest accuracy was in hernias of the lower two levels L4L5 and L5S1. The existence of weakened sense was 0.91 sensitive, specificity was remarkably low, amounting to 0.08, and accuracy was 0.36. It was most inaccurate at the level L3L4 and slightly better at the levels L4L5 and L5S1. Disturbance of leg movements showed sensitivity of only 0.60, but specificity was 0.39 and accuracy 0.46. It was most precise at the level L4L5. Neurological symptoms and signs were insufficiently sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of lumbar disc hernia. On the basis of these parameters, the level of hernia could not be exactly determined."
CD007431,0,2549451,0,The role of thermography in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"We studied 27 normal subjects and 30 patients with low back pain to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thermography in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Thermographic abnormality was defined as the presence of either interside temperature difference exceeding 3 standard deviations from the normal mean, or an abnormal heat pattern overlying the lumbosacral spine. In patients with clinically unequivocal radiculopathy, thermography and electrophysiologic study were similar in diagnostic sensitivity, and the 2 methods agreed on the presence or absence of abnormality in 71% of cases. However, the thermographic findings had limited localizing value. Relative limb warming was often seen in patients with acute denervation on EMG, and limb cooling in those with more chronic lesions, but the side of the root lesion could not be identified confidently by thermography alone. Moreover, thermographic abnormalities appeared not to follow a dermatomal distribution and failed to identify the clinical or electrophysiologic level of radiculopathy in most cases. Thus, the thermographic findings are nonspecific, of little diagnostic value, and of uncertain prognostic relevance."

Stimulation sites were over the dorsum of the foot at the distal fifth metatarsal for the S1 dermatome and at the web space of the first and second toe for the L5 dermatome. Recordings were made at PZ reference to FZ. Spinal cord or cauda responses could not be detected. Both EMG and DSEP were contrasted to myelography or lumbar computerized tomography results on 31 patients. Side-to-side amplitude differences proved too variable to be of use. Sixty-five percent of abnormal DSEP results were on the basis of side-to-side latency criterion, and 35% were on the basis of an absent unilateral response. When compared to EMG and anatomic studies DSEP showed less accuracy and sensitivity. The specificity of the two tests was similar. Using both positive EMG and anatomic studies to define radiculopathy, there were 27% false negative tests and 9% false positive tests. An 86% root level correlation was found between EMG and DSEP.

CD007431,0,6269444,0,Stress reactions involving the pars interarticularis in young athletes.,"A stress reaction involving the pars interarticularis of the lumbar spine was confirmed in seven young athletes with a positive technetium pyrophosphate bone scan. No pars defects were detectable on their lumbosacral roentgenograms, which included oblique views. The return to normal levels of radioactive uptake on repeat bone scans correlated closely with their clinical course. If the bony reaction is recognized early, it may heal at a subroentgenographic level and prevent the development of lumbar spondylolysis. These early lesions usually show unilateral increased uptake at one lumbar level on the bone scan and, initially, the athlete localizes the pain to the corresponding unilateral lumbar paraspinous area. The ""one-legged hyperextension test"" is positive on the ipsilateral side and aggravates the pain. Treatment consists of avoiding the aggravating activities and resting. The average time for return to pain-free competition was 7.3 months. These developing defects may be the source of considerable prolonged disability in the young athlete, particularly if undiagnosed and untreated."
CD007431,0,1750007,0,A quantitative evaluation of sensory dysfunction in lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"A quantitative evaluation of sensory disturbance of the foot was attempted in 94 cases of lumbosacral radiculopathy using the biothesiometer, the Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer, light touch, tuning fork, and dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials. Dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials was the most sensitive of these tests, and reflected the duration of the lumbosacral radiculopathy better than the biothesiometer and the Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer. The biothesiometer and Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer reflected the clinical severity of sensory dysfunctions, the extent of numbness, and the immediate change in sensory function better than the dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials. It is important to understand the characteristics of each test and to choose informative tests for clinical use. Grades of sensory disturbance in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy were classified into three categories in combination with the findings of dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials and the values recorded with the biothesiometer and Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer."

Twenty-four female and 53 male postmen with an occupational seniority of more than 2 years took part in the investigation. The cumulative lifetime prevalence, the one-year and the point prevalence of LBT were 67%, 62%, and 4% in females and 55%, 52%, and 0% in males. The rates are higher than in a representative Danish population 40 years old. Anthropometrical measurements and isometric strength (MVC) in trunk flexors and extensors were recorded. The flexibility of the spine, hip and knee joints, the fingertip-floor distance, and the restricted extension of the knee were evaluated. The isometric endurance in the trunk extensors was measured by two methods: 1) prone with the unsupported trunk in a horizontal position and the legs and hips fixated to a couch; and 2) standing, at 60% MVC. The participants were divided into three groups according to the extent of previous LBT, Group I: LBT to a degree that made work impossible, Group II: LBT experienced but not to such a degree that work was hindered, and Group III: LBT never experienced. The main findings were that the isometric endurance time of the trunk extensors was shorter in group I than in II and III, while the trunk muscle strength, anthropometrical measures and joint flexibility were independent of the persons' earlier low-back episodes. Differences in the distribution of ST and FT muscle fibres are suggested as an explanation of the endurance difference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The diagnosis is clinical and the confirmation is electrophysiological. Distal pudendal nerve latencies have been used but they are unspecific and do not allow to localize the site of compression. A preliminary electrophysiological study has suggested separate innervations of the anterior and the posterior anal sphincter quadrants, so diverging from what main anatomy textbooks teach. By detailed dissections of pudendal nerve region we can confirm a dichotomy in the innervation of the two quadrants. Therefore, it seems feasible, by using the differences of staged sacral reflexes, to better localize the compressive neuropathy, with a stimulation of the clitoris and by recording latencies of different muscles."

The efficacy and safety of etodolac were evaluated based on the changes of symptoms and signs of the patients, including the following parameters: low back pain, leg pain and tingling, gait, the straight-leg-raising test, sensory disturbance, motor disturbance, restriction of activities of daily living (ADL), urinary bladder function, and patients' impressions at each hospital on the initial day, and at one week and two weeks after the start of administration of etodolac, in a total of 88 patients. The overall improvement was noted as a 'marked' in 5% and 13%, 'moderate' or better in 31% and 54%, 'slight' or better in 82% and 84%, 'no change' in 12% and 9%, and 'aggravated' in 6% and 7%, at one and two weeks after administration, respectively.

All of the 11, cases were confirmed by operation. There were 13 protrusions in the 11 cases with the locations of T10-11 in 4, T11-12 in 5 cases and T12-L1 in 4. 9 protrusions fell into central type, 1 into paracentral type and 1 into lateral type. The clinical symptoms were prominent with all 11 cases, however, most primary clinical diagnoses were erroneously given as lumber intervertebral disk protrusions and even the disorders of heart, lung, alimentary tract and urinary system. It was concluded that the main causes of the misdiagnosis included: (1) not easily to think of this entity for the clinic physicians due to its low incidence, (2) the untypical clinical manifestations.

CD007431,0,7487754,0,MRI of intraspinal nerve sheath tumours presenting with sciatica.,"The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of 14 intraspinal nerve sheath tumours (NST) presenting with sciatica were reviewed. The group comprised seven schwannomas, six neurofibromas and one perineuroma. The tumours were either iso- or hypointense with respect to spinal cord on T1-weighted (T1W) images; almost all tumours were hyperintense compared with spinal cord on T2-weighted (T2W) images. The tumours were all detectable on unenhanced T1W images. Nine NST were scanned following Gadolinium-Diethylenetriamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) injection and all showed intense enhancement. This aids differentiation from sequestrated disc fragments. Tumours were more likely to show homogeneous enhancement unless they were recurrent tumours. Rim enhancement occurs more commonly in schwannomas and this can be used to differentiate these from neurofibromas. However, on unenhanced images, schwannomas cannot be distinguished from neurofibromas. Four tumours occurred at T11-T12. There was poor correlation of the site of the lesion with the clinical findings. MRI studies in patients with sciatica should include the lower thoracic region especially if no protruded disc was found in the lumbar region."

The 105 patients were divided into three groups: a treatment group, an alternative group which underwent 1/5 of the treatment group's exercise program per session, and an alternative group in which the treatment consisted of thermotherapy, massage and mild exercise. Regardless of whether the outcome of treatment is assessed qualitatively or quantitatively, a statistically significant, favourable difference was found between the results for the treatment group and those for the alternative groups. The therapy was found to be without risk, but patients with clinical signs of current lumbar nerve root compression or radiological signs of spondylolysis or halisteresis of the column were excluded from the study. The authors recommend the introduction of this form of treatment as a general offer in the primary and secondary health sector. Back exercises can advantageously be conducted in a group; thus, the resources required for this treatment do not differ significantly from those required for many of the other forms of treatment generally employed, which often require individual attention."

Thirty-nine patients (11 male, 28 female; mean age=43.49 yrs) were requested to perform two movements twice, i.e. bending forward and straight leg raising. During each of the four trials, baseline pain, expected pain and experienced pain were recorded. Analyses revealed that patients initially overpredicted pain, but after exposure the overprediction was readily corrected. This exposure effect did not generalize towards another dissimilar movement. The above pattern of results was only characteristic for patients reporting a high frequency of catastrophic thinking about pain. Low pain catastrophizers did not overpredict pain. The results are discussed in terms of the view that exposure may be better conceived of as the learning of exceptions to a general rule."

Imaging by the scanner is a safe and relatively low-cost procedure and its reliability is identical to that of other conventional exploratory methods. It should, therefore, become the initial examination conducted during investigation of sciatica thought to be of discal origin. Reliability of results has varied between 85 and 90 p. 100, according to the author, for this essentially simple and atraumatic method. Confirmation of the presence of a hernia requires the observance of clear signs: material of discal density amputating the spinal canal and spreading over the dural sheath. False negatives or positives usually occur in borderline cases or in previously operated patients. Differences in clinical and computed tomography findings, with undoubted absence of signs on the scan image, require further investigation by radiculography."
CD007431,0,10905440,0,"Relationships between epidural fibrosis, pain, disability, and psychological factors after lumbar disc surgery.","Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is an important complication of lumbar disc surgery. Epidural fibrosis is one of the major causes of FBSS. However, most patients with epidural fibrosis do not develop symptomatic complaints from scarring. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the relationships among the severity of epidural fibrosis, psychological factors, back pain and disability after lumbar disc surgery. Twenty-nine surgically managed patients (13 women, 16 men) were included in this study. In all patients, the presence and severity of epidural fibrosis was determined with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A pain visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) were completed before and after surgery. Subjects were grouped by their type of herniation (protrusion, free fragment), MRI findings and results of the mini form of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and the groups were compared for their VAS and ODQ scores. Our results disclosed that neither the postoperative VAS scores nor the postoperative ODQ scores differed significantly among the epidural fibrosis severity groups. Moreover, postoperative VAS scores were positively correlated with the scores of the mini MMPI. These findings indicate that epidural fibrosis may be considered as a radiological entity independent of patients' complaints. Furthermore, the mini MMPI should be included in the assessment and planning of the reoperations in FBSS patients, because of the importance of psychological factors in postoperative pain and disability."

Selective nerve root block is a useful test to indicate whether the pain is neural in origin and/or whether nerve root is pain producing in these patients with equivocal clinical and imaging studies. Over 8 years, the author performed selective nerve root blocks in 215 patients. Of this group, 78 patients underwent surgery. Following surgery, 71 patients were available for a minimum 12-month follow-up. The preoperative diagnoses included previously unoperated-upon lumbar disc herniation, previously unoperated-upon spinal canal stenosis, and prior lumbar surgery. The average follow-up was 34 months (range, 12-96 months). Overall, there were 38 good (53%), 16 fair (23%), and 17 poor (24%) surgical results. The results for those patients who had had prior surgery were disappointing (52% poor). These data reaffirm that surgical intervention should only be recommended for previously operated-upon patients with unequivocal findings."

However, as these procedures become more common, the long-term consequences are becoming more evident. One such consequence is degeneration of an adjacent segment, which can occur in up to 17% of patients undergoing cervical fusion. A threaded interbody fusion cage has often been used in a primary degenerative disorder of the cervical spine.

Surgical findings at reoperation of 48 patients: 30 patients (3%) had a recurrent disc herniation at the previous site, 9 patients (1%) had disc herniations at a new site only, and 9 patients (1%) had only considerable epidural scar formation. The preoperative differentiation between symptoms related to recurrent disc herniation and those related to epidural scar formation is difficult, because in this situation myelography can not be relied upon.

CD007431,0,10523425,0,Voluntary and reflex control of human back muscles during induced pain.,"1. Back pain is known to change motor patterns of the trunk. The purpose of this study was to examine the motor output of the erector spinae (ES) muscles during pain in the lumbar region. First, their voluntary activation was assessed during flexion and re-extension of the trunk. Second, effects of cutaneous and muscle pain on the ES stretch reflex were measured, since increased stretch reflex gain has been suggested to underlie increased muscle tone in painful muscles. 2. The trunk movement and electromyographical (EMG) signals from the right and left ES during pain were compared with values before pain. Controlled muscle pain was induced by infusion of 5 % saline into the right lumbar ES. Cutaneous pain was elicited by mechanical or electrical stimulation of the dorsal lumbar skin. The stretch reflex was evoked by rapidly indenting the right lumbar ES with a servo-motor prodder. 3. The results from the voluntary task show that muscle pain decreased the modulation depth of ES EMG activity. This pattern was associated with a decreased range and velocity of motion of the painful body segment, which would normally serve to avoid further injury. Interestingly, when subjects overcame this guarding tendency and made exactly the same movements during pain as before pain, the EMG modulation depth was still reduced. The results seem to reconcile the controversy of previous studies, in which both hyper- and hypoactivity of back muscles in pain have been reported. 4. In the tapped muscle, the EMG response consisted of two peaks (latency 19.3 +/- 2.1 and 44.6 +/- 2.5 ms, respectively) followed by a trough. On the contralateral side the first response was a trough (26.2 +/- 3.2 ms) while the second (46.4 +/- 4.3 ms) was a peak, similar to the second peak on the tapped side. Cutaneous pain had no effect on the short-latency response but significantly increased the second response on the tapped side. Surprisingly, deep muscle pain had no effect on the stretch reflex. A short-latency reciprocal inhibition exists between the right and left human ES. 5. It is concluded that deep back pain does not influence the stretch reflexes in the back muscles but modulates the voluntary activation of these muscles."
CD007431,0,130216,0,The facet syndrome.,"Injection of irritant fluid precisely into the facet joint causes referred pain patterns indistinguishable from the pain complaints frequently associated with the ""disk syndrome."" Even straight leg raising and diminished reflex signs can be obliterated by precise local anesthetic injection into the facet joint. The use of radiographically localized injection of steroids and local anesthetic into the facet joint has been presented as a diagnostic-therapeutic procedure. Clinical experience with a group of 100 consecutive patients suggests that this treatment alone can achieve long-term relief in one-fifth of the patients with lumbago and sciatica and partial relief in another one-third of these patients. This information suggests that the structures related to the facet joint can be a persistent contributor to the chronic pain complaints of individuals with low back and leg pain."

CD007431,0,130219,0,Clinical features of lumbar spinal stenosis.,"In contrast with patients with herniations of the nucleus pulposus, those with spinal stenosis experience onset of symptoms at a slightly older age; more males are affected than females. The symptoms tend to be somewhat more chronic, and therefore, the patients will have symptoms of back pain for a longer period of time before developing radiating root pains and will not come to surgical treatment until relatively late. Bilateral root symptomatology is more common although examination shows multiple nerve root involvement only slightly more frequently as well as involvement of the L1 to L4 nerve roots. The spinal movements tend to be somewhat better and straight leg raising tests are usually symmetrical and somewhat less restricted in those patients than in the acute disk syndrome. Postfusion and post-chemonucleolysis spinal stenosis will, of course, have the symptomatology of the initial problem, but their recurrent problems would tend to parallel those of spinal stenosis rather than disk herniation."

CD007431,0,6466060,0,Myelographic versus clinical diagnostics in lumbar disc disease.,"The series consisted of 200 patients on whom lumbar myelography was performed for sciatica. After myelography, a disc operation was carried out on 95 patients. The episode of sciatica was the first for 90 patients. Objective neurologic signs were present in 185 patients, while 15 had only subjective symptoms. Definite or possible disc herniation was revealed by myelography in 66%. Most positive findings were located at the L4-L5 interspace. The clinical diagnostic accuracy rate was assessed from the patients' histories. As confirmed by operation, the accuracy of the clinical diagnostics was 52%, and the accuracy rate of myelography was 90%. The rate of false positive findings in myelography was 4%, that of false negative findings 6%. When the clinical or myelographic diagnosis was definitive, a disc herniation or protrusion was always found at operation. Almost one fourth of the clinically diagnosed definite herniations were not treated surgically because myelography proved negative. One fifth of those patients in whom myelography revealed an unequivocal disc herniation were not operated on because these patients had clinically improved before being admitted to myelography. The results of this study justify the following conclusions: the clinical level diagnostics of a disc herniation is rather unreliable, and myelography is therefore always indicated before operation; myelography should only be performed in those cases in which there is a clear clinical indication for surgery; myelography ought to be performed within 1 week; an unequivocal positive finding in myelography predicts a good operative result."

Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed at 1 week, 5 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery for 28 patients of 34 consecutive patients who underwent single-level disc resection. Enhancement/thickening of the affected root was found to be 100%/89% at 1 week, 50%/57% at 3 months, and 32%/37% at 6 months after surgery. Patients with root enhancement and thickening at 3 and 6 months after surgery had less clinical improvement than patients without it. There was consistent correlation between postoperative clinical developments and nerve root enhancement/thickening in enhanced MR imaging.

The surface field strengths of the magnets were 200 and 50G. Phase I included four random periods of two-week duration: two periods with 200G, one period with 50G, and one period of ""no treatment."" The magnets were positioned either vertically or horizontally in standard lumbosacral elastic corsets. Phase II consisted of two five-week periods with the most effective magnet from Phase I and its corresponding 50 or 200G device. The primary outcome was average daily leg pain score (0-10 scale) in each period of Phase II. Thirty-eight of 40 randomized patients completed Phase I, and 28 of 31 Phase II participants completed the study. In Phase I, pain scores did not differ significantly between 200 and 50G magnets. Phase II average leg pain scores tended to be lower with 200 vs. 50G magnets (3.2+/-2.1 for 200G vs. 3.9+/-2.2 for 50G magnets [P=0.08]) after excluding one unblinded patient. The relative treatment effect of the 200G magnets appeared to increase throughout the five-week period. Although these data cannot rule out a chance effect, the positive trends suggest that larger, longer-duration, sham-controlled trials with 200G magnets be considered in patients with chronic lumbar radicular pain."

Fitness and strength is postulated to protect an individual from disc rupture. The objective of our study was to determine the pain levels and differences of functional and economic situations of patients who had undergone one or more than one operation due to lumbar disc herniation and to put forward the effect of risk factors that may be potential, especially from the aspect of undergoing reoperation. Patients who had undergone one (n=46) or more than one operation (n=34) due to lumbar disc herniation were included in the study. It was a prospective study with evaluation on the day the patients were discharged and at second and sixth months after lumbar disc operation. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used in determining the functional disability associated with back pain; the Prolo Functional Economic Rating Scale (Prolo scale) was used in determining the effect of back pain on functional and economic situations. In the ODI measurements made in the postoperative second and sixth months, significant differences appeared in favor of patients who had undergone one operation (p<0.05). According to the Prolo scale, it was found that the economic situation was better in the sixth month and the functional situation was better in the second and sixth months in patients having undergone one operation (p<0.05). The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the lack of regular physical exercise was a significant predictor for reoperation (OR, 4.595; CI, 1.38-15.28), whereas gender, age, BMI, occupation, or smoking did not indicate so much significance as regular exercise."

The aim of the present study was to determine whether generalized deep-tissue hyperalgesia could be demonstrated in a group of patients with chronic low-back pain with intervertebral disc herniation. Twelve patients with MRI confirmed lumbar intervertebral disc herniation and 12 age and sex matched controls were included. Subjects were exposed to quantitative nociceptive stimuli to the infraspinatus and anterior tibialis muscles. Mechanical pressure (thresholds and supra-threshold) and injection of hypertonic saline (pain intensity, duration, distribution) were used. Pain intensity to experimental stimuli was assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients demonstrated significantly higher pain intensity (VAS), duration, and larger areas of pain referral following saline injection in both infraspinatus and tibialis anterior. The patients rated significantly higher pain intensity to supra-threshold mechanical pressure stimulation in both muscles. In patients, the pressure pain-threshold was lower in the anterior tibialis muscle compared to controls. In conclusion, generalized deep-tissue hyperalgesia was demonstrated in chronic low-back pain patients with radiating pain and MRI confirmed intervertebral disc herniation, suggesting that this central sensitization should also be addressed in the pain management regimes."

The study showed a close relationship between the location of the pain and the position of the protrusion of the disc. The degree of limitation of straight-leg raising was also found to have a direct relationship to the size and position of the protrusion and to its relationship to the spinal nerve. The protrusions were classified into three types according to position in relation to the dura mater and to the pattern of pain that was induced by passive straight-leg raising. On straight-leg raising, central protrusions tended to cause pain in the back, lateral protrusions caused pain in the lower extremity, and intermediate protrusions caused both. On this basis, the distribution of pain on straight-leg raising allowed an accurate prediction of the location of the lesion in 100 (88.5 per cent) of the 113 patients."

CD007431,0,11485360,0,Relationship between the cervical component of the slump test and change in hamstring muscle tension.,"SUMMARY. The slump test has been used routinely to differentiate low back pain due to involvement of neural structures from low back pain attributable to other factors. It is also said to differentiate between posterior thigh pain due to neural involvement from that due to hamstring injury. If changes in cervical position affect the hamstring muscles, differential diagnosis is confounded. Posterior thigh pain caused by the cervical component of the slump could then be caused either by increased tension on neural structures or increased tension in the hamstrings themselves. The aim of this study was to determine whether changing the cervical position during slump altered posterior thigh pain and/or the tension in the hamstring muscle. Asymptomatic subjects aged between 18 and 30 years were tested. A special fixation device was engineered to fix the trunk, pelvis and lower limb. Pain levels in cervical flexion and extension were assessed by visual analogue scale. Fixation was successful in that there were no significant differences in position of the pelvis or knee during changes in cervical position. Averaged over the group, there was a 40% decrease (P < 0.05) in posterior thigh pain with cervical extension. There were no significant differences in hamstring electromyographic readings during the cervical movements. This indicated that: (1) cervical movement did not change hamstring muscle tension, and (2) the change in experimentally induced pain during cervical flexion was not due to changes in the hamstring muscle. This conclusion supports the view that posterior thigh pain caused by the slump test and relieved by cervical extension arises from neural structures rather than the hamstring muscle.

Radiological and functional therapeutic results].,"The purpose of this investigation was to identify risk factors in relation to non-union following lumbar intercorporal spondylodesis and to correlate this result with the functional outcome as assessed by the Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DPQ). This comprises questions concerning daily activities, work-leisure activities, anxiety-depression and social interest, measured on visual analog scales. During the period 1979-87 a total of 132 patients were operated with spondylodesis, diagnosed as suffering from spondylolisthesis or disc degeneration. Minimal follow-up was one year. Radiological graft incorporation was complete in 52% of the cases, partial in 24% and lacking in 24%. The rate of functional outcome follow-up was 72%. Seventy percent claimed an improvement in three out of four categories. Thirty percent claimed no improvement or worsened condition. The DPQ showed signs of poor prognosis for age groups above 45 (p < 0.04) and those with former spine surgery (p < 0.02). The questionnaire showed significantly better results for the group with perfect or doubtful union compared to the group with non-union (p < 0.006). In conclusion this investigation demonstrates a success rate of 70% for anterior lumbar interbody fusion. There is a tendency to poorer prognosis for patients with previous spine surgery and age above 45 years. The Dallas Pain Questionnaire correlates significantly to X-ray analysis and seems to be a useful tool for the description of individual biopsychosocial changes following spine surgery."
CD007431,0,956228,0,Tenderness at motor points. A diagnostic and prognostic aid for low-back injury.,"In patients with low-back injury the motor points of some muscles may be tender. Of fifty patients with low-back ""strain"", twenty-six had tender motor points and twenty-four did not, while forty-nine of fifty patients with radicular signs and symptoms suggesting disc involvement had tender motor points, and the one without such tender points had a hamstring contusion which limited straight leg raising. Of fifty controls with no back disability, only seven had mild tender points after strenuous activity, while forty-six of another fifty controls with occasional back discomfort had mild motor-point tenderness. In all instances the tender motor points were located in the myotomes corresponding to the probable segmental levels of spinal injury and of root involvement, when present. Patients with low-back strain and no tender motor points were disabled for an average of 6.9 weeks, while those with the same diagnosis but tender motor points were disabled for an average of 19.7 weeks, or almost as long as the patients with signs of radicular involvement, who were disabled for an average of 25.7 weeks. Tender motor points may therefore be of diagnostic and prognostic value, serving as sensitive localizers of radicular involvement and differentiating a simple mechanical low-back strain from one with neural involvement."

Recovery of function after surgical treatment of the underlying disorder is not well documented in the literature. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the prognosis of preoperative foot drop after lumbar surgery in 55 patients with foot drop and herniated nucleus pulposus and/or lumbar spinal stenosis. Preoperative dorsiflexion motor strength improved measurably in 98%, and 71% had full recovery of strength. All patients had associated neurologic findings and 71% experienced complete resolution. No statistically significant relationship was found between the extent of recovery and age, diagnosis (herniated nucleus pulposus lumbar spinal stenosis), duration of symptoms, or severity of preoperative weakness. In our series, the prognosis of preoperative foot drop and associated neurologic deficits treated by lumbar spine surgery was excellent."

A 10-year longitudinal study.,"Percutaneous nucleotomy is a relatively new technique for treating lumbar disc herniation. There is no agreement as to the volume of disc material to be removed. A long-term study of clinical and radiological data from patients treated by percutaneous nucleotomy was designed to identify the factors associated with favourable and unfavourable outcomes. We studied 42 patients for at least ten years; the mean follow-up was 10.9 years. They were divided into two subgroups to assess the value of preserving the nucleus pulposus in the central area of the disc. The overall success rate for both subgroups was 50%. A decrease in disc height on plain radiography and a decrease in signal intensity on MRI were observed more infrequently in patients in whom the nucleus pulposus in the central area of the disc had been preserved, than in those in whom it had been extensively removed. These adverse radiological findings correlated closely with increased low back pain during the first one to two years after operation and a poorer overall outcome. We conclude that percutaneous nucleotomy is most likely to be successful when the central area of the disc is preserved."
CD007431,0,2139515,0,[A comparative study of myelography and CAT in patients with lumbo-sciatica].,"One hundred patients with acute lumbo sciatica symptoms probably due to disc hernia, have been studied. A CT scan and a myelography was performed in all patients. The clinical and radiologic (myelography and CT scan) findings have been evaluated in three categories based on their intensity and a correlation between these three parameters has been performed. Our results show a positivity of 94% in the clinical signs, 87% in the myelography findings and 88% in CT scan findings. The correlation results show that in very severe lumbo sciatica syndromes there is a greater positivity in the myelography than in CT scan findings and that there could be big radiologic changes without a clear clinical repercussion."
CD007431,0,9706933,0,The effect of thoracic paravertebral blockade on intercostal somatosensory evoked potentials.,"The paravertebral nerve blocks used in upper abdominal or thoracic surgery provide excellent pain relief and can inhibit some aspects of the neuroendocrine stress response to surgical trauma, which suggests that a very high-quality afferent block can be effected. To confirm this, we evaluated intercostal somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in 10 patients undergoing paravertebral nerve blocks as a treatment for chronic pain. SSEPs were recorded before and after ipsilateral thoracic paravertebral deposition of 1.5 mg/kg bupivacaine 0.5%. Sensory loss to temperature was demonstrated in all patients at the level of injection and had a mean superior spread of 1.4 (range 0-4) dermatomes and a mean inferior spread of 2.8 (range 0-7) dermatomes. SSEPs were abolished (the normal waveform was rendered unrecognizable with unmeasurable latencies and a mean amplitude of zero) in all patients at the level of injection. In addition, a two-dermatome SSEP abolition was found in four patients and a three-dermatome abolition was found in two patients. SSEPs were modified, but not significantly, at all other test points. We conclude that cortical responses to thoracic dermatomal stimulation can be abolished at the block level and adjacent dermatomes by thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade. Equivalent results have not been demonstrated with more central forms of afferent blockade, which suggests that thoracic paravertebral nerve blocks may be uniquely effective."
CD007431,0,141646,0,"Facet ""denervation"" in the treatment of low back syndrome.","Long-term pain relief occurred in 21% of patients with low back and leg pain who underwent injection or radiofrequency rhizotomy. When pain was accompanied by unequivocal limitation of straight leg raising, neither injection nor rhizotomy produced long-term relief. Leg pain improved more than low back pain. Improvement was limited to pain relief as reported to the physician and reduction of medication. There was no improvement in work or activity status. Despite the low success rate, facet ""denervation"" is uncommonly safe and seems to be of some usefulness in the treatment of patients with low back pain and sciatica."
CD007431,0,9835099,0,[Surgery of lumbar disk hernia: historical perspective].,"Although the clinical picture of discogenic sciatica is well known already in the ancient world, it is not until 1933 that WJ Mixter and JS Barr provide the correct pathogenetic interpretation and suggest surgery as the treatment of choice. The work of the American Authors was however based on the knowledge acquired during the previous centuries starting with Domenico Cotugno, who first suggested the neurogenic nature of sciatica (1764) and later with the neurologists of the french school Valleix, Lasègue, Dejerine, Sicard who elucidated the semeiology and debated in detail the etiopathogenesis of the condition. The german pathologists Schmorl and Andrae (1927-29) are to be credited for their contribution to the pathology of intervertebral disc, recognizing the frequency and degenerative (not neoplastic) nature of nucleus pulposus herniation. Surgery of disc herniation starts with Oppenheim and Krause (1909). Mixter and Barr used laminectomy and a transdural route although a more limited approach to the spinal canal had already been proposed by the italian Bonomo (1902), unknown to many. Love, of the Mayo Clinic (1937-39) introduced the extradural/interlaminar approach while Caspar and Yasargil (1977) applied the concepts of microsurgery to the procedure. The latest advances are represented by percutaneous and endoscopic techniques."
CD007431,0,12149929,0,[Blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier function and cholinesterase activity in cerebrospinal fluid in degenerative changes of the lumbar spine].,"The objective of this study was to determine whether spinal compression associated with degenerative changes of the lumbar vertebral column induces significant alteration in defined cerebrospinal fluid parameters. Serum and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid were studied in 62 patients and 47 age-matched controls. Patients were grouped according to neurologic status, duration of symptoms, and findings in magnetic resonance imaging. Statistically significant elevations in cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase activity, and total protein concentration were observed in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Patients with neurologic deficits did not exhibit significant differences in cerebrospinal fluid parameters compared with patients lacking neurologic signs. No significant differences were detectable between lateral and medial compression. Acute disk herniation led to practically the same biochemical changes as chronic compression. Biochemical analysis of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid offers additional diagnostic information in patients suffering from back or leg pain associated with degenerative changes of the spine. Pathological damage to meningeal and neural tissues can be demonstrated even if neurologic signs or obvious spinal compression are missing in the radiological examination. An elevated cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio reflects alteration of the blood/cerebrospinal fluid barrier status. Increased acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity point to pathophysiological impairment of neural tissues or meninges."

The mean age was 40.3 years (range 21-56 years). Nineteen cases were at L4-L5 and 41 cases were at L5-S1. Nineteen cases had BAK anterior interbody fusion and 41 cases were randomized as SB Charité disc replacement. The length of surgery was mean 88.4 minutes (range 54-137 minutes) for both groups. The estimated blood loss was mean 289.5 mL (range 50-1800 mL). The length of hospital stay was a mean of 3.03 days (range 2-6 days). Oswestry Disability Index scores for the SB Charité disc (aggregate study group) were 50.0 +/- 14.3 preoperatively and 25.0 +/- 20.1 at 1-3 years' follow-up (P < 0.001).

The outcome of surgery (traditional methods) was evaluated one year postoperatively, mainly using a composite Clinical Overall Score (COS), including pain intensity, physical signs, functional capacity and analgesics. Return to work was also assessed. In regression analyses, low body height, high values of weight and body mass index, as well as long duration of sickness absence were shown to be significantly related to a poor outcome, as evaluated by the COS. However, after controlling for modifying effects of previously determined predictive fibrinolytic and psychological variables, the background variables lost their significance. Female sex, low stature, long duration of sickness absence and physically strenuous work activities were statistically significantly related to lower frequencies of return to work."

Examination of 215 aviators with varying degrees of impairment of the vertebrae-pelvis-lower extremity biokinematic system allowed to relate protrusions of the intervertebral disks. Correlation between the neurologic pattern of disease and different forms of protrusions was studied. Pathogenesis of the radiculopathy syndrome was made more clear. Potentials of the X-ray computerized and magnetic/resonance tomographies were given a comparative analysis. As was established, the two methods are not mutually exclusive. MRI is more advantageous in the diagnosis of degenerative/dystrophic changes in soft a tissue structures. On the other hand, the X-ray computerized tomography is preferable for visualization of changes in highly dense tissues. Semiotics of processes articularis arthrosis was studied. Discovered were X-ray detectable morphological signs of arthrosis which had never been discussed in literature.

Clinical follow-up was combined with a gadolinium-DPTA MRI examination, 1 year after surgery. Disc herniation was still present in eight patients and four of these did not have any significant radicular pain. Another 15 patients had a small protrusion at the site of the former herniation. Twenty-three patients showed evidence of scar tissue. The nerve root was displaced in 12 patients and was thickened in 16 patients, respectively. Clinically, 19 patients recovered from leg pain, 14 patients improved, and 3 patients remained unchanged compared with preoperative symptoms.

CD007431,0,8153823,0,Prediction of an extruded fragment in lumbar disc patients from clinical presentations.,"To determine whether the presence of an extruded lumbar disc prolapse could be predicted from clinical symptoms, the authors compared the relative proportions of back and leg pain, with operative findings in a prospective observational study of 100 lumbar discectomy patients. All cases were assessed by an independent observer, blind to the knowledge of the operative findings. Of the 58 men and 42 women (mean age 42, range 19-75), 47 patients had a subligamentous disc protrusion and 53 had an extruded disc fragment. Of 27 patients who presented with leg pain only, 26 (96%) were found subsequently to have an extruded fragment. Patients with an extruded fragment had a significantly higher proportion of leg:back pain (median 99:1) than those with a subligamentous disc protrusion (median 75:25, P < 0.001). Patients with leg pain only and those with a marked predominance of leg pain over back pain have a high probability of harboring an extruded disc fragment."
CD007431,0,146731,0,Reoperation after lumbar intervertebral disc surgery.,"This retrospective study includes 53 patients who underwent reoperation after failure of lumbar disc surgery to relieve pain. All patients had leg pain before reoperation, which was successful in 28% of cases. Most clinical features, such as persistence or mode of recurrence of pain, radicular quality of pain, positive straight-leg raising, and myelographic root sleeve defects, were not helpful in predicting successful and unsuccessful reoperations. However, a significantly larger percentage of women than men had successful reoperations. Patients who had past or pending compensation claims, who had sensory loss involving more than one dermatome, or who failed to have myelographic dural sac indentations resembling those caused by a herniated disc did poorly with reoperation. A very convincing myelographic defect appears to be needed to justify reoperation at a previously unoperated location. Excision of scar alone or dorsal rhizotomy was of no avail in these cases."

The dimensions of the vertebral canal and the intervertebral foramen can be altered by these factors before or after birth. Sex differences in dimensions have also been reported. When there is a stenosis of the vertebral canal or the intervertebral foramen, neural structures confined within them can be affected easily, resulting in symptoms. Using computed tomography images, we compared vertebral canal dimensions in 100 patients with low back pain and/or radiculopathy with those in 40 healthy, non-symptomatic controls. We also measured the dimensions of 275 dry bones. We found significant correlations among the variables in the live subjects.

Information has been extracted from complex data sets using a multivariate data analysis program (FCVPC-87). Superficially experienced pain may represent pronounced nerve root affliction. Pain relief in particular body positions was related to extruded discs and additional osseous stenosis, and rarely occurring relief to derangement of nerve root circulation. Neither somatosensory pain quality descriptions nor pain intensity variables were found to be of diagnostic value. Long duration of symptoms was found together with nerve root atrophy. Affliction of the L5 and S1 nerve roots showed differences with regard to pain localization and intensity and some surgical findings. Pain mapping may represent an indication of the patho-anatomical substratum in patients with herniated lumbar intervertebral discs."

CD007431,0,9202855,0,Disc protrusion in the child. Particular features and comparison with neoplasms.,"Lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, although common in adults, is infrequent in the young, and especially in patients under 17 years old. In this work we review clinical data pertaining to two pediatric groups of patients whose main complaint was low back pain and/or sciatica, trying to identify factors that might contribute to their earlier referral and to the differential diagnosis of protruded disc and spinal neoplasm in this population. Group A comprises 17 youngsters diagnosed as having lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus and group B, 16 children with neoplasms of the lower thoracic and lumbosacral regions. Both groups were similar in sex distribution and symptoms of pain and numbness. However, there was a striking difference in age at presentation. No patient in group A was younger than 11 years, while most of those in group B were in their first decade of life (P = 0.018). The classic clinical onset in the children with herniated discs started with low back pain and sciatica, as in the children with neoplasms, although in subgroup B leg pain tended to be bilateral. The usual examination findings in both groups were spinal rigidity and sensory loss, but motor weakness and impaired reflexes were found to be more frequent in the group with spinal growths (P = 0.02). Children with lumbosacral neoplasms also tended to present with atypical symptoms (acute onset, intracranial hypertension, subarachnoid hemorrhage and abdominal pain), while this was the exception in the group with herniated discs. Plain radiographs of the pediatric spine showed that X-ray examination is still a good tool for diagnosing spinal growths compared with their scant utility in disc herniations (P = 0.001). During the survey we were impressed by the children's apparent good tolerance to pain, which is probably due to the lack of the emotional component of pain in adults and explains their delayed referral for neurosurgical consultation. However, all modalities of treatment seemed to be effective in children, chemonucleolysis and surgery being extraordinarily effective in this age group. Accordingly, we see no reason for long-term conservative therapy in children with lumbar and sciatic pain; on the contrary, we believe these patients should be offered earlier neurosurgical treatment."
CD007431,0,2521444,0,Selective criteria may increase lumbosacral spine roentgenogram use in acute low-back pain.,"Eleven clinical criteria have been proposed to limit use of lumbosacral spine roentgenograms in patients with acute low-back pain who are at risk for vertebral cancer, osteomyelitis, acute fracture, or herniated disk. We retrospectively applied the criteria to 471 patients with acute low-back pain in three teaching hospital walk-in clinics. Roentgenograms were obtained at the initial visit in 99 patients (21.1%); the number would have increased to 217 (46.1%) if the criteria had been used. The following four patient characteristics were associated with actual roentgenogram use: older age, longer duration of symptoms, reflex asymmetry, and point vertebral tenderness. Adoption of the 11 criteria studied herein may inadvertently increase roentgenogram use, thereby raising health care costs and exposing more patients to gonadal irradiation. The standard of practice in these three clinics seemed to entail use of less broad roentgenogram selection criteria. Other published guidelines for roentgenograms emphasize clinical follow-up, reserving further evaluation for patients who fail to improve after a trial of bed rest and analgesics."

CD007431,0,11193500,0,The role of cyclooxygenase-2 and inflammatory cytokines in pain induction of herniated lumbar intervertebral disc.,"Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is the disease which is the major cause of radiculopathy. In terms of the pathogenesis of disease, it is reported that prostaglandinE2 (PGE2) plays an important role to induce radiculopathy. Arachidonate cascade, which is the process of PGE2 synthesis, is mainly regulated by two kinds of enzymes, phospholipaseA2 (PLA2) and cyclooxy genase (COX). Previously, PLA2 was recognized as the rate-limiting enzyme of this cascade, and some authors reported the clinical significance of PLA2 at the site of LDH concerning the radicular pain. Recently, COX was elucidated to consist of 2 types of isoform, a constitutive form of COX-1 and an inducible form of COX-2. COX-2 has been focused as a key enzyme to regulate PGE2 synthesis and plays an important role in inflammation, because COX-2 was induced in many types of cells by the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). However, it is not fully discussed whether or not, COX-2 is induced in lumbar disc tissue and if it plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of LDH. To clarify the role of COX-2 in the pathomechanism of radiculopathy of LDH, we have investigated the expression of COX-2, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in herniated lumbar disc tissue. Immunohistologically, they were detected in the cytosol of chondrocytes constituting the disc tissue. RT-PCR showed that herniated lumbar disc-derived cells expressed mRNA of COX-2, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in the presence of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. The disc-derived cells also produced much PGE2 by stimulating of inflammatory cytokines at the same time and this PGE2 production was distinctly suppressed by a selective inhibitor of COX-2, 6-methoxy-2-naphtyl acetic acids (6MNA). These results suggest that COX-2 and inflammatory cytokines might play a causative role in the radiculopathy of LDH through upregulating PGE2 synthesis."
CD007431,0,2997232,0,Lower-extremity sensibility testing in patients with herniated lumbar intervertebral discs.,"The significance of sensory changes determined by pinprick and light touch in individuals with a herniated lumbar disc has been questioned. Discrepancies may be related to the subjectiveness of the test, failure to use dermatome-specific testing sites, overlap of areas that are innervated by different nerve roots, anatomical variations, or lack of sensitivity of the testing technique. For this study, we assessed the results of sensory examinations of twenty-five patients with documented herniation of a lumbar disc. The examinations were done using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, vibrometry, pinprick, and light touch in the autonomous skin areas supplied by the fourth and fifth lumbar and first sacral-nerve roots. Right-left differences in Semmes-Weinstein pressure thresholds of more than fifteen milligrams per square millimeter enabled us to localize disc lesions to a specific root in 100 per cent of patients and differences in vibratory thresholds of more than 3.5 micrometers, to localize the correct level in 88 per cent. Lesser differences in thresholds did not help to identify the involved root. The mean sensory threshold on the side of the disc lesion was found to be significantly greater than that on the opposite side by both vibrometry and pressure aesthesiometry (p less than 0.005). These findings were not duplicated using light touch or pinprick testing. Even with the most sophisticated sensibility-testing techniques, correct identification of the nerve root that was compressed by a herniated lumbar disc was accurate in only 50 per cent of patients."

CD007431,0,6529903,0,Lateral L3/4 herniated nucleus pulposus: clinical and imaging considerations.,"This report examines 18 surgically proven L3/4 herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), all having myelogram, CT and adequate neurological evaluation. It will focus on four cases where the herniation involved the neural canal (intervertebral canal). Comparison to the 14 spinal canal central herniations will be made. The clinical findings for lateral L3/4 HNP allowed a preimaging diagnosis to be made in three of the four cases. In the central group the correct preimaging diagnosis was made one of the 14 cases (P less than 0.01). There are numerous reasons why the central L3/4 HNP preimaging diagnosis is inaccurate as well as difficult to establish and these reasons are discussed in detail. The myelographic and CT findings of the lateral L3/4 HNP are clearly elaborated. All herniations were extruded. They poorly responded to conservative management. The duration of illness, onset of pain to surgical disk removal, for the lateral herniations was 34.8 days and, 154.4 days for the central group (P less than 0.05). The myelogram is a disappointing test in the diagnosis of lateral L3/4 HNP, but highly accurate in spinal canal L3/4 HNP. CT is a preferred imaging test being virtually positive in all cases."

Lumbar spinal pathology in cadaveric material in relation to history of back pain, occupation, and physical loading.","The occurrence of symmetric disc degeneration, anular ruptures, end-plate defects, vertebral body osteophytosis, and facet joint osteoarthrosis was examined radiographically and osteologically in 86 male cadavers for whom occupational, physical loading, and back pain histories were obtained from the men's families. History of back pain and the parameters of spinal pathology were related to the highest and lowest degrees of physical loading. In multivariate analyses, history of back injury was related to the occurrence of symmetric disc degeneration, anular ruptures, and vertebral osteophytosis. Symmetric disc degeneration was associated with sedentary work, and vertebral osteophytosis was related to heavy work. History of back pain was related to occupational physical loading after control for the effects of the other covariates. The results indicate that the least pathology stemmed from moderate or mixed physical loading, but the least back pain was associated with sedentary work."

Twelve patients complained of permanent uni or bilateral sciatica. All the others had a syndrome of intermittent claudication with pain and paresthaesia. The authors stress once again the highly evocative nature of this syndrome which reflects involvement of the nerve roots in the stenosed lumbar canal. Treatment consisted of lamino-arthrectomy which resulted in the disappearance of symptoms in most of cases. In four cases, vertebral slipping worsened during the post-operative cowise with, in three cases a recurrence of symptoms necessitating a complementary arthrodesis. This risk of increased slipping is a result of the instability created by the arthrectomy, especially when it is bilateral, and has led the authors to widen their indications for routine complementary postero-lateral arthrodesis."

CD007431,0,12210362,0,Intrapartum maternal lumbosacral plexopathy.,"There are many conflicting theories regarding the mechanism and prognosis of acute foot drop during labor. We report seven women who had arrested labor and foot drop. Six had short stature and one had a large newborn. All had weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, eversion, and inversion, and sensory loss in the L-5 dermatome. Superficial peroneal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were small or absent in six patients, and the sural SNAP was attenuated in one. Peroneal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude (recording from extensor digitorum brevis) was low in five, whereas the tibial CMAP was normal in all patients. Peroneal CMAP amplitude (recording from the tibialis anterior) was normal in three and small in three. Needle electromyography revealed decreased recruitment and fibrillation potentials in L-5-innervated muscles, mostly below the knee. We conclude that intrapartum foot drop occurs mostly in short women and is caused by lumbosacral trunk compression by the fetal head at the pelvic brim. The primary pathology is predominantly demyelination and recovery is complete in up to 5 months."

Patients had a microdiscectomy, a laminectomy plus microdiscectomy, or a decompressive laminectomy with a microdiscectomy. The causes of ruptured discs were lifting (31.4%), falls (10.2%), and sports (10.0%). Almost all patients had complained of leg pain (99%), and 79% had radicular pain in a dermatomal distribution. Thirty-three percent of the patients had been involved in industrial accidents, and 6% had legal claims pending during the surgical period. Almost 11% of the patients had complications, and there was one death caused by abdominal arterial bleeding. Patients were also rated according to the Prolo Functional-Economic Outcome Rating Scale to improve the ability to compare series in the future. Almost 80% of the patients had good outcomes as defined by scores on this scale of 8 (16.2%), 9 (33.2%), and 10 (26.9%). Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of this series: 1) most patients had good outcomes; 2) patients with nonindustrial injuries had better outcomes than did patients with industrial injuries; 3) professionals with legal concerns and laborers with industrial insurance had good outcomes; and 4) the Functional-Economic Outcome Rating Scale appears to be a useful tool for comparing different procedures more objectively and for comparing the outcomes across series."

Key information is contained in the overall temporal pattern of motor unit activity, observed in the EMG (RMS) envelope. In paralysis, a rudimentary form of suprasegmental control of tonic and phasic reflexes can be demonstrated. EMG patterns evoked by voluntary and passive maneuvers and by volitional modulation of reflex responses reveal features of motor control not apparent in the clinical examination. Such subclinical findings may explain paradoxically different responses in apparently similar SCI subjects, and may be used to monitor spontaneous or induced changes. The recording protocol, examples of EMG patterns, and their prevalence in 40 spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects are presented, and compared with 5 healthy subjects."

The purpose of this study is to report the clinical and radiographic outcomes of 36 consecutive patients who underwent lumbar TDR using ProDisc II, and the factors associated with a better clinical outcome after a 2-year minimum follow-up. At the time of the latest follow-up, the success rate was 94% of 36 patients according to the criteria of the US Food and Drug Administration. Of the 10 patients unable to work preoperatively, 7 patients returned to work. Moreover, mean score on the visual analog scale for low back and leg pain improved significantly from 7.5 and 4.7 to 3.0 and 1.2, respectively (P<0.001). In addition, mean Oswestry disability index scores improved significantly from 69.2 to 21.0 (P<0.001). Mean disc height at the operative level increased significantly from 9.0 to 17.6 mm, and mean range of motion increased significantly from 9.7 to 12.7 degrees (P<0.01). Statistical analysis showed that the factors associated with a better clinical outcome were single level, and a higher postoperative segmental ROM at the operative level. At a minimum follow-up of 2 years, the lumbar TDR using ProDisc II showed excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes without any significant complication. However, future efforts need to be directed toward the evaluation of a larger number of patients with longer follow-up."

Following failed conservative treatment for 6 months, eight patients with contained disc herniations were enrolled in the study. Following MR guided introduction of the laser fiber into the targeted disc space, the laser-induced temperature distribution was visualized using a color-coded subtraction technique based on a T1-weighted GRE sequence. In seven patients PLDD could be performed. In all cases laser effects were depicted by MR. In this regard the color-coded technique was found to be superior to conventional magnitude images. Whereas no apparent decrease in the extent of herniation was discovered immediately following PLDD, T2-weighted FSE images showed signal intensity alterations in two of the seven patients. Clinical evaluation, obtained 3-4 months after PLDD, revealed a fair (n = 2) or good (n = 4) response to the treatment. One patient showed no change in symptoms. MR guidance and monitoring of PLDD is feasible within an open 0.5-T system and seems to render PLDD more safe and controllable."

Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a chief complaint of leg pain, primarily; 2) a positive straight leg raising (SLR) at less than 60 degrees reproducing the leg pain; 3) a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrating a herniated nucleus pulposus without significant stenosis by a radiologist's reading, which was also confirmed by the authors; 4) a positive electromyogram (EMG) demonstrating evidence of radiculopathy; and 5) response to a follow-up questionnaire. All patients had undergone an aggressive physical rehabilitation program consisting of back school and stabilization exercise training. Of a total of 347 consecutively identified patients, 64 patients with an average follow-up time of 31.1 months met the inclusion criteria and constituted the study population. They were sent questionnaires that inquired about activity level, pain level, work status, and further medical care. The patients with neurologic loss, extruded discs, and those seeking a second opinion regarding surgery were identified and subgrouped. Results for the total group included 90% good or excellent outcome with a 92% return to work rate. For the subgroups with extruded discs and second opinions, 87% and 83% had good or excellent outcomes, respectively, all (100%) of whom returned to work. Sick leave time for these subgroups was 2.9 months (+/- 1.4 months) and 3.4 months (+/- 1.7 months), respectively. These results compared favorably with previously published surgical studies.

CD007431,0,11082550,0,Evaluation of low back pain risks in a beef skinning operation.,"The low back pain risks in a beef skinning operation at a high stand kill floor workstation was evaluated. The increases in compressive forces at lower back (L5/S1) between normal slump (back angle 25 degrees, measured in the sagittal plane) and severe (45 degrees ) and between normal slump and very severe (70 degrees ) bent back postures were 387 N or 28% and 616 N or 45%, respectively. The high spine load coupled with high level of repetition can have a high probability of fatigue failure in the spine structural members. Non-neutral back posture for a large portion of the total work time can be a low back pain risk factor. The videotape analysis showed that the times involved during the task performance for the bent back (more than 25 degrees ) and severe bent back (more than 45 degrees ) were 48.4 and 33.5% of the total cycle time, respectively. The upper limit from OWAS (Ovako Working Posture Analysis System) for bent back posture is 30% of the total cycle time. The bent and twisted back posture (both more than 25 degrees ) time was 10.4% compared to OWAS limit of 5%. This indicated that actions are needed in the near future to alleviate the risk of low back pain. Ergonomics redesign of the workstation was recommended for the operation."

Objective - To compare chiropractic and hospital outpatient treatment for managing low back pain of mechanical origin.Design - Randomized controlled trial. Allocation to chiropractic or hospital management by minimization to establish groups for analysis of results according to initial referral clinic, length of current episode, history, and severity of back pain. Patients were followed up for up to two years.Setting - Chiropractic and hospital outpatient clinics in 11 centers.Patients - 741 patients aged 18-65 who had no contraindications to manipulation and who had not been treated within the past month.Interventions - Treatment at the discretion of the chiropractors, who used chiropractic manipulation in most patients, or of the hospital staff, who most commonly used Maitland mobilization or manipulation, or both.Main outcome measures - Changes in the score on the Oswestry pain disability questionnaire and in the results of tests of straight leg raising and lumbar flexion.Results - Chiropractic treatment was more effective than hospital outpatient management, mainly for patients with chronic or severe back pain. A benefit of about 7 percent points on the Oswestry scale was seen at two years. The benefit of chiropractic treatment became more evident throughout the follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures also showed that chiropractic was more beneficial.Conclusions - For patients with low back pain in whom manipulation is not contraindicated, chiropractic almost certainly confers worthwhile, long-term benefit in comparison with hospital outpatient management. The benefit is seen mainly in those with chronic or severe pain. Introducing chiropractic into NHS practice should be considered.J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 1991;13(6):278-287."

The aetiological factors and clinical manifestations were analysed. Nucleus pulposus prolapse was diagnosed in 5 children, in 9 cases neoplasms were found (in 3 cases malignant tumours of the sacral bone, intraspinal tumours in 6 cases); in 4 cases obliterative intraspinal arachnitis, and in 3 cases other causes were diagnosed. With the exception of one child the other ones were in the school-age group. In nearly all cases the onset was insidious. In one-third of children with neoplastic processes the neurological symptoms appeared after injuries and caused initially considerable diagnostic difficulties. In 18 cases disturbances of spinal configuration and mobility were observed. Pain produced by stretching was present in 20 cases. Sphincter disturbances were observed in 6 cases (including 5 with tumours). Motor defects were noticed in all patients, more pronounced in cases of tumours. Patency of the subarachnoid spinal space was without any greater importance for the diagnosis of sciatic pains. Raised protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid was highest in cases of intraspinal tumours, and it was moderately pronounced in obliterative arachnitis, while in nucleus pulposus prolapse the protein level varied. Plain films were of lower diagnostic importance, with the exception of sacral bone tumours and nucleus pulposus prolapse.

Goniometric range of motion measurements of three hip movements, abduction, flexion with the knee extended, and extension, were taken on two subject populations, runners (N = 45), and nonrunners (n = 43), in order to determine tightness of the hip adductor, extensor, and flexor muscles, respectively. The mean score values obtained for each of the three measurements for both the right and left sides were compared for differences between the running and nonrunning populations and between male and female subjects. Runners were found to be significantly limited in the movement of hip flexion with the knee extended. The mean score values obtained for all male subjects for this movement were lower than those for all female subjects. The incidence of low back pain in runners was examined; however, no correlation could be drawn between muscular tightness in these subjects and low back pain.

Joint motion, moments, and intersegmental forces were calculated for 19 patients with unilateral osteoarthritis of the hip (12 men and seven women) and for a group of normal subjects (12 men and seven women) with a similar age distribution. The patients who had osteoarthritis walked with a decreased dynamic range of motion (17 +/- 4 degrees) of the hip and with a hesitation or reversal in the direction of the sagittal plane motion as they extended the hip. The patients with a hesitation or reversal in motion had a greater loss in the range of motion of the hip during gait (p < 0.004) and a greater passive flexion contracture (p < 0.022) than those with a smooth pattern of hip motion. This alteration in the pattern of motion was interpreted as a mechanism to increase effective extension of the hip during stance through increased anterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis. The patients who had osteoarthritis of the hip walked with significantly decreased external extension, adduction, and internal and external rotation moments (p < 0.008). The decreased extension moment was significantly correlated with an increased level of pain (R = 0.78; p < 0.001). This finding suggests that decreasing muscle forces (hip flexors) may be one mechanism used to adapt to pain."

Forty-four calcified Type I-IV (CA I-IV) limbus fractures, interpreted as routine disc herniations on magnetic resonance imaging scans, were correctly identified as limbus fragments on computed tomographic and myelographic/computed tomographic studies, whereas 15 NC III lesions were mistaken for disc herniations alone on all three radiographic examinations. The preoperative recognition of the CA I-IV and NC III fracture types proved essential to the successful resection of five Type I, five Type II, 36 Type III, and ten Type IV fragments through extended laminotomies, hemilaminectomies, and laminectomies with the down biting curette, tamp, and mallet technique.

Convenient reproductions of experimental traces in rigidity were obtained by the combination of a low reflex gain and a decrease in reflex threshold. These findings are consistent with studies reporting an increase of spinal interneuron excitability and proprioception deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, as the threshold parameter was much lowered, our model generated typical features of parkinsonian resting tremor, endorsing the hypothesis of a participation of a spinal oscillator in this disorder. Finally, tuning the reflex gain during simulations of rigidity resulted in the generation of active movement, opening some hypotheses on pathophysiology of motor dysfunction in PD, and notably, of akinesia. More generally, this work accredits the hypothesis of the involvement of an aperiodic, altered supra-spinal motor drive in PD, resulting in spinal dysfunction, through specific descending motor pathways. This may lead to a search for new (spinal) pharmacological targets in PD. It emphasizes further the value of computer modeling in understanding motor control in health and disease."

Initial experience in 28 cases.,"Since November 1988, 28 patients with lumbar L5 radiculopathy refractory to conservative care and with a radiologically verified central or mediolateral disc herniation at the level of L4/L5 had had a percutaneous discectomy. Radiological verification consisted of spinal CT +/- myelography, +/- myelo-CT, +/- MRI. A short-term follow-up analysis of at least 2 months taking the clinical and functional status as well as the professional reintegration into account revealed a 64.3% (18/28 patients) satisfactory outcome and a 32.1% (10/28 patients) failure rate. Of the latter 28.6% (8/28 patients) required further open surgery. One patient whose pain had only partially in regressed was shown at open operation to have a sequestered cranial prolapse as revealed by spinal CT after the percutaneous procedure. There were no major complications. One patient developed a sequestered extraforaminal herniation through the nucleotomy canal three weeks after the procedure. One patient bled for 2 minutes. There were no major vessel injuries. One patient reported local muscular pain, and enhanced nerve root pain after introduction of the trocar sleeve."

The iodine concentration given was 250 mg I/ml or 200 mg I/ml respectively. The total iodine never exceeded 2.5 g (8-10 ml). Image quality was assessed in terms of diagnostic value having experience of more than 1,000 myelographies using metrizamide. Picture quality was similar to metrizamide of equal iodine concentration. In 35 patients electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after myelography with iopamidol 250. No changes that could be referred to the contrast medium were seen. There were no adverse reactions to lumbar myelography other than those following the lumbar puncture. In thoracocervical myelography mild and transient side effects occurred in 41 (28.3%). The most common were headache (41 cases), nausea (12), radicular pain (10), and dizziness (five). General seizures and psychopathologic symptoms were not observed."

CD007431,0,1534723,0,The role of vascular damage and fibrosis in the pathogenesis of nerve root damage.,"Vascular damage and fibrosis are common within the vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen. The grossest examples occur in patients who have previously undergone oil-based myelography or spinal surgery. The mechanisms of fibrosis in the latter instance may be related to persisting cotton debris from sponges used during the operation. This debris may act as a fibrogenic stimulus. However, in cadaveric studies of nonoperated spines, the author and his colleagues have found clear evidence of vascular damage and fibrosis within the spines, and this vascular damage is significantly related to the severity of degenerative disk disease. Degenerative disk disease with osteophytic proliferation and disk protrusion may lead to compression of epidural veins with dilation of noncompressed veins. There is a significant statistical relationship between the extent of the disk degeneration and prolapse and the evidence of venous compression and dilatation. The dilatated veins may contain antemortem thromboses. In turn, there is a significant statistical relationship between the evidence for venous obstruction and perineural fibrosis. Such a relationship also exists between perineural fibrosis and neuronal atrophy. If therefore appears likely that venous obstruction with resultant hypoxia is an important mechanism leading to nerve root damage. In the peripheral blood, significant defects in the fibrinolytic system correlate with the severity of the symptoms. However, it was not possible to correlate these changes with individual clinical or imaging features. These fibrinolytic changes are recognized as markers of vascular damage and may reflect the pathologic processes that the author and his colleagues have demonstrated. It is uncertain whether they play any secondary pathogenic role in the chronicity of these back problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,3235323,0,"Lumbar disc herniation: diagnosis, surgical treatment, recurrence. A review of 872 operated cases.","This review is based on 972 cases treated surgically for lumbar disc herniation between 1974 and 1984. The authors discuss several problems related to this condition. The importance of the history and clinical assessment are emphasized, as well as the role of instrumental tests such as radiculography and CT scan. The authors report what they believe to be the treatment of choice to avoid recurrence, based on an analysis of two groups of patients. The first group consisted of patients in whom lumbar and radicular pain persisted after operation. The second group consisted of patients in whom these symptoms recurred after an interval of complete relief. This analysis leads to the following conclusions: 1) clinical examination is pre-eminent; CT scan and radiculography are complementary to an accurate neurological examination; 2) hemilaminectomy is the operation of choice because it is sufficient to ensure accurate exploration of both root and disc; 3) most recurrences are due to errors in diagnosis or surgical technique."
CD007431,0,3235321,0,A comparison between computerized tomography and myelography in radicular lumbar syndromes.,"The clinical, tomographic and myelographic findings in 40 patients with radicular lumbar syndromes are analysed and discussed. The study shows that indications for surgical treatment must take into account errors in determining the level of the syndrome based on clinical examination (25%), false negatives (10%), and false positives (15%) resulting from CT scan and, finally, false negatives resulting from myelography (10%). It is emphasized that at present there is no real evidence to support preference for one or other of these instrumental tests. Only the clinical examination is capable of evaluating each case individually and thus providing the most reliable indications on which to base both diagnosis and treatment."
CD007431,0,9422900,0,Knee-chest vs horizontal side position during induction of spinal anaesthesia in patients undergoing lumbar disc surgery.,"In the prone knee-chest position the spread of plain 0.5% bupivacaine in the cerebrospinal fluid and associated haemodynamic changes may be different compared with the horizontal position. A randomized comparison was performed in 40 ASA I-II patients, aged 24-61 yr, undergoing lumbar disc surgery. Subarachnoid injection (27-gauge needle) at the L2-3 interspace with 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine was performed with the patient in the operative knee-chest position (prone knee-chest group, n = 20) or in the horizontal side position (supine side horizontal group, n = 20). Patients in the supine side horizontal group were turned into the horizontal supine position for 20 min, and subsequently they were placed in the operative knee-chest position. In three patients in the prone knee-chest group, the spinal needle was replaced by a larger needle (25-gauge). The final cephalad extension of sensory analgesia on skin tested by pinprick was T5 (median) in the prone knee-chest group and T6 in the supine side horizontal group. Recovery was also similar, on average 210 min from injection in both groups. The mean decrease in systolic arterial pressure was somewhat greater in the prone knee-chest group (30 mm Hg) than in the supine side horizontal group (13 mm Hg). The need for ephedrine occurred earlier in the supine side horizontal group (three patients, all within 10 min from local anaesthetic injection) than in the prone knee-chest group (six patients, all after 15 min). Four of the latter patients also required administration of an anticholinergic for bradycardia compared with two patients in the supine side horizontal group. Light sedation was given to five patients in the prone knee-chest group and to four in the supine side horizontal group because of numbness and aching in the shoulders. We conclude that spinal block was similar in the two groups but there was a tendency to more frequent episodes of haemodynamic deterioration in the knee-chest position."

CD007431,0,8980726,0,Contrast enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of recurrent disc herniation.,A positive result of re-operation in patients with recurrent symptoms after lumbar disc surgery is likely only if a new disc herniation is present. An improved ability to differentiate between recurrent disc herniation and scar tissue by contrast enhanced CT and MRI is suggested in earlier studies. In a prospective study 29 patients were selected for operation for suspected recurrent disc herniation. The inclusion of the patients was based on clinical symptoms and signs and myelography or non-enhanced CT. All patients were examined by CT and MRI both with and without intravenous contrast pre-operatively. The examinations were evaluated blind on a five point scale and statistical analysed by a regret function. Intravenous contrast improved the diagnostic power of both CT and MRI. MRI was superior to CT in both non-enhanced and enhanced examinations. MRI with intravenous contrast enhancement is proposed as the primary examination in patients with suspected recurrent disc herniation.

CD007431,0,6866454,0,When to operate and what to operate upon.,"It is apparent that the results of spinal surgery are less than optimal. The three major causes appear to be as follows: Patient selection. There are some patients who, owing to psychological change or secondary gain, are unable to respond to correction of a spinal problem. This is probably a very small percentage of the 25 to 35 per cent failure rate listed in the literature. Many of these patients have had the wrong operation for an unknown structural diagnosis. It is too tempting and easy for the spinal surgeon to blame poor results on the psyche. Structural diagnosis. It has been 40 years since Dandy published a report on ""the hidden disc,"" but the world of spinal surgery still has not recovered from it. Poor Dandy is also credited with introduction of the method of shaking the spinous process as a test for instability and hence fusion. It would seem obvious that any disc surgery based on a premise of exploration for a hidden problem is antiquated in the day of the CT scan. One should be further chagrined by decision making for fusion based on shaking the spine with a towel clip. It would defy any spinal surgeon to define in rational terms how much observed motion is ""abnormal."" Until a structural diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical and laboratory testing, there is no indication for surgery. This is the single most important factor in spinal surgery. The success rate will not change until this function is universally recognized. Proper operation. There is little room, in modern spinal surgery, for the surgeon who is a ""one trick pony."" Uniform application of an operative technique to a variety of deforming forces will result in a high failure rate. It is the duty of the spinal surgeon to have all the techniques available and be able to apply them with precision and skill. Specific surgical response must be made to a specific structural diagnosis. The foregoing three principles should greatly enhance surgical results."
CD007431,0,6455745,0,1980 Volvo award in clinical sciences. Assessment of patients with low-back pain by biplanar radiographic measurement of intervertebral motion.,"Abnormalities of intervertebral joint motion including hypermobility, reduced mobility, torsional abnormality, and displacement of the center of rotation have been associated with degenerative change. However, measurement of these signs in plane X-ray films is handicapped by the three-dimensional motion and geometry of the spine. This study aimed to relate three-dimensional motion of the joints to their pathological state. We have used biplanar radiography to measure intervertebral motion during voluntary movements by patients with low back pain. Primary (or intentional) and coupled motions were measured by a refined technique, along with disc shear and facet joint motion. Abnormalities were found, especially in the ""coupled"" motions which were related to narrowed disc space, and to proximity to previous fusions. There was asymmetry of motion specific to joints with herniated nucleus pulposus."

The diagnostic accuracy of the selected clinical signs and symptoms was also tested with arthroscopy as the standard, and sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Pronounced osteoarthrosis was more frequently associated with joint crepitus (P < 0.001). Adhesions were more frequently associated with reduced maximum protrusion (P < 0.001). Crepitation was the only clinical sign that showed acceptable values for SE, SP, PPV, and NPV, and only in diagnosing advanced osteoarthrosis. The values for mild osteoarthrosis were low."

CD007431,0,2275302,0,[Lumbar intervertebral disk operation in the aged].,"The frequencies of required surgery of lumbar disc protrusion as the cause of resistant lumbar compression of the nerve root, including the rare cauda equina compression, is according to literature for patients over 70 years of age only 1% of the total number of lumbar disc surgery. However, probably as a course of the improved preclinical diagnostical methods as EMG, spinal CT scan, MRT and the increased number of these examination techniques the percentage was 3.2% in our material thus a higher share of operated patients at the age of 71 and older. 50% of those patients even had a sequestered lumbar disc protrusion. Because the additional, clinical relevant bone narrowment of the spinal canal, lateral processus and the foramina intervertebralia it is necessary for this group of patients to perform a wide microsurgical decompression as modification of the normal surgery with a sufficient resection of compressing bone parts through laminotomy, hemilaminectomie and laminectomy. We did not observe serious intra- and postsurgery complications with persistent damages. The surgical mortality of 68 consecutive operated patients at the age of 71 up to 93 years was zero. The subjective valuation of the surgical longterm results was in 68% of the interviewed patients well or excellent, including the influence of the presurgical torturing pain (66%) and clinically relevant neurological deficits (72%). 10.6% of all cases judged the long term results as insufficient or bad. Especially considering the increasing life expectation one should think of lumbar, even sequestered disc protrusion as the course of a therapy resistant lumbar compression of the nerve root and its successful surgical decompression of the older people before irreversible damages and torturing pains decrease the quality of life significantly."

Thirty women with lymphedema following axillary lymph node dissection surgery for breast cancer surgery were enrolled. In each patient, the volumes of the upper limbs were estimated by three physical therapists using circumference measurements, water displacement and optoelectronic volumetry. One of the physical therapists performed each measure twice. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), relative differences, and limits of agreement were determined. Intrarater and interrater reliability ICCs ranged from 0.94 to 1. Intrarater relative differences were 1.9% for the disk model method, 3.2% for the frustum sign model method, 2.9% for water displacement volumetry, and 1.5% for optoelectronic volumetry. Intrarater reliability was always better than interrater, except for the optoelectronic method. Intrarater and interrater limits of agreement were calculated for each technique. The disk model method and optoelectronic volumetry had better reliability than the frustum sign method and water displacement volumetry, which is usually considered to be the gold standard. In terms of low-cost, simplicity, and reliability, we recommend the disk model method as the method of choice in clinical practice. Since intrarater reliability was always better than interrater reliability (except for optoelectronic volumetry), patients should therefore, ideally, always be evaluated by the same therapist. Additionally, the limits of agreement must be taken into account when determining the response of a patient to treatment."
CD007431,0,8484146,0,Intensive dynamic back exercises with or without hyperextension in chronic back pain after surgery for lumbar disc protrusion. A clinical trial.,"Sixty-two patients with chronic low back pain occurring 14-60 months after undergoing discectomy for the first time were randomized to two physical treatment groups: 24 sessions of intensive dynamic back exercises with hyperextension or 24 sessions of intensive dynamic back exercises without hyperextension. At the conclusion of therapy and at one-year follow-up, no difference was seen between the randomized groups, with regard to the combined assessments of pain, disability and objective measurements. A difference for back exercises without hyperextension to be superior to the other treatment regimen was statistically significant at the three-month follow-up. In the patient's qualitative assessment of treatment outcome there were seen no significant differences between back exercises with or without hyperextension. There was a similar and significant improvement of the isometric endurance of back muscles in both groups, but the flexibility of the spine was significantly improved only in the group using hyperextension exercises. The overall response rate of an earlier published investigation was reproduced. It is concluded that chronic back patients after first time discectomy may benefit from an intensive rehabilitation protocol including intensive exercises. The added use of hyperextension exercises does not confer any independent benefit. Furthermore, the training had to continue for more than 2-3 months before a statistical significant decrease in back pain was reported in the patient pain diary."

The aim of this study was to compare retrospectively the frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying neck mobility after laminoplasty preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into the C2 spinous process with that after laminoplasty reattaching the muscle to C2. Forty-nine patients after C4-C7 laminoplasty with C3 laminectomy preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into C2 (Group A) and 24 patients after C3-C7 laminoplasty reattaching the muscle (Group B) were evaluated. The frequency of postoperative limitations of ADL accompanying each of three neck movements of extension, flexion and rotation were investigated. The postoperative O-C7 angles at extension and flexion was measured on lateral extension and flexion radiographs of the cervical spine, respectively. The postoperative cervical range of motion in rotation was measured in the cranial view using a digital camera. Frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying extension was lower (P = 0.037) in Group A (2%) than in Group B (17%). Frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying flexion was similar in Group A (8%) and Group B (4%). Frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying rotation was lower (P = 0.031) in Group A (12%) than in Group B (33%). Average O-C7 angle at extension was significantly larger (P = 0.002) in Group A (147 degrees ) than in Group B (136 degrees ). Average O-C7 angle at flexion was similar in Group A (93 degrees ) and Group B (91 degrees ). Average range of motion in rotation was significantly larger (P = 0.004) in Group A (110 degrees ) than in Group B (91 degrees ). This retrospective study suggested that the frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying neck extension or rotation was lower after laminoplasty preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into C2 than after laminoplasty reattaching the muscle."

Hyposensibility in the dermatome was noticed in 35% of patients. Except in 1 patient, these side effects had disappeared 6 weeks after treatment. The EMG showed no signs of denervation. One SEP recording remained abnormal after treatment. There was initial pain relief in 75% of patients after 3 months and in 50% of the patients after 6 months. In conclusion, this study did not reveal any signs of motor denervation after a percutaneous partial rhizotomy. There were no long-term signs of deafferentation. Initial pain relief was found in 75% of patients, but there was a marked tendency for pain to recur in a period from 3 to 9 months after treatment."

The electrophysiological findings point out the neurogenic nature of the disturbance. They furthermore furnish statements with respect to the localisation, the extent, the kind and the prognosis of the lesions. The electromyographical and electroneurographical examination programme is determined by the anatomical innervation conditions and the questions that are of clinical interest. In case of radicular syndromes it is mainly the localisation with respect to the height of the root lesions that is of interest. In plexus lesions, the question regarding the reinnervation chance is usually to the fore. In primary nerve lesions, the question whether there is a partial or total nerve separation is above all of interest. In secondary nerve lesions and the bottle-neck syndromes it is usually necessary to determine the exact site of the lesions and the extent of the chronic compression damage. In this paper, these aspects ae discussed on the basis of the more important clinical pictures and practical hints for diagnosis and therapy are given."

The author found that in 6.15% of cases the nervus peroneus communis passes between the tendinous parts of the m. piriformis, and he considers this variation of practical significance for the development of the 'piriformis syndrome'. In unward rotation of the thigh, the m. piriformis is extended and the tendons of the divided muscle are tightly pressed together thus pinching the nerve between them. Pinching of the nerve causes the characteristic sciatic pain. In such a case, the patient can be relieved by cutting one of the tendons."

The clinical data including the neurological findings, the angle of straight leg raising and post-operative recovery as measured by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, were recorded. The high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) was measured by an ultrasensitive latex-enhanced immunoassay. The mean hs-CRP concentration was 0.056 +/- 0.076 mg/dl in the patient group and 0.017 +/- 0.021 mg/dl in the control group. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.006). There was no other correlation between the hs-CRP concentration and the level and type of herniation, or the pre-operative clinical data. A positive correlation was found between the concentration of hs-CRP before operation and the JOA score after. Those with a higher concentration of hs-CRP before operation showed a poorer recovery after. The significantly high concentration of serum hs-CRP might indicate a systemic inflammatory response to impingement of the nerve root caused by disc herniation and might be a predictor of recovery after operation."

The partial sit-up may be appropriate only for patients with significant trunk flexion weakness, and the straight head-trunk sit-up may be useful as a more strenuous test and resistive exercise. Rationale and derivations of the rigid-body equilibrium equations, as well as some of the limitations and assumptions associated with the modeling approach, are presented."
CD007431,0,9102825,0,[Neuroleukemia in adults].,"Involvement of CNS with leukemic cells is well recognized complication of acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) in childhood, but with recent improvements in systemic treatment and longer survival the incidence of this complication has increased in adults. Neurological symptomatology in patients with CNS leukemia is due to meningeal infiltration, but sometimes also to diffuse and nodular cerebral infiltration. Between January 1991 and December 1994, 36 patients suffering of acute leukemia, 28 with ALL, and 8 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were demonstrated to have neuroleukemia by the following criteria: (1) the presence at lumbar puncture (LP) pleocytosis and blast cells on CSF sediment (without positive bacteriologic and fungal cultures), and (2) the presence of neurological symptoms and signs. All 36 patients had 46 episodes of CNS involvement. All patients had neurological examinations during every episode, and according to the neurological abnormalities were classified into four categories. LP was performed in all, and CSF sediments obtained by sedimentation in Sayk's chambers, were routinely stained by MGG and cytochemical stains to detection of leukemic cells (Fig. 1). EEG was done during 21 episodes, CT scan during 15. We divided patients into four groups according to the most prominent neurological symptoms and signs. First was the group included 23 episodes (50%), (18 ALL, 5 AML), where symptoms and signs of meningeal irritation predominated, mimicking the clinical picture of meningitis. This meningeal syndrome can sometimes produce differential diagnostic problems with CNS infections, when CSF examination is of primary importance. Second was the group of 9 patients (6 ALL and 3 AML) with 10 episodes (21.74%) where cranial nerve symptoms and signs-predominated, or were exclusively present. Most frequently affected were bulbomotors, facials and opticus. Third group consisted of 8 ALL patients (8 episodes, 17.39%) with dominant spinal root symptomatology, caused by pathological infiltration of either spinal roots or meninges surrounding them. This group includes also one patient with mononeuritis multiplex and the other with painful polyneuropathy. All patients in this group had pain on straight leg raising, but we stress here that all patients from other groups had positive Lazarevitsh's sign, too. So, it can be a good differential diagnostic parameter for distinguishing toxic medicamentous polyneuropathy from leukemic poliradiculoneuropathy. Fourth group included 5 patients (5 episodes, 10.87%). 4 ALL and 1 AML, where cerebral symptoms, such as seizures, hemiparesis and psychoorganic syndromes were prominent. CSF was obtained during all episodes by lumbar puncture. The protein concentration ranged from 21-3180 mg/dl, and was above normal (45 mg/dl) during 28 episodes. Mild hypoglycoracchia was present during 16 episodes. Cell count ranged from 11-4816 cells/cm3, malignant cells were identified during all episodes with same morphological and cytochemical characteristics of identified type of leukaemia. It has been established that the most valuable diagnostic procedure in CNS leukemia is CSF examination, and detection of blasts is sufficient for diagnosis. All other procedures like EEG, myelography and CT have only supplemental diagnostic significance. Finally, in this study we showed that neurological symptomatology in patients with acute leukemia is not dependent of the type of leukemia, moreover different types of AL can have same neurological manifestations. As others, we sometimes used the term CNS leukemia in this paper, although it is clear that meninges and peripheral nervous system are most often involved. This is the reason why we suggest that neuroleukemia, or NS leukemia should be used as more appropriate expressions."

CD007431,0,7471586,0,Intraoperative straight-leg raising during laminectomy and disk excision for sciatica.,"During lumbar disk excision for sciatica, doubts may occasionally arise as to the level of the lesion or the degree of involvement of the particular nerve root being observed. Following removal of the obstructing agent, can we be certain that liberation of the nerve root is complete? These anxieties can be dispelled by performing a straight-leg raising test bilaterally during the operation both before and after removal of the obstructing agent. The intraoperative straight-leg raising tests enable observations to be made as to the degree of nerve tension on the involved side as compared with tension on the uninvolved side; at the end of the operation, the tension on the involved side should be no more than the tension on the uninvolved side. When the straight-leg raising test is not being performed, it should be possible for the nerve root to be displaced to the midline of the spinal canal with ease."

Neurological status of the patients can significantly change depending on progression of the disease of the intervertebral disc.

CD007431,0,9840472,0,Comparative immunohistochemical study of group II (synovial-type) and group IV (cytosolic) phospholipases A2 in disc prolapse tissue.,"Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) has been suggested to be present in herniated disc tissue and it could possibly be involved in sciatica/ discogenic back pain mechanisms. In the present study the occurrence of two different phospholipase A2 enzymes, (1) low molecular weight (14 kDa) group II synovial-type (sPLA2) and (2) high molecular weight (85 kDa) group IV cytosolic (cPLA2), were compared. Fifty-three disc prolapses obtained at disc operations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, using anti-human monoclonal antibodies to sPLA2 and cPLA2, respectively. Only cell-associated (disc cells, hyaline cartilage chondrocytes) sPLA2 and cPLA2 immunoreactivity could be observed. The results showed that sPLA2 was more common (25/53, 47%) than cPLA2 (13/53, 25%). sPLA2 and cPLA2 were simultaneously present in 13 of 53 samples (25%). However, both PLA2 enzymes were predominantly present in hyaline cartilage cells (sPLA2: 16/53, cPLA2: 5/53), being less commonly observed in disc cells (sPLA2: 6/53, cPLA2: 3/53). In addition, three samples for sPLA2 and two samples for cPLA2 exhibited immunoreactivity in cartilage and disc cells simultaneously. sPLA2 was observed in no other locations, but in 3 of 53 samples cPLA2 was observed more diffusely in areas of granulation tissue, possibly in macrophages. No gender- or age-related dependence for either type of PLA2 enzyme immunoreactivity could be observed. Neither did their occurrence relate to clinical data such as straight leg raising or neurological deficit. The results do not support a major role for either of the two disc-cell-associated PLA2s in disc pathophysiology. For both enzymes, the major pool appears to reside in cartilage tissue cells, presumably in dislodged end-plate fragments. Disc cells are apparently unlikely candidates for major PLA2 storage."

CD007431,0,2159986,0,Normal and radiculopathic cutaneous pain tolerance levels evaluated by heat-beam dolorimetry.,"The heat-beam dolorimeter has previously been used to obtain cutaneous pain tolerance measures in normal volunteers and patients with chronic pain. In the present study, normal reference data were collected at two stimulus intensities for 24 volunteers, and the stimulus-effect relationship (decreasing tolerance latency with increasing stimulus intensity) was found significant (p less than 0.001) for all body sites tested. No overall sex differences were found; males behaved slightly more stoically than females, with differences significant only at the T3 site over the breasts. At the second evaluation at the higher stimulus intensity, females exhibited lower pain tolerance (greater pain sensitivity) at the right breast than males (p less than 0.05). No significant lateral asymmetry was found in cutaneous pain tolerance except at the dorsum of the hand: the right hand evinced elevated pain tolerance compared with the left hand in both right- and left-handed subjects. Eight radiculopathic pain patients with clinically involved left L5 nerve roots were evaluated and their responses were compared with the volunteer normal reference data. The radiculopathic group evinced elevated tolerance levels in both the radiculopathic dermatome and noninvolved sites compared with normal individuals (p less than 0.05)."

CD007431,0,2104701,0,Assessment of extradural degenerative disease with Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging: correlation with surgical and pathologic findings.,"To test whether gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced MR would increase the conspicuity of extradural degenerative disease in the previously unoperated patient, we prospectively studied a group of 30 patients with symptoms suggestive of disk disease. Surgical findings and pathologic correlations were used as an objective measure of accuracy. Gadolinium-DTPA increased the confidence of diagnosis at one of eight operated cervical levels (six patients) and changed the diagnosis from extradural degenerative disease to tumor in one patient. The mechanism of enhancement of the epidural space and peridiskal region appears to be related to accumulation of contrast material within the epidural venous plexus, as well as to epidural fibrosis associated with disk disruption and herniation. While the immediate clinical utility of gadolinium-DTPA for morphologic analysis seems limited to difficult cervical spine cases, the presence of enhancement as a marker of epidural fibrosis and attempted healing may prove to be of great importance in studying the natural history and basic pathophysiology of degenerative disk disease."
CD007431,0,15885385,0,A new approach for the estimation of intervertebral disc volume using the Cavalieri principle and computed tomography images.,"This study was carried out to describe a simple, accurate and practical technique for estimating the volume of intervertebral disc (ID) by the combination of the Cavalieri principle and computed tomography (CT) images. Total eight lumbar IDs from two cadavers were CT scanned in axial, sagittal and coronal sections. The consecutive sections with 5 and 3mm thickness were used to estimate the volume of the IDs by the Cavalieri principle. Three investigators estimated the volume of IDs independently to evaluate inter-observer differences. When the results were compared to the real volumes of IDs measured by the fluid displacement technique, there was no significant difference between the real volume measurements and the Cavalieri estimation results of ID volumes (P > 0.05). Moreover, findings of three investigators did not show significant variations (P > 0.05). Our results indicate that the section thickness and the section planes did not affect the accuracy of the disc volume estimation. Thus the combination of CT scanning with the Cavalieri principle may be used as a direct and reliable technique to estimate the volume of IDs with a mean of 4 min workload per ID."

Clinical and pulse sequence considerations.,"Sixty-five patients were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MR) to determine what combination of operator-selectable controls would result in a thorough examination of the intervertebral disks. There were 20 normal subjects, 8 with degenerative lumbar disk disease, 27 with both degeneration and herniation, 5 with stenosis of the spinal canal, and 5 with disk space infection. T2 was significantly longer in the normal nucleus pulposus than in the degenerated disk. Based on plots of in vivo signal intensity vs. repetition time (TR) for various echo times (TE), a sagittal 30-msec. TE and a 0.25-sec. TR were used for anatomical delineation and rapid localization, while sagittal and/or axial 120-msec. TE/3-sec. TR images were used to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid and disk. Comparison with radiographs, high-resolution CT scans, and myelograms showed that MR was the most sensitive for identification of degeneration and disk space infection, separating the normal nucleus pulposus from the annulus and degenerated disk. Herniation, stenosis of the canal, and scarring can be identified as accurately with MR as with CT or myelography."
CD007431,0,12016348,0,Evaluation of electromagnetic fields in the treatment of pain in patients with lumbar radiculopathy or the whiplash syndrome.,"Back pain and the whiplash syndrome are very common diseases involving tremendous costs and extensive medical effort. A quick and effective reduction of symptoms, especially pain, is required. In two prospective randomized studies, patients with either lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 or the whiplash syndrome were investigated. Inclusion criteria were as follows: either clinically verified painful lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 and a Laségue's sign of 30 degrees (or more), or typical signs of the whiplash syndrome such as painful restriction of rotation and flexion/extension. Exclusion criteria were prolapsed intervertebral discs, systemic neurological diseases, epilepsy, and pregnancy. A total of 100 patients with lumbar radiculopathy and 92 with the whiplash syndrome were selected and entered in the study following a 1:1 ratio. Both groups (magnetic field treatment and controls) received standard medication consisting of diclofenac and tizanidine, while the magnetic field was only applied in group 1, twice a day, for a period of two weeks. In patients suffering from radiculopathy, the average time until pain relief and painless walking was 8.2 +/- 0.5 days in the magnetic field group, and 11.7 +/- 0.5 days in controls p < 0.04). In patients with the whiplash syndrome, pain was measured on a ten-point scale. Pain in the head was on average 4.6 before and 2.1 after treatment in those receiving magnetic field treatment, and 4.2/3.5 in controls. Neck pain was on average 6.3/1.9 as opposed to 5.3/4.6, and pain in the shoulder/arm was 2.4/0.8 as opposed to 2.8/2.2 (p < 0.03 for all regions). Hence, magnetic fields appear to have a considerable and statistically significant potential for reducing pain in cases of lumbar radiculopathy and the whiplash syndrome."
CD007431,0,10547007,0,Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Long-term results after undercutting decompression compared with decompressive laminectomy alone or with instrumented fusion.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of various surgical procedures for lumbar spinal stenosis. Operations were performed on 117 consecutive patients for lumbar spinal stenosis between 1987 and 1992. Pre- and intraoperative data were recorded in a standardized manner. Three treatment groups were distinguished: group I consisting of 39 patients submitted to undercutting decompression; group II, 51 patients, submitted to laminectomy and foraminal decompression alone; and group III, 27 patients, who underwent foraminal decompression and laminectomy with instrumented fusion. Eight years (5-10 years) after surgery a questionnaire was mailed to the patients containing the outcome scales according to Greenough and Fraser [6] and Turner et al. [22] together with questions about residual pain, necessity of treatment and satisfaction with the operative outcome. A total of 72 questionnaires (61.6%) gave enough information for analysis. After a mean follow-up of 8 years, walking capacity had increased significantly in all groups (P < 0.001). Compared to preoperative values, pain had decreased significantly in all groups (P < 0.01). In group I 36% had good-to-excellent outcomes, and 30.8% and 23.8% in groups II and III (P > 0.05). Forty percent of group I patients were unsatisfied with the result, compared to 38.4% and 33.3% in the other groups (P > 0.05). Overall, 25 of 72 patients (34.7%) had severe constant back and/or leg pain requiring daily administration of analgesics. We conclude that the long-term outcome of decompressive surgery of the lumbar spinal canal, without and with instrumented fusion, is less favourable than was previously reported."
CD007431,0,3206299,0,Magnetic resonance imaging and contrast CT of the lumbar spine. Comparison of diagnostic methods and correlation with surgical findings.,"Thirty-two patients with suspected lumbar disc herniation were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast computed tomography (CT). One hundred disc levels were evaluated. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery on 31 discs, allowing anatomic confirmation of the diagnosis. Surgical findings supported the MRI diagnosis at 28 of 31 levels (90.3% accuracy), whereas the CT diagnosis correctly reflected only 24 of 31 levels (77.4% accuracy). Discrepancy between MRI and CT interpretation occurred at ten levels that were surgically explored. Computed tomography (CT) was incorrect at seven levels, and MRI was in error at three levels. The sensitivity of MRI was 91.7%, compared with 83.3% for CT, and the MRI specificity of 100% was superior to 71.4% for CT. This study demonstrates the clinical superiority of surface coil MRI over contrast CT in the evaluation of lumbar disc herniation. Surface coil MRI can be used as the initial diagnostic procedure for a suspected herniated lumbar disc, using invasive contrast studies and CT, if required, to clarify an equivocal MRI finding."

Narrowed disc spaces and alterations attributed to lumbar Scheuermann's disease, shown on the radiographs, were always associated with DD in MRI. Such a strong relationship was not observed with transitional vertebrae, spondylolisthesis, spina bifida, or postural abnormalities. However, an increased weight, a positive straight leg raising test, and a reduced lumbar mobility was consistent with an increase in frequency of DD. Magnetic resonance imaging is a safe and sensitive method for studying the presence and etiologic factors of DD."

Continuous data on five signs were analyzed by Pearsons' correlation coefficient, and binary data on 54 signs were analyzed by the Kappa agreement coefficient. Reliable signs consisted of measurements of lordosis and flexion range, determination of pain on flexion and lateral bend, nearly all measurements associated with the straight leg raising test, determination of pain location in the thigh and legs, and determination of sensory changes in the legs. Signs of root tension showed better agreement when qualified with a description of where the pain was experienced. Bony tenderness was more reliable than soft tissue tenderness."

However, one must be cautious not to overinterpret small abnormalities that are also frequent in asymptomatic subjects. There is conflicting evidence about the correlation of high-intensity zones with clinical symptoms. Bulging disks and protrusions are a common finding in asymptomatic individuals, whilst extrusions are almost always accompanied by back pain and sciatica. In patients with back pain or sciatica, MRI is indicated after failure of conservative management or neurological deterioration. Contrast-enhanced MRI is well suited to differentiate a recurrent disk extrusion from epidural fibrosis. In all cases suspicious of tumor or infection, MRI is indicated as a first-line investigation.

Fifty-Three patients (33 women and 20 men, with an average age of 60.8 years) were evaluated retrospectively by neurosurgery. All of the patients had received simple X-P, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery. The neurological findings were evaluated on admission and in a follow-up review. Surgical intervention was performed on all patients and they underwent gross-total cyst removal. During surgery, the origin of a cyst was well observed. Follow-up data ranged from 6 to 46 months. Patient outcome was graded on a scale of excellent, good, or poor. Histological findings were evaluated. In 53 patients 58 cysts were identified. Four of the patients had multiple cysts. All cysts were associated with mobile spine. Fifty-five cysts were found in the lumbo-sacral region, two cysts were found in the cervico-thoracic region and one cyst in the thoracic region. Forty-two patients presented back pain and 52 patients presented radicular pain. Four patients had a cauda equina syndrome. Sensory disturbance was observed in 24 cases and motor weakness was observed in 21 cases. Claudication was observed in 19 cases. All cases with cervico-thoracic or thoracic cysts presented myelopathy. The duration of these clinical symptoms ranged from 10 days to 10 years. After surgery there was no case of a recurrent cyst during the follow-up period. Thirty-four cases had an excellent outcome, 18 a good outcome, and one a poor outcome. Out of 58 cysts 32 were joint cysts (11 synovial cysts, 21 ganglion cysts). A further 19 were flavum cysts, one was a posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) cyst and six others were unknown pseudo cysts. In 34 of the cysts we found hemosiderin deposits and in eight amyloid deposits. Present investigation and findings in literature show a clear comparison of these cystic formations and the mobile part of the spine. An anatomical relation to a vertebral joint (""facet"") is only found in some of the cases (32 of 58). Further to that, the name ""cyst"" is not correct either, because most of the cystic formations are presented without a cell lining on their internal wall and therefore they are pseudo-cystic. We think that these cystic formations should be called ""cystic formations of mobile spine"" (CYFMOS) rather than ""juxtafacet cysts"". A surgical intervention is the best treatment for these cysts if they cause a compression of nerve roots or/and of the spinal cord."

Of 250 consecutive patients, 94 were diagnosed as having myofascial pain and 57 as having herniated disc syndrome. Before evaluation and diagnosis, all patients completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire, ratings of pain and disability, and the Symptom Checklist 90-R. Patients were also grouped on the basis of previous surgical history and workers' compensation benefits. Patients suffering from myofascial pain were significantly less likely to report periods of pain relief than patients with herniated disc syndrome. Those receiving workers' compensation benefits reported significantly greater levels of pain, disability, and psychological distress than those not receiving benefits, irrespective of diagnosis. Patients who underwent previous surgery did not differ significantly from those who never underwent surgery. All patients had elevated scores on the Somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-R. Patients with myofascial pain and workers' compensation benefits demonstrated the highest levels of somatization and phobia. These findings suggest that the effects of low back pain of myofascial origin have comparable, if not worse, consequences than disc herniation.

In the higher age groups, the incidence increases. Multiple myeloma is an illness that reacts well to treatment which can result in periods of remission lasting for years. Some of the patients are even able to return to work. A pre-requisite for successful treatment is early diagnosis and this is usually in the hands of first line physicians. This is the reason why the Czech Myeloma Group, in conjunction with neurologists, orthopedicians and radio diagnosticians has issued the following recommendations for first line physicians containing a more detailed description of the symptoms and the diagnostic pitfalls of the disease. This disease reminds a chameleon for the variety of its symptoms. For the sake of clarification, we shall divide multiple myeloma symptoms into five points, each of which is reason enough to warrant an examination to confirm or rule out a malignant cause of health problems (a negative result does not automatically mean exclusion). If any of the recommended examinations results positive, the diagnostic process must be continued, in which case a general practitioner refers the patient to a specialist health centre. Observing these recommendations should minimize the number of cases of late diagnosis. 1. Bone destruction symptoms. - Unexplained backache for more than one month in any part of spine even without nerve root irritability or without pain in other part of skeleton (ribs, hips, or long bones). - Pain at the beginning of myeloma disease is very similar to benigne common discopathy, however the intensity of backache is decreasing within one months in benigne disease. In the case of malignant process the intensity of bone pain is steadily increasing. - Immediate imaging and laboratory investigation are indicated by resting and night pain in spinal column or in any part of skeleton. - Backache with the sign of spinal cord or nerve compression should be sent for immediate X Ray, and focussed CT/MRI followed by acute surgery if needed. - Osteoporosis especially in men and premenopausal women. 2. Features of changed immunity or bone marrow function. Persistent and recurrent infection, typical is normochromic anaemia, with leucopenia and trombocytopenia. 3. Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate even increase concentration of total plasma protein. 4. Impaired renal function. Increased level of creatinin or proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome with bilateral legs oedema. 5. Hypercalcemia with typical clinical symptoms (polyuria with dehydratation, constipation, nausea, low level conscience, coma). Every one from these points has to be reason for general medical doctor to start battery of tests: -X-ray of bones focused to painful area (mandatory before physiotherapy, local anaesthesia or other empiric therapy). If plain X-ray does not elucidate pain and symptoms are lasting more than one month, please consider all circumstances and results from laboratory investigation. This patient needs referral to the centre with MRI/CT facilities (CT or MRI is necessary investigation in case of nerve root or spine compression). -Investigation of erythrocyte sedimantion rate (high level of sedimentation of erythrocyte can indicate multiple myeloma). -Full blood count. -Basic biochemical investigation serum and urine: serum urea, creatinin, ionts including calcium, total protein, and albumin CRP (high concentration of total protein indicates myeloma, low level of albumin indicates general pathological process, similary increased concentration of fibrinogen, impaired renal function indicates myeloma kidney, however hypercalcemia is typical for highly aggressive myeloma). -Quantitative screening for IgG, IgM and IgA in serum (isolated raised level one of immunoglobulin with decreased level of the others indicates myeloma). -Common electrophoresis of serum is able to detect monoclonal immunoglobulin level at few gramm concentration. If all the laboratory investigation are in normal level the possibility that the current problems are multiple myeloma origine is smaller, but it does not exclude one of rare variant--non secretory myeloma (undifferentiated plasmocyt lost characteristic feature to produce monoclonal immunoglobulin). If any of tests indicate the possibility of myeloma, patient require urgent specialist referral to department with possibility to make diagnosis of malignant myeloma."

CD007431,0,17414980,0,Bleeding risk with ketorolac after lumbar microdiscectomy.,"There is a need to improve postoperative analgesia to support the trend to shorter hospitalization after minimally invasive spine surgeries. Ketorolac Tromethamine has proven efficacy in decreasing postoperative pain but there is concern with postoperative epidural bleeding after spine procedures. We prospectively assessed the incidence of bleeding complications after microdiscectomy in patients treated with a single 30 mg intraoperative dose of Ketorolac subsequent to wound closure. Group 1 consisted of 44 patients, 24 women and 20 men with mean age of 35.7 years (20 to 68 y) treated with Ketorolac. Group 2 consisted of 45 patients, 28 men and 17 women with mean age 46.8 years (32 to 74 y), who underwent discectomy without Ketorolac. Postoperative bleeding complications were monitored along with pain levels and time to discharge. We detected no significant postoperative changes in coagulation parameters or bleeding from the surgical site in either group. Both group 1 and 2 had averaged preoperative visual analog scale scores for leg pain of 8. Group 1 had an average postoperative visual analog scale score of 2.6 compared with 4 for group 2 two hours after surgery. Single dose intravenous Ketorolac provided beneficial analgesia without significant increase in risk of bleeding after microdiscectomy, enabling us to consistently perform microdiscectomy as an ambulatory procedure. Meticulous hemostasis should be accomplished before closure. Prolonged postoperative use is a promising alternative to narcotics."

CD007431,0,2955983,0,Clinical assessment of lumbar impairment.,"Assessment of severity in low back injuries may be based on diagnosis, pain, disability, physical impairment, and capacity for work. It is important to distinguish between impairment and disability. Physical impairment is objective structural limitation; disability is the resulting loss of function. Disability can be assessed by the patient's report of restriction in activities of daily living: bending and lifting, sitting, standing, walking, traveling, socializing, sleep, sex, and putting on or taking off footwear. Detailed statistical analysis of 480 patients identified the most important elements of lumbar impairment as the anatomic and time patterns of pain, lumbar flexion, straight leg raising, neurologic signs, previous surgery, and spinal fractures. Methods of examination need to be improved. An anatomic chart is provided to calculate impairment in the individual patient. The patient's report of pain, disability, and capacity for work should then be compared with the physician's objective assessment of the injury, diagnosis, and lumbar impairment."

Studies have shown the importance of a multilevel assessment of this disease, as its course is influenced by many factors. Most follow-up studies use the degree of physical impairment to measure the outcome of a certain treatment. This remains unsatisfactory, as physical impairment itself seems to be influenced by the social, psychological and personal condition of a patient. We believe that an overall quality of life assessment is required to evaluate success of treatment. The SF-36 questionnaire seemed appropriate, as it provides consistent data of a patient's overall health status. To ensure measurement of disability due to back pain we combined the SF-36 with the NASS (North American Spine Society) questionnaire, an instrument specific for lumbar spine disorders."

The asymptomatic controls were matched by age, sex, and school class. In the group with recurrent or continual low-back pain (17 boys and 21 girls), the boys were over 4 cm taller than those in the control group. In both sexes sagittal mobility was decreased in lumbar extension and straight leg raising, and increased in lumbar flexion. Endurance strength in the abdominal and back muscles was decreased compared to the control pupils, who reported no back pain at all in the questionnaire collected 1 year before the testing procedure. The pupils reporting sciatica (n = 7) at some time, in addition to recurrent low-back pain, had decreased lumbar flexion and side bending compared to those with recurrent low-back pain (n = 31) without sciatica. The results of the study indicated that in this growing-age population there was a subgroup with recurrent low-back pain having a different spinal mobility pattern as well as decreased trunk muscle strength."

CD007431,0,124641,0,Low back pain with femoral neuritis.,"In 465 patients treated surgically for low back and lower extremity disability, almost 10 per cent had femoral rather than sciatic distribution of pain. The average age of patients who had a primarily femoral distribution of pain is higher by a decade than those who had a predominantly sciatic distribution of pain; the higher level of the lesion and greater incidence of apophyseal joint arthritis may be associated with the aging process. The femoral distribution of pain may lead to difficulties in differential diagnosis between a spinal origin and a hip or knee origin of the problem. Radiculopathy causing femoral pain may be the result of both disk degeneration with protrusion and apophyseal arthritis with synovitis. Neuritis of the L4 nerve root is more commonly the result of a lesion at the L4-5 nerve root foramen than centrally at the L3-4 disk level. The syndrome of low back pain with femoral neuritis is not uncommon 5 or more years after an otherwise successful L4-S1, two level spine fusion. This syndrome can result from an L3-4 disk protrusion with nerve root neuritis but may be a reflex disturbance from the posterior arch structures as evidenced by fusion mass, apophyseal joint or spinous process overgrowth and associated soft tissue inflammation."

CD007431,0,2931153,0,Clinical trial of common treatments for low back pain in family practice.,"The results of a multicentered randomised clinical trial are reported of bed rest and of a physiotherapy and education programme for patients who presented in family practice with an acute episode of low back pain. No beneficial effect of either treatment was observed on several clinical outcome measures, including straight leg raising, lumbar flexion, activities of daily living, and pain. In fact the results favoured early mobilisation over bed rest and suggested that the physiotherapy and education programme was doing more harm than good. Moreover, additional analyses, which focused on clinically interesting patient subgroups, discovered no subset of patients who benefited from either of the treatments under study. Having failed to identify any clinically important benefits, or other explanations for these negative results, we can only conclude that family doctors have little reason to prescribe either bed rest or isometric exercises to patients who suffer from low back pain."
CD007431,0,6867860,0,Bilateral laminotomy and discectomy for segmental lumbar disc disease. Decompression with stability.,"A type of bilateral laminotomy with discectomy for segmental lumbar discogenic disease is presented. The procedure includes wide bilateral decompressive laminotomies and radical partial discectomies, partial V-ostectomy of the adjacent spinous processes, partial facetectomies of the inferior and superior articular processes, and foraminotomies as indicated. One hundred patients who underwent this procedure were evaluated by an independent examiner in follow-up an average of six years postoperatively. The patients were evaluated by utilizing a scale which included back and leg pain relief, restriction of physical activities, analgesic use, and return to work. Seventy patients were graded as good, 12 as fair, and 18 as poor. Preoperative factors which were highly significantly correlated with a good postoperative result included occupation other than heavy labor, present employment or less than 12 months of unemployment, unilateral subjective paresthesias, symptoms of spinal claudication, unilateral restriction of straight leg raising, a positive Cram or bowstring test, the severity of the myelographic defect, elevation of spinal fluid protein, and the severity of the disc pathology noted at surgery. Several other preoperative factors were noted to be of somewhat lesser significance and were correlated with a poor surgical outcome, including job-related injury, compensation or litigation, previous unsuccessful surgery, subjective weakness, calf atrophy, and sensory deficit."
CD007431,0,8757000,0,Spinal cord infarction: etiology and outcome.,"We reviewed 44 cases of ischemia and infarction of the spinal cord at two university hospitals. Three patients experienced transient ischemic attacks. Etiologies of completed strokes were diverse and included rupture and surgical repair of aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, aortic rupture and thrombosis, global ischemia, anterior spinal artery embolism, repair and thrombosis of spinal arteriovenous malformations, hematomyelia, epidural hematoma, cervical osteophytosis, celiac plexus block, systemic lupus erythematosus, coagulopathy, and decompression sickness. Motor function improved in 12 patients, was substantial in only one, and occurred largely within the first 2 to 4 weeks. Favorable ambulatory outcome correlated with improving neurologic examinations and relatively preserved strength in hip abductors and knee extensors. More extensive deficits without initial improvement portended a more severe prognosis. Autonomic dysfunction, pain, paresthesia, and depression were common and impeded recovery in some patients. The mean level of deficit was at T-8 and in cases of global ischemia was at T-9, which leads us to dispute the classical view of a midthoracic watershed zone of ischemic vulnerability near T-4."
CD007431,0,7716310,0,[Magnetic resonance myelography. Preliminary experience].,"Three-dimensional (3D) MR Myelography is a new technique using constructive interference steady-state (CISS) sequences, which are characterized by a symmetric flow compensation enhancing CSF signal intensity compared with neural and extradural structures. 3D myelographic projections with different rotation angles are obtained from the 3D dataset with a mathematical algorithm called maximum intensity projection (MIP). Myelographic projections yield a global view of subarachnoid spaces and of root sleeves with no intrathecal contrast agent injection. This study was aimed at assessing the feasibility, the clinical value and the diagnostic accuracy of 3D MR Myelography in comparison with conventional myelography. From September 1992 to January 1994, thirty-five myelograms were performed. The study population consisted of 10 volunteers, 8 patients with traumatic brachial plexus lesions, 7 with herniated disks (4 lumbar and 3 cervical disks), 4 with sacral radicular cysts, 2 with spinal vascular malformations, 3 with extramedullary intradural neoplasms (2 cervical neuromas and 1 cervical meningioma) and 1 with an intramedullary tumor (a conus medullaris ependymoma). All patients underwent SE MRI and conventional myelography (22 lumbar injections, 3 cervical injections of nonionic iodinated contrast agent) followed by CT (CT myelography). This trial demonstrates the feasibility of 3D MR myelography in the study of the cervical and lumbar spine: its results are comparable to those obtained with conventional myelography also in some specific indications like traumatic brachial plexus injuries, where invasive conventional myelography is usually thought to be essential."

CD007431,0,8864502,0,Surgery for patients with central protruded lumbar discs who have failed conservative therapy.,"The clinical presentation and results of surgery of patients with central protruded lumbar discs have not been well defined or distinguished from studies of patients with lateral herniated discs. Many patients are denied surgical treatment, even though they are incapacitated by pain, because they do not have the classic radiographic findings seen in patients with lateral disc herniation. Sixty-three symptomatic patients with radiographically documented central lumbar disc protrusion were analysed. All patients had failed at least 6 months of conservative therapy. Although lumbar spinal pain was the most common complaint, 24 patients also presented with bilateral leg pain and 33 with unilateral leg pain; 26 had unilateral limitation of straight leg raising. An interesting observation was that unilateral symptoms and dural tension signs can be seen in patients with central disc protrusion. After surgical follow-up for a mean of 51 months, 86% achieved good results when analysed by the Prolo Functional Economic Outcome Rating Scale. It is postulated that pain is mediated by neuropeptides and arachidonic acid degradation products which are a response to mechanical annular injury."

CD007431,0,17334791,0,Modic changes following lumbar disc herniation.,"Only a small proportion (20%) of patients with LBP can be diagnosed based on a patho-anatomical entity. Therefore, the identification of relevant subgroups, preferably on a patoanatomical basis, is strongly needed. Modic changes have been described by several authors as being closely linked with LBP. The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of Modic changes, their development as well as their association to LBP, previous disc contour, and surgery in patients with previous severe sciatica. This is a longitudinal cohort study where the patients were recruited from an RCT comparing two active conservative treatments, the 181 patients, who at baseline had radicular pain in or below the knee; all underwent a physical examination and MRI. MRI's, pain history and physical examination of 166 patients were obtained at follow-up 14 months later. The prevalence of Modic changes type 1 increased from 9% at baseline to 29% at follow-up. At that time, a strong association between Modic changes and non-specific LBP was noted. Apparently, Modic changes type 1 was more strongly associated with non-specific lumbar pain than Modic changes type 2. The development of new Modic changes was closely related to the level of a previous disc herniation. A lumbar disc herniation is a strong risk factor for developing Modic changes (especially type 1) during the following year. Furthermore, Modic changes are strongly associated with LBP."
CD007431,0,3703237,0,Lumbar disc disease evaluated by myelography and postmyelography spinal computed tomography.,"Five- and ten-millimeter-thick transverse axial computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained at lumbar disc spaces in 81 patients with suspected lumbar disc disease. Scans were obtained following metrizamide myelography. CT and myelography findings were compared and correlated with clinical and surgical findings. Postmyelography CT scan was superior to myelography in 68% since it was able to demonstrate even small herniations. It was especially valuable in the L5-S1 space where the wide epidural space can hide the disc herniation without it being demonstrated by myelography. Also other kinds of pathology which may simulate or complicate disc herniation were readily evaluated by postmyelography CT. Although noncontrast CT scans are usually diagnostic and sufficient, the improved anatomical details obtained by postcontrast CT scans, increase the diagnostic accuracy, and selected, complicated cases may need the CT study with intrathecal metrizamide."

Besides the ""common"" findings, such as seroma, one must classify conditions such as haematomas, isolated bone fragments and/or residual disc tissue as ""unusual"" changes. The CT findings are correlated with clinical symptoms. We conducted CT and clinical follow-up studies in 91 patients several weeks later. All patients showed epidural scars of very different intensity. The comparison between early postoperative findings and the controls documents the high accuracy of the interpretation of the early postoperative states seen by CT. Therefore, it is possible to give hints for the indication for early postoperative CT examinations, for the prognosis as well as for the technique for a safe operative procedure."

CD007431,0,18391677,1,The sensitivity and specificity of the Slump and the Straight Leg Raising tests in patients with lumbar disc herniation.,"An accurate and specific diagnosis prevents the recurrences of low back pain and chronic spinal pain. The physical examination is the most useful tool to diagnosis. The examiner must aim to determine the exact tissue that pain arises from to make the specific diagnosis. Lumbar disc herniation is 1 disease that physical examination, symptoms, and findings on imaging technique do not always correlate with each other. The Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test has been used as the primary test to diagnosis lumbar disc herniations and found to have high correlation with findings on operation since its sensitivity is high in only disc herniations leading to root compression that may eventually need operation. More sensitive test, like the Slump, might be used in herniations in which the SLR is negative. The Slump test is really a variant of the SLR and the Lasègue's tests performed in the seated position and is a progressive series of maneuvers designed to place the sciatic nerve roots under increasing tension. At each step in the procedure, the patient informs the examiner what is being felt and whether radicular pain is produced. As a result, the Slump test applies traction to the nerve roots by incorporating spinal and hip joint flexion into the leg raising and would warn the examiner of the presence of nerve root compression when there is a negative SLR test."

CD007431,0,7477696,0,[Characteristic neurological signs in patients with cervical disc disease].,"In cervical radiculopathy, neurological findings for the upper extremities and the responsible level of the radices have been precisely detailed. However, in cases of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, it is not always easy to determine the responsible level of the cervical spine solely based on neurological findings. To disclose characteristic neurological lesions of the upper extremities, if any, for different locations of disc disease, 49 patients with cervical disc protrusion at single levels, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, were analyzed. Thirty-six patients demonstrated long tract signs (LTS) concomitant with segmental signs in the upper extremities, and 13 patients had no LTS. Except for deep tendon reflexes and the extent of dysesthesia in the upper extremities, there were no characteristic neurological findings, such as muscle atrophy, loss of muscle strength, extent of hypalgesia, or hypesthesia, pointing to the responsible compression site. In the 13 patients without LTS, the extent of dysesthesia and diminution of deep tendon reflexes proved to be completely in agreement with results for radiculopathy: 9 had protruded discs at the C56 level and described dysesthesia in the thumb and the index finger with deep tendon reflexes in the biceps and brachioradialis being diminished. The remaining 4 had protruded discs at the C67 level and described dysesthesia in the middle finger. Their deep tendon reflexes in the triceps were diminished. A clear contrast was observed for the patients with LTS. Four out of 36 patients had C34 protruded discs and did not complain of dysesthesia in any digits. Their deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated in all muscles in the upper extremities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,3808189,0,[Transthoracic approach and costotransversectomy in thoracic discogenic disease].,"The thoracic discogenic disease is the rarest, yet is most devastating of all disc lesions. The clinical manifestations including myelopathy and radiculopathy are not characteristic, therefore accurate radiological diagnosis has to be made by carefully performed myelography and CT, and recently by MRI. Historically conventional laminectomy has been attended with terrible results such as paraplegia. Therefore transthoracic approach and costo-transversectomy have been the procedure of choice in recent years, and these procedures can be performed safely and effectively without serious complications with help of the operating microscope. Transthoracic approach is a more decisive anterolateral operation for the central disc and the spondylotic spur in the midthoracic spine with excellent visualization of the anterior aspect of the spinal cord. On the other hand, costrotransversectomy is a less formidable posterolateral approach and it provides a reasonable exposure to the lateral disc and the enlarged facet in the lower thoracic spine. The details of the both operative procedures were discussed by using illustrations."

Twenty-five females were in the conventional therapy group (CTG) and 26 females in the manipulation therapy group (MTG). Range of motion of total flexion and extension, total side-flexion and total rotation of the lumbar spine and the straight-leg-raising test were used as criteria to determine efficacy of treatment. The results showed that while the mean treatment time for CTG subjects was 160 minutes (SD = 7.9) that for MTG patients was 121.2 (SD = 10.2) with a significant difference p less than 0.001. There were significant differences between the two groups with regards to post-treatment differences in total flexion and extension p less than 0.01; total side flexion p less than 0.05; and total rotation p less than 0.05 in favour of the MTG subjects. There was also significant difference in post-treatment straight-leg-raising values between the two groups p less than 0.05 in favour of the MTG group.

The mean followup was 12 years (range, 9-13 years). Three patients had moderate low-back pain and two were handicapped. One patient had slight peroneal weakness. Flexibility of the lumbar spine was restricted to some extent in all patients. Laminectomy for spinal stenosis (L4-L5) had been done in one patient and reoperation because of recurring disc herniation was done in two patients. Partial or total bone marrow depletion and corresponding enhancement of fat signals in relation to adjacent vertebral bodies, narrowing of the intervertebral disc space, and irregularity or cavitations affecting one or both end plates were long-term findings of magnetic resonance imaging. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a complete bony fusion in one patient and partial fusion in one patient. In two patients, residual disc protrusion or herniation in relation to the surgically treated disc was evident; three affecting L3-L4 and two affecting L5-S1 disc levels. Septic postoperative lumbar discitis severely hampers clinical recovery after disc operations and results in long-term changes as seen on magnetic resonance imaging scans."
CD007431,0,15805944,0,Surgical versus pharmacologic treatment of intraspinal gout.,"A controversy between pharmacologic and surgical treatment of intraspinal gout exists in the literature. If gout is diagnosed timely, pharmacologic therapy may avert the need of surgery. The lack of readily available synovial fluid makes the diagnosis particularly difficult. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical pictures and magnetic resonance imaging features in rapid differentiations of intraspinal gout. I retrospectively evaluated lumbar intraspinal tophaceous gout without the classic radiographic punched-out lesions. Four patients (average age, 65 years) had a history of hyperuricemia with multiple tophaceous deposits in the joints or visceral organs or both. The common presentations were low back pain with or without inflammatory reaction (fever, elevated C-reactive protein level, and mild leukocytosis). The patients also presented with intermittent claudication or radiculopathy of variable duration or both. The gouty tophi yielded homogeneous and hypointense masses on T1- and T2-weighted images, with multiple hypointense speckles. The masses were located in bilateral lumbar facet joints in all patients, with additional midline extension along the ligamentum flavum in three. All patients had uneventful outcomes after surgical decompression and pharmacologic treatment. Rapid deposition of tophi may aggravate nerve compression. If neurologic deficits are found, surgical decompression can provide a satisfactory outcome."

In this approach an enlargement of the intervertebral foramen is achieved by the partial excision of adjacent pedicles or excision of one or several pedicles. The access to the anterior canal wall is gained in this manner. This surgical approach has been used in 48 patients with neurological injury (spinal cord, conus medullaris, cauda equina or the roots). An active tuberculosis was the causative factor in 12 cases, the sequelae of tuberculous infection in 10 cases, infection in one case, degenerative disc disease in 12 cases, osteochondrosis in 2 cases, nucleus pulposus prolapse into the root canal in 3 cases, developmental defect of the vertebrae in 2 cases, primary or metastatic tumors in 6 cases. These conditions resulted in plegia (3 cases), spastic paresis (3 cases), caudal paresis (5 cases), root paresis (12 cases) and root syndrome (24 cases). This approach provided possibility to recognize the pathology accurately and decompress the roots. Neurological results achieved were most advantageous since in 41 cases neurological symptoms subsided entirely, in 2 cases an improvement was noted, in 2 cases partial improvement and no improvement occurred in 3 cases only."

An effective treatment of this disease is given by the microinvasive. CT controlled periradicular therapy (micro PRT). Under visibility, the tip of a canula is led directly and high precisely in close neighbourhood to the prolaps, then locally NaCl and cristaline cortisone (40 mg Volon A) is instillated. The periradicular distribution and the distribution into the epidural space is documented via contrast medium. A retrospective study with 220 patients and a prospective randomized double blind study with 40 patients (10 mg vs. 40 mg Volon A) were carried out. The average age of the retrospective collective was 53.1 +/- 12.4 years, average treatment period 18.4 weeks, and the mean follow-up 17 months. The mean value of successful treatment of lumbal spine was at 60% (spine 88.5%) with protrusion, with prolaps at 75% (spine 94%), with sequester at 94%, and with stenoses at 69% (spine 60%). With 78.8% of the patients, the percentual result was constantly good at the time of questionnaire as to the end of the treatment. 7.7% still took analgesics, 5.9% were post-operated. 1.8% of the patients made a pension application. The average age of patients within the prospective randomized double-blind-study was 47.2 +/- 11.9 years. At 27.5% of the patients, the start of pain was about more than 5 years ago and goes back to about 23 years (72.5% had pain more than 1 year). The mean value of visits was 4 physicians per patient, and 5 months of follow-up. There is a high significant improvement in results within the group with 40 mg Volon A (p = 0.0351479). The entire improvement, subjectively estimated (visual analogical scale) within this group was at 90%. After end of therapy, 83.3% (n = 30) had stopped the taking of analgesics and the neurologic deficit decreased significantly. Furthermore, significant reduction of prolapses could be observed at 60% of the patients in both study groups (n = 156).

CD007431,0,12021944,0,Clinical features of the localized girdle sensation of mid-trunk (false localizing sign) appeared in cervical compressive myelopathy patients.,"Cervical compressive myelopathy patients sometimes show localized girdle sensation in the mid trunk (so-called false localizing sign). This symptom often confuses physicians, but the clinical features and mechanism of this symptom are still unclear. We investigated the clinical features and possible mechanism. In each of five cases of cervical compressive myelopathy disease with and without mid-truncal girdle sensation, the clinical features, degree and shape of cord compression were analysed. The girdle sensation was expressed as a vague or burning sensation, and was localized with a width of 3 or 4 dermatomes from the T3 to T11 level. There was no correlation between the appearance of the girdle sensation and etiology and level of cervical cord compression. Pyramidal tract signs and disturbance of superficial sensation were observed in all cases. Furthermore, on axial MRI, the midline ventral surface of the cervical cord was remarkably compressed in cases with girdle sensation, as if the compressive lesion entered the anterior medial fissure of the cervical cord. From these findings, this false localizing sign may be caused by severe compression of midline ventral structure of the cervical cord. Ischemia of the thoracic watershed zone of the anterior spinal artery from the compression of the anterior spinal artery at the cervical level might also be considered to be a possible cause."

CD007431,0,6886503,0,[Electromyographical study of the straight leg raising test in lumbar disc herniation].,"The straight leg raising test is one of the most reliable test for the diagnosis of the disc herniation. It is well known that the pain is produced by the increased tension of the affected root. However, the patient's response to the pain evoked by the straight leg raising test is not uniform. In some patients the leg is raised beyond the straight leg raising positive angle without resistance and some young patients show the tight hamstrings phenomenon. To elucidate these phenomena, the muscle action of erector spinae, gluteus maximus and biceps femoris evoked by this test was studied electromyographically. The results are as follows: 1) The muscle action patterns in the patients of disc herniation which are not observed in normal group are classified into four groups, namely LGB type (erector spinae, gluteus maximus and biceps femoris act), GB type (gluteus maximus and biceps femoris act), G type (gluteus maximus only acts), B type (biceps femoris only act). These abnormal muscle actions disappear under general anesthesia and are different from the actions which are recorded when the patients resist passive straight leg raising intentionally. 2) In the case of L4-5 intervertebral disc herniation mainly gluteus maximus acts as the resisting force against the passive straight leg raising. On the other hand, biceps femoris acts mainly in the case of L5-S1 disc herniation. 3) The group of younger age and less degenerated disc shows more resistance against straight leg raising and records the action potential of resisting muscles in earlier stage of the leg raising test."
CD007431,0,12902952,0,Lumbar disc replacement: preliminary results with ProDisc II after a minimum follow-up period of 1 year.,"Total disc replacement has the potential to replace fusion as the gold standard surgical treatment of degenerative disc disease. Potential advantages of disc replacement over fusion include avoidance of pseudarthrosis, postoperative orthoses, and junctional degeneration. After observing satisfactory clinical results at 7-11 years' follow-up with the ProDisc first-generation implant, a second-generation prosthesis was designed. This study is a prospective analysis of the early results of total disc replacement with the ProDisc II total disc prosthesis. Fifty-three patients had single-level or multilevel disc replacement and were evaluated clinically and radiographically preoperatively and at mean 1.4-year follow-up. There were clinically and statistically significant improvements in back and leg pain Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry disability scores that were maintained at final follow-up. The clinical results of patients with single- and multilevel surgery were equivalent. Satisfactory results were achieved in 90% of patients who had previous lumbar surgery. Complications occurred in 9% of patients and included vertebral body fracture, transient radicular pain, implant malposition, and transient retrograde ejaculation. Three patients (6%) required reoperation to address complications. No mechanical failure of the implants or loosening was observed, and the prostheses retained motion. Randomized, prospective, long-term studies will be necessary to compare the effectiveness of arthrodesis with total disc replacement."

Data were collected preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), and patient satisfaction rates were evaluated at these intervals, as well as range of motion, return to work, and recreational and ambulatory status. There were 28 ProDisc patients and 11 who underwent fusion. Six patients had two-level surgery. Estimated blood loss (ProDisc = 69 mL versus fusion = 175 mL) and operative time (ProDisc = 75 minutes versus fusion = 219 minutes) were significantly different (P < 0.01). Hospital stays were shorter (ProDisc = 2.1 days versus fusion = 3.5 days [P < 0.01]) for ProDisc patients. There was a significantly greater reduction in the ODQ scores at 3 months in the ProDisc group compared with the fusion group (P < 0.05). No difference was noted in VAS. A trend was identified at 6 months in patient satisfaction rates favoring ProDisc versus fusion (P = 0.08), and motion was significantly improved in ProDisc patients compared with the fusion group (P = 0.02). Ambulatory status as well as recreational activity improved faster in the ProDisc group. The data suggest that total disc arthroplasty may be an attractive option as opposed to lumbar fusion for the surgical treatment of disabling mechanical low back pain secondary to lumbar disc disease."

All tests were read independently of each other and the level of confidence in each diagnosis was recorded. The results are based on negative (106) as well as positive (125) findings at the 231 disc sites (level and side) explored. Computed tomography-discography (disco-CT) was the most accurate test (87%) compared to 77% for CT-myelography (myelo-CT), 74% for CT, 70% for myelography, 64% for disc injection pain, and 58% for discography. The false positive rate was lower for disco-CT (19%) than for myelo-CT (24%), CT (24%), and myelography (30%). The false negative rate was also lower for disco-CT (8%) than for myelo-CT (22%), CT (29%), and myelography (30%). Disco-CT was the most accurate test (94%) in patients who had prior disc surgery compared with 81% for myelo-CT, 80% for CT, and 74% for myelography. Disco-CT was also the most accurate test for patients with foraminal HNP (91% compared with 71% for CT, 65% for myelo-CT, and 58% for myelography). Disc injection reproduced the patient's clinical pain pattern in only 36% of herniated discs. This test has high specificity (89%), but low sensitivity (43%). The risks from myelography followed by discography within a 72-hour period are similar to those reported for myelography alone. Disco-CT is the most accurate of these tests (P less than 0.05) for the diagnosis of lumbar HNP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex and cervical motor roots was used to evoke motor action potentials in the biceps brachii and hypothenar muscles. The phasic stretch reflex in the biceps brachii was also recorded to study the excitability of spinal alpha motor neurons. Motor cortex stimulation evoked motor action potentials at low threshold and with abnormally short latencies and prolonged durations. In contrast cervical motor root stimulation resulted in responses of normal latency and duration. The phasic stretch reflex had a low threshold, short latency and prolonged duration. It is concluded that in Rett syndrome the corticospinal pathway is intact. The results suggest disordered synaptic control of the Betz cell of the motor cortex and/or the spinal alpha motor neuron, although the involvement of the latter might be a consequence of dysfunction in supraspinal descending motor pathways."

Rheumatoid polyarthritis is often difficult to distinguish from rhizomelic pseudopolyarthritis, these two diseases resemble each other at this age with the asthenia and loss of general health, the inflammatory pains which are peripheral and of nerve root origin. Among the metabolic arthropathies, articular chondrocalcinosis is frequent, and often latent, but sometimes it is destructive in particular in the hips and knees; septic arthritis today mainly occurs in the elderly, and the algoneurodystrophies are more frequent in old persons than in young subjects, following trauma or a hemiplegia. Arthrosis is obviously the main articular disease of senescence especially involving the joints of the lower limb, hip disease being less incapacitating than knee disease where surgical treatment is less often considered. The arthroses of the upper limbs especially of the shoulder are well tolerated. Osteochondromatosis, osteonecrosis of the internal condyle of the knee, the rapidly destructive arthropathies and hemarthrosis can develop as a complication of a simple arthrosis. In the spine vertebral hyperostosis is especially a disease of the elderly, it can occur alone or with an arthrosis of the posterior vertebral joints, a narrow spinal canal straight or narrowed.

They conducted a retrospective study of 200 cases of patients hospitalised for sciatica who were investigated by lumbar phlebography using selective catheterisation, without any prior neuro-radiological examination. 104 of these cases were operated. The lumbar phlebography was interpretable in 99 p. cent of cases. Severe thrombo-embolic episodes occurred in two cases. In the 104 patients who went to operation, the surgical procedure confirmed the presence of a herniated disc (suspected on phlebography) in 96 p. cent of cases. Topographical agreement between the phlebographic data and the operative findings was observed in 81 p. cent of cases. Phlebography proved to be more reliable at L4-L5 than at L5-S1. In the patients in whom clinical examination and plain X-ray findings provided coherent information as to the site of the herniated disc, phlebography was considered to be of no use.

The purpose of the present study is to describe the MR images of early postoperative MRI at 3 days in 30 unselected patients who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy, and to correlate the findings with follow up MRI at 8 weeks and with final outcome. The findings are correlated with literature data. Early postoperative MRI findings were consisting of pseudohernia in 24 patients (80%), annular rent in 23 patients (80%), and other non-specific postoperative findings. On the late MRI the pseudohernia persisted in 12 patients (50%), the annular rent in 4 patients (15%) and asymptomatic pseudo-spondylodiscitis was apparent in 3 patients (10%) as was a case of true spondylodiscitis. Therefore, early postoperative findings have limited value in the management of patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation, since the images were not correlated with the immediate clinical course after surgery nor with the late radiological and clinical outcome. The evident imaging changes in the early postoperative period after lumbar disc surgery limit the accuracy of the interpretation of MRI examinations."

CR is shown to be increased in men who have had back pain within 24 hours of testing and no difference was found between men who had had back pain in the past and those who denied ever having had back pain. A separate series of 35 post-laminectomy patients examined at least 10 months after operation and who were shown to have disc disease at operation and/or on myelogram were found to have low CR. This work suggests that the changes involved in disc disease are not limited solely to the discs, but may involve collagen/elastic tissue or ground substance elsewhere as for example in this case when detectable in a test on the forearm. Secondly, it is suggested that CR grading could be a helpful discriminating test for 'disc disease' among those presenting with back pain of undetermined diagnosis."

The treatment is most likely to be effective when the patient is male, the duration of symptoms is less than four weeks, and the patient has irritant rather than compressive neuropathy."

CD007431,0,9816715,0,Application of spinal pain mapping in the diagnosis of low back pain--analysis of 104 cases.,Low back pain is probably the most common pain problem seen in a general pain clinic and the cause of low back pain can be enigmatic at times. Often the pain sources are difficult to identify with the conventional diagnostic modalities. Spinal pain mapping is a sequence of well organized nerve block procedures. We undertook this study to evaluate the usefulness of this modality in diagnosing low back pain of uncertain etiology.
CD007431,0,11931066,0,Proinflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with disc herniation and sciatica.,"Proinflammatory cytokines have been identified in herniated intervertebral discs in humans, and such cytokines have experimentally been demonstrated to be important in the pathophysiological mechanisms of disc herniation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta IL-6, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were investigated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in 39 patients with lumbar disc herniation and sciatica. Pain duration and pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) were recorded at inclusion, and a clinical examination was performed evaluating neurological findings. The extent of disc herniation (protrusion or extrusion/sequestration) was evaluated perioperatively. Normal concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were present in CSF and serum in almost all patients with lumbar disc herniation. The concentrations of IL-8 in CSF were increased in 12 out of 39 patients, and these increased levels of IL-8 correlated to a short duration of pain and to more pronounced herniation (extrusion or sequestration). No relationship between IL-8 concentrations in CSF and pain intensity, positive neurological findings or a positive straight leg-raising (SLR) test was found. The observation of increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF in patients with a short duration of symptoms supports the concept of the initial involvement of inflammatory mechanisms after a disc herniation. The finding that most of the patients with increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF had an extrusion or a sequestration may suggest that the increase in IL-8 is related to mechanical nerve root compression, but may also indicate a biochemical effect exerted by the herniated disc on the surrounding tissue. Further studies on the potential role of IL-8 as a biomarker for disc herniation are warranted."

Clinical features, diagnostic procedures, and results of surgical treatment in 68 patients.","Our experience with 68 patients with strictly defined, myelographically proven, surgically confirmed lumbar spinal stenosis seen over a 30-month period was reviewed. Pseudoclaudication was the commonest symptom (94%) and was described by patients as pain (93%), numbness (63%), or weakness (43%). Symptoms were frequently bilateral (68%) and generally relieved by flexing the lumbosacral spine. Neurologic abnormalities were found in a minority of patients and were usually mild. Electromyography showed one or more lumbosacral radiculopathies in 34 of 37 patients examined. Radiographic evidence of degenerative disk or joint disease was found in 63 patients. All patients had stenosis on myelography, with narrowing at L2, L3, and L4 being the commonest; 30% had multi-level stenosis. Two of ten computed tomograms were normal. Surgery was extensive; 72% of patients had three or more laminae removed. At a mean of 4 years after surgery, 84% of patients reported that surgery had yielded good to excellent results."
CD007431,0,11931063,1,Cramp finding: can it be used as a new diagnostic and prognostic factor in lumbar disc surgery?,"In this prospective study, the validity and the importance of a new finding (cramp finding) in the diagnosis and outcome after lumbar disc surgery were tested. The test is performed with the person in prone position. Against a forceful knee flexion, the examiner holds the leg with one hand and applies a force to overcome the knee flexion. The finding is positive if the examined person feels a disturbing cramp in the leg or thigh. The study was performed between October 1997 and December 1999. Besides the cramp finding, the classical disc herniation examination, including mechanical and neurological findings, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging tests, and laboratory findings were checked pre- and postoperatively. The positive cramp finding in the operated group was 72% (n=133) preoperatively and straight leg raising (SLR) test was positive in all of them. Cramp finding was positive in 70%, 52%, 34%, and 8% of patients postoperatively in the first, 3rd, 12th and 24th months, respectively. The presented finding appears to be as valuable as the SLR, and especially contralateral SLR, tests in lumbar disc surgery. Cramp finding is also important in outcome evaluation."
CD007431,0,11931062,0,Diagnostic validity of somatosensory evoked potentials in subgroups of patients with sciatica.,"The diagnostic utility of scalp-recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in patients with sciatica has generally been regarded as low. The purpose of the present study was to determine the validity of sensory nerve SEP in different subgroups of sciatic patients. A total of 65 consecutive patients with sciatica showing disc pathology and/or facet joint hypertrophy on lumbar computed tomography (CT) and/or myelography were studied. Symptomatic myelographically compressed nerve roots were defined as truly compromised roots. Asymptomatic myelographically normal nerve roots were defined as truly normal roots. Bilateral sensory nerve SEP representing nerve roots L4, L5, and S1 were performed in all patients. Evaluation of SEP included the use of P1 latency inter-root comparison. The false-positive rate of SEP was low. Pathological L4, L5, and S1 SEP therefore strongly indicate true compromise of the corresponding nerve roots. The true-positive rate was higher in patients with facet joint hypertrophy with or without additional disc disease than in patients with disc pathology only, and highest if the sciatic sensory symptoms were present during the SEP registration. Diagnostic validity was not influenced by previous episodes of sciatica, the duration of the present episode, or the number of spinal levels with ipsilateral myelographically compressed nerve roots. Pathological SEP strongly indicate sensory radiculopathy in patients with sciatica. Diagnostic efficacy is higher in patients with facet joint hypertrophy than in patients with disc pathology only and highest when the sciatic symptoms are present during registration."
CD007431,0,11931060,0,Microendoscopic lumbar discectomy versus open surgery: an intraoperative EMG study.,"This study investigated electromyographic (EMG) activity as a marker of nerve root irritation during two different surgical procedures for lumbar disc herniation. Mechanically elicited EMG activity was recorded during the dynamic stages of surgery in muscle groups innervated by lumbar nerve roots. Confirmation of surgical activity was correlated with the activity of the electromyogram. Fifteen patients with lumbar disc herniations were treated via an endoscopic medial approach, and 15 patients via the open microscopic surgical technique. Results indicated that the endoscopic technique was superior to the open surgical technique and produced less irritation of the nerve root. Significantly less mechanically elicited activity was recorded during both the approach and the root mobilization. The study showed that microendoscopic discectomy allows a smaller incision and less tissue trauma with comparable visualization of the nerve structures than does open surgery."

CD007431,0,3600973,0,[Value of testing vibration sensation in diagnosing spondylogenic pain syndromes].,"One-hundred patients with cervical vertebral changes, 100 with lumbar vertebral changes and 20 with ankylosing spondylitis were studied carrying out examinations of the sensation of touch, pain and vibration in these dermatomes and sclerotomes which are related to the levels of the most frequently occurring intervertebral disc changes. It was found that disturbances of the vibration sensation occurred significantly more frequently than disturbances of surface sensitivity, and their character suggested that they were a more specific sign of damage to the innervation of the spine than segmental disturbances of superficial sensitivity which are due to root damage."
CD007431,0,11931068,0,Thermal quantitative sensory testing in lumbar disc herniation.,"The most frequent clinical presentation of sciatica suggests injury of sensor root fibers alone. To evaluate whether thermal quantitative sensory testing (QST) is applicable in the study of sensory dysfunction in lumbosacral disc herniations, 36 men and 30 women with L4/5 or L5/S1 disc herniations underwent thermal QST of the L4, L5, and Si dermatomes. For both levels of disc herniation, there was a significant difference for all temperature modalities, i.e., cold, warmth and heat pain, between all dermatomes as well as between the side of the herniated disc and the corresponding asymptomatic side. However, the proportion of herniated discs classified correctly was only 48% in patients with disc herniations at the L4/5 level, while it was 71% at the L5/S1 level. We conclude that thermal QST measurements reflect and document sensory dysfunction in patients with lumbosacral disc herniation. The method offers a new means both to study the time course of a spontaneous recovery of sensory dysfunction and to evaluate the result of different treatment options. However, thermal QST seems to have the same poor predictive value for identifying the anatomic location of a herniated lumbar disc as conventional electrophysiologic methods."

The authors have identified differences of the threshold characteristics in all zones which depended on the severity of damage to the sensory nerves (according to the clinical findings) and the presence or the absence of attendant neurotic manifestations.

CD007431,0,15457335,0,Vrms/T quantitation in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.,"Thirty consecutive patients with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with lumbosacral root injury were evaluated. Electrodiagnostic examinations included determination of root mean square (Vrms)/turns (T) values. Vrms/T values > or =1 are consistent with chronic neurogenic injury and have been correlated with increase in fiber density. Radiographic studies were independently classified as having severe (group I; n= 8), mild (group II; n=11), or no lumbar spinal stenosis (group III; n=11). Abnormal Vrms/T values were present in all 8 patients in group I in comparison to 0/11 in group II and 2/11 in group III (p<0.0001 and 0.0007 respectively in comparison to group I). In 5/8 patients in group I, Vrms/T values provided unique information. Large amplitude motor units were also present more frequently in group I in comparison to the other groups (p<0.02). This study indicates Vrms/T values can be helpful in the electrodiagnostic evaluation of patients with lumbosacral radiculopathies, particularly where chronic multilevel radicular injury might be expected such as in lumbar spinal stenosis."

Such techniques do not enable any clear diagnosis to be made before the 3rd postoperative week. The PMN elastase released from stimulated polymorphonuclear granulocytes has been proved to be a good laboratory parameter by which it is possible to prognosticate bacterial and abacterial organ complications in surgical patients with a high degree of probability. Under investigation were 12 patients with spondylodiscitis out of 1162 operations on herniated lumbar discs. PMN elastase was determined on the 7th postoperative day. In patients with spondylodiscitis and a mean value of 110.5 micrograms/l, the elastase was on average higher by a factor of 2.6 as compared to 88 randomly selected control patients. Since spondylodiscitis is a rare complication, this results in a positive value of only 7%, which does not allow a reliable diagnosis of spondylodiscitis by the elastase assay. But because the negative predictive value is 100%, it is possible to exclude a postoperative spondylodiscitis already on the 7th postoperative day, if the elastase value is normal."

CD007431,0,18340276,0,Yield of the sural/radial ratio versus the medial plantar nerve in sensory neuropathies with a normal sural response.,"The electrodiagnostic yield of the medial plantar nerve action potential (NAP) amplitude versus the sural/radial amplitude ratio (SRAR) was determined in 110 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed distal sensory polyneuropathy (SN) and normal sural responses. Forty-five consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed lumbosacral radiculopathy served as disease controls. Of the 110 SN patients, 32 were classified clinically as SN with large-fiber involvement (SN-LFI), whereas 78 had clinically pure small-fiber SN. Plantar NAP amplitudes were abnormal in 18 of 32 patients (56%) with SN-LFI, and 15 of 78 (19%) with small-fiber SN. A SRAR <0.21 (fifth percentile of normal) was found in 7 of 32 patients (22%) with SN-LFI and 8 of 78 (10%) with small-fiber SN. In the control group, the medial plantar NAP was normal in all 45 subjects (100%), whereas the SRAR was >0.21 in 43 subjects (96%). Thus, for a 50% pretest probability of SN-LFI, the positive predictive value of an abnormal medial plantar was 100% versus 85% for a SRAR <0.21. The medial plantar NAP amplitude is a more useful measure of SN, than is the SRAR, in patients under age 70, with suspected SN-LFI. The yield of the SRAR and plantar NAP amplitude is poor when clinical signs of large-fiber sensory dysfunction are lacking."

CD007431,0,11819133,0,Factors predicting the prognosis of lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation.,"This study was designed to determine the prognostic factors in unilateral lumbar radiculopathy due to herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP); this was done by prospectively investigating the clinical course of consecutive patients with HNP. The study population consisted of 131 patients who complained primarily of unilateral leg pain, and who were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to establish a definite diagnosis. Patients with a questionable diagnosis were excluded. The initial assessment was done within the first 2 months of presentation, according to conventional surgical indications. Surgery was performed only in patients who gave their informed consent for the procedure. Questionnaires were sent to patients twice, in 1994 and 1996, to assess the clinical outcome in those patients who did not meet the surgical indications and in those who met the indications, but who refused surgery. Clinical outcomes were classified into three categories based on the patients' own assessment. Fifty patients met the surgical indication criteria, and 25 were actually operated on. Neither these patients' profiles nor their MRI findings correlated with the results of the initial assessment. Patient age was significantly correlated with outcome only at the time of the first follow-up. The type of HNP and the result of the initial assessment were correlated with outcome at the times of both follow-ups, but the significance of these correlations had decreased at the second follow-up. In conclusion, initial assessment and type of HNP on MRI are major prognostic factors. However, the conventional manner of treatment selection is inadequate for the appropriate management of lumbar disc herniation."
CD007431,0,8476547,0,Segmental v dermatomal somatosensory-evoked potentials. Normal intertrial variation and side-to-side comparison.,"Although segmental and dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials have been used in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy, the unilateral or bilateral normal intertrial variation of these responses has not been investigated. Furthermore, there exists little consensus on how many sequential trials for a single nerve or dermatome are optimal and how to use the data generated from these trials. Without investigation of these basic parameters, determination of what constitutes a normal somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) is difficult. In 29 normal subjects, the ipsilateral intertrial variations, arithmetic mean side-to-side differences and maximum potential side-to-side differences with stimulation of the superficial peroneal sensory nerve, sural nerve and L5 and S1 dermatomes with respect to P1 and N1 latencies and peak-to-peak amplitudes were investigated. Considerable ipsilateral intertrial variation was observed and side-to-side comparisons revealed a further increase in this inherent variation regarding the above measured parameters. The maximum potential side-to-side differences were even more remarkable than the mean side-to-side differences. For these results and others presented, a method of evaluating SEP parameters whereby the arithmetic mean of two sequential trials for both latency and amplitude is presented that attempts to minimize the normal, inherent variation. We also suggest an additional parameter with which to evaluate SEPs: the maximum side-to-side latency difference. Only through the use of a consistent methodology can segmental or dermatomal SEPs be utilized in a reliable diagnostic manner."

ADCON-L European Study Group.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of any correlation between recurrent radicular pain during the first six months following first surgery for herniated lumbar intervertebral disc and the amount of lumbar peridural fibrosis as defined by MR imaging. 197 patients who underwent first-time single-level unilateral discectomy for lumbar disc herniation were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled multicenter clinical trial. Clinical assessments, performed by physicians blinded to patient treatment status, were conducted preoperatively and at one and six months postoperatively. The enhanced MR images of the operative site utilized in the analysis were obtained at six months postoperatively. Radicular pain was recorded by the patient using a validated visual analog pain scale in which 0 = no pain and 10 = excruciating pain. The data obtained at the 6 month time point were analyzed for an association between amount of peridural scars as measured by MR imaging and clinical failure as defined by the recurrence of radicular pain. The results showed that the probability of recurrent pain increases when scar score increases. Patients having extensive peridural scar were 3.2 times more likely to experience recurrent radicular pain than those patients with less extensive peridural scarring. In conclusion, this prospective, controlled, randomized, blinded, multicenter study has demonstrated that there is a significant association between the presence of extensive peridural scar and the occurrence of recurrent radicular pain."
CD007431,0,1030453,0,Shoulder muscle tenderness and physical features of female industrial workers.,"Physique, muscle strength, and jump-step scores of female industrial workers, ages 17--34, were studied in relation to tenderness of shoulder muscles for five groups, (A) character display operators, (B) fluorescent lamp assemblers, (C) photographic film rolling workers, (D) teachers and nurses of handicapped children, and (E) office workers. No significant differences were found between the five groups in mean body height, body weight, and skinfold thickness, but mean knee extension force of groups A and C and mean back muscle strength of groups A, B, and C was significantly lower than that of group E. Workers of groups C and D with a low tenderness threshold of m. trapezius of 0.6 kg/cm2 or less had stiff shoulders more frequently and lower force levels of knee extension, back muscle, and upper arm abduction than those without tenderness. No similar tendency was found for groups B and E. Further, among workers with objective signs of occupational cervicobrachial disorder, there were few whose knee extension force or jump-step scores were above the averages of normal office workers. Shoulder muscles of such operators were revealed to be continuously contracted during operations. The possible effects of chronic fatigue due to repetitive operations on developing localized tenderness and occupational hazards are discussed."

CD007431,0,12592544,0,Predictors of outcome in fusion surgery for chronic low back pain. A report from the Swedish Lumbar Spine Study.,"Despite the continuous development of surgical techniques and implants, a substantial number of patients still undergo surgery for chronic low back pain (CLBP) without any benefit, or even become worse. With the aim of finding predictors of functional and work status outcome, 264 patients with severe CLBP of long duration, randomised to surgical or non-surgical treatment, were characterized by socio-demographic, clinical, radiological and psychological variables. The variables were estimated as predictors of outcome at the 2-year follow-up. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used in both treatment groups. We found that a personality characterized by low neuroticism and low disc height were significant predictors of functional improvement after surgical treatment. Depressive symptoms predicted functional improvement after non-surgical treatment. Work resumption was predicted by low age and short sick leave in the surgical group, and by short sick leave in the non-surgical group. We conclude that improved selection of successful surgical candidates with CLBP seems to be promoted by attention to severe disc degeneration, evaluation of personality traits and shortening of preoperative sick leave."
CD007431,0,12592546,0,Temporary external pedicular fixation versus definitive bony fusion: a prospective comparative study on pain relief and function.,"Temporary external pedicular fixation is used as a prognostic instrument when treating degenerative conditions with spinal fusion. We studied the validity of the method and whether a functional test could improve the prognostic value of such fixation. Twenty-six patients with long-standing lumbar pain had an external temporary fixation. Pain levels were registered before fixation on a visual analogue scale at rest, as a mean for the previous week, and at seven different standardized activities. Walking capacity and walking speed for a standardized distance were also measured. Identical evaluations were then repeated during the external fixation and 1 year after definitive fusion. Based on the outcome of the temporary fixation, 20 patients were recommended for definitive surgical fusion. In six cases, the option of fusion surgery was rejected due to an unfavourable pain response or insufficient pain relief during the test fixation period, and this group was not further followed within the study. One year after surgery, 14 of 20 patients reported a good outcome. Solid bony fusion assessed by conventional radiography was seen in 19 patients. One patient with a poor clinical outcome had a pseudarthrosis. The mean values for pain level at rest, during last week and at the seven different activities in the functional test tended to decrease after fusion compared to the situation with temporary external fixation. In no activity did the external fixator overestimate the mean positive pain-relieving effect after definitive fusion. The walking capacity significantly increased, while the walking speed did not alter at the three different measurements. We conclude that with a good outcome ratio of 14 patients out of 19 having a solid fusion, the external frame improved patient selection and can be used as a valid prognostic instrument. The pain relief and function after definitive fusion can not be quantified by the external fixation, probably due to the fact that the stabilisation with an external frame is partial. The value of the functional test design presented is moderate, and an outcome evaluation comprising pain relief at rest and mean pain level during a week in fixation seems adequate."

CD007431,0,3782560,0,Effects of chemonucleolysis demonstrated by MR imaging.,"In a study designed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients to be treated with chymopapain, 39 patients with a clinicoradiographic picture of herniated lumbar disk were scanned. Twenty-one of these, who were actually treated, were rescanned 3 months following the intradiskal administration of chymopapain. In both pretreatment and posttreatment scans sagittal T1 and T2 weighted spinecho technique was used. Prior to therapy, disks that were later injected demonstrated narrowing of the intervertebral disk space (95% of cases); an extradural defect (86% of cases); diminished signal intensity on the T1 weighted images (50% of cases); and decreased signal intensity on the T2 weighted image when compared with normal controls (100% of cases). Additionally, the adjacent endplates of the injected disk showed increased signal intensity on the T1 weighted image in 32%; 18% of the cases displayed increased signal intensity on the T2 weighted image. Following chymopapain, 100% of injected disks demonstrated decrease in disk height; 36% of the extradural defects diminished in size and 9% increased; 91% of injected disks showed loss of signal intensity on the T1 weighted image; and 86% lost signal in the T2 weighted study with 14% remaining unchanged. Vertebral body endplates adjacent to the level of injection demonstrated a decreased signal intensity on the T1 weighted image in 32% of cases, and 40% demonstrated increased signal in the T2 weighted study. Even though these findings could not be correlated with clinical success or failure using the criteria in this study, six of the original 39 patients were diagnosed as having free disk fragments on the basis of their initial MR scans, a fact that does have management implications for the use of chymopapain in treatment of herniated disk disease."
CD007431,0,4061922,0,Epidural morphine strongly depresses nociceptive flexion reflexes in patients with postoperative pain.,"The comparative effects of low doses (0.03-0.04 mg/kg) of epidural morphine on a nociceptive flexion reflex of the lower limb and on postoperative pain in volunteer patients were studied after orthopedic surgery on one knee. According to the stimulation parameters, it was found that 40-50 min after the injection, morphine produced an increase of 87% and 83% of the reflex threshold and of the threshold of maximal reflex response, respectively, as well as a 80-90% depression of the nociceptive responses when elicited by a constant level of stimulation. Onset of pain relief occurred by the 25th min and increased to a maximum stable level 40-50 min after the injection. These data support the hypothesis that the main site of the pain-relieving effect of epidural morphine is located directly at a spinal level."
CD007431,0,11572192,0,Neurophysiological investigation of cervical spondylosis.,"The difficulties in diagnosing spinal cord lesions due to the cervical spondylosis is well-known in clinical neurology. In order to investigate the contribution of various neurophysiological examinations in the diagnosis in cervical spondylosis, we examined 70 patients suffering from cervical spondylosis, with peripheral nerve conduction studies, F-wave from the upper limb and electromyography from the corresponding muscles, as well as somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) from upper and lower limbs. Patients were separated into four groups: 20 patients had cervical spondylosis symptoms only; 15 patients had symptoms and signs of spinal root involvement; 15 patients had symptoms and signs of myelopathy; and 20 patients had symptoms and signs of both myelopathy and spinal root involvement. A group of 20 normal controls was also studied. In all groups of patients SEPs were the most sensitive electrophysiological study. Low-amplitude N13 and increased conduction time of N9-N13 and central conduction N13-N19 and LP-P27 were the most common finding in SSEP testing. SEPs were affected in many cases without CT-MRI findings of spinal cord pressure. From the above findings, SEPs proved to be the most sensitive diagnostic investigation in cervical spondylosis."
CD007431,0,7645156,0,Urodynamic evaluation of stress incontinence.,"A careful history points the urodynamic examination in the right direction and enables the examiner to ask the correct questions. The individual who does the test is the only reliable interpreter of the results of that study. No urodynamic technique is as sensitive or specific as a blood glucose, or even an electrocardiogram. A history of urgency and urge incontinence suggests uninhibited contractility and is a better index of that condition than a cystometrogram. Leakage occurring shortly after a previous operative procedure for stress incontinence suggests type III stress incontinence. A past history of radiation, prior pelvic surgery, neurologic disease, herniated disc conditions, or prior chemotherapy all require a simple cystometrogram to rule out abnormal bladder compliance. Following a simple history and urodynamic evaluation, a physical examination should be performed, searching for urethra hypermobility and genital prolapse. Abdominal leak-point pressure testing is useful to assign broad categories of incontinence. Relatively high leak-point pressures with hypermobility suggest suspension operations will be effective. Low leak-point pressures with hypermobility often require a sling, and very low leak-point pressures with no hypermobility indicate a suitable candidate for a trial of injection therapy."

CD007431,0,17973128,0,Pain and disability correlated with disc degeneration via magnetic resonance imaging in scoliosis patients.,"Prior imaging studies of scoliosis patients attempted to demonstrate a relationship between plain radiographic curve patterns and curve progression and pain, or used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to focus on spinal cord abnormalities. Pain in scoliosis patients may differ from nondeformity patients, yet may still be discogenic. The purpose of this study was to assess the possible relationship of degenerative disc findings on MRI to scoliosis patients' pain. This prospective study enrolled scoliosis and control patients, all of whom had assessment for back pain (visual analog scale) and disability (Oswestry Index) and spinal MRI to identify prevalence and distribution of degenerative disc findings. Specifically, we assessed 60 consecutive pediatric and adult idiopathic scoliosis patients who had progressed to surgical treatment, 60 age- and gender-matched asymptomatic controls, and 172 nondeformity symptomatic degenerative disc disease patients who had progressed to surgical treatment. All subjects had independent analysis of their preoperative MRI for disc degeneration, disc herniation, Schmorl's nodes, and inflammatory end plate changes. Imaging findings of the scoliosis patients were compared to those from asymptomatic and symptomatic control groups. Our results found that both pediatric and adult scoliosis patients had significantly more pain and disability than did asymptomatic controls (P < 0.001). The adult idiopathic scoliosis patients had pain and disability similar to those of surgical degenerative disc disease control groups. Disc degeneration and herniation (contained) were not related to pain. However, in the pediatric scoliosis patients, those with Schmorl's nodes often had greater pain than those without (P = 0.01). Adults with painful scoliosis, typically occurring at the apex of the scoliosis or at the lumbosacral junction, had a significantly higher frequency of inflammatory end plate changes on MRI than did controls (P < 0.001). Prior studies have demonstrated a correlation of inflammatory end plate changes to lumbar discogenic pain. In conclusions, scoliosis patients who have progressed to surgical intervention, pediatric patients have varying degrees of pain, and those with Schmorl's nodes may be at greater risk for pain. Adult scoliosis patients have multifactorial pain of which one component may be related to degeneration of the lower lumbar discs similar to that in nondeformity patients. Additionally, adult scoliosis patients may have MRI findings consistent with discogenic pain at the apex of their curvature, most commonly at the proximal lumbar levels."
CD007431,0,6410817,0,Myelopathy due to ossification or calcification of the ligamentum flavum: radiologic and histologic evaluations.,"The clinical, radiologic, and histologic features of ossification and calcification of the ligamentum flavum were studied in 18 patients. Ossification (15 patients) usually occurred in the lower thoracic spine in men of various ages, while calcification (three patients) was found exclusively in the cervical region of older women. Histologic examinations of ossification showed mature lamellar bone associated with proliferated cartilage replacing the ligamentum flavum (endochondral ossification). This corresponded well with radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) appearances. In the cases with calcification of the ligamentum flavum, calcification within the degenerated ligamentous fibers was observed on histologic examination, and correlated well with an oval nodular density on radiographs and CT. The two conditions differ in clinical, radiologic, and histologic considerations. Pathomechanisms in the development of these lesions and clinical significance are also discussed."

CD007431,0,9455668,0,Spinal manipulation results in immediate H-reflex changes in patients with unilateral disc herniation.,"The aim of this clinical investigation was to determine whether the abnormal H-reflex complex present in patients with S1 nerve root compression due to lumbosacral disc herniation is improved by single-session lumbar manipulation. Twenty-four patients with unilateral disc herniation at the L5-S1 level underwent spinal H-reflex electro-physiological evaluation. This was carried out before and after single-session lumbar manipulation in the side-lying position. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study were: predominant sciatica, no motor or sphincteric involvement, unilateral disc herniation at the L5-S1 level on CT or MR imaging, age between 20 and 50 years. H-reflex responses were recorded bilaterally from the gastrosoleous muscle following stimulation of tibial sensory fibers in the popliteal fossa. H-reflex amplitude in millivolts (HR-A) and H-reflex latency in milliseconds (HR-L) were measured from the spinal reflex response. Pre- and post-manipulation measurements were compared between the affected side and the healthy side. Statistical evaluation was performed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test (SPSS). Thirteen patients displayed abnormal H-reflex parameters prior to lumbar manipulation, indicating an S1 nerve root lesion. The mean amplitude was found to be significantly lower on the side of disc herniation than on the normal, healthy side (P = 0.0037). Following manipulation, the abnormal HR-A increased significantly on the affected side while the normal HR-A on the healthy side remained unchanged (P = 0.0045). There was a significant difference between latencies on the affected side and those on the healthy side (P = 0.003). Following manipulation there was a trend toward decreased HR-L. However, this trend did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.3877). Eight patients displayed no H-reflex abnormalities before or after manipulation. Their respective HR-A and HR-L values did not change significantly following manipulation. Three additional patients were excluded due to technical difficulties in achieving manipulation or measuring spinal reflex. These observations may lend physiological support for the clinical effects of manipulative therapy in patients with degenerative disc disease."
CD007431,0,15799188,0,Is there a clinical correlate to the histological and radiological evidence of inflammation in trans-ligamentous extruded and sequestered lumbar disc herniaton?,"The pain of lumbar disc herniation is related to direct compression of the nerve root and to the foreign-body inflammatory response to the herniated disc material. In this study, we attempted to identify disc-related inflammation in trans-ligamentous extruded and sequestered lumbar disc herniation using gadolinium-DPTA-enhanced T1-weighted and short-time inversion recovery (STIR) magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed how these results related to each other, and to patients' clinical status, and to immunohistochemistry findings in disc specimens removed at surgery. Forty-one patients with trans-ligamentous extruded or sequestered disc herniation were investigated clinically and radiologically. Twenty-five patients who did not respond to initial medical treatment or who had progressive neurological deficits underwent discectomy. Specimens of disc material removed during surgery were studied immunohistochemically and inflammatory cell types were identified. The other 16 patients showed good response to treatment, and were given further medical therapy and monitored for a mean of 6.3 months of follow-up. All radiological diagnoses in the operated cases were confirmed at surgery. There were no significant differences among the rates of detection of inflammation by contrast MRI, STIR technique, and immunohistochemistry in the surgical treated cases. In the medically treated cases, the frequency of radiological evidence of inflammation on the initial contrast enhanced T1-weighted and STIR images was similar to the frequency observed on the most recent scans done during follow-up. The study showed that the radiological and immunohistochemical evidence of inflammation in these cases does not correspond with patients' clinical pain profiles over time. It also revealed that STIR and contrast T1W are equally reliable for detecting inflammation in trans-ligamentous extruded or sequestered lumbar disc herniation. In future, studies that focus on physical and chemical mechanisms of pain in lumbar disc herniation in larger series of conservatively and surgically treated patients may clarify the link between inflammation and radicular pain in these types of disc herniation."

They were evaluated according to a protocol and treated with corticosteroid and praziquantel. The disease, in general, presented as a lower cord syndrome of acute progression characterized by motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunctions. The severity of the clinical picture was different among the patients, but the symptoms were quite constant. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an inflammatory pattern with or without eosinophils and/or IgG against schistosomal antigens. The most frequent alterations detected by imaging methods were enlargement of the medullary cone and of the roots of the cauda equina. Schistosome egg counts suggested a low parasite burden in 71.6% of the cases.

CD007431,0,10992311,0,Sensitivity and specificity of dural sac and herniated disc dimensions in patients with low back-related leg pain.,"Narrow spinal canals or herniated discs can be associated with leg pain. However, it is not known whether quantitative measurements of the spinal canal or herniated disc are sensitive and specific for low back-related leg pain. The size and cross-sectional area of the dural sac and any herniated discs were measured from magnetic resonance imaging examinations of 22 asymptomatic individuals and 44 patients with sciatica. The sensitivity and specificity of these measurements were determined. In this small population of patients, a dural sac anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 10.2 mm at the L3-4, L4-5, or L5-S1 vertebral levels was 74% sensitive and 74% specific for leg pain. Based on measurements in symptomatic patients, a herniated disc with an AP diameter of approximately 3 mm was over 95% sensitive and 95% specific. However, if the AP diameters of herniated discs in symptomatic patients were compared with similar measurements in asymptomatic controls, the most sensitive and specific threshold value was 6.8 mm. These findings must be confirmed in a larger population before they are applied clinically. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2000;12:439-443."

A history of sciatica was reported by 8%, lumbago by 13%, back injury by 13% and low back insufficiency by 63%. Weak trunk extensors were associated with a history of sciatica, weak trunk flexors with back injuries and with current backache at work/exercise. Weak leg extensors showed associations with a history of low back insufficiency and of sick leave due to the back and with current hip pain. Men with a history of lumbago and of hip and knee complaints performed poorly during 12 min of running. Back and leg complaints were more frequent in men with high socio-economic status, who engaged in little physical activity, or who were obese.

All had had previous surgery for disc herniation, and the diagnosis of epiduro-arachnoiditis was confirmed at repeat surgery. Massive epidural scarring with no coexistent pathologic condition was found in every patient, and adhesive arachnoiditis was noted in three. The common clinical presentation consisted of low-back pain and sciatica, and radicular pain was usually a continuation or a recurrence of the preoperative sciatic pain. Neurologic deficits were mild, and no patients with the classic picture of adhesive arachnoiditis were found. Myelographic patterns did not disclose any correlation with the clinical symptoms. Five myelograms were normal, while six others simulated a recurrent disc herniation. The results of scar excision were good in 13 patients, fair in eight, and a failure in 17."

CD007431,0,10708995,0,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy of the Knee.,"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) of the knee frequently does not present with the classic combination of signs and symptoms seen in the upper extremity. Pain out of proportion to the initial injury is the hallmark symptom. Symptom relief by sympathetic block is the current standard for confirmation of the diagnosis. Because invasive diagnostic procedures, such as arthroscopy, are likely to increase symptoms, evaluation with a noninvasive diagnostic modality, such as magnetic resonance imaging, is preferred. Generally, RSD should be treated before surgical intervention to correct any underlying intra-articular pathologic condition. However, surgery may sometimes be necessary before RSD symptoms resolve; in these cases, use of intra- and postoperative continuous epidural block can be successful. The initial treatment of RSD of short duration should be conservative; physical therapy modalities, including exercise and contrast baths, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are indicated. In the authors' experience, an indwelling epidural block using bupivacaine for several days followed by use of a narcotic agent, combined with functional rehabilitation, is the most effective management when noninvasive treatment has failed. Surgical sympathectomy can be successful, but should be reserved until repeated lumbar sympathetic block or more than one trial of inpatient epidural block has failed. Early diagnosis and early institution of treatment (prior to 6 months) are the most favorable prognostic indicators in the management of RSD."

CD007431,0,1915902,0,Isolated iliac aneurysms.,"Isolated iliac aneurysms are relatively infrequent, often difficult to detect and therefore rarely considered in the differential diagnosis. Because of their close anatomical relationship to the ureters, bladder, colon, pelvic veins, femoral and sciatic nerve roots one is often misled. The consequences can be grave; chronic ureteric obstruction for instance can cause damage to one or both kidneys. With the growing frequency of tube grafting for aortic aneurysms it becomes increasingly important to consider the prevalence and incidence of isolated iliac aneurysms. The aim of this study is to report the incidence, clinical course and outcome of these lesions. In a consecutive series of 678 aorto-iliac aneurysms in the years 1972-1988 there were 53 isolated iliac aneurysms (7%) ranging in size from 3.5-14 cm whereas the reported incidence in the literature lies between 1-2%; the prevalence in consecutive autopsy series is even less than 1%. CT scanning proved to be the gold standard for the evaluation of pelvic aneurysmal disease whilst angiograms were of little help. A palpable mass was present in nine cases; GI-tract signs in 12 (five patients being operated on for suspicion of appendicitis or sigmoiditis), the genito-urinary tract was involved in eight cases, sciatic or femoral root nerve compression occurred in seven, recurrent pulmonary embolism in two, lower extremity ischaemia in seven and a-v fistula in one. The male:female ratio was 51:2 and that of ruptured to non-ruptured aneurysms 15:38. The site of isolated iliac aneurysms was the common and/or the internal iliac artery uni- or bilaterally.

CD007431,0,11803753,0,[Surgical method in treatment of total kyphosis in ankylosing spondylitis].,"In spite of extensive, conservative methods for treating spondylitis, more or less distinct kyphotic deformities are common. Pain usually plays a minor role as an indication for surgery either as local instability or as impairment of the large hip or knee joints. Much more common are the loss of social contact and the lack of visual contact with the surroundings, both of which the patients find unacceptable. The monosegmental, lumbar correction method as used at an early stage implicated a high rate of complications. The implant supported methods, and in particular those that allow the potential for dorsal transpediculated fixation, allowed, in the early 1980s, dorsal lordotic measures in the form of a multilocus method and, in the mid-1980s, a modified monosegmentary method as well. Both of these methods are widely accepted because of their good long-term results. The possible complications no longer include the disturbance of the spinal cord but are rather to be found in the poor general condition of the patient. The restoration of a largely normal equilibrium of the backbone relieves the musculature and is therefore a definitive pain therapy for muscle tension problems. Straightening the backbone also relieves the hip joints and therefore it is possible in many cases to delay the implantation of a hip prosthesis."
CD007431,0,16623937,0,A clinical genetic method to identify mechanisms by which pain causes depression and anxiety.,"Pain patients are often depressed and anxious, and benefit less from psychotropic drugs than pain-free patients. We hypothesize that this partial resistance is due to the unique neurochemical contribution to mood by afferent pain projections through the spino-parabrachial-hypothalamic-amygdalar systems and their projections to other mood-mediating systems. New psychotropic drugs for pain patients might target molecules in such brain systems. We propose a method to prioritize molecular targets by studying polymorphic genes in cohorts of patients undergoing surgical procedures associated with a variable pain relief response. We seek molecules that show a significant statistical interaction between (1) the amount of surgical pain relief, and (2) the alleles of the gene, on depression and anxiety during the first postoperative year."

The level specific incidence of extreme lateral disc herniation (ELLDH) ranged from a low of 4.5% at L4-5 to peak of 17.4% at L3-4 although the largest number of ELLDH occurred at L4-5 and L5-S1 for a total number of 139 cases (78.1%). 43.6% of all L3 radiculopathies were caused by an L3-4 ELLDH, whereas only 4.4% of all L5 radiculopathies were caused by an L5-S1 ELLDH. Leg pain, either of the sciatic or the femoral type, was the first and dominant clinical symptom of radiculopathy, but pain radiation occurred not always in the appropriate dermatomal segment. ELLDH at upper levels (L2-3 and L3-4) caused usually none or only minor low back signs (76.2%), whereas ELLDH at lower levels more often caused moderate or major lumbar symptoms and signs (59.6%). Positive femoral nerve traction test with upper ELLDH showed a high frequency (84.4%) and reliability and is therefore an important clinical parameter in this situation. Motor deficits occurred more often (78.8%) than sensory deficits (46.6%), were usually of the monoradicular type and were therefore a more reliable clinical sign than sensory disturbances."

CD007431,0,17918502,0,Influence of trunk muscle co-contraction on spinal curvature during sitting for desk work.,"Nowadays, a lot of office workers are forced to sit at a desk for many hours while doing their jobs. While sitting, the pelvis rotates backwardly, and lumbar lordosis is flattened. At the same time, the load on the intervertebral discs and spine increases. Sitting in a slumped position is known to increase disc pressure even more, and to aggravate chronic low back pain (CLBP). Therefore, it is very important to teach workers about the correct sitting posture. In addition, it has been recognized that co-contraction of the deep spine-stabilizing muscles enhances lumbar segmental stability and the sacro-iliac joint. However, little is known about the influence of co-contraction of the trunk deep muscles on spinal curvature during sitting for while doing desk work. The purpose of this study was to compare EMG (electromyographic) activity of the trunk muscles during slump sitting with that during co-contraction of the trunk muscles and to investigate how this co-contraction influences spinal curvature. Ten healthy male volunteers (21.7 +/- 2.5 years old) without CLBP participated in the study. Bipolar surface electrodes were attached to the rectus abdominis, the obliquus externus abdominis, the obliquus internus abdominis, the lower back extensor muscles (L3) and the multifidus on the right side. EMG signals were continuously recorded during slump sitting and co-contraction of the trunk muscles, simulating a desk work sitting posture; i.e., slightly inclined forward. They were amplified, band-pass filtered, digitized and stored by a data acquisition system. The average muscle activity values over the five-second sample for each sitting posture were normalized to maximal voluntary contractions (%MVC). While the subjects performed both sitting postures, the curvature of the spine was measured using a new skin-surface and hand-held device, the ""Spinal Mouse"". More significant activities of the trunk muscles, with the exception of the rectus abdominis, were observed during co-contraction of the trunk muscles than during slump sitting The co-contraction of the trunk muscles resulted in significantly less lumbar curvature and more sacral angle than during slump sitting. The thoracic curvature showed no significant change during either sitting posture. The results of this study indicated that co-contraction of the trunk muscles during sitting while doing desk work could bring about the correct lumbar curvature, and effectively stabilize the lumbopelvic region, and decrease focal stress on passive structures."

The response to damage is characterized by increased collagen metabolism, which can be monitored by the serum markers PICP for type I synthesis and CTx for type I collagen degradation. In a cohort of 67 patients who underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation, PICP and CTx were measured and ratings were made of back pain, leg pain, and functional disability, before and after the operation. In the 6 weeks following surgery, concentrations of PICP increased, concentrations of CTx decreased, and the ratio between PICP and CTx increased. Back pain and functional disability improved, but the scores were not significantly associated with the marker concentrations. The changes in serum markers most likely reflect tissue healing. However, these markers are not yet ready for clinical use."

CD007431,0,8184352,0,Manual therapy with steroid injections--a new approach to treatment of low back pain. A controlled multicenter trial with an evaluation by orthopedic surgeons.,"Fifty-three acute or subacute patients with low back pain were given standardized but optimized activating conventional treatment by primary health care teams. Forty-eight patients received an experimental treatment that included specific manual treatment, such as manipulation and specific mobilization, muscle stretching, auto-traction, and cortisone injections. After 4 months, the experimental group had a less restricted range of movement in extension, less restricted side-bending to the right and to the left, less local pain caused by extension and side-bending to the right, less pain radiating to the right leg caused by side-bending to the left, and a less positive straight leg raising test (both sides) than the conventionally treated group. Manual treatment was superior to the conventional activating treatment in normalizing pathologic findings on physical examination of the lower back. These results agree with the positive influence on pain, drug consumption, sick-leave, disability rating, and quality of life reported in other reports from the same study."

CD007431,0,224837,0,Electromyographic value of the tibialis posterior muscle.,"Differentiation between peroneal palsy and L5 radiculopathy poses a diagnostic challenge. However, clinical weakness of the tibialis posterior muscle indicates that the involvement must lie outside the peroneal territory, potentially at a radicular level. Electromyographically this muscle should provide similar information but it has been relatively ignored, possibly for reasons of presumed inaccessibility. A retrospective study was undertaken to delineate the potential electrical discriminatory value of this muscle. Patients selected were those with clinical evidence of lower extremity neurogenic dysfunction in whom needle electrode examination had been performed on the tibialis posterior as well as other posterior and anterior compartment musculature. The parameters measured were the presence of abnormal spontaneous activity suggestive of denervation plus neurogenic motor unit alterations. Abnormalities were detected in the tibialis posterior which were reflected equally in the anterior but not posterior compartment muscles, indicating a shared L5 radicular innervation. Thus this muscle represents a useful source of electrical information assisting in the differentiation between peroneal and radicular dysfunction."
CD007431,0,2998699,0,Recognition of lumbar disc disease with magnetic resonance imaging.,"Ten normal adult volunteers, 75 patients with low back pain and/or lumbar radiculopathy, 16 patients following chymopapain treatment, 14 patients with recurrent symptoms following disc surgery, and two patients with distal cord compression were scanned on Fonar 3000 permanent magnet scanner. Of all the patients 98 had additional computed tomography scans (CT) of the lumbar spine and 82 had myelography. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scans were both diagnostic in cases of herniated and extruded discs. MRI scan showed more information concerning the degenerative state of the intervertebral discs. It was relatively more accurate in detecting, small bulging and herniated discs without ruptured anulus and the relation of the migrated fragments of extruded discs to both the back of the vertebrae and the thecal sac. Moreover, lumbar MRI matched the clinical response of disc disease to chymopapain treatment more than lumbar CT scan. In addition, the MRI studies differentiated more accurately postoperative epidural fibrotic changes from recurrent herniated and/or extruded disc and detected distal spinal cord abnormalities. CT scan easily detected laterally herniated lumbar discs. Myelography was the diagnostic study in cases of arachnoiditis."

CD007431,0,14673717,0,Comparison of instrumented anterior interbody fusion with instrumented circumferential lumbar fusion.,"Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) restores disc height, the load bearing ability of anterior ligaments and muscles, root canal dimensions, and spinal balance. It immobilizes the painful degenerate spinal segment and decompresses the nerve roots. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) does the same, but could have complications of graft extrusion, compression and instability contributing to pseudarthrosis in the absence of instrumentation. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the outcome of instrumented circumferential fusion through a posterior approach [PLIF and posterolateral fusion (PLF)] with instrumented ALIF using the Hartshill horseshoe cage, for comparable degrees of internal disc disruption and clinical disability. It was designed as a prospective study, comparing the outcome of two methods of instrumented interbody fusion for internal disc disruption. Between April 1994 and June 1998, the senior author (N.R.B.) performed 39 instrumented ALIF procedures and 35 instrumented circumferential fusion with PLIF procedures. The second author, an independent assessor (S.M.), performed the entire review. Preoperative radiographic assessment included plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and provocative discography in all the patients. The outcome in the two groups was compared in terms of radiological improvement and clinical improvement, measured on the basis of improvement of back pain and work capacity. Preoperatively, patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire giving their demographic details, maximum walking distance and current employment status in order to establish the comparability of the two groups. Patient assessment was with the Oswestry Disability Index, quality of life questionnaire (subjective), pain drawing, visual analogue scale, disability benefit, compensation status, and psychological profile. The results of the study showed a satisfactory outcome (score< or =30) on the subjective (quality of life questionnaire) score of 71.8% (28 patients) in the ALIF group and 74.3% (26 patients) in the PLIF group (P>0.05). On categorising Oswestry Index scores into ""excellent"", ""better"", ""same"", and ""worse"", we found no difference in outcome between the two groups: 79.5% (n=31) had satisfactory outcome with ALIF and 80% (n=28) had satisfactory outcome with PLIF. The rate of return to work was no different in the two groups. On radiological assessment, we found two nonunions in the circumferential fusion (PLIF) group (94.3% fusion rate) and indirect evidence of no nonunions in the ALIF group. There was no significant difference between the compensation rate and disability benefit rate between the two groups. There were three complications in ALIF group and four in the PLIF (circumferential) group. On the basis of these results, we conclude that it is possible to treat discogenic back pain by anterior interbody fusion with Hartshill horseshoe cage or with circumferential fusion using instrumented PLIF."

CD007431,0,8963999,0,Posterior limbus vertebral lesions causing lumbosacral radiculopathy and the cauda equina syndrome.,"This report reviews our experience with spinal decompression for posterior limbus vertebral lesions or osteocartilaginous vertebral corner defects in the lumbar spine in 29 children and young adults. There were 19 male and 10 female patients with a mean age of 16.5 years (range, 9 to 24 years). Twenty-four patients were involved with various athletic activities. Clinical presentation included low back pain with a variable degree of radiculopathy in 25 patients and a cauda equina syndrome in four. The level of the affected spinal area was L1-2 in one patient, L2-3 in one, L3-4 in seven, L4-5 in 17, and L5-S1 in three. The preoperative imaging workup showed lateralised ""non-calcified' or 'calcified' limbus vertebral defects in 13 patients and centrally displaced lesions in 16 patients. All patients underwent posterior spinal decompression with a slightly extended laminotomy, except for three patients who had a subsequent posterolateral fusion. All of the patients consequently returned to practice their favourite preoperative sport and lifestyle, but five discontinued their previous sports. We suggest that patients with posterior limbus vertebral lesions require careful diagnosis and therapy that are different from those with an ordinary lumbar disc herniation."
CD007431,0,2521316,0,Percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy. An alternative to laminectomy in the treatment of backache and sciatica.,"The evacuation and decompression of the herniated lumbar disc (HLD) through a sheath or cannula inserted dorsolaterally represent a new concept in the treatment of backache and sciatica associated with disc herniation. Under local anesthetic and Valium (Roche, Nutley, New Jersey) sedation, 20 patients with sciatica, restricted straight-leg raising, and neurological impairment were treated by this simple and safe technique. All patients had computed tomographic evidence of L4-L5 protrusion. The introduction of a sheath with an internal diameter of 4.9 mm permitted removal of the nuclear material by means of a small pituitary forcep. Using the self-assessment method of Coventry and Stauffer, it was concluded that 12 of the 20 patients had a good or fair result. Predictably, the compensation patients fared poorly. There were no complications. This technique appears applicable in HLD to properly selected patients, and it would seem that it is safe, effective, and cost efficient."
CD007431,0,2940266,0,Self-report of depressive symptoms in low back pain patients.,"Two studies designed to examine the self-report of depressive symptoms in low back pain patients are presented. Symptoms of depression were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory. In the first study, a sample (N = 134) of patients who presented for neurosurgical evaluation were evaluated. In the second study, a subgroup of patients found to have lumbar disc protrusion were compared to a subgroup with few or no positive physical findings at the time of physical examination. If the cut-off scores recommended by Beck were used, patients in both studies would be classified as mildly depressed. Both studies found that patients were significantly more likely to report somatic than cognitive symptoms of depression. Patients with multiple physical findings or a disc abnormality at the time of operation were not found to be more likely to report somatic symptoms than patients with few physical findings."
CD007431,0,3778262,0,"Short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials from radial, median, ulnar, and peroneal nerve stimulation in the assessment of cervical spondylosis. Comparison with conventional electromyography.","A study of data on 30 patients with cervical spondylosis was carried out to determine whether short-latency somatosensory-evoked responses (SEPs) to median, ulnar, radial, and peroneal nerve stimulation provided additional information to that obtained by electromyography (EMG), late responses, and peripheral conduction studies. Peripheral studies, EMG results and SEPs were within normal limits in ten patients with pain, but without objective neurological deficit. By contrast, of ten patients who had objective signs of root compression, conventional EMG results were normal in nine, but abnormalities of the SEPs from radial nerve stimulation were obtained in only five patients, and were normal from ulnar and median nerve stimulation. In ten patients with clinical features of myelopathy, seven had abnormal median SEPs and all had abnormal peroneal SEPs, whereas EMG results were abnormal in only five patients. It is suggested that SEPs and EMG are both of limited use in patients with only symptoms of root compression. In patients with signs of root compression, EMG is the most sensitive procedure; however, some additional information can be obtained from superficial radial SEPs. In patients with cervical myelopathy, SEP was the most useful procedure, especially when upper and lower limbs were studied."
CD007431,0,10794114,0,Effect of acupuncture on pain management in patients before and after lumbar disc protrusion surgery--a randomized control study.,"Management of acute and chronic low back and leg pain often includes the use of acupuncture. The effectiveness of this form of therapy is dependent upon compliance, which in turn is dependent on availability, response, treatment of proper acupoints, and the placebo effect. We hypothesized that classical acupuncture would be more effective than placebo acupuncture. One hundred and thirty-two patients with acute and chronic low back and leg pain were examined before and after surgery for lumbar disc protrusion. Diagnosis was based on CT and MRT findings. Patients received acupuncture drug-free throughout the study period. The visual analogue scale was used to assess pain intensity before and after (i.e. 30 min. 60 min. 2 h and 6 h) acupuncture. Classical acupuncture resulted in a significant reduction in pain that become increasingly stronger during the 6h study period. Placebo acupuncture lead to same early pain relief that did not reach statistic significant and then declined thereafter."

But although preliminary open-label studies demonstrated promising results for the treatment of low back pain with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, early optimism has been tainted by a controlled study showing no significant benefit in sciatica. To determine whether outcomes might be improved by a more direct route of administration, the authors evaluated escalating doses of intradiscal etanercept in 36 patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy or discogenic low back pain."

CD007431,0,2139310,0,Herniated lumbar intervertebral disk.,"Low back pain is common, but a herniated intervertebral disk is the cause in only a small percentage of cases. Most symptomatic disk herniations result in clinical manifestations (pain, reflex loss, muscle weakness) that resolve with conservative therapy, and only 5% to 10% of patients require surgery. Sciatica is usually the first clue to disk herniation, but sciatica may be mimicked by other disorders that cause radiating pain. Because more than 95% of lumbar disk herniations occur at the L4-5 or L5-S1 levels, the physical examination should focus on abnormalities of the L5 and S1 nerve roots. Plain radiography is not useful in diagnosing disk herniation, but more sophisticated imaging (myelography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) should generally be delayed until a patient is clearly a surgical candidate. Conservative therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, brief bed rest (often for less than 1 week), early progressive ambulation, and reassurance about a favorable prognosis. Muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics have a limited role, and their use should be strictly time-limited. Conventional traction and corsets are probably ineffective. Except for patients with the cauda equina syndrome, surgery is generally appropriate only when there is a combination of definite disk herniation shown by imaging, a corresponding syndrome of sciatic pain, a corresponding neurologic deficit, and a failure to respond to 6 weeks of conservative therapy."

CD007431,0,8306918,0,"Action potential patterns of intrafusal gamma and parasympathetic motoneurons, secondary muscle spindle afferents and an oscillatory firing alpha 2-motoneuron, and the phase relations among them in humans.","1. Single-fibre action potentials (APs) were recorded from a S4 root of a brain-dead human and a patient with a spinal cord lesion, with 2 pairs of wire electrodes, and distribution histograms of conduction velocity frequencies were constructed. By plotting the intrafusal velocity main gamma peak on a logarithmic scale, the peak splitted into one dynamic ad two static gamma-peaks and an additional peak of parasympathetic fibres. 2. Apart from the doublet firing, a single gamma 1 (dynamic) and a single gamma 21-motoneuron (static) fired with shortest interspike intervals of 80 msec, similarly as a simultaneously firing secondary spindle afferent fibre; with 13 msec the doublet interspike interval of the gamma 1-motoneuron was very similar to that of the spindle afferent fibre. The intrafusal motoneurons fired with patterns very similar to those of secondary spindle afferents, and they did not fire in the oscillatory mode for high activations as alpha 2 and alpha 3-motoneurons do. 3. The stability of the oscillatory firing of a sphincteric alpha 2-motoneuron increased with the increasing phases of approx. 50 msec between the APs of the gamma-motoneurons and the impulse train of the motoneuron following bladder catheter pulling. Moreover, in a certain phase range the number of phases between the APs of a gamma 1-motoneuron and a secondary spindle afferent fibre increased upon stimulation and, as shown earlier, also the number of phase correlations between the APs of some secondary spindle afferents and the impulse train of the oscillatory firing alpha 2-motoneuron increased. Phase relations between the APs of two spindle afferents also increased upon the bladder catheter pulling. During the oscillatory firing of the alpha 2-motoneuron a phase loop seemed to exist from the APs of the alpha 2-motoneuron to the APs of certain gamma-motoneurons, to the APs of certain secondary spindle afferent fibres and back to the APs of the alpha 2-motoneuron, in similarity to the phase recoupling of electronic oscillators. 4. Single gamma-motoneurons changed their activity levels rhythmically, similarly as the secondary spindle afferents, often with a frequency of 0.3 Hz. Parasympathetic intrafusal motoneurons fired at a constant activity level for about 10 sec, and activated up to 6 single encoding sites of a parent secondary spindle afferent fibre. Shortly after the recruitment of a new encoding site, the interspike intervals of the parent fibre were similar again.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,8306916,0,Impulse patterns of single encoding sites of human secondary muscle spindle afferents.,"1. By recording single-fibre action potentials (APs) from human sacral nerve roots, the impulse patterns of 6 secondary spindle afferents could be identified, analysed and compared with the impulse trains of oscillatory firing alpha 2-motoneurons. 2. Secondary spindle afferents fired with single APs, doublets, bursts and equidistant APs. On the assumption that the most simple firing pattern of a single fibre with a shortest interspike interval (II) of 80 msec was generated by a single encoding site, the firing patterns of the other afferents could be splitted into firing patterns of single encoding sites with similar II distributions and also with a shortest II of about 80 msec. 3. Successive IIs also reflected the different ways of firing of the secondary muscle spindle afferents. A fibre from a paraplegic with bladder dyssynergia seemed to show a higher activity than a comparable probably normal fibre. The doublet IIs of two secondary spindle afferents ranged from about 9 to 14 msec with peaks at 10.2, 11.2 and 13 msec in the distributions. Multiple encoder sites increased discharge rates of parent fibres, but did not always regularize the output discharge. 4. The simultaneously plotted impulse patterns of 4 secondary spindle afferents showed coordinated firing: they did not fire simultaneously but regularized the summed activity. A phase of 50 msec (range 30 to 70 msec) often occurred between the spindle afferent APs and the impulse trains of an oscillatory firing alpha 2-motoneuron. An afferent drive of the oscillator with a certain phase is likely."

The protocol was found feasible in the occupational health service setting. The interexaminer repeatability between an occupational physician and an occupational physiotherapist was good for most items. The predictive validity of different symptoms and signs was investigated with regard to future sick leaves due to low back disorders. Relief of pain when lying, severe trouble at work caused by pain, continuous pain, and pain in the leg or numbness or diminished sensitivity in the foot predicted sick leaves. Of physical signs, pain in the low back or buttock during lateral flexion and a side difference > or = 20 degrees in the straight-leg-raising angle were predictors for sick leaves. The predictive validity of the protocol items should be tested in another patient population before conclusions can be drawn concerning the external validity of our results."
CD007431,0,10877482,0,Effect of foot movement and an elastic lumbar back support on spinal loading during free-dynamic symmetric and asymmetric lifting exertions.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an elastic lumbar back support on spinal loading and trunk, hip and knee kinematics while allowing subjects to move their feet during lifting exertions. Predicted spinal forces and moments about the L5/S1 intervertebral disc from a three-dimensional EMG-assisted biomechanical model, trunk position, velocities and accelerations, and hip and knee angles were evaluated as a function of wearing an elastic lumbar back support, while lifting two different box weights (13.6 and 22.7 kg) from two different heights (knee and 10 cm above knee height), and from two different asymmetries at the start of the lift (sagittally symmetric and 60 degrees asymmetry). Subjects were allowed to lift using any lifting style they preferred, and were allowed to move their feet during the lifting exertion. Wearing a lumbar back support resulted in no significant differences for any measure of spinal loading as compared with the no-back support condition. However, wearing a lumbar back support resulted in a modest but significant decrease in the maximum sagittal flexion angle (36.5 to 32.7 degrees), as well as reduction in the sagittal trunk extension velocity (47.2 to 40.2 degrees s(-1)). Thus, the use of the elastic lumbar back support provided no protective effect regarding spinal loading when individuals were allowed to move their feet during a lifting exertion."

CD007431,0,10534590,0,Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation: an alternative to TENS in the management of sciatica.,"Sciatica is a common pain problem and current pharmacologic therapies have proven inadequate for many patients. The objective of this sham-controlled investigation was to compare a novel non-pharmacologic technique, percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS), to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in the management of the radicular pain associated with sciatica. Sixty-four consenting patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation were treated with PENS, TENS and sham-PENS according to a randomized, single-blinded, cross-over study. All patients had been maintained on a stable oral non-opioid analgesic regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to entering the study. Each treatment modality was administered for a period of 30 min three times per week for 3 weeks, with 1 week 'off' between each modality. Both PENS and TENS treatments were administered using a stimulation frequency of 4 Hz. The pre-treatment assessment included the health status survey short form (SF-36), as well as visual analog scales (VAS) for radicular pain, physical activity and quality of sleep. The pain VAS was also repeated after each treatment session. At the end of each 3-week treatment block, the SF-36 was repeated. After receiving all three treatment modalities, a global assessment questionnaire was completed. Both PENS (42%) and TENS (23%) were significantly more effective than the sham (8%) treatments in decreasing VAS pain scores. The daily oral analgesic requirements were also significantly reduced compared to the pre-treatment values with PENS (P<0.01) and TENS (P<0.05). However, PENS was significantly more effective than TENS (and sham-PENS) in improving physical activity and quality of sleep. The SF-36 evaluation confirmed the superiority of PENS (versus TENS and sham-PENS) with respect to post-treatment functionality. In the overall assessment, 73% of the patients reported that PENS was the most desirable modality (versus 21% for TENS and 6% for sham-PENS). Finally, 71% of the patients stated that they would be willing to pay extra to receive PENS therapy compared to 22% and 3% for TENS and sham-PENS, respectively. In this sham-controlled study, we concluded that PENS was more effective than TENS when administered at a stimulation frequency of 4 Hz in providing short-term pain relief and improved functionality in patients with sciatica."

CD007431,0,9448651,0,Spinal reflex pattern to foot nociceptive stimulation in standing humans.,"Ipsi- and contralateral patterns of lower limb nociceptive reflex responses were studied in 6 normal subjects in free standing position. Once the position was stabilized, only ankle extensor muscles showed consistent tonic activity while ankle flexors and knee extensors and flexors were virtually silent. Reflex responses, elicited by painful electrical stimuli to the skin of the plantar and dorsal aspect of the foot, were recorded from ipsi- and contralateral quadriceps (Q), biceps femoris (Bic), tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (Sol) muscles. Plantar foot stimulation evoked a large excitatory response in the ipsilateral TA at about 80 ms and a smaller responses in Bic and Q at 70 ms and 110 ms, respectively. Ipsilateral excitatory effects after dorsal foot stimulation consisted of a Bic response at about 75 ms. In addition to excitatory effects, both plantar and dorsal foot stimulation evoked long-lasting suppression of ipsilateral Sol background activity starting at about 60 ms. Contralaterally, the only nociceptive effects after plantar or dorsal foot stimulation were a small excitatory response of Sol at about 85 ms. Evidence is provided that only excitatory responses were contingent upon nociceptive volley. The main mechanical effects seen after plantar stimulation were dorsiflexion of the foot without loss of heel contact with the floor; no withdrawal response of the foot followed nociceptive dorsal stimulation. Our main conclusion is that only reflex nociceptive responses serving to avoid the stimulus without conflicting with limb support function are expressed. The mechanisms reconciling nociceptive action and postural function of the lower limbs are discussed."
CD007431,0,8938612,0,Lumbar disc degeneration and sagittal flexibility.,"It is uncertain whether intervertebral disc degeneration is associated with reduced or increased flexibility, although lumbar flexibility is known to reduce with advancing age. This cross-sectional study of 214 middle-aged men attempted to determine the influence on lumbar sagittal flexibility from intervertebral disc degeneration parameters measured from magnetic resonance images (disc height, signal intensity, bulging, osteophytes). Multivariate analyses showed that a reduced extent of lumbar flexibility could be accounted for by the combined effect of decreasing disc height together with increasing age, weight, and back pain frequency. Although it remains possible that single degenerate discs will display increased mobility, the presence of discs at various stages of degeneration results in a net reduction of flexibility. The factors studied here explained only 31% of the variance in flexibility; the major determinants remain to be identified and quantified."

The sample studied included 220 persons (participation frequency 86%) between the ages of 16-65 who had either acutely declared themselves unable to work because of low back pain (acute patients, n = 50) or who had been ill because of low back pain for one month (subacute patients, n = 50) or for three months (chronic patients, n = 70). A control group (n = 50) consisting of persons who had not been absent at all from work the last year was also included. Information regarding the participants' socio-economic situation, previous and present illnesses, further sick-listing during the one year follow-up period and the duration of absenteeism was obtained from the records of the Department of Health Insurance. The median age for men (68%) in the four different groups was 46, 46, 46 and 48.5, respectively. The corresponding figures for women were 50, 33, 33 and 49 years. Twenty percent were of foreign extraction. The proportion of foreigners in the group of non-participants (n=33) was higher (39%) and in this group there was a significantly greater frequency of previous episodes of ill health of short duration (less than or equal to 7 days + no certificate of ill health). Despite a careful clinical examination it was not possible to find any objective signs amongst 51% (86) of the patients. These patients exhibited normal motion of the back, normal musculature, no signs of neurologic involvement, negative straight-leg-raising test, no fixed painful position and no pain during percussion or palpation despite the fact they had subjective symptoms. The proportion of patients without objective findings increased with increased duration of absenteeism. Forty percent of the acute back patients displayed no objective findings. The corresponding figures for the subacute and chronic back patient groups were 34% and 70%, respectively. In the group without objective findings but with chronic pain (greater than 3 months) there was an increased frequency of Waddell's non-organic signs compared with the group with objective findings.

CD007431,0,2526943,0,Physical findings in patients with chronic intractable benign pain of the neck and/or back.,"Chronic intractable benign pain (CIBP) is defined as non-neoplastic pain of greater than 6 months duration without objective physical findings and known nociceptive peripheral input. To test the CIBP concept, 283 consecutive chronic pain patients were examined independently by a neurosurgeon and physiatrist and only congruent physical findings were coded. Because they did not fit the CIBP definition, patients with the following primary treatment diagnoses were eliminated: degenerative disease of the spine and spinal stenosis; degenerative disease of the hips; radiculopathy; malignancy; deafferentation pain; and miscellaneous. Eliminated, also, were patients with any one finding indicative of a root compression syndrome, leaving 90 low back and 34 neck patients. These patients had abnormal physical findings in 7 categories: tender points/trigger points; decreased ranges of motion in back or neck; non-anatomical sensory loss; rigid musculature; decreased range of hip motion; gait disturbance; and miscellaneous non-neurologic signs. Low back CIBP patients had the following distribution among the 7 categories: 0% had findings of all 7; 1.1% had 6; 13.3% had 5; 24.4% had 4; 25.6% had 3; 26.7% had 2; 8.9% had 1; and 0% had none. Neck CIBP patients, in which only the first 4 categories of physical findings were applicable had the following distribution: 2.9% had 4; 41.2% had 3; 35.3% had 2; 20.6% had 1; and 0% had none. It was concluded that CIBP patients do have abnormal physical findings indicative of musculoskeletal disease: possibly fibrositis and/or specific myofascial syndromes, as sources of peripheral nociception. These findings question the validity of the CIBP concept and point to the need for a careful, all-inclusive physical examination as a basic initial requirement in the classification of chronic pain patients."

Radicular pain was predominant in patients with metastases located in the lumbar area, while the severity of motor symptoms was positively correlated with thoracic metastases. The most common initial symptom was radicular pain, followed, with decreasing frequency, by motor weakness, sensory complaints and bladder dysfunction. The progression of motor weakness influenced the probability of establishing the diagnosis of spinal cord compression by stepwise marked increased probability when patients lost gait function or progressed into total paralysis."
CD007431,0,932080,0,Degenerative spondylolisthesis.,"A clinical study has been made of forty-three patients with symptoms arising from degenerative spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine. Attention is drawn to the lower average level of the iliac crests in these patients, and to the high incidence of osteoarthritis of the hips. Many patients in this series had been referred specifically for operation and fourteen were so treated. The techniques of decompression and of spinal fusion are discussed. It is concluded that patients with back pain predominant are well treated by corsetry, only a minority needing fusion, and that patients with nerve root involvement or with symptoms of spinal stenosis need decompression. The place of spinal fusion is the main problem, but it seems reasonable, firstly, in younger patients with clear evidence of instability and degenerative change at a single level, and secondly, when radical decompression is judged to increase the risk of instability."

Such measures may be important determinants in discriminating between patients who are asymptomatic and those who have low back pain. However, little objective evidence is available concerning variations in PA stiffness and their clinical significance. Moreover, although several studies have assessed only load input in relation to stiffness, a more complete assessment based on dynamic stiffness measurements (force/velocity) and concomitant neuromuscular response may offer more information concerning mechanical properties of the low back."
CD007431,0,17216227,0,Quantitative analysis in outcome assessment of instrumented lumbosacral arthrodesis.,"The outcome assessment in instrumented lumbosacral fusion mostly focuses on clinical criteria, complications and scores, with a high variability of imaging means, methods of fusion grading and parameters describing degenerative changes, making comparisons between studies difficult. The aim of this retrospective evaluation was to evaluate the interest of quantified radiographic analysis of lumbar spine in global outcome assessment and to highlight the key biomechanical factors involved. Clinical data and Beaujon-Lassale scores were collected for 49 patients who underwent lumbosacral arthrodesis after prior lumbar discectomy (mean follow-up: 5 years). Sagittal standing and lumbar flexion-extension X-ray films allowed quantifying vertebral, lumbar, pelvic and kinematic parameters of the lumbar spine, which were compared to reference values. Statistics were performed to assess evolution for all variables. At long-term follow-up, 90% of patients presented satisfactory clinical outcomes, associated to normal sagittal alignment; vertebral parameters objectified adjacent level degeneration in four cases (8%). Clinical outcome was correlated (r = 0.8) with fusion that was confirmed in 80% of cases, doubtful in 16% and pseudarthrosis seemed to occur in 4% (2) of cases. In addition to clinical data (outcomes comparable to the literature), quantitative analysis accurately described lumbar spine geometry and kinematics, highlighting parameters related to adjacent level's degeneration and a significant correlation between clinical outcome and fusion. Furthermore, criteria proposed to quantitatively evaluate fusion from lumbar dynamic radiographs seem to be appropriate and in agreement with surgeon's qualitative grading in 87% of cases."
CD007431,0,14767713,0,Management of disabilities associated with achondroplasia.,"Achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia that manifests as short stature. Impairment and complications range over many disciplines including orthopedics, pediatrics, neurology, and otolaryngology. The major impairments of the extremities are short limbs, limited elbow and hip extension, and knee and leg deformities that can cause disabilities in arm function and locomotion. Hydrocephalus, a narrow foramen magnum, spinal deformity, and spinal canal stenosis can cause neurological problems, leading to disabilities in locomotion, communication, and learning. Malfunctions of the otolaryngeal system such as otitis media, upper respiratory obstruction, deafness, speech delay, and malocclusion are interrelated and can also lead to disabilities in communication and learning. Although such disabilities may cause social handicaps, most children receive a normal education. Their social maturity scale is comparable to that of normal children, but their scale of locomotion is not. The reported occupational level of female adult patients is lower than that of their unaffected siblings. When managing patients, orthopedists should consider the overall aspects of achondroplasia, including natural development and complications other than orthopedic factors."

To evaluate chemonucleolysis 84 patients, treated with chymopapain over 12 months, were assessed before injection and reviewed 5-15 months after injection. All patients had lumbar disc disease which had failed to respond to conservative therapy. Chemonucleolysis was most effective in those patients with classical signs and symptoms of prolapsed lumbar disc disease of less than 3 months' duration and where sciatica was the predominant complaint. Poor results were obtained in those patients with pain for more than 6 months' duration and with predominantly low back pain. Workers' compensation patients did not respond favourably. Good short term results with chemonucleolysis can be expected by careful patient selection and adequate and accurate placement of enzyme."

CD007431,0,12902949,0,The fate of the adjacent motion segments after lumbar fusion.,"Lumbar spine fusion is a commonly performed procedure in various pathologic conditions of the spine. Its role remains debated, and moreover, delayed complications may occur, among which is transitional segment alteration leading to recurrence of back pain, gross instability, and neurologic symptoms. Little is known about the long-term prevalence of this complication because of a lack of specific studies. We analyzed the fate of the transitional segments in a homogeneous group of patients operated on during a 14-year period for degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine resistant to conservative treatment. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 15 years. Seventy-five percent of our study group had a minimal 5-year follow-up. In this subgroup, 41% of the patients developed transitional segment alterations, and 20% needed a secondary operation for extension of the fusion. Potential risk factors such as postoperative delay, length of fusion, and spine imbalance were recognized. The frequency of delayed alterations of the adjacent segment and the severity of symptoms related to this complication in this study raise questions about the justification of fusion procedures in degenerative conditions of the spine without threatening instability. Data from the literature confirm the severity of the problem, but many uncertainties remain because of the lack of homogeneous and complete data on both the normal evolution of motion segments of the lumbar spine with age and the fate of the same segments when transformed in transitional segments. Future prospective studies on the subject are needed and must deal with homogeneous groups of patients. More reconstructive surgical procedures need to be developed to lessen the need for fusion procedures."
CD007431,0,12902948,0,Prosthetic disc nucleus (PDN) replacement for lumbar disc herniation: preliminary report with six months' follow-up.,"A clinical follow-up study was performed to evaluate lumbar disc nucleus replacement clinically and functionally. The objective was to assess the clinical efficacy of the prosthetic disc nucleus (PDN) for treatment of lumbar disc herniation. The PDN was designed to treat patients suffering from disc herniation and/or degeneration. Clinical trials for PDN were first conducted in 1996, and the results showed that the PDN device was effective in most of the patients who were implanted. These studies had been carried out with patients who were implanted with a pair of the devices. The main complication was device migration. Therefore, a follow-up study based on a single PDN device implantation was designed to evaluate its clinical result. Forty-five patients with lumbar disc herniation were implanted with one PDN device from March 2002 to December 2002. Thirty (66.7%) patients came to the clinical, functional, and radiographic 6-month follow-up examinations. Independent analysis was performed by careful review of the charts, operative notes, preoperative and postoperative radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and follow-up records of all patients. After implantation, significant proportions of patients experienced pain relief. Improvements were noted in pain intensity, walking distance, lumbar mobility, neurologic weakness, Oswestry and Prolo scores, and intervertebral disc height. No difference in work status after PDN implantation could be detected. Compared with the preoperative height, the intervertebral disc had gained 19.7% (P < 0.001). Device migration, failure, and dislocation were not noticed in any patient. A few patients had minor complications such as transient low-grade fever. Clinically, a single PDN is preferred and can effectively increase the height of the intervertebral disc in patients with lumbar disc herniation. However, long-term follow-up of PDN implantation needs to be studied."
CD007431,0,12902947,0,Partial disc replacement with the PDN prosthetic disc nucleus device: early clinical results.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the PDN prosthetic disc nucleus device for the treatment of chronic discogenic back pain caused by degenerative disc disease. Among the 48 patients who underwent nucleus replacement surgery from January 2001 through May 2002, 46 patients were followed >6 months. The mean Oswestry Disability Index score was 58.9% preoperatively, and it improved to 18% at the 1-year follow-up. Visual Analogue Pain Scale scores improved from a preoperative mean of 8.5 to 3.1 after 1 year. The mean Prolo Scale score also improved from 5.2 preoperatively to 7.2 at 1 year. Major complications included four cases of device migration, requiring revision surgery, and infection in one patient. According to MacNab's criteria, results were excellent in 5 patients (10.9%), good in 31 (67.4%), fair in 3 (6.5%), and poor in 7 (15.1%). The overall clinical success rate was 78.3%. Nucleus replacement with the PDN device seemed to be effective in treating patients with chronic discogenic back pain caused by degenerative disc disease."
CD007431,0,3451621,0,[The post-diskotomy syndrome].,After lumbar disc operations in some cases epidural scars develop. The symptoms consist of back- and leg pain combined with a both sided straight leg raising test. In the myelogram and CT scars can be seen. The conservative therapy can be made by local injections with steroids. A lumbosacral distraction spondylodesis with autologous bone graft can bring a certain relief. Important is a prophylaxis with the right indication for the primary disc operation: without discectomy no post-discectomy-syndrome.

The electrical studies which were performed on all the patients, included recordings of fibrillation potentials, H-reflex and ankle reflex latencies. This diagnosis technique was found to be more accurate than radiculography or clinical examination and did not give false evidence. Seventy patients were classed as having a lesion of the nerve root. Fifty of these patients were treated surgically. The operation revealed compression of the nerve root by osteophytes arising from degenerative and incompletely dislocated posterior facet joints in 43 patients."

However, morphological abnormalities demonstrated by MR imaging do not always reflect low back pain (LBP). MR imaging should be interpreted with consideration of full clinical signs, symptoms, and other relevant background. At the same time, MR findings potentially relevant to LBP, such as morphological abnormalities of the disc, presence or absence of high intensity zone, abnormalities of the end plate and adjacent marrow signal, degree of nerve root compression, and degeneration of the facet joint, should be described without omission."
CD007431,0,10693256,0,[True neurological thoracic outlet syndrome].,"The thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) encompasses various clinical entities affecting the neurovascular bundle crossing the thoracic outlet. Unfortunately, this term often proves to be confusing because many of these entities have little in common beyond their known or presumed lesion site. Neurogenic TOS (true TOS) is caused by compression of the lower trunk in the brachial plexus, the cervical ribs or fibrous band. This syndrome is extremely rare. We consider that this neurological form of TOS is a clearly defined neurological syndrome. We report 10 patients with true TOS. All were females. Stating the onset was difficult because symptoms were progressive and insidious. Pain was the most frequently reported symptom. Sensory deficit was slight or absent. All patients showed unilateral severe atrophy of the thenar muscles. Wasting and weakness developed later. A reduced amplitude of ulnar and median compound muscle action potential associated with a normal amplitude of median sensory nerve action and a reduced amplitude of ulnar sensory nerve action potential were indicative of a chronic axon loss in the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. In all cases, we performed medial antebrachial cutaneous sensory nerve action potential, a C8-T1 innervated nerve. The absence of the medial antebrachial cutaneous sensory nerve action potential in 9 patients and a reduction in amplitude of 50 p. 100 compared to the unaffected side in the other patient, indicated the diagnostic value of this easy and reproductible test. It confirmed a C8-T1 post-ganglionic radicular lesion or a lower brachial plexus neuropathy. Radiography showed a rudimentary bilateral cervical rib or an elongated C7 transverse process in all cases. Surgery was performed in the affected side in 7 patients and in each case the lower part of the brachial plexus was found to be stretched and angulated over a fibrous band, which was removed. Pain was relieved after 1 to 4 weeks. A minimal motor improvement was observed after one year. Electrophysiological results were unchanged."

CD007431,0,17607103,0,Bone dowels in anterior lumbar interbody fusion.,"Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the Babgy-Kuslich BAK cage for anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), various threaded interbody fusion devices have been introduced. Bone dowels offer several theoretical advantages over cages with regard to stress shielding; the purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of bone dowels in interbody fusion. All patients undergoing ALIF performed by the senior author between 1998 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' preoperative and postoperative neurologic status, functional status, and both back and radicular pain were assessed according to a previously published outcome measure. Between 1998 and 2000, 23 patients underwent ALIF with cortical femoral allograft bone dowels. One patient underwent simultaneous bone dowel and titanium cage placements and was therefore excluded from further analysis. The 22 remaining patients underwent a total of 33 fused segments; of these, 21 patients were available for follow-up. Mean clinical follow-up was 30.6 months. Mean imaging follow-up was 21 months. There were 5 instances of radiographic nonunion (3 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic). The incidence of technical failures and complications related to the bone dowels was 17%. Bone dowels failed and caused symptoms only in patients with a stand-alone ALIF. There were no clinical failures in patients treated with supplemental anterior or posterior spinal fixation. These data demonstrate that marginal fusion rates and functional success rates can be achieved using stand-alone bone dowels for ALIF. The clinical success and fusion rates are significantly higher if ALIF dowels are shielded from stress with rigid spinal instrumentation."
CD007431,0,10442447,0,Surgical outcome in patients with coexisting multiple sclerosis and spondylosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-degenerative disease of unknown etiology which results in destruction of myelin. A variety of neurologic signs and symptoms are associated with MS and include myelopathy, extremity weakness, low back pain, sciatica and paresthesias. Many of these signs and symptoms are identical to those experienced by patients with spondylosis (e.g. spinal stenosis, disc herniations).

CD007431,0,15138861,0,Detection of bacterial DNA in painful degenerated spinal discs in patients without signs of clinical infection.,"A local inflammatory and potentially painful response, of which the ultimate cause is unknown, has been described in nervous tissues in contact with degenerated disc material in patients with low back and leg pain. With the rationale that a possible cause of such inflammation could be bacterial infection, we utilized PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of the 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) gene followed by gene sequencing, to investigate whether bacterial DNA might be detected in the degenerative discs of 10 patients operated for disc herniation or post-discectomy syndrome. One patient with disc hernia harbored DNA homologous to Bacillus cereus, and in one patient suffering from post-discectomy syndrome, Citrobacter braaki/freundii DNA was detected. The finding demonstrates that 16S rRNA PCR can be a useful tool in search of bacterial DNA in degenerated discs, which in turn may be indicative of low-grade infection, manifesting itself only as pain rather than as clinical infection."
CD007431,0,11550835,0,Lumbar micro disc surgery with and without autologous fat graft. A prospective randomized trial evaluated with reference to clinical and social factors.,"Epidural scarring is one of the possible complications after lumbar disc surgery. Perineural scar tissue has been considered responsible for recurrent neurological symptoms in patients operated on for disc herniation and leads to a high rate of unsatisfactory results. In addition, postoperative scars may increase the technical difficulty and risk of subsequent procedures. Various materials have been used in animal studies to try to affect the degree of epidural scar tissue with controversial results. In particular, free fat transplantation has been described to reduce the degree of intraspinal scar tissue. We therefore performed a prospective, double-blind, randomized study comparing clinical and social factors of patients being operated on for the first time for lumbar disc herniation. A total of 92 patients received an implantation of autologous fat graft, 94 did not. After a median of 24.2 months after their surgery, an objective examinator compared various clinical parameters and the social situation of patients in both groups without knowing the operation method used. We found no significant differences between the fat-graft group and the control group regarding either the clinical outcome or the social aspects."
CD007431,0,1835156,0,Clinical validation of functional flexion-extension roentgenograms of the lumbar spine.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical validity of functional flexion-extension roentgenograms of the lumbar spine in a defined patient population. One hundred and one adults with low-back pain or functional disorders underwent passive functional flexion-extension examinations. Their roentgenograms were analyzed using a computer-assisted method to determine segmental motion parameters such as rotation and translation of the lumbar vertebrae. The patient population was broken down into five groups with similar pathologies or physical conditions, and their motion parameters compared to a normal population and to each other. It was found that all of the patient groups exhibited significantly hypomobile motion, spread equally among all levels, in comparison to the normal population, except for the group of high-performance athletes, who had significant hypermobility. The uniform spread of hypomobility limits the ability to distinguish with any confidence between the four pathologic groups by their motion. Thus, we believe that the analysis of the segmental motion of the lumbar spine using passive flexion-extension roentgenograms does not aid in differentiating the underlying pathologic condition of patients with low-back pain, and that no useful information can be derived form this procedure, especially in relation to the need for surgical intervention."

In this retrospective study, functional outcome by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and verbal rating scale (VRS) for current pain severity was evaluated in 39 patients undergoing lumbar transforaminal epidural spinal injections (ESI). Subjects with low back pain (mean age, 60 +/- 12.5 years) were evaluated for functional improvement post EMG and ESI. Of 39 patients tested with EMG before injection, 18 patients were positive for radiculopathy and 21 had a normal or negative examination. The patients were followed postinjection on average of 10.8 (SD +/- 3.9) weeks. Pretreatment ODI scores were not significantly different between groups showing positive (72.3 SD +/- 12.7) and negative (65.9 SD +/- 18.6, P > .05) EMG findings. There was significantly greater improvement of ODI for EMG positive radiculopathy (7.11 SD +/- 9.5) compared with negative EMG (3.2 SD +/- 17.4, P < .05). Positive radiculopathy subjects complained of more pain by VRS before ESI than subjects with negative EMG findings, 8.1 SD +/- 1.0 and 7.3 SD +/- 0.8, respectively, which was not significant (P > .05). VRS mean improvement was not significantly different in the positive EMG group (1.8 SD +/- 1.2) compared with a negative EMG (1.2 SD +/- 1.2, P > .05)."
CD007431,0,8238703,0,Upper trunk brachial plexopathy. The stinger syndrome.,"This study was designed to determine the cause of upper trunk brachial plexopathy, which is referred to as a ""stinger"" or a ""burner."" This injury often has been thought to occur secondary to traction when an athlete sustains a lateral flexion injury of the neck. At the United States Military Academy, a 4-phase study was begun with 261 tackle football players (236 intramural- and 25 varsity-level players) to investigate this injury. Electromyography and nerve root stimulation studies were used to delineate the lesion, which was found in a total of 32 players who continued throughout the study. This study demonstrated that a much more common mechanism of injury resulting in the stinger syndrome is probably compression of the fixed brachial plexus between the shoulder pad and the superior medial scapula when the pad is pushed into the area of Erb's point, where the brachial plexus is most superficial. An orthosis was designed to protect the brachial plexus from the compressive force of the shoulder pad. In preliminary trials, this orthosis had been very effective in decreasing the number of episodes in which stinger injuries occurred."

CD007431,0,12709855,0,Posterior lumbar interbody fusion using one diagonal fusion cage with transpedicular screw/rod fixation.,"Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using threaded cages has gained wide popularity for lumbosacral spinal disease. Our biomechanical tests showed that PLIF using a single diagonal cage with unilateral facetectomy does add a little to spinal stability and provides equal or even higher postoperative stability than PLIF using two posterior cages with bilateral facetectomy. Studies also demonstrated that cages placed using a posterior approach did not cause the same increase in spinal stiffness seen with pedicle screw instrumentation, and we concluded that cages should not be used posteriorly without other forms of fixation. On the other hand, placement of two cages using a posterior approach does have the disadvantage of risk to the bilateral nerve roots. We therefore performed a prospective study to determine whether PLIF can be accomplished by utilizing a single diagonal fusion cage with the application of supplemental transpedicular screw/rod instrumentation. Twenty-seven patients underwent a PLIF using one single fusion cage (BAK, Sulzer Spine-Tech, Minneapolis, MN, USA) inserted posterolaterally and oriented anteromedially on the symptomatic side with unilateral facetectomy and at the same level supplemental fixation with a transpedicular screw/rod system. The internal fixation systems included 12 SOCON spinal systems (Aesculap AG, Germany) and 15 TSRH spinal systems (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, USA). The inclusion criteria were grade 1 to 2 lumbar isthmic spondylolisthesis, lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis, and recurrent lumbar disc herniations with instability. Patients had at least 1 year of low back pain and/or unilateral sciatica and a severely restricted functional ability in individuals aged 28-55 years. Patients with more than grade 2 spondylolisthesis or adjacent-level degeneration were excluded from the study. Patients were clinically assessed prior to surgery by an independent assessor; they were then reassessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively by the same assessor and put into four categories: excellent, good, fair, and poor. Operative time, blood loss, hospital expense, and complications were also recorded. All patients achieved successful radiographic fusion at 2 years, and this was achieved at 1 year in 25 out of 27 patients. At 2 years, clinical results were excellent in 15 patients, good in 10, fair in 1, and poor in 1. Regarding complications, one patient had a postoperative motor and sensory deficit of the nerve root. Reoperation was required in one patient due to migration of pedicle screws. No implant fractures or deformities occurred in any of the patients. PLIF using diagonal insertion of a single threaded cage with supplemental transpedicular screw/rod instrumentation enables sufficient decompression and solid interbody fusion to be achieved with minimal invasion of the posterior spinal elements. It is a clinically safer, easier, and more economical means of accomplishing PLIF."

This is thought to be due what is called ""diffuse noxious inhibitor control"" modulating the activity of a group of convergent spinal neurons. The purpose of this study was to determine whether surgical resection of the herniated disk in patients suffering from sciatica might relieve this so-called ""counter-irritation"". Among 10 patients whose sciatica resulted from herniated disk, the decrease in amplitude of the RIII response observed when Lasegue's manoeuvre is applied disappeared in 7 patients, 6 to 8 days after surgical resection of the herniated disk. These results suggest that this test might be a useful tool for postoperative prediction of radicular compression."

The mean KED angle in the group of healthy children was 35 degrees (SD = 14 degrees). The border between norm and disease was defined as a mean + 2 SD and equaled 63 degrees. A KED angle greater than 60 degrees occurred in 10% of normal children. There was no correlation between age and a value of KED angle. In the study group, KED angle greater than 40 degrees was more frequent in boys. A correlation between disorders within musculoskeletal system and greater KED angle was found. These disorders were more frequent in children with asymmetrical KED angle. In our opinion, the border value of the KED angle is not a good differentiating factor between hamstring shortening and contracture because it does not explain the cause of the disorder."
CD007431,0,8333299,0,Reoperation after lumbar disc surgery: results in 130 cases.,"Out of a series of 1850 cases operated upon for lumbar disc herniation 130 underwent re-operation because of persistent or recurrent symptoms. Re-operation was successful in 62%. The prognosis of re-operation was not related to special clinical symptoms and signs but only to the operative findings. Herniations at other levels and recurrences of lumbar disc herniations had the best results (excellent in 98% respectively 54%), but scar formations alone came out much less satisfactory (only 38% excellent results). Computed tomography (CT) findings were less reliable in distinguishing between disc prolapse and fibrosis than magnet resonance imaging (MR). Therefore MR is the diagnostic method of choice in these conditions, and scar formations alone should be considered a contra-indication for re-operation."

The objective was to determine the efficacy, clinical outcome, and functional recovery in patients undergoing simultaneous decompression. No previous study has focussed on the clinical outcome of such simultaneous decompression. Twenty-one patients with neurological claudication, progressive gait disturbance, upper motor neuron symptoms, and findings of myelopathy in both the lower extremities underwent simultaneous decompression and were assessed. The average follow-up was 32 months (range, 24-40 months). At the last examination,13 patients (82%) had excellent or good clinical results. Postoperative improvement correlated inversely with the duration of symptoms. The patients usually had satisfactory outcomes when the correct diagnosis was made and management was implemented. Functional recovery depends on early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention."
CD007431,0,2917056,0,Lower extremity manifestations of spasticity in chronic spinal cord injury.,"The prevalence of various manifestations of spasticity from questionnaire responses and from clinical examination of chronic spinal cord injured patients is reported. Extensor spasms, flexor withdrawal spasms, and clonus were reported by most subjects. Those with incomplete lesions reported more interference with activities, more pain, and less functional usefulness, than did those with complete lesions. Extensor spasms were reported to interfere more with transfers, whereas flexor withdrawal spasms were reported to be more frequent at night and to interfere more with sleep. Increased muscle tone was observed more often in extensor than in flexor muscles. Those with incomplete lesions had more hypertonus and more limited passive joint movements than did those with complete lesions. Flexor withdrawal reactions and extensor spasms were also more pronounced in those with incomplete lesions, particularly those with Frankel grade C lesions."
CD007431,0,1876219,0,[Diagnostic tests in carpal tunnel syndrome].,"In a first series 100 patients underwent surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) after being tested by provocative tests for sensory disturbances preoperatively. In addition to the well-established tests like passive wrist flexion (Phalen's test) or wrist extension, active movement tests of the patient against resistance were investigated. Tests of active movement were introduced because of the high values of intraoperatively measured pressure at the median nerve, similar to those recorded with passive movements. All investigated provocative tests for sensory disturbances related to CTS, investigated by active and passive movements, were positive in 72% to 84% of patients. Average delay times for reaction of these provocative tests ranged between 15.7 and 19.5 s. Furthermore Tinel's sign showed a sensitivity of 64% and the flick sign one of 69%. The specificity of tests and signs for the CTS was assessed on a group of 50 surgically treated patients with cervical nerve root entrapment at the C5-C8 level. In this group and a second CTS group the most sensitive of each test in the first series (active and passive provocational movement), Tinel's sign and flick sign were investigated. By forming subgroups in both diseases we showed that the results of the total groups were not influenced by a possible double crush. We could demonstrate high sensitivities in cervical nerve root entrapment for Phalen's sign with 74% and for active thumb abduction with 68% and a medium sensitivity for Tinel's sign with 40%--thus implying low specificity for CTS. Only the flick sign turned out to be relatively specific for CTS--its sensitivity in cervical nerve root entrapment was around 26%--indicating its potential to function as a valid criterion for the differential diagnosis of CTS and cervical nerve root entrapment syndrome."
CD007431,0,6844850,0,[Stenosis of the lumbar canal: nosologic and semeiologic study. 163 operated cases].,"The authors report a retrospective study of 163 cases of degenerative or constitutional stenosis of the lumbar canal. In this series, the most frequent cause was osteoarthrosis and constitutional stenoses were relatively rare. The authors note that this is often a difficult aetiological distinction to make, especially in elderly patients and the anatomical deformities caused by osteoarthrosis lead to stenosis of the canal similar to that seen in constitutional malformations. Sensori-motor claudication is inconstant and was only found in one third of the cases in this series. More often, the lumbar stenosis presents as nerve root pain. It can be distinguished from root disease of disc origin by the frequent absence of Lasegue's sign and of spinal stiffness. When a herniated disc is associated with a stenosis, the clinical picture is altered and can then resemble that of disc sciatica. The diagnosis of stenosis depends on the radiological examination. This series confirms the diagnostic value of the abnormalities seen on standard X-rays, but the severity and the extent of the stenosis can only be assessed by performing tomography, water-soluble contrast myelography and C.T. scan. The authors discuss the limitations and degree of reliability of each of these investigations. The extent of the surgical decompression depends on the severity of the symptoms and on the results of this radiological survey."
CD007431,0,1432127,0,Transpedicular screw-rod fixation of the lumbar spine: operative technique and outcome in 104 cases.,"A total of 104 patients underwent transpedicular spinal instrumentation using the Cotrel-Dubousset (71 cases) or the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital (33) screw-rod system. Surgery was performed for lumbar vertebral column instability secondary to fractures (28 cases), spondylolisthesis (29), tumors (four), vertebral osteomyelitis (two), or postoperative causes (41). Pseudoarthrodesis due to failure of a prior fusion was present in 37 cases. The 55 men and 49 women (mean age 47 years, range 18 to 87 years) all presented with severe back pain. Signs or symptoms of neural compression were noted in 96 patients. Surgery consisted of neural decompression, internal fixation, and autogenous iliac bone grafting. Spondylolistheses were fused in situ, without reduction; otherwise, major spinal deformities were corrected. A total of 516 pedicle screws were placed. The mean extent of fusion was 2.7 motion segments (range one to six motion segments). A 96% fusion rate was obtained with a mean follow-up period of 20 months. There were no operative deaths. Major complications included one spinal epidural hematoma, three isolated nerve root deficits (two transient, one permanent), and three wound infections (two deep, one superficial). Instrument failure eventually developed in 18 patients; nine were asymptomatic with a solid fusion and did not require further treatment and the other nine were symptomatic or had a pseudoarthrosis and required operative revision. Pedicle screw-rod fixation offers biomechanical advantages compared to other forms of internal fixation for the lumbar spine. It enables short-segment fixation with preservation of lumbar lordosis and adjacent normal motion segments. This technique provides a highly successful method to obtain arthrodesis, even with prior pseudoarthrosis."

We have tried to clinically evaluate lumbago and sciatica using the technique of multiple regression analysis. Selection of evaluation item and allocation of scores to the item were carried out in 104 patients. Multiple regression analysis was carried out in all patients and the standard regression coefficient showed a correlation with criterion variable (dependent Y) in the order of walking, pain, posture, paralytic symptom in lower limbs and SLR (straight leg raising test). The proportion was 0.69, which seems to be a nearly valid value when other factors are considered."
CD007431,0,17613510,0,Schwannoma of the posterior tibial nerve: the problem of delay in diagnosis.,"Schwannomas are the most common tumours of the sheath of peripheral nerves. The clinical diagnosis is usually straightforward, but may be delayed for many years in a schwannoma of the posterior tibial nerve. The symptoms are often attributed to entrapment neuropathy or to lumbosacral radiculopathy. We describe 25 patients with a schwannoma of the posterior tibial nerve. Only three were diagnosed within a year of presentation. The mean time to diagnosis was 86.5 months with a median of 48 months (2 to 360). All the patients complained of pain, which was felt specifically in the sole of the foot in 18. A Tinel sign was detected in all 25 patients. MRI confirmed the diagnosis in all the cases in which it had been undertaken. Surgical resection of the lesion abolished the neuropathic pain. In patients with a long history of neuropathic pain in the lower limb in whom lumbar and pelvic lesions have been excluded, a benign tumour of the sheath of a peripheral nerve may explain the symptoms. Surgical resection of the tumour is safe and effective."

Patients with root pain due to infectious, neoplastic or inflammatory diseases were excluded, as were patients who needed immediate surgery. Pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) 10 and 90 days after the injection. After 10 days a substantial decrease in root pain was observed, with a statistically significant decrease in mean VAS. This decrease was observed in 90% of patients, and it persisted after 90 days in 85%. Side effects were rare, mild and disappeared spontaneously. They were related to the drug injected (corticosteroids)."

CD007431,0,3603106,0,Diagnosis of diseases of the lumbar spine: correlation of computerized tomography with myelography and clinical findings.,"Data from 339 patients referred for evaluation of suspected lumbar disease were studied retrospectively to correlate findings in the routine clinical evaluation with results of computed tomography and myelography. Clinical features from the patients' history that correlated with an abnormal CT and myelogram included age greater than or equal to 40, a history of previous surgery, and absence of a history of injury. Signs from the physical examination that correlated included reduced lumbar motion, a motor or sensory deficit, abnormal reflexes, and reduced capacity for straight leg-raising or walking. Using a clinical score incorporating these variables, we suggest a diagnostic strategy to promote more efficient and selective use of CT scans and myelograms. We project that the use of this diagnostic approach can reduce the number of myelograms ordered in a similar population by more than 50%."

Trauma was not a significant aetiological factor, but there was a high incidence of back pain in relatives of affected patients. The clinical picture is similar to that in the adult except for a relative paucity of neurological signs. This review of patients treated by surgical or conservative methods suggests that good results may be obtained in patients with a short history who are offered surgery early. Preoperative radiculography is considered to be essential because of the inaccuracy in localising the level of disc prolapse by clinical signs. The result of treatment in patients with long histories is usually disappointing."

Correlation with low-back pain, spinal mobility and trunk muscle strength in 15-year-old school children.","From a population of 1503 school children, 38 15-year-old children reporting recurrent or continuous low-back pain (LBP) and 38 asymptomatic controls (34 boys and 42 girls) matched for age, sex and school class, were compared with respect to spinal mobility and trunk muscle strength. The subjects were interviewed on leisure time physical activity preceding the measurements. Of the subjects with recurrent or continuous LBP and of those completely without LBP experience 73.7% vs 42.1% reported that they pursued some physical activity two days a week or less (P = 0.006). Further, decreased spinal mobility, diminished endurance strength of the back muscles and diminished dynamic strength of the abdominal muscles were found in the group with a low frequency of activity. Mobility in children pursuing physical activity two days a week or less was decreased in lumbar extension measured by flexicurve, in forward bending, in side bending and in straight leg raising. Our results indicate that a very low frequency of physical activity in the young might be the risk factor for LBP. Pursuing sports as a leisure time activity is not harmful; on the contrary it has positive effects on spinal mobility and trunk muscle strength."
CD007431,0,12131428,0,Does provocative discography screening of discogenic back pain improve surgical outcome?,"The value of preoperative provocative discography in the setting of discogenic low back pain was investigated by evaluating surgical outcomes. Seventy-three consecutive patients who underwent posterolateral interbody and posterior spinal arthrodesis for discogenic low back pain refractory to nonoperative management were reviewed. Chronologically, the first 41 patients (group A) were indicated without discography, whereas the remaining 32 (group B) had been indicated only if their pain had been reproduced during disc injection. The two groups were similar in demographic, psychometric, and radiologic parameters. Average follow-up time in group A was 2.8 years and in group B it was 2.4 years, both with a 2-year minimum. Using modified Oswestry scoring, group A and group B patients had satisfactory outcomes of 75.6% and 81.2%, respectively. This difference was neither statistically significant nor suggestive.

CD007431,0,2657484,0,Spinal segmental somatosensory evoked potentials in lumbosacral radiculopathies.,"We studied 21 patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy with segmental somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) recorded over both spine and scalp following saphenous, superficial peroneal, and sural nerve stimulation. Spinal SEPs were abnormal in 10 patients. In 3 patients, SEPs detected abnormalities not seen on EMG examination. With 1 exception, all anatomic levels of SEP abnormalities matched that of radiographic, EMG, or clinical abnormalities. SEPs were abnormal in 41% of nerve roots shown to be involved by other techniques. SEPs added to the clinical evaluation in 4 patients, but were less accurate than a combination of EMG and radiography in indicating the extent of nerve root involvement. We conclude that spinal SEPs following segmental sensory stimulation are useful in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies and complement information provided by the EMG. In contrast, scalp-recorded segmental SEPs rarely provide additional useful clinical information."
CD007431,0,17570589,0,Pseudoradicular and radicular low-back pain--a disease continuum rather than different entities? Answers from quantitative sensory testing.,"To assess whether pseudoradicular low-back pain may be associated with subclinical sensory deficits in the distal extremity, we applied the quantitative sensory testing protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) in 15 patients with pseudoradicular pain distribution. Sixteen age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects as well as 12 patients with radicular pain syndromes (L4-S1) were studied with the same protocol. Radicular pain was diagnosed using clinical criteria (pain radiation beyond the knee, motor-, sensory-, or reflex deficits, positive Laségue's test). Z-score QST profiles revealed a selective loss of vibration detection, detection of v. Frey hair contact, and cold detection in the affected dermatomes in the radicular pain group. The contralateral dermatome was also affected, but to a lesser degree. In patients with pseudoradicular pain, the sensory profile was similar, but sensory loss was less pronounced than in the radicular pain patients. There was no significant difference between the two patient groups. Vibration detection was the most sensitive parameter with 73% abnormal values in radicular and 47% in pseudoradicular cases. These data verified the sensitivity of QST to detect sensory loss in radicular compression syndromes, and support a neuropathic component in low-back pain with radiculopathy. In contrast to some central pain syndromes this sensory loss involved predominantly large fiber functions. The subclinical sensory loss in pseudoradicular cases suggests that these patients may also have a neuropathic component of their chronic pain. The spatial incongruence of pain and sensory loss in pseudoradicular pain, however, may also indicate that the two are not causally related."

The single most useful electrophysiologic technique was EMG, which often provided evidence of denervation in a myotomal pattern when other electrophysiologic findings were normal. We found abnormal late responses in 14 patients, but always in association with EMG abnormalities. Peroneal-derived SEPs were always normal. Dermatomal SEPs confirmed the diagnosis in seven patients, including two in whom other electrophysiologic studies were normal."

The outcomes of each test were blinded as to group assignment and the data was assessed statistically to derive each test's independent scores of sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and accuracy.

We present six patients with a transverse fracture of the sacrum with anterior displacement. All patients presented with bowel and bladder dysfunction, perineal anesthesia, sensory and motor deficits at the lower extremities. Prompt diagnosis of the sacral fracture was obtained in five of the six patients. Operative treatment including lumbosacral laminectomies, spine instrumentation and fusion was done in all patients. Neurological recovery was almost complete in one patient, incomplete in four patients, and none in one patient.

CD007431,0,16403662,0,The course of high-sensitive C-reactive protein in correlation with pain and clinical function in patients with acute lumbosciatic pain and chronic low back pain - a 6 months prospective longitudinal study.,"In this prospective longitudinal study with a follow-up of 6 months, the course of serum concentration of C-reactive protein was measured by an ultrasensitive immunoassay in 31 patients with acute lumbosciatic pain and 41 patients with chronic low back pain. High-sensitive CRP (hsCRP), pain and clinical function were assessed at ten fixed time-points during follow-up. The course of hsCRP values was assessed in relation to the course of pain and clinical function adjusting for possible confounding factors. At the beginning of the study, there were no statistically significant differences in mean hsCRP levels in patients with acute lumbosciatic pain (1.49mg/l) compared to the levels obtained in patients with chronic low back pain (1.30mg/l) and those in a control group from the general population (1.26mg/l). In patients with acute lumbosciatic pain, hsCRP declined significantly in the initial period of 3 weeks with a corresponding decrease in pain and improvement in function and clinical evaluation as assessed with the straight leg raising test (SLR), whereas after this period, the course of the hsCRP did not correspond with the clinical parameters. In patients with chronic low back pain, hsCRP remained approximately constant throughout the whole period with no correlation with pain or function. As a conclusion, according to this study levels of hsCRP do not have a major clinical relevance when evaluating the long-term course of patients with acute lumbosciatic pain and chronic low back pain and therefore should not be taken into primary consideration when decisions on therapy are made."

Clinical experience has shown that in contrast to levels L2/3-L4/5, this approach may become extremely difficult at the L5-S1 level. According to new microanatomic studies, the previous lateral approaches at this level often do not allow access to the neuroforamen without partial or total destruction of the L5-S1 facet joint. Postoperatively, this may lead to joint irritation with consecutive low back and pseudoradicular pain. To preserve the facet joint, a new approach was developed based on an anatomic study."
CD007431,0,3401361,0,Night pain associated with diminished cardiopulmonary compliance. A concomitant of lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis.,"Twenty patients admitted to hospital with congestive heart failure were evaluated for severe concomitant lumbosacral and leg pain. In each instance the discomfort was worse at night and progressively decreased with a resolution of the pulmonary edema. Neurologic and electromyographic examinations in all but four patients were normal with reflexes, strength and straight leg raising testing normal. An absent Achilles reflex was recognized in two, a diminished knee jerk reflex in one and in a third, weakness in the extensor hallucis longus. Lumbar spinal stenosis was identified in all of the patients with a concomitant degenerative spondylolisthesis present in nine instances and in an additional two a spondylolisthesis with interruption of the neural arch. It is theorized that diminished right heart compliance can induce a sufficient increase in venous volume and pressure within the paravertebral plexus of Batson to acutely exacerbate a chronic lumbar spinal stenosis. In support of this hypothesis, the multiple factors involved in the pathomechanics and physiology of lumbar radiculopathy, spinal stenosis and the role of the paravertebral plexus of veins are examined. Specifically, their response to altered volume and pressure gradients tending to induce venous ""creep"" as well to alterations in posture and diurnal cycles are reviewed."
CD007431,0,15761707,0,Combined intra-extracanal approach to lumbosacral disc herniations with bi-radicular involvement. Technical considerations from a surgical series of 15 cases.,"Large lumbosacral disc herniations effacing both the paramedian and the foraminal area often cause double radicular compression. Surgical management of these lesions may be difficult. A traditional interlaminar approach usually brings into view only the paramedian portion of the intervertebral disc, unless the lateral bone removal is considerably increased. Conversely, the numerous far-lateral approaches proposed for removing foraminal or extraforaminal disc herniations would decompress the exiting nerve root only. Overall, these approaches share the drawback of controlling the neuroforamen on one side alone. A combined intra-extraforaminal exposure is a useful yet rarely reported approach. Over a 3-year period, 15 patients with bi-radicular symptoms due to large disc herniations of the lumbar spine underwent surgery through a combined intra-extracanal approach. A standard medial exposure with an almost complete hemilaminectomy of the upper vertebra was combined with an extraforaminal exposure, achieved by minimal drilling of the inferior facet joint, the lateral border of the pars interarticularis and the inferior margin of the superior transverse process. The herniated discs were removed using key maneuvers made feasible by working simultaneously on both operative windows. In all cases the disc herniation could be completely removed, thus decompressing both nerve roots. Radicular pain was fully relieved without procedure-related morbidity. The intra-extraforaminal exposure was particularly useful in identifying the extraforaminal nerve root early. Early identification was especially advantageous when periradicular scar tissue hid the nerve root from view, as it did in patients who had undergone previous surgery at the same site or had long-standing radicular symptoms. Controlling the foramen on both sides also reduced the risk of leaving residual disc fragments. A curved probe was used to push the disc material outside the foramen. In conclusion, specific surgical maneuvers made feasible by a simultaneous extraspinal and intraspinal exposure allow quick, safe and complete removal of lumbosacral disc herniations with paramedian and foraminal extension."

A cost and quality-of-life evaluation.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the cost and effects on quality of life [using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] of 2 treatments for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation: chemonucleolysis and surgical discectomy. The design involved a combination of decision analysis and Rosser index, with assessment of probabilities from long term clinical series. Utility was based on patients' subjective assessment using a simplified self-administered Health Measurement Questionnaire (HMQ). 146 patients from 7 hospitals were enrolled, 2 to 3 months after chemonucleolysis or surgery. The end-points used were cost and QALYs for each intervention, every year for years 1 to 7. At the time of analysis (1990), the total cost of surgical discectomy was FF15,400, compared with FF8000 for chemonucleolysis. After 1 year, and including the costs of reoperation for failure and relapse and long term medical costs for the non-reoperated unsatisfactory results, discectomy costs were almost 40% higher than those of chemonucleolysis. Ratios remain unchanged after 7 years. QALY results reveal an additional benefit of 52 days of good health associated with chemonucleolysis."
CD007431,0,11052356,0,"The relationship between disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, and stability of the degenerative lumbar spine.","Degenerative processes in the disc and facet joints affect the stability of the motion segment. The exact relations among disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, and the kinematics of the motion segment are not well defined in the literature. Magnetic resonance imaging and functional radiography of the lumbar spine were analyzed to examine the relations among segmental instability, facet joint osteoarthritis, and disc degeneration in patients with degenerative disorders of the lumbar spine. Seventy consecutive patients (mean age, 46 years) had both magnetic resonance imaging and flexion and extension radiographs of the lumbar spine. The lumbar instability was classified into abnormal tilting on flexion, rotatory instability in the sagittal plane, and translatory instability. Translatory instability was subdivided into anterior, posterior, and anteroposterior translatory instability. Disc degeneration as seen on T2-weighted sagittal images was classified into five grades. Facet joint osteoarthritis as seen on axial T1-weighted images was divided into four grades. This study revealed that the kinematics of the lumbar motion segment are affected by disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis. Abnormal tilting movement on flexion and anteroposterior translatory instability both had negative associations with facet joint osteoarthritis. However, anterior translatory instability was positively associated with disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis. Rotatory instability in the sagittal plane and posterior translatory instability were not associated with disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis."

CD007431,0,11052353,0,Recovery of function in adjacent nerve roots after surgery for lumbar disc herniation: use of quantitative sensory testing in the exploration of different populations of nerve fibers.,"Results from experimental and clinical studies indicate that adjacent nerve roots may be affected in sciatica because of lumbar disc hemiation. This may be caused by proinflammatory mediators in the epidural space being transported into nerve roots at the same or neighboring lumbar segments. The aim of the present study was to investigate the recovery of function of sensory nerve fibers in the adjacent noncompressed nerve roots. Thirty-nine patients undergoing microdiscectomy for monoradiculopathy were investigated with quantitative sensory testing immediately before surgery, and at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months after the operation. Twenty-one healthy volunteers were used as controls. The patients were classified as having a good or a poor result at the 1-year follow-up according to a clinical score. Significant improvement of function in the noncompressed nerve roots were only observed in the 31 patients with a good result. The improvement in small myelinated nerve fibers came within 12 months in the adjacent nerve roots in both the symptomatic as well as the asymptomatic leg. The improvement of function in small unmyelinated fibers also came within 12 months after surgery; however, significant improvement was only observed in the ipsilateral neighboring nerve root. The function in large myelinated fibers did not improve in any of the adjacent nerve roots during the observation period. The observed recovery of function in adjacent noncompressed nerve roots after successful surgical decompression in monoradiculopathy may be because of less production of proinflammatory mediators when the disc herniation is removed."
CD007431,0,6450448,0,Acute low-back pain. An objective analysis of conservative therapy.,"The roles of bedrest, antiinflammatory medication, and analgesic medication in the treatment of acute back strain were objectively analyzed to determine whether they have a measurable effect on the return of patients to full daily activities as well as on the relief of pain. Two hundred patients were studied prospectively. Each patient had the diagnosis of acute back strain, which was defined as nonradiating low-back pain. The results of the patient's neurologic examination, straight leg raising test, and lumbosacral spine roentgenograms had to be within normal limits for the patient to be included in the study. The results showed that bedrest, as compared with ambulation, will decrease the amount of time lost from work by 50%. Bedrest will also decrease the amount of discomfort by 60%. Analgesic medication, when combined with bedrest, will further decrease the amount of pain incurred, particularly when used in the first three days of the healing process. However, analgesic medication will not allow a more prompt return to work. Antiinflammatory medication, when added to bedrest in the treatment of lumbago, does not provide an advantage over bedrest alone."

CD007431,0,2968667,1,"Computed tomography, electrodiagnostic and clinical findings in chronic workers' compensation patients with back and leg pain.","One hundred patients with complaints of low-back pain and leg pain, consistent with a diagnosis of sciatica, were evaluated. All patients had complaints for longer than 6 months and had recently undergone electrodiagnostic testing and computed tomography (CT). Correlation was made between symptoms, straight leg raising, clinical neurological deficits, electrodiagnostic and CT findings. The radiation of pain above or below the knee and pain on straight leg raising did not show a high correlation with each other or with neurological deficits or CT findings. Electrodiagnostic studies often defined a radiculopathy in patients with equivocal clinical signs. CT findings did not predict the nature of symptoms or clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Electrodiagnostic abnormalities showed the greatest ability to predict CT abnormalities. It is concluded that in chronic sciatica patients, no single diagnostic parameter is conclusive and a combination of clinical and laboratory findings is necessary to reach a diagnosis. In addition, many assumptions, valid in patients with acute pain cannot be extrapolated to patients with chronic sciatica."
CD007431,0,15614654,0,[Guidelines for back pain].,"Chronic back pain is one of our society's most important health problems, causing long periods of sick leave and early retirements. Recently the German Society of General Practice and Family Medicine (DEGAM) published an evidence-based guideline for low back pain. It has been developed according to the 10-step concept of guideline development of the DEGAM, aiming for early detection of complicated clinical conditions, avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic tests and prevention of chronicity. Complicated, uncomplicated and radicular pain are defined by patient history and a short clinical examination. Imaging and further diagnostic tests are reserved for patients at risk. Basic therapy consists of structured advice. The aim of the guideline is to get patients back to their usual activity supported by effective pain relief. Psychosocial factors which are important for the prognosis should be evaluated already during the first consultation. Manual therapy might help in acute pain. Patients with persistent pain symptoms and long periods of sick leave should be transferred to multiprofessional management including pain treatment, behavioural therapy and physiotherapy. A randomised controlled trial has been set up to study the efficacy of guideline implementation."

A total of 511 patients answered a battery of questionnaires, which included questions relating to intensity and duration of pain, the Japanese version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, limitation of daily functions, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire short-form and 34 items of behavioural contributing factors. Group IIIb showed significantly the highest age in all subtypes. Those in group I had higher depression scores than those in group II (P = 0.005). Group IIIa had a lower women's ratio than in group II (P = 0.001) and the patients showed a shorter pain duration than those in groups I (P = 0.000) and II (P = 0.001). Group IIIa patients also showed lower visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings for pain descriptors 'heavy' (P = 0.002) and 'tiring' (P = 0.004) than those of group I, and 'dull' (P = 0.005), 'heavy' (P = 0.001) and 'tiring' (P = 0.005) than those of group II. Group IIIa showed lower ratios of contributing factors of 'an awareness of grinding/clenching during sleep' (P = 0.000) and 'an awareness of clenching sensation when waking up at night' (P = 0.002) than those of group I, and also showed a higher ratio of 'a liking for a hard food' (P = 0.000) and lower ratio of 'talking for a long time on the telephone' (P = 0.001) than those of group II. In conclusion, although several properties were different between subtypes, the majority of them were similar in the four subtypes of TMD."

Patients were evaluated by an independent interviewer postoperatively, and at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Ratings were based upon the modified Macnab criteria. All patients presented with leg pain with or without back pain that had failed a minimum of 6 weeks conservative treatment (e.g., rest, NSAIDs, physical therapy, epidural steroid injections). Patients were not considered for LADD if the primary source of neurologic findings was a result of scar tissue from a previous discectomy, lateral recess or central stenosis, or sequestered discs. At 1 year postoperative follow-up, the surgical success rate was 84%. For patients requiring an additional LADD procedure, results at 6 month follow-up yielded surgical success rates of 92.3% and 90% for additional level and index level LADD, respectively. LADD appears to be a viable treatment modality for nonsequestered herniated nucleus pulposus recalcitrant to conservative treatment.

CD007431,0,8420516,0,Prospective evaluation of the course of disc herniations in patients with proven radiculopathy.,"Although surgery is often recommended as the definitive treatment for radiculopathy when definite disc herniation is demonstrated with imaging techniques, complete improvement can occur with nonoperative treatment. However, what happens to the disc in the latter circumstance is not well defined. We report the first prospective study in subjects with proven radiculopathy and definite disc herniation who improve with nonoperative management to determine what occurs to the herniated disc material. Eighteen subjects with lower extremity pain or paresthesia, positive straight leg raising, weakness in a myotomal distribution, reflex asymmetry, or electromyogram evidence of radiculopathy were studied. Subjects were admitted to the study if computed tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated definite disc herniation corresponding to the side and level of the radiculopathy. After complete clinical improvement, repeat CT scan was performed at six to 18 months after the initial study. The CT scans were interpreted separately by two neuroradiologists. Disc herniations were characterized by size (large, moderate, or minimal); the presence of absence of free fragments; and location. Follow-up scans were compared with the original study and characterized as resolved, improved, or unchanged. Fourteen subjects completed the study, an additional three had operative treatment, and one refused repeat scanning. Subjects were followed an average of 30.4 months with no recurrence of radicular symptoms during this follow-up period in 13 patients. One had recurrence of symptoms at 21 months and surgery at 26 months. Six follow-up scans (43%) were interpreted as completely resolved, five (36%) as improved, and three (21%) as unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD007431,0,8981896,1,Physical signs in lumbar disc hernia.,"In a prospective study of 163 consecutive patients operated on because they were thought to have lumbar disc hernia, the authors investigated whether physical signs could predict the degree of hernia (complete hernia, incomplete hernia, protruded disc, and normal disc) found at surgery. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that there were only 2 physical signs of diagnostic value: lumbar range of motion and crossed Lasegue sign. By these signs, 74% of the uncontained hernias and 68% of the contained hernias could be correctly classified. Discrimination also was made between intact annuli (negative exploration and protruded disc) versus ruptured annuli (incomplete hernias and complete hernias). Again, lumbar range of motion and crossed Lasègue sign were the only significant parameters, predicting 71% of the ruptured annuli and 80% of the intact annuli. These 2 physical signs are important because the degree of the hernia is the most important prognostic factor for the outcome of lumbar disc surgery. The degree of the hernia also has an impact on the choice of invasive therapy: open surgery, percutaneous surgery, or enzymatic nucleolysis. Neurologic signs often were absent, showed low correlation to the degree of the hernia, and had a limited value for predicting the level of the hernia. However, they are important for the differential diagnosis in distinguishing between radicular and referred pain."
CD007431,0,14506578,0,Documentation of brachial plexus compression (in the thoracic inlet) utilizing provocative neurosensory and muscular testing.,"Diagnosis and documentation of brachial plexus compression in the thoracic inlet, ""thoracic outlet syndrome"", remains difficult because the syndrome complex overlaps that of patients with cervical disc disease, intrinsic shoulder pathology, and peripheral nerve compression. While traditional electrodiagnostic testing can identify cervical radiculopathy and the rare isolated lower trunk compression, it cannot identify brachial plexus compression in the thoracic inlet. In 2000, neurosensory testing with the Pressure-Specified Sensory Device (PSSD) was applied to this diagnostic dilemma, demonstrating a significant increase in the one-point static touch cutaneous pressure threshold between controls and patients, when the index finger (upper trunk) and little finger (lower trunk) were tested with the hands at rest and after provoking the plexus by elevating the hands above the head. In the present study, this approach has been extended to include two-point static touch thresholds with the PSSD, and pinch and grip strength (Digit-Grip). Sixteen controls (mean: 34.2, range: 11 to 48 years) were tested and the 99 percent upper confidence limit calculated for percent change after elevation of the hands for 3 min. Forty-one patients symptomatic for brachial plexus compression (mean: 41.0, range: 21 to 62 years) were tested. The clinical severity of the plexus compression was dichotomized as either ""severe"" or ""not severe"" judged by the Roos and Tinel sign. Results demonstrated that when five or more of the eight possible neurosensory and motor test results were > 99 percent normal confidence limit for change, this testing has a sensitivity of 82 percent, a specificity of 100 percent, and a positive predictive value of 100 percent for the diagnosis of clinically severe brachial plexus compression. Seventeen patients who were in the ""severe"" category prior to surgery, were tested before and after plexus neurolysis and anterior scalenectomy. All 17 patients were clinically improved and in 16 of these patients, postoperative neurosensory and motor testing returned to a normal pattern (no significant increase in thresholds with hand elevation). It is concluded that neurosensory (PSSD) and motor testing (Digit-Grip) can help in the diagnosis and documentation of brachial plexus compression."

The potential was abnormal in 19 of the 20 surgically proven cases. The dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential is as accurate as myelography for diagnosis but has the advantage of being non-invasive and repeatable. It provides useful additional diagnostic and pathophysiological information about lumbo-sacral root compression.

For the dermatomal studies at least two trials of 512 responses were recorded from the vertex with reference to both the midfrontal and contralateral parietal electrodes, using an averaging technique. Findings on the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides were compared in each patient. We found that peroneal SSEPs were normal in all patients. Dermatomal SSEPs correctly identified the lesion in 5 patients. In 1 patient dermatomal SSEPs lateralized the lesion correctly but localized it to the adjacent root. In 10 cases dermatomal SSEPs gave misleading information, indicating an abnormality on the asymptomatic side in 1 patient and no abnormality in 9. In the remaining 3 patients, both SSEPs and radiological contrast studies failed to identify any lesion, although the radiculopathy was confirmed by electromyography. These findings raise doubt about the ultimate utility of these evoked potential techniques in the evaluation of patients with suspected radiculopathies."

CD007431,0,161216,0,The predictive utility of the orthopedic examination in identifying the low back pain patient with hysterical personality features.,"Physical examination of the patient with low back pain routinely includes a number of tests which are useful clinically to the orthopedist as suggestive of the presence of hysteria or malingering. These include tests of light touch differences medially and laterally in the same foot or leg, vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, forward flexion, straight-leg raising differences between the supine and sitting positions, and the Burns' bench test. The present study examined the specific predictive utility of these tests individually and as a composite battery in identifying low back pain patients with hysterical personality features. Twenty-five postoperative lumbar laminectomy and diskectomy patients were administered the MMPI and evaluated by physical examination. Silight to moderate correlations were found for each of the subtests with a Composite Hysteria Index derived from the MMPI. The predictability was improved by the use of a weighted combination of the individual tests obtained by multiple regression analysis. The results lend empirical support to: the predictive value of these clinical tests in definitively identifying 60% of those low back pain patients with hysterical personality features; decision rules for use in clinical practice were also developed."

All patients had failed to respond to conservative management, and the diagnosis had been confirmed by metrizamide myelography. Following a randomized schedule, 30 patients had intradiscal injections of chymopapain, and 30 patients had intradiscal injections of an equivalent volume of normal saline solution. Two years after the injection, 77% of patients treated with chymopapain were assessed as moderately improved, compared with 47% of saline-injected patients. Fifty-seven percent of the chymopapain group were free of pain, compared with 23% in the saline group. Based on the late results of this study, chymopapain is recommended for the treatment of sciatica from intervertebral disc herniation when conservative measures have failed and before disc fragment excision is considered."

CD007431,0,8727456,0,Persistent back pain and sciatica in the United States: patient characteristics.,"Low back pain is an extremely common, seriously disabling, nonfatal public health problem worldwide. The National Low Back Pain Study was a multicenter study of a large, heterogeneous group of patients who have been referred to either a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon for the evaluation and treatment of a persistent complaint of low back pain. In this paper, we characterize persistent low back pain patients and their complaints, describe the impact of persistent low back pain on the patients' functional and psychological status, report on the patients' medical characteristics, and identify treatments that are currently prescribed for these patients. Persistent low back pain is most common among people in their mid-to-late thirties and early-to-mid forties. The patients are mostly white, well educated, and generally affluent. The majority are gainfully employed, but some quit working because of pain and those who do tend to be less educated, and more likely to be involved in litigation. The average patient has had low back pain intermittently for 10 years. The pain is usually well localized but its severity varies considerably. Besides pain, most persistent low back pain patients report a variety of motor and sensory deficits. Patients also report significant functional impairment at work, at play, and at home. The typical patient does not, however, display significant psychological distress. Most patients have consulted multiple health care providers, have received a variety of treatments, and have used a variety of medications to alleviate pain; a few have been subjected to more aggressive treatment measures including surgery, intradiscal therapy, and narcotic and psychoactive drugs. None of these treatments has been effective. Physical examinations of these patients do not provide significant clues for making a definitive diagnosis. Nonspecific abnormalities such as muscle spasm, tenderness, and trigger points are quite common, but motor weakness and sensory deficits in the lower extremities, and reflex changes in the knees and ankles, are much less common. The classic combination of reflex changes, motor weakness, and sensory deficits associated with specific protruded discs are extremely rare even though one of three patients had a diagnosis of disc herniation. Diagnostic imaging studies revealed that the majority of persistent low back pain patients have spondylotic abnormalities involving root compression or lumbar instability or both, with root compression as the primary cause of the complaint. Myofascial syndrome and lumbar instability were the next most common diagnoses. After a thorough evaluation by specialists in spinal disorders, three of five persistent low back pain patients were prescribed an additional course of conservative therapy, one of five was prescribed surgery, and the rest were prescribed no treatment. Persistent low back pain patients appear to be a distinct group of low back pain patients who are different from patients who have similar nonpersistent acute symptoms and those who have the chronic pain syndrome characterized by significant behavioral and psychological co-morbidities."
CD007431,0,8727454,0,Clinical appearance of contained and noncontained lumbar disc herniation.,"In a prospective and consecutive study, we evaluated the incidence of common symptoms and neurologic disturbances in 200 patients operated on because of lumbar disc herniation by using a computer-coded protocol with pre- and perioperative registration. The preoperative occurrence of pain at rest, at night, and on coughing was registered. Use of analgesics and walking ability were registered as category data. At examination, a straight-leg-raising (SLR) test was graded in four categories, and results from neurologic findings were collected. At surgery, disc herniation was classified as extruded/sequestered herniation, prolapse, or focal protrusion. There were no significant differences concerning pain at rest or at night related to type of herniation. Pain on coughing was more common in extruded/sequestered herniations. Use of analgesics as well as severe reduction of walking capacity were significantly more common in patients with extrusion/sequestration. The highly restricted SLR test, as well as the crossed positive SLR test, were also significantly more common in patients with extruded/sequestered herniation, and this was also true for the incidence of relevant reflex/extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and sensory disturbance. In conclusion, the clinical appearance of lumbar disc herniation was most ""aggressive"" in extruded and sequestered disc herniation. The symptoms and signs in disc protrusion were less severe, whereas patients with prolapse had an ""intermediate"" appearance concerning symptoms and signs. The differences in incidence of common signs in noncontained versus contained herniation were statistically significant; these differences may be of clinical interest for patient selection and information as well as in pathophysiologic considerations."
CD007431,0,3031765,0,[The importance of thermography in the diagnosis of lumbar radicular pain syndromes].,"This study proved the existence of lateral differences in thermographic recordings of the legs of 83 out of a total of 84 patients with the clinical diagnosis ""lumbar disk herniation"". In 68.5 per cent only of 71 patients with unilateral symptoms, however, the hypothermic areas occurred in the symptomatic leg. These areas could not be matched with corresponding dermatomas. As regards determination of the level of the herniation, thermography is an unreliable method for differentiation between the different segments, because the site of the dermatoma cannot be identified in relation to the site of the herniation. The mechanism of difference in temperature distribution probably depends on sympathetic reflexes with increased activity in the vasoconstrictor system due to pain. These reflexes are not limited to one dermatoma. This has been confirmed by means of diagnostic nerve blocks of the appropriate root."

Clinical applications in gnathology.,"This investigation is focused on the analysis of the masseter responses evoked by means of magnetic and electric stimulation of the cortex and root of the trigeminal system of 20 healthy subjects. Moreover, in order to determine jaw elevation in centric occlusion, the analysis also focused on the motor response of the trigeminal bilateral roots evoked simultaneously using two stimulators. The masseter responses show a high level of symmetry in both latency and amplitude. The difference between the hinge axis in natural centric occlusion (CO) and in centric relation (CR) as determined by electric and magnetic transcranial stimulation is lesser than 2.5 mm. This is due to two main factors: (i) the response is evoked from the trigeminal motor neural pool involving all the masticatory muscles and hence simulating the natural 'muscular coactivation'; (ii) there is no manual manipulation to guide the jaw into the centric relation (CR). This method could be of some help for diagnosis in patients suffering from TMJ dysfunction who have lost stereognostic control over the jaw and display obvious signs of deviation during closure of the mandible."

CD007431,0,3231575,0,Evaluation and treatment of chemonucleolysis failures.,"Fifty patients underwent chemonucleolysis for the treatment of lumbar disk herniations unresponsive to conservative therapy. In patients treated with chymopapain, unrelieved sciatica was the most common cause of clinical treatment failure. Eight patients (16%) experienced no relief or only a transient reduction in their radicular symptoms following chymopapain injection. All eight patients were clinically reevaluated and underwent repeat neuroradiographic studies. Computed axial tomography and lumbar myelography demonstrated persistent nerve root compromise at the level of the injected disk space. Open diskectomy was performed in all eight cases. Postoperatively, seven patients noted complete resolution of their radicular symptoms; one patient had intermittent low back and leg pain following surgery."
CD007431,0,420553,0,Lumbosacral fusion by standing h-graft technique.,"Fusion of the lumbosacral spine was carried out on 44 patients. A modification of the standing H-graft technique was used in 41 of the patients. The operative diagnosis was degeneration of the lumbosacral spine in nearly two-thirds of the cases and spondylolisthesis in about one-third. Operations for low back or sciatic pain had previously been performed on 17 patients. The duration of postoperative bed rest ranged from one to six weeks; a lumbosacral corset was used at least for six weeks postoperatively. The average stay in hospital was 52 days. Complications occurred in five cases. The operative results of 40 patients were evaluated on the basis of a follow-up examination performed on average 3.6 years after operation. Nearly half the patients with radiologically successful fusions had a good subjective improvement and about one-fourth had returned to their previous or corresponding occupations. The operative result was at least fair in about half the patients, assessed by a measure of the patients' subjective improvement and working capacity. In the non-fusion group (six cases) the operative results were exclusively poor. Age over 40 years, long-standing preoperative disability and previous back operations proved prognostic factors for poor results. Assessed from functional radiographs, 63% of two-segment fusions and 95% of one-segment fusions were successful. The operative technique appeared simple and suitable for fusions of one spinal segment, but the value of the lumbosacral fusion in the treatment of low back pain seemed doubtful because of the great proportion of poor clinical results even following technically successful fusions."

CD007431,0,2384773,0,Leptomyelolipoma: analysis of 20 cases.,"Leptomyelolipoma (lumbosacral lipoma) is a common form of spinal dysraphism. The deficits produced include sensory, motor, bowel, and bladder dysfunction, and vary in incidence between the pediatric and adult populations. Twenty patients treated surgically at the Mount Sinai Hospital between 1972 and 1988 are reviewed. Fifty percent were 12 years of age or less and 50% were older than 18 years of age. The surgical approach was designed to accomplish untethering of the conus medullaris, debulking of the lipomatous mass compressing the cord, reconstruction of the dural canal, and reapproximation of the paraspinal muscles and lumbosacral fascia to prevent future trauma. Postoperatively, no patient experienced deterioration of neurological function. Of the symptomatic patients. 67% displayed dramatic improvement or became asymptomatic and 33% experienced stabilization of their deficits. The symptoms most resistant to surgical correction were orthopedic foot deformities and bowel dysfunction, whereas bladder dysfunction, motor weakness, and radiculopathies were most amenable to surgical therapy. Early surgical repair is recommended in these cases to forestall irreversible neurological damage."

Similar clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ""virgin"" herniated lumbar discs were used. All patients had low back or radicular pain unrelieved by a minimum of 4 weeks of conservative therapy. Physical findings included a positive straight leg raising sign, weakness of the appropriate muscle groups, and a sensory loss or evidence of depressed reflexes. All had myelograms or computed tomographic scans demonstrating an extradural defect. Compensation cases were eliminated. Results demonstrated a 90% marked improvement in the microdiscectomy category and a 58% marked improvement in the chemonucleolysis group. Four per cent of the microdiscectomy patients were unimproved, and 18% of the chemonucleolysis group required a subsequent surgical procedure. The average postoperative hospital stay was 3 days for both groups. Because of the necessity for reoperations in the chemonucleolysis group, chemonucleolysis seemed less cost-effective than microdiscectomy."

CD007431,0,11415594,0,Mechanical behaviour of hamstring muscles in low-back pain patients and control subjects.,"The purpose of this study was to measure and compare the passive elastic moment, the stiffness and the damping coefficient of the hip joint, as functions of the hip and knee joint angles in men with and without low-back pain. Two conventional tests, the straight-leg-raising test and the trunk forward flexion, were also performed and compared between these subjects. The passive elastic moment was measured using an isokinetic device in the passive mode. This device raised the lower limb from the horizontal position to the straight-leg-raising angle at a slow and constant angular velocity. A custom-made splint connected with the lever arm of the isokinetic device maintained the knee in extension and the ankle in the neutral position. The damping coefficient of the hip joint was measured for 0, 15, 45, 60, 75 and 90% of straight leg raising angle of each subject, using the suspension method based on small oscillation theory. To ensure that muscles were inactive during the passive hip moment tests, muscle activity was monitored with surface EMG. The stiffness was computed as the ratio of the change in passive elastic moment to the change in the hip angle. The passive elastic moment, the stiffness and the normalized trunk flexion were significantly different between the two groups respectively. There was, however, no difference between the two groups in the results of straight-leg-raise and damping coefficient of the hip. The passive elastic moment was a nonlinear function of the hip flexion angle and showed large intersubject differences, especially as the joint limit was approached. The damping coefficient was a polynomial function of the hip flexion angle. The measured variables were analysed using a discriminant function and it was shown that the two groups were clearly discriminable in a meaningful manner."

Neither time delay (time from surgery to the suspicion of the diagnosis) nor pain intensity (a subjective factor which might be obtunded by an analgesic drug) are valuable features.

The Hoffman (H)-reflex was tested before and after the injection of morphine in the epidural space. The reflex was chosen as a monitor of the function of monosynaptic pathways in the spinal cord. Analogue scales for the measurement of pain revealed a satisfactory decrease of nociception after morphine injection, while the H-reflex was not significantly affected. This study may confirm that monosynaptic reflexes are not affected by epidural administration of morphine and that they are probably not involved in pain transmission."

In a prospective cohort study (N = 1,067), we examined associations between worker sociodemographic and other characteristics and opioid prescription within six weeks of the first medical visit for workers' compensation claims for work loss due to back injury. We examined administrative, pharmacy, and worker-reported data. In bivariate logistic regression models, Hispanics were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive opioid prescriptions, and very high body mass index, daily tobacco use, greater pain and physical disability, pain radiating below the knee, injury severity categorizations (from medical records) of major sprain and radiculopathy, and worse mental health were associated with opioid prescription. Adjusting for demographics, pain intensity, and physical disability, opiate prescription was significantly associated with daily tobacco use, pain radiating below the knee, and injury severity categories (major sprain and radiculopathy). Knowledge of worker characteristics associated with early opioid prescription may be useful in future studies of the role of early pain treatment in influencing subsequent course of pain and disability among workers with back injuries."

Examinations of 36 patients with 57 cases of such compression neuropathies have demonstrated that the main etiological moments of the disease are orthopedic diseases, illnesses of the joints and veins of the lower limbs and loading factor. The major clinical symptoms of the disease are spontaneous pains at the site of nerve compression, paresthesias, disorders of sensitivity in the area of innervation of the damaged nerve as well as pains on palpation at the level of nerve compression. Diagnosis is verified by the positive tests inducing pains and paresthesias and by stimulation electromyography. The principal treatment method lies in paraneural injection of glucocorticoids."

There is backache and sciatica, occasionally after trauma, and straight leg raising is usually limited with signs of L-5 or S-1 root compression. The only distinguishing clinical characteristic is that the pain is worse on recumbency and relieved by sitting or walking.

CD007431,0,12955608,0,Outcome of the Graf ligamentoplasty procedure compared with anterior lumbar interbody fusion with the Hartshill horseshoe cage.,"The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy of Graf ligamentoplasty in comparison with rigid fixation and fusion with the Hartshill horseshoe cage for similar severity of disc degeneration. Although studies have been done on the Graf ligamentoplasty procedure and the Hartshill horseshoe cage, their efficacy has never been compared in any study. This study was done to decide whether retaining mobility and stabilizing the spine is best or stiffening the lumbar segment by fusion is preferable. Between 1995 and 1997, a prospective randomized study was performed comparing Graf ligament stabilization and anterior lumbar interbody fusion. Twenty-eight patients had single-level Graf ligaments inserted and 27 patients had single-level anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) with a Hartshill horseshoe cage and tricortical iliac crest autograft. The two groups were similar in age, sex, symptoms, severity of the disc degeneration, and duration of follow-up. The chi-square test and t-test were used to evaluate the outcome. At a minimum follow-up of 2.1 years, we found that 93% of patients who had undergone Graf ligamentoplasty had a satisfactory outcome (rated ""excellent"" or ""better"") compared to 77.8% of patients who had been treated with ALIF with Hartshill horseshoe cage stabilization and fusion, when measured on the Oswestry Disability Index ( P<0.05). Retaining mobility in the lumbar segments gives better results after stabilisation with Graf ligaments than rigid fixation and fusion with the Hartshill horseshoe cage in the short term. We will be watching this cohort of patients over the next few years."

Patient groups were similar in respect of anthropometric data. The indication for using the semi-rigid technique was a fairly stable intraoperative situation; for the more common unstable situations, the rigid technique was chosen. Selecting implant rigidity on these criteria led to results with an improvement rate well within the upper success range reported in the literature. Among people in employment, a lengthy preoperative sick leave was an important predictor for unsatisfactory outcome."

Comparative study with conventional myelography].,"65 patients with nerve root compression syndrome were examined using a new type of MR-technique, which is comparable to the conventional X-ray myelography. The results of the prospective case study were compared with previous clinical experiences (1). For the examinations a 1.0T whole body MR-system (Siemens Magnetom Impact) was used. A strong T2*-weighted 3D-FISP sequence (TR = 73 ms, TE = 21 ms, alpha = 7 degrees) was applied in sagittal orientation using a circularly polarized oval spine coil. To obtain fat suppression a frequency selective 1-3-3-1 prepulse was applied prior to the imaging sequence. The acquired 3D-data set was evaluated using a Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) program. Our results confirmed earlier experiences which showed that the diagnostic sensitivity of 3D-MR myelography (3D-MRM) is comparable to that of conventional X-ray myelography. In cases of severe spinal canal stenosis and spondylolisthesises, and in cases of postoperative scar tissue with nerve root compressions, the sensitivity of the 3D-MRM is higher as compared to that of conventional X-ray myelography."

CD007431,0,6457838,0,Clinical studies of isolated disc resorption in the lumbar spine.,"Low lumbar pain with radiation into the leg is a common symptom pattern caused by a number of pathological processes. Isolated disc resorption is one such entity which can be readily identified and is amenable to surgical treatment. This study consisted of two groups of patients. Group I were 50 patients suffering from isolated disc resorption at L5--S1 with ill-defined low backache extending into the buttocks and down one or both legs, but not into the feet. Clinical signs of nerve root dysfunction were found in 16 per cent of patients. Radiographic changes with loss of disc height, facet over-riding and intrusion into the nerve root canal and intervertebral foramen were common and frequently associated with sclerosis of the vertebral end-plate. Group II were a series of 45 patients with isolated disc resorption independently reviewed an average of 45 months after surgical decompression of the S1 (98 per cent) or lower lumbar nerve roots. Based on objective grading by the clinician and subjective assessment by the patient complete success was achieved in 62 per cent of the patients and partial success in 24 per cent. Provided there is full appreciation of the pathological anatomy, strict diagnostic criteria and meticulous surgery, decompression of the nerve root canal is a useful surgical procedure in severely disabled patients suffering from isolated disc resorption."

CD007431,0,11243472,0,Withdrawal reflex organisation to electrical stimulation of the dorsal foot in humans.,"The present study investigated excitatory reflex receptive fields for various muscle reflex responses and reflex mediated ankle joint movements using randomised electrical stimulation of the dorsal and plantar surface of the foot in 12 healthy subjects. Eleven electrodes (0.5-cm2 cathodes) were mounted on the dorsal side and three on the plantar side of the foot. A low (1.5 times pain threshold) and a high (2.3 times pain threshold) stimulus intensity were used to elicit the reflexes. EMG signals were recorded from tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), soleus (SO), biceps femoris (BF), and rectus femoris (RF) muscles together with the ankle movement measured by a goniometer. The withdrawal pattern evoked from the dorsal side consisted of two separate responses with different receptive fields: (1) early EMG responses in GM and BF (50-120 ms) evoking knee flexion, probably of purely spinal origin, and (2) a late response in GM and SO (120-200 ms) that may be under supraspinal control. The ankle flexor TA was significantly activated in both time windows, but in 11 of 12 subjects its contraction was too small to cause significant dorsal flexion. In the ankle joint inversion was the most dominant movement. Stimulation of the plantar side resulted in activation of TA when stimulating the forefoot and in activation of triceps surae when stimulating the heel. These observations show that painful stimuli activate appropriate muscles depending on stimulus location to initiate the adequate withdrawal. For proximal muscles (e.g. knee flexors) the receptive field covers almost the entire foot (dorsal and plantar sides) while more distal muscles have a smaller receptive field covering only a part of the foot. This adequate withdrawal movement suggests a more refined withdrawal reflex organisation than a stereotyped flexion of all joints to avoid tissue damage."

The progression of slipping was small and not correlated to age at diagnosis and initial degree of spondylolisthesis. Disc height reduction at the spondylolytic level occurred at an earlier age and was more severe than in a normal control group. Symptoms were correlated to radiographic pathology. Risk factors for low-back symptoms were greater than 25% slipping, low lumbar index in L5 spondylolysis, spondylolysis at the L4 level, and early disc degeneration."

The electrodiagnostic findings were classified as abnormal only by the needle examination and only if muscles demonstrated active denervation or a marked neurogenic motor unit potential firing pattern. In comparison to other surgical, intraoperative root stimulation, and clinical studies, we found several differences. Overall, there was little overlap among L-2-4, L-5, and S-1 radiculopathies. The tibialis anterior was predominantly L-5 innervated, the gastrocnemius (medial and lateral head) predominantly S-1 innervated, and the biceps femoris (short and long head) exclusively S-1 innervated. The two heads of biceps femoris were not affected in any patients with L-5 radiculopathy in whom they were examined. These findings help guide both the clinician and surgeon in the diagnosis and treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathies."

CD007431,0,7453968,0,Stenosis of the lumbar vertebral canal and sciatica.,"Stenosis of the vertebral canal is a form of compressive stenosis in contrast to transport stenosis of vessels or other channels. The concept, definition and pathomorphological properties are discussed. As it is a form of compressive stenosis, the diagnosis is based on measurements of diameters rather than of cross-sectional surfaces. The biomechanical action of compressive stenosis is compression of the fixed living content at two opposite sites or at all sites. The special properties of sciatica in stenosis are described and presented in tabular form. Some properties of neurogenic intermittent claudication (I. Cl.) in the presence of stenosis are discussed. There is a predominance of sciatica at rest and of motor weakness during walking. The mechanism of neurogenic I. Cl. is obscure. Stenosis of the lumbar vertebral canal is one of the conditional determinants of I. Cl. The data presented in this paper demonstrate, however, that stenosis is not an absolute determinant of I. Cl. and that its production depends on the combination with other determinants. The theory is advanced that other determinants may be related to changes in the caudal nerve roots due to either constitutional properties or to subclinical changes induced by ageing and chronic wear and tear, and compression and traction in the area of stenosis during various bodily activities. Suppression of sciatica during I. Cl. is a phenomenon which is particularly difficult to explain."

We did not observe any significant ipsilateral intertrial variations and arithmetic mean side-to-side differences in normal subjects. As for segmental latencies, the dermatomal P40 latencies were directly correlated with height. The regression equations for L4, L5 and S1 dermatomes were as follows: (L4) y = 5.8 + 21.3 (height), (L5) y = -2.09 + 28.04 (height), (S1) y = -13.9 + 36.4 (height). Maximum side-to-side latency differences and maximum P 40 latencies were obtained by adding 2 standard deviations to the arithmetic means. The abnormal latencies for L4, L5 and S1 dermatomes were 48 msec., 52 msec., and 55 msec., respectively. The abnormal side-to-side latency difference were 3 msec. for all dermatomes. DSEPs accurately predicted the lesion only in four patients (7.2%). In 20 patients (36.3%), DSEPs correctly identified the lesion but also gave misleading information on the other levels. DSEP abnormality were on the correct level but opposite side in 5 patients (9%). The findings were normal in 11 patients (20%), and misleading in 15 patients (27.2%). We conclude that the ultimate diagnostic utility of DSEPs in lumbosacral radiculopathies is doubtful and controversial needs further investigations."

A comparison with radiculography, computed tomography, and operative findings.","Fifty nerve root infiltration studies were evaluated prospectively in a consecutive series of 50 patients referred to the Sheffield Problem Back Clinic with complicated back problems. All were over 35 years of age (mean, 51 years). Ten (20%) demonstrated abnormal segmentation of the lumbar spine. Sixteen (32%) had undergone previous surgery. Before nerve root infiltration all patients were investigated by radiculography and computed tomography. Nerve root infiltration identified two types of response. In 20 patients, infiltration reproduced the symptomatic pain, which then was abolished by local anesthetic--the positive result. These patients were considered suitable for surgery. One patient in this group had spontaneous resolution of pain and thus did not undergo operative treatment. In 30 patients, infiltration did not reproduce the symptomatic pain regardless of the level studied, or only partially reproduced the pain at two or more levels--the negative result. Radiculography and computed tomography in these patients also was inconsistent. This group were considered unsuitable for surgery. In those patients undergoing surgical decompression, nerve root infiltration correctly identified the symptomatic level in 18 of the 19. Computed tomography and radiculography identified the level in 14 and 12 patients, respectively."
CD007431,0,3405411,0,CT-diskography in the evaluation of the postoperative lumbar spine. Preliminary results.,"Thirty-three patients with recurrent sciatica after lumbar-disk surgery were studied for recurrent herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) by CT alone and CT-diskography (CTD). Twenty-six patients underwent surgical reexploration allowing correlation with CTD. CTD made a correct diagnosis of recurrent HNP in twenty-one patients showing an extravasation of the contrast medium from the disk space into the medullary canal. In two cases CTD was positive for recurrent HNP but surgery showed only fibrosis. The amount of contrast leak was very small in these two cases along the posterior common longitudinal ligament, and the junction with the disk was very narrow. Because of their clinical presentation three patients with negative studies were operated upon. One showed only fibrosis and the two others showed an associated disk fragment. Among the twenty-one true-positive cases, seven showed a combination of recurrent HNP and scarring. Contamination of CSF by the contrast medium through the dura was observed in two patients. Although a prospective comparative study between CTD and IV-contrast-enhanced CT is necessary, CTD appears to be a useful diagnostic procedure for recurrent HNP after surgery of the lumbar spine."

CD007431,0,1833832,0,The failed posterior lumbar interbody fusion.,"The problems presented by unsuccessful posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) have not been addressed. The cases of 12 patients who presented with failed PLIF were reviewed. Five patients were male and seven female (age range, 24-50 years; mean age, 40 years). All patients underwent at least one PLIF; many had undergone other procedures. A total of 37 procedures had been performed on the 12 patients. Chronic radiculopathy was present in all patients, as detected with electromyographic or nerve conduction velocity examination. At the time of reconstructive surgery, in the 11 patients in whom the canal was explored, all had extensive epidural fibrosis. Nine of the 12 patients had pseudarthrosis of the previous PLIF. Four patients had evidence of motion segment dysfunction at nearby levels: two had positive discograms adjacent to the PLIFs; one developed a facet syndrome at L5-S1, caudal to an L4-5 PLIF; and one demonstrated frank segmental instability at L2-3, cranial to a previous PLIF at L3-4. Twelve patients underwent a total of 22 procedures after referral. Eleven patients initially underwent decompression and fusion, and one patient underwent a sympathectomy. Seven patients underwent an additional 10 procedures, including repeat decompression, repair of pseudarthrosis, and implantation of an epidural analgesic pump system. After all surgical treatment, five patients rated their pain as improved. Seven patients were thought to have a solid fusion. The presence of a solid fusion did not correlate with satisfactory relief of pain (chi-square). Continued extremity pain was the predominant complaint of all the patients. Two shortcomings of the PLIF were evident.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,12962295,0,Microsurgical management of postoperative disc space infection.,"We analysed seventeen patients with septic postoperative spondylodiscitis (POD) who were managed by early microsurgical removal of the infected necrotic tissue, application of a closed suction-irrigation system (for a mean of 6.7 days), and early mobilisation. The POD was diagnosed clinically by elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) values and radiographically by computerised tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging. According to the sensitivity studies of the obtained pathogens, systemic antibiotics were given, followed by early mobilisation of all patients in a light cast corset. Immediate pain relief was noted in all patients except one, who required a third operation that was followed by rapid clinical improvement. Bacteriological diagnosis was obtained in 88% of the patients. Excellent or good clinical long-term results were achieved in 82% of the patients, whereas 18% had poor results. Elevated ESR/CRP values returned to normal ranges within 6 to 44 days (mean 15 days) after reoperation. All but one patient tolerated early mobilisation (within 2 to 4 weeks) well without any complication. Early microsurgical removal of the necrotic and infected tissue and application of a closed suction-irrigation system supported by specific antibiotic therapy should be considered an effective means to treat POD, thereby avoiding a prolonged period of unpleasant immobilisation for the patient."

These cases could be divided into two groups by the relative level of conus medullaris to that of L3 body, i.e. 34 cases in which the conus medullaris is tethered below the superior border of L3 body were classified into low placed conus medullaris (LPCM) and 43 in which the conus medullaris is located above the same level into the tight filum terminale (TFT). As to symptoms and signs, incontinence, gait disturbance, foot and toe deformities, lumbosacral tumor and sacral dimple were seen more often in the LPCM group. On the other hand, nocturia, pain in the back and in the lower limbs, positive Lasègue sign and tight back were seen more often in the TFT group. Neurological signs were seen more often in the LPCM group. In 3 cases of LPCM, and 10 of TFT, spina bifida was not visualized on the plain X-ray film of the spinal column. LPCM could be definitively diagnosed by myelography taken with the patient lying in the supine position, on the other hand myelography did not always give definitive diagnosis of TFT. Surgery for releasing the tethering conus was carried out in 58 of 77 cases. Of which 49 have been followed up more than 2 months after operation. Some degree of improvement of various symptomes and signs, was noted in 35 (68%) of these patients."

CD007431,0,17977762,0,Functional magnetic resonance imaging of cerebral activation during spinal cord stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome patients.,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) consisting of electrical stimulation of the dorsal spinal cord using epidural electrodes has been shown to relieve chronic neuropathic pain. To analyze the cerebral activation patterns related to SCS, and to evaluate the effects of SCS on the processing of acute experimental pain, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on eight patients suffering from failed back surgery syndrome who were also being treated with SCS for severe pain in their legs and lower back. Three types of stimulation were used, each lasting 36s: (i) SCS, (ii) heat pain (HP) applied to the leg affected by neuropathic pain, and (iii) simultaneous HP and SCS. During SCS, we found increased activation of the medial primary sensorimotor cortex somatotopically corresponding to the foot and/or perineal region, contralateral posterior insula, and the ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). Decreased activation was seen in the bilateral primary motor cortices and the ipsilateral primary somatosensory cortex corresponding to the shoulder, elbow and hand. Compared to separately presented HP and SCS, simultaneous HP and SCS showed statistically significant activation of the bilateral inferior temporal cortex and the ipsilateral cerebellar cortex. The activation of the primary motor cortex, insula and S2 during SCS may directly interfere with the processing of neuropathic pain. When SCS is associated with heat pain, the paralimbic association cortex and cerebellum show activation exceeding the sum of activations resulting from separate SCS and heat pain stimulation. The explanation of this could possibly rest with the continuous comparisons of simultaneous pain and somatosensory sensations occurring in a single dermatome."

CD007431,0,9352617,0,On surgical intervention in the temporomandibular joint.,"The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the indications for and the results of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery in patients with long-standing severe orofacial pain and dysfunction as well as in patients with fractures of the condylar neck. The patients with long-standing pain and dysfunction had had symptoms for a mean time of 4 years, had been treated conservatively for a mean time of 2.5 years, and had undergone numerous conservative treatment methods without improvement except for a minor increase in mouth opening capacity. The indications for surgery were strict; only 1% or less of all the patients referred to the departments with a diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) were prescribed surgery, which was considered to be the only remaining option. The TMJ surgery reduced pain, sleeping problems, and analgesic consumption and improved mouth opening capacity. The procedure showed low morbidity except for a facial nerve disturbance in three patients. Postoperatively, the bite force was observed to be normalised, and the radiographic examination showed moderate to severe osteoarthrotic changes. These changes, though extensive, were considered to be the normal outcome of diskectomy and without clinical significance, even though they resembled degenerative joint disease. In study V, surgery was performed on patients with a clear diagnosis of anterior disk displacement (ADD) with or without reduction. The preoperative pain and mouth opening capacity were markedly improved as well as other subjective symptoms. Although surgical morbidity was low, some radiographic changes were clearly detectable. In agreement with earlier reports, patients with a distinct diagnosis of ADD with or without reduction were clearly helped by diskectomy. In cases of ADD with or without reduction, it can be concluded that unsuccessful conservative treatment should not exceed 3-6 months but be discontinued in favour of the documented advantages of surgery in these cases. Patients with ankylosis should be treated surgically without delay. Unclear diagnoses such as arthralgia and osteoarthrosis with symptoms should be excluded from surgery unless overlapping muscular hyperactivity has been excluded as a major cause of the patients problem. Diskectomy is a useful surgical procedure for patients with severe long-standing TMD. It was shown in study VI that patients with dislocated fractures of the condylar neck can be successfully treated with open surgical reduction when the dislocation is large and associated with symptoms and limited function. When cognitive-behavioural profiles were measured psychometrically in study VII, a dysfunctional profile was more common in patients with myofascial pain and pain with an obscure origin than in other patients diagnosed with TMD. The dysfunctional profile was also common in patients in whom treatment of a conservative or surgical nature had failed. Among TMD patients with disk displacement, adaptive copers were most common in successfully diskectomized patients and least common in patients about to undergo invasive treatment."

In the remaining 10 patients (20%), it was negative; in this group the myelogram correctly predicted the lesion in 8 (80%). Sector CT correctly predicted the nature of the lesion in 24 patients (48%), was incorrect in 14 (28%), and gave incomplete findings in 12 (24%). CT was most accurate when it demonstrated a disc protrusion as the only finding. In this group, sector CT correctly predicted the operative findings in 24 of 25 patients (96%). CT was less accurate when spondylitic compression was diagnosed. This study suggests that sector CT is a useful test in the evaluation of patients with sciatica and that, when a soft herniated disc is demonstrated on CT, myelography may be omitted."

CD007431,0,8113853,0,A long-term outcome analysis of 984 surgically treated herniated lumbar discs.,"This paper presents a long-term follow-up study of 984 patients operated on for a herniated lumbar disc between 1959 and 1991. It was possible to follow 98% of patients from the time of operation to the time of writing. The mean follow-up period was 10.8 years. The most common presenting complaint was back pain with sciatica in one leg; the most frequent neurological finding was impaired straight-leg raising. Myelography confirmed the diagnosis in 80% of patients, but more recently enhanced computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have been the preferred studies. The operative procedure was either hemilaminectomy or laminectomy with x 3.5 magnification and fiberoptic lighting. Herniated lumbar discs involved L4-5 and L5-S1 with equal frequency (47%). The recurrence rate was 6%, one-third of which developed during the 1st year after operation. The complication rate was 4%; there were no intraoperative vascular or intestinal injuries. The Prolo Functional Economic Outcome Rating Scale was used to measure long-term outcome and the results were compared to those of Pappas, et al. Patients who did sedentary work and housewives had statistically higher total and economic Prolo scores (p < 0.01) than those who did strenuous work. The majority of patients with the ""failed-back syndrome"" had pending legal or Workers' Compensation claims, or were at psychological risk for surgery. In 89% of patients the outcome was good--defined as a Prolo score of 8 in 10%, 9 in 19%, and 10 in 60%."
CD007431,0,10664304,0,The active straight leg raising test and mobility of the pelvic joints.,"Objective signs to assess impairment in patients who are disabled by peripartum pelvic girdle pain hardly exist. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical test to quantify and qualify disability in these patients. The study examined the relationship between impaired active straight leg raising (ASLR) and mobility of pelvic joints in patients with peripartum pelvic girdle pain, focusing on (1) the reduction of impairment of ASLR when the patient was wearing a pelvic belt, and (2) motions between the pubic bones measured by X-ray examination when the patient was standing on one leg, alternating left and right. Twenty-one non-pregnant patients with peripartum pelvic girdle pain in whom pain and impairment of ASLR were mainly located on one side were selected. ASLR was performed in the supine position, first without a pelvic belt and then with a belt. The influence of the belt on the ability to actively raise the leg was assessed by the patient. Mobility of the pelvic joints was radiographically visualized by means of the Chamberlain method. Assessment was blinded. Ability to perform ASLR was improved by a pelvic belt in 20 of the 21 patients (binomial two-tailed P = 0.0000). When the patient was standing on one leg, alternating the symptomatic side and the reference side, a significant difference between the two sides was observed with respect to the size of the radiographically visualized steps between the pubic bones (binomial two-tailed P = 0.01). The step at the symptomatic side was on average larger when the leg at that side was hanging down than when the patient was standing on the leg at that side. Impairment of ASLR correlates strongly with mobility of the pelvic joints in patients with peripartum pelvic girdle pain. The ASLR test could be a suitable instrument to quantify and qualify disability in diseases related to mobility of the pelvic joints. Further studies are needed to assess the relationship with clinical parameters, sensitivity, specificity and responsiveness in various categories of patients. In contrast with the opinion of Chamberlain, that a radiographically visualized step between the pubic bones is caused by cranial shift of the pubic bone at the side of the standing leg, it is concluded that the step is caused by caudal shift of the pubic bone at the side of the leg hanging down. The caudal shift is caused by an anterior rotation of the hip bone about a horizontal axis near the sacroiliac joint."

CD007431,0,10664306,0,Recurrent pain after lumbar discectomy: the diagnostic value of peridural scar on MRI.,The association between peridural scarring and recurrent pain after lumbar discectomy is much debated. A recently published study found that patients with extensive peridural fibrosis were 3.2 times more likely to experience recurrent radicular pain than those with less extensive scarring. This finding may lead to an overestimation of peridural fibrosis in clinical practice. In a retrospective study we analyzed the records of 53 patients who underwent a lumbar MRI because of recurrent pain after first unilateral microdiscectomy. Patients were classified as those with radicular or non-radicular pain according to history and clinical findings. The diagnosis was confirmed by spinal anesthetic block. The extension of scarring was compared between the two groups of patients. The amount of epidural fibrosis was examined on contrast-enhanced MRI in axial slices subdivided into four quadrants. The amount of fibrosis was divided into four stages in each affected quadrant. We found no differences regarding the amount of peridural fibrosis between patients with radicular pain and patients with non-radicular pain. We conclude that the extent of peridural scarring as defined by MRI is of minor value in the differential diagnosis of recurrent back and leg pain after lumbar microdiscectomy.

In this study, findings from radiography, computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy with SPECT in 34 patients with chronic back pain were examined to determine the nature and clinical relevance of the lesions. Twenty-seven patients had lesions at SPECT, of whom 24 (89%) had abnormalities at CT and 18 (67%) had abnormalities at radiography. SPECT allowed identification of 54 lesions, of which only 20 (37%) were detected with planar imaging. Forty-three (80%) SPECT lesions were located at the site of an abnormality also seen at CT and 20 (37%) at the site of an abnormality also seen at radiography.

Nonendoscopic percutaneous laser disc decompression was performed under x-ray control via the posterolateral approach with side-firing probes. All patients with chronic back pain who had reproduced pain during discography of a nature, pattern, and distribution similar to what they experienced normally were included in the study. Magnetic resonance which confirmed stenosis and sequestrated discs, and patients with acute neurological findings were excluded from the study. Laser disc decompression or ablation was done using the KTP532 wavelength. The functional outcome was assessed prospectively using the Oswestry Disability Index. Clinical benefit was considered significant in those patients with a percentage change in the index of > or =50% at review 3-9 years (mean, 5.33 years) following surgery. A total of 52% of patients demonstrated a sustained significant clinical benefit, with an additional 21% in whom functional improvement was noted. Cohort integrity was 67%. Long-term benefit of the laser disc ablation and decompression for discogenic pain suggests a mechanism other than principally mechanical as a cause of chronic back and sciatic pain. It may suggest that efficacy occurs by reduction in the intradiscal production of irritative products and by an effect upon discal and annular neoneuralization. The sustained nature of the benefit after long-term preoperative symptoms (mean, 4.7 years) rules out any placebo effect. Selection should be restricted to patients without significant lateral recess stenosis, retrolisthesis or olisthesis of > or =3 mm, significant dorsal or foraminal osteophytosis, extrusion, or sequestration."

CD007431,0,12933410,0,Can quantitative sensory testing predict the outcome of epidural steroid injections in sciatica? A preliminary study.,"Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) is a psycho-physiological test used to identify dysfunction of individual nerve fiber types. In the present study, we investigated whether selective nerve fiber dysfunction, as assessed by QST, correlates with the effectiveness of epidural steroid injections (ESI) in patients with lumbar radiculopathy. Twenty patients with unilateral painful sciatica caused by disc herniation participated in this open study. Before ESI, quantitative thermal and mechanical sensory testing was conducted at the most painful dermatome and the contralateral dermatome. The primary outcome measure used was the self-recording of pain intensity twice daily with a 0-10 numerical pain scale (NPS). Secondary efficacy measures included the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the straight leg raising test, and the lumbar range of motion. A significant difference in all types of sensory thresholds between the affected and the contralateral dermatomes was detected at baseline. All outcome measures improved subsequent to the ESI. A significant positive correlation was found between the increase in cold sensation thresholds of the affected dermatome (Adelta-fiber dysfunction) and the improvement in NPS. The increase in touch and vibration thresholds (Abeta-fiber dysfunction) was found to be inversely correlated with the improvement in NPS. No correlation was found between heat sensation thresholds (C fibers) and any of the outcome measures. These results suggest that QST has the potential to be an important tool in the selection of the appropriate treatment (e.g., ESI versus surgery) for patients with sciatica and may assist in identifying the mechanisms of pain generation in these patients."

They were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 79 months (31 to 161) to determine the clinical and radiological outcome. The clinical results were collected by an independent observer, who was not involved in patient selection, treatment or follow-up, using a combination of outcome measures, including the Oswestry Disability Index. Pain was recorded using a visual analogue score, and the most recent radiographs were reviewed. Survival of the device was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and showed a cumulative survival of 35% at 156 months when radiological failure was taken as the endpoint. The mean improvement in the Oswestry disability index scores after disc replacement was 14% (6% to 21%) and the mean improvement in the pain score was 1.6 (0.46 to 2.73), both falling below the clinically significant threshold. Removal of the implant was required in 12 patients, four because of implant failure. These poor results indicate that further use of this implant is not justified."

The increase of the CSF total protein concentration in sciatica without spinal block is assumed to be due to leak of plasma proteins into the CSF from the nerve root. A relationship between CSF protein concentrations and certain clinical parameters has been found. At myelography, 10 ml of CSF was collected for analysis. The patients were evaluated for involvement of the nerve root and/or the dural sac, respectively. The neurologic parameters investigated were: straight leg raising tests, paresis, disturbances of sensibility, and altered reflexes. At follow-up, the patients were asked to fill in questionnaires concerning job function, sick leave or disability pension, subjective physical disability and pain perception, and a clinical examination with the same neurologic parameters was performed. Elevated CSF total protein concentration was related to chronic leg pain, leg pain, and subjective physical disability at follow-up. Nonoperated women reported higher subjective physical disability scores and were more often on sick-leave or disability pension than were men at follow-up. Lateral prolapses were associated with good job function outcome and less risk for sick-leave or disability pension. Reduced lower extremity reflexes, laterally located disc herniation and elevated CSF total protein concentration were associated with a favorable long-term outcome in patients with sciatica. CSF proteins as objective measures on nerve root injury are discussed. CSF total protein concentration can be regarded as an indicator of the functional status of the nerve root and a prognostic factor in patients with sciatica."
CD007431,0,9438815,0,Effects of intravenous lipoprostaglandin E1 on neurogenic intermittent claudication.,"Circulation disturbances in the cauda equina and nerve roots have been implicated in the genesis of neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). We report the clinical results of lipoprostaglandin E1 (lipo-PGE1) treatments in patients with NIC. Lipo-PGE1 was administered intravenously for 10 consecutive days to 40 patients, 31 of whom showed a response to the treatment. Of the clinical symptoms examined, walking ability and leg numbness were significantly improved with an average effective period of 2.5 months. However, patients with radicular pain and severely affected patients did not respond well. Nerve root circulation in eight patients who subsequently underwent surgery was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter. We observed increased blood flow in seven of these eight patients, after the intraoperative administration of lipo-PGE1. Lipo-PGE1 produced symptomatic improvement for a limited period in the treatment of NIC associated with LSS. The drug appeared to exert its effects through an increase in the circulation of blood in the nerve roots and the cauda equina."

Clinical parameters such as pain on motion, lumbar range of motion, straight leg raising test, deep tendon reflexes, dermatomal sensations, motor functions and neurogenic claudication distances were assessed at admission and were compared after a conservative treatment program was completed. A conservative treatment program consisted of physical therapy (infrared heating, ultrasonic diathermy and active lumbar exercises) and salmon calcitonin. Pain on motion (100%), restriction of extension (77%), limited straight leg raising test (23%), neurogenic claudication (100%), dermatomal sensory impairment (47%), motor deficit (29%), and reflex deficit (40%) were observed in the patients. All aforementioned disturbances except reflex deficits improved by the conservative treatment and results were statistically significant. The authors conclude that this conservative treatment should be the treatment of choice in elderly patients and in those patients without clinical surgical indications."

CD007431,0,8278854,0,Evaluation of clinical lumbar instability using the treadmill.,"The physical signs of lumbar instability have not yet been clearly defined. Furthermore, they do not always coincide with the abnormal movement on flexion-extension radiographs. Thus, the treadmill was used to evaluate clinical lumbar instability. The subjects were 82 patients with degenerative lumbar disease aggravated by walking or daily physical activities. The reproduction and provocation of low-back pain or pain in the lower extremities was examined during walking on a treadmill. The responses of the reproduction and provocation of the symptoms were divided into four grades. Fifteen cases were examined again using a treadmill after body casting to determine the indication for fusion surgery. As a result, the responses in the reproduction or provocation test using a treadmill manifest more dominant reflection of clinical symptoms suggesting clinical lumbar instability than the existence of the abnormal movement on flexion-extension radiographs. Reexamination after body casting was useful to determine the indications of fusion operations. The reproduction or provocation test using a treadmill was implied as a possible functional evaluation method of clinical lumbar instability."
CD007431,0,17180400,0,Headache in patients with cervical radiculopathy: a prospective study with selective nerve root blocks in 275 patients.,"Since many years we routinely use diagnostic selective nerve root blocks (SNRB) at our department when evaluating patients with cervical radiculopathy. Frequently patients who also presented with headache reported that the headache disappeared when the nerve root responsible for the radicular pain was blocked with local anaesthetics. Headache has been described as a companioning symptom related to cervical radiculopathy but has never before been evaluated with SNRB performed in the lower cervical spine. For this reason we added to our routine an evaluation of the response from the SNRB on headache in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The aim was to describe the frequency of headache in patients with cervical radiculopathy and its response to a selective nerve root block of the nerve root/roots responsible for the radiculopathy. Can nerve root compression in the lower cervical spine produce headache? In this consecutive series of 275 patients with cervical radiculopathy, 161 patients reported that they also suffered from daily or recurrent headache located most often unilaterally on the same side as the radiculopathy. All patients underwent a careful clinical examination by a neurosurgeon and a MRI of the cervical spine. The significantly compressed root/roots, according to the MRI, underwent SNRB with a local anaesthetic. The effect of the nerve root block on the radiculopathy and the headache was carefully noted and evaluated by a physiotherapist using visual analogue scales (VAS) before and after the SNRB. All patients with headache had tender points in the neck/shoulder region on the affected side. Patients with headache graded significantly more limitations in daily activities and higher pain intensity in the neck/shoulder/arm than patients without headache. After selective nerve root block, 59% of the patients with headache reported 50% or more reduction of headache and of these 69% reported total relief. A significant correlation was seen between reduced headache intensity and reduced pain in the neck, shoulder and arm. The result indicates that cervical root compression from degenerative disease in the lower cervical spine producing radiculopathy might also induce headache."
CD007431,0,2749374,0,Cross leg pain and trunk list.,"The prognostic significance of gravity-induced trunk list and cross leg pain was investigated in 113 patients who had root tension signs from a lumbar disc lesion. Cross leg pain, (a positive contralateral straight leg raising sign) and list was associated with poor prognosis for conservative management. There was a high incidence of disc sequestration and extrusion in the operated patients with cross leg pain. It was concluded that cross leg pain is probably a contraindication to chymopapain injections, and the surgeon should be aware of the possibility of a migrated disc fragment during operation on patients with cross leg pain."

In the 42 study patients, aged 60 years or older, clinical manifestations were similar to those usually seen in younger patients. Evidence of nerve root tension, including a positive straight-leg raising test seen in 67% of our patients, proved valuable for outruling sciatica due to bony impingement. Outcome was favorable in 78% of cases after a mean follow-up of 2.5 years. This findings is consistent with previous studies performed without age restrictions. Chemonucleolysis had no adverse effects. Despite the biochemical changes which occur in the aging disc, chemonucleolysis is an effective tool for the treatment of sciatica due to disc herniation in elderly patients."

The comparatively high percentage of accurate results 94% (myelogr.) and 90% (ct) in 93 cases where the findings were operatively substantiated,--sinks when the problem cases are considered apart. In 22% of our patients, one method alone was not sufficient for satisfactory preoperative diagnosis. The value of myelography and ct in the diagnosis of problem cases in herniated lumbar disk disease is different. Because of specific advantages (Tab. 1) in the representation of the spinal canal the techniques have their own position. When clinical and computertomographical results are clear and corresponding, myelography-as an invasive diagnostic technique--is unnecessary. In problem cases, however, both methods should be used to complement one another."

CD007431,0,2273409,0,Skin and epidural recording of spinal somatosensory evoked potentials following median nerve stimulation: correlation between the absence of spinal N13 and impaired pain sense.,"A clinical lesion study and intraoperative epidural recordings were made to test the origin and clinical significance of the spinal N13 and P13 of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) that follow median nerve stimulation. Intraoperatively, the respective peak latencies of spinal P13 and N13 coincided with those of the N1 component of the dorsal cord potential and its phase reversed positivity. On both the ventral and dorsal sides of the cervical epidural space, maximal amplitude was at the C5 vertebral level to which nerve input from the C6 dermatome is the main contributor. The modality of sensory impairment in the hand dermatome was examined in selected patients with cervical lesions, who showed such normal conventional SEP components as Erb N9, far-field P9, P11, P14, N18 and cortical N20, with or without loss of spinal N13. Statistically, the loss of spinal N13 was associated with decrease of pain sensation in the C6 dermatome. This was interpreted as being due to damage to the central grey matter of the cord, including the dorsal horn. Our results suggest the spinal N13 and P13 originate from the same source in the C6 spinal cord segment and that they are good indicators for the detection of centromedullary cervical cord damage."

The investigated group comprised 9 subjects (4 women, 5 men) aged 33 to 67 years operated upon at the Neurosurgical Clinic in Kosice between Jan. 1 1982 and June 30 2001 on account of compression of nervous structures in the thoracic portion of the spine by sequestra of intervertebral discs. This was manifested by back pain, a sensation of stiffening of the muscles of the lower extremities, altered sensitivity and in all by impaired gait. Only one female patient developed urinary retention, another one painless paraparesis of the lower extremities, therefore the condition was evaluated as a demyelinisation process. In three patients as the only imaging examination method perimyelography was used, in another two it was supplemented by CT. Four patients were examined by MRI. This graphic method proved to be the most suitable. In all subjects of the investigated group the clinical picture and examination methods indicated a unilateral predominance of the affection. In five subjects it proved possible to remove the sequestream of the intervertebral disc via laminectomy, in another four a transpedicular approach into the spinal canal was used successfully. In all patients the condition improved after surgery."

CD007431,0,1809517,0,[Tumor compression of the conus and cauda].,"The author analyzed a group of 17 patients with spinal tumours with symptoms of compression of the conus or cauda. Early clinical symptoms were sought and the entire clinical course before surgery was evaluated. The objective clinical finding was compared with the surgical one. Causes of diagnostic errors were analyzed. Most frequently a discogenic or other vertebrogenic cause of complaints was suspected. In all patients a local or root symptoms were the first manifestation of the disease. From the investigation ensues that a tumour must be considered when pain radiates into both lower extremities, in case of striking stiffness of the spine up to the neck and in case of damage of the higher lumbar roots. Tumours are more frequently located higher than prolapsed discs with manifestations of caudal compression. When bone structures are affected in primary tumours, the objective clinical finding may be very sparse. Tumours at the borderline of Th-L may be manifested by root symptoms L5 or S1. During PMG attention is focused lower, usually a prolapsed disc of L4/5 or L5/S1 is suspected and the tumour may be missed. Values of cerebrospinal fluid proteins in fluid collected at the lumbar level were high in all patients of the group."

The objectives of this clinical study were to evaluate inter-examiner reliability in the classification of patients with LBP, the influence of radiological findings on the classification and the reliability of some clinical tests. Two examiners independently assessed 50 outpatients with LBP. Inter-examiner reliability in classification of patients with LBP using Kirkkaldy-Willis classification (KWC) system and in 30 clinical tests was calculated as percentage agreement and kappa coefficients (kappa). Inter-examiner reliability was excellent (kappa>0.8) for classification according to KWC. Radiological findings did not influence the reliability. Age of the patient, movement range, and pain and neurological signs seemed to guide the decision on classification. The reliability of clinical tests was good (kappa>0.6) in 6 tests and moderate (kappa>0.4) in 12 tests. Good inter-examiner reliability was found for the SLR test, movement range and sensibility testing with spurs in dermatome areas. We conclude that the KWC for classifying patients with LBP seems to be a reliable classification system depending on a few key observations and that moderate and good inter-examiner reliability can be achieved in several clinical tests in the assessment of LBP."

With the recording electrode over the abductor digiti quinti latencies of stimulation in the supraclavicular fossa and of the C8 nerve root were ascertained. The difference between these 2 values reflected conduction time between C8 and the supraclavicular fossa. Four normal volunteers, 150 patients without Thoracic Outlet Syndrome and 50 patients with clinical thoracic outlet syndrome were studied. Using this method, conduction time from C8 to supraclavicular fossa ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 msec (mean = 0.6570, S.D. = 0.2097) in patients without thoracic outlet syndrome, and from 1.0 to 2.6 msec (mean = 1.7836, S.D. = 0.1984) in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. These values show a significant difference between the 2 groups at the 0.05 level of confidence (T-Test). In thoracic outlet syndrome, conduction time has a tendency to be prolonged and the value above 1.3 msec is strongly suggestive of thoracic outlet syndrome. The values are consistent and reproducible. This method is easy to carry out and is a useful addition to the diagnostic assessment of thoracic outlet syndrome."

Most improvement occurred within the first month, and one year after treatment outcome was judged satisfactory (excellent or good) in 71%. Individual patient characteristics associated with a satisfactory response were sciatica of greater severity than back pain (p = 0.005) and duration of symptoms less than 18 months (p = 0.03). Patients fulfilling 3 or 4 of four immediate pre-treatment clinical and radiographic criteria (sciatica more severe than back pain, reduced straight leg raising, neurological deficit, radiographic abnormality) had a satisfactory response more often than others (p less than 0.05). Reported success one year after surgery for disc prolapse is similar. Chemonucleolysis, however, requires less resources and does not preclude subsequent operation. Our results therefore suggest that it might be considered an alternative to surgery when conservative treatment has failed."

The results reported to date have not been consistent. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not the concentration of SPLI or that of beta-ENDLI in CSF demonstrated any potential for assessing the degree of subjective pain in various spinal diseases. SPLI in CSF was measured by radioimmunoassay in 158 patients with a spinal disease; involving 57 patients with a lumbar disc herniation (LDH), 38 with lumbar canal stenosis (LCS), 46 with cervical myelopathy (CM) and 17 with cervical radiculopathy (CR), and also in 20 healthy controls. beta-ENDLI in CSF was measured in 25 of these same patients; involving 12 with LDH, seven with LCS and six with CM, and also five of the same controls. The concentration of serum SPLI was also measured in 50 of these 158. The severity of pain was self-evaluated by each patient using a linear visual analogue scale (VAS). Their Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was also calculated objectively using the clinical findings. Correlations were investigated among the concentrations of SPLI and beta-ENDLI in the CSF and the VAS and JOA clinical assessments of these patients. The concentration of SPLI in CSF was significantly higher in various spinal diseases than in control (P < 0.05), and was correlated with the severity on the VAS and with the JOA score. However, beta-ENDLI was not correlated with either the VAS or the JOA score. We conclude that the measurement of the SPLI concentration in CSF has the potential for assessing objectively the severity of pain associated with various spinal diseases."

The MR angiographic images were also obtained from the same 3D data set with maximum intensity projection algorithms. The MR studies showed that 9 of 12 patients had neurovascular compression caused by one or two arteries. These findings were verified at surgery.

CD007431,0,3581584,0,Spasticity.,"Spasticity has been defined as velocity-dependent hyperactivity of stretch reflexes; it is therefore only one aspect of the complex syndrome produced by a lesion of the upper motoneuron. Although spasticity may be partially responsible for joint contractures, it does not produce most of the functional disability experienced by patients with upper motoneuron lesions. Paresis, fatigability, lack of dexterity, etc., account for most of these patients' complaints. The pathophysiology of spasticity is poorly understood but appears to be related to an increased excitatory state at the segmental spinal level; there is no evidence for increased sensitivity of muscle spindles in spastic patients. Several mechanisms for this increased excitability within the spinal cord have been proposed. There are different types as well as degrees of spasticity. Clinical neurophysiologic recordings of reflex activity in patients with spasticity provide the means to differentiate among the various types of spasticity, to select the therapy most likely to be effective in a particular patient, and to see the results of its employment objectively. The latter will prove whether a specific therapy is useful or not. Ablative treatment at the level of the peripheral nerve or dorsal root may be useful, particularly when spasticity is severe. Drugs such as baclofen or diazepam relieve flexor spasms but are not particularly effective against spasticity itself. Dantrolene acts to weaken muscles, but that is not often helpful. Rarely do any of these therapies increase function; there are no effective cures for paresis or related negative manifestations of chronic spasticity."

Our studies showed a clear correlation of Dermatomal SEP abnormalities and radiculopathy in up to 83.3% of subjects studied. Use of electromyography testing provided this correlation in about 62.5% of the same subjects.

Clinical patterns were similar to those seen in Western countries.

Interview administration of an adapted Mcgill Pain Questionnaire.,"This paper aims at elucidating to what extent patients with lumbago-sciatica in the presence of an herniated intervertebral disc, are inclined to describe their pain in a characteristic way. The material comprised 50 patients with clinical and radiological signs indicating herniation of the L4/5 or L5/S1 discs. The assessment of pain was performed by formal oral interview, focussing on spatial distribution and somatosensory dimensions of pain in various regions of the back and leg. In conformity with the fact that a range of sensible nerves are affected by the herniation pain description is represented by a variety of pain qualities. The pattern of pain description tends to exhibit certain characteristic traits: only half of the patients had low-back pain, and pain was most frequently occurring in the gluteal region, thigh and calf. The frequency of superficially localized pain tended to increase in the proximo-distal direction. Aching-like pain was the most common pain quality, and this variant of pain as well as flashing and jerking sensations were commonly reported in the gluteal region, thigh and calf. Warmth was most frequently experienced in these regions, cold sensations in distal parts. A feeling of punctate pressure was common in the gluteal region, incisive pressure and paraesthesia in the thigh and calf, and a cramp-like feeling in the calf region. Reduced sensibility was frequently experienced in distal parts and never in the lumbar region. Pain quality differs in patients with a short and a long duration of the actual attack of sciatica. The mapping of pain seems to represent a diagnostical aid. A high degree of homogeneity of the patients is required for pain description to be a valid and reliable instrument. The clinical application of pain mapping is to be shown through a paper-and-pencil administration of a questionnaire based upon the findings from this study."

CD007431,0,1447574,0,Ganglioside antibodies: a lack of diagnostic specificity and clinical utility?,"Serum IgG and IgM antibodies to gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, AGM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b were determined in 210 patients with different degenerative and inflammatory disorders including motor neuron diseases, peripheral radiculopathies and neuropathies, multiple sclerosis and neuroborreliosis. No single disorder was associated specifically with ganglioside antibodies. No characteristic patterns of ganglioside antibodies were observed in any disease category. However, 32% of all patients had pathological antibody titres to at least one ganglioside. Four patients had pathological IgG and IgM titres for all gangliosides evaluated. They suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus [2], neuroborreliosis and schizophrenia, respectively. The results of this study indicate that the introduction of ganglioside antibody determination as a differential diagnostic test in clinical neurology is only helpful in a few patients with typical lower motor neuron syndromes."
CD007431,0,2876596,0,[Surgically treated carpal tunnel syndrome--clinical and electrophysiologic follow-up].,"The carpal tunnel syndrome is described as a compression of the N. medianus under the retinaculum flexorum with the causes for this syndrome being of the most varied nature. The aetiology is multifactorial with frequent alterations of the connective tissue being observed in the histological specimen, i.e. chronic inflammatory proliferations or fibrotic degenerations. Direct pressure measurements have shown that the pressure is markedly higher both at rest and extension or flexion as compared to normal healthy subjects. An exact diagnosis requires a measurable prolongation of the distal motorial latency. Surgery is the treatment of choice to ensure perfect recovery. For this purpose the retinaculum flexorum must be entirely split, and our experiments have shown that the splitting of the epineurium yields good results. The microsurgical interfascicular neurolysis, however, should be considered in special cases only. Complaints tend to disappear fairly quickly in the majority of cases, i.e. pain recedes by 90%, sensitivity disorders by more than 70% and muscle atrophy by 50%. The operation enables a measurable improvement of the distal motorial latency. The incidence of postoperative complications is relatively low, and if they do occur, then they are negligible and without any bearing on the final surgical result. Persistent residual complaints are very often due to other accompanying diseases such as cervical vertebral column syndrome, cervical ribs etc."
CD007431,0,2951048,0,Recognizing specific characteristics of nonspecific low back pain.,"A retrospective review of 1293 cases of low back pain treated over a 12-year period revealed that sacroiliac joint syndrome and posterior joint syndromes were the most common referred-pain syndromes, whereas herniated nucleus pulposus and lateral spinal stenosis were the most common nerve root compression lesions. Referred pain syndromes occur nearly twice as often and frequently mimic the clinical presentation of nerve root compression syndromes. Combined lesions occurred in 33.5% of cases. Lateral spinal stenosis and herniated nucleus pulposus coexisted in 17.7%. In 30% of the cases of spondylolisthesis, the radiographic findings were incidental and the source of pain was the sacroiliac joint. Distinguishing radicular from referred pain, recognition of coexisting lesions, and correlation of diagnostic imaging with the overall clinical presentation facilities formulation of a rational plan of therapy. The above-outlined approach to managing low back pain evolved over a 12-year period. Designed to establish a specific diagnosis, it should yield excellent or good results in 84% of patients."

We prospectively studied 203 patients undergoing primary lumbar discectomy. Data was collected before surgery, at 3 months postoperatively and at long-term follow-up (12-60 months, median 24) using both disease-specific (visual analogue scores, Roland-Morris disability scales, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scales) and generic (SF-36) instruments. Continued significant symptomatic benefit was observed to long-term assessment and the health gains in this patient group compared favourably with other elective surgical procedures. We have used this data to validate the SF-36 for use in this context and we recommend that SF36 should be used as a sole measure of outcome in routine practice, as well as in future studies."

CD007431,0,11472384,0,Cervicogenic headache: evaluation of the original diagnostic criteria.,"A variety of headaches are frequently associated with the occurrence of neck pain. The purpose of this paper was to describe the adherence to diagnostic criteria of a series of patients enrolled on the basis of two clinical criteria: (1) unilateral headache without side-shift, and (2) pain starting in the neck and spreading to the fronto-ocular area. One hundred and thirty-two patients (36 male and 96 female) entered the study. Sixty-two patients were assigned to Group A (patients fulfilling criteria 1 and 2), 40 to Group B (criterion 2 only) and 12 to Group C (criterion 1, only). Eighteen subjects were excluded because X-rays of the neck were not available. Patients were evaluated regardless of whether or not they fell into one or more of the following diagnostic categories: cervicogenic headache (CEH), migraine without aura (M) and headache associated with disorders of the neck (HN) (IHS definitions). Fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria for CEH was found to be particularly frequent in Group A. A higher frequency of CEH diagnosis was found when two criteria were used (Group A) than in Group B (P = 0.001); in the former group a higher mean number of diagnostic criteria for CEH were also present (P = 0.001). Group A patients more frequently presented pain episodes of varying duration or fluctuating, continuous pain and moderate, non-excruciating, non-throbbing pain than Group B patients (P = 0.04 and P = 0.08, respectively). In Group C patients, the frequency of these two criteria was relatively low (17%) especially of the first mentioned variable. The presence of at least five of the seven 'pooled' CEH criteria (present in > or = 50% of the patients) might be deemed a reliable cut-off point, allowing the headache to be diagnosed as 'probable' CEH. If patients fulfilling M or HN criteria in addition to the CEH criteria are added to the 'pure' CEH group a total of 74% of Group A patients may have a CEH picture. The temporal pattern of pain and the quality of pain in Group A showed good sensitivity and specificity (> or = 75) when compared with Group B; therefore, the chances of diagnosing a definite CEH are significantly more frequent in patients presenting with unilateral pain that also begins as a neck pain. Head/neck trauma and radiological abnormalities in the cervical spine were not significantly associated with CEH, M or HN diagnoses. An improvement of the current diagnostic IHS criteria might make it possible to avoid the existing, partial overlap of CEH with HN and M. Extensive use should be made of the GON, and other, blockades in the routine work-up of CEH, both in the differential diagnosis and in the mixed forms (CEH + M, and CEH + HN), in order to improve the efficiency of the current diagnostic system."
CD007431,0,11180701,0,Surgical results of lumbar disc herniation in the elderly.,"We investigated the surgical results of lumbar disc herniation in the elderly. Ten elderly patients underwent surgical treatment between 1990 and 1999. There were 7 males and 3 females with a mean age of 68.2 years (range: 60~85 years). Thirteen patients in their 20s and 30s were used as a control. Preoperatively, severe leg pain and gait disturbance, and higher rates of negative straight leg-raising were shown in the elderly group. Higher levels of herniation and higher graded disc degeneration were shown compared with the young. The mean total of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score in the elderly group improved from 5.1 points to 13.1 points postoperatively, and that in the young group improved from 6.9 points to 14.5 points. The recovery rate was 82.6% in the elderly group and 94.3% in the young group. Postoperatively, the recovery of gait disturbance in the elderly group tended to be poor compared with the young group. The elderly patients would not tolerate bed rest and would often do poorly if kept recumbent and in pain for long periods of time. Satisfactory results are being sought with regard to the operative management of lumbar disc herniation in the elderly."
CD007431,0,8628931,0,[Magnetic resonance myelography with a fast-spin-echo sequence].,"A major application of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) consists in the ""myelographic effect"", characterized by high signal intensity of the CSF, which permits to visualize spinal subarachnoid spaces and nerve root sheaths. Such new ultrafast pulse sequences as fast spin echo (FSE) further enhance CSF high signal intensity. In addition, suppressing background with the fat suppression technique and with maximum intensity projection (MIP), a particular algorithm already used in MR angiography, FSE sequences yield 3D myelography-like images. Our study was aimed at assessing the clinical role and the reliability of this technique. Our preliminary experience is based on 21 patients with pain in the lower back and legs and on 5 healthy volunteers; all the myelography-like images were obtained with a 1.5-T MR system (Signa, General Electric). The parameters for FSE myelography-like images included: TR = 6000, TE = 200, ETL = 32, thickness = 3 mm, matrix = 256 x 224, Nex = 4, FOV = 20 cm, fat presaturation, no phase wrap, acquisition time = 2 min 58 s. MR myelography sequences were acquired after a standard FSE T1/T2-weighted exam. MR-myelography results confirmed the diagnosis of disk herniation made on conventional T1/T2-weighted images, especially in thecal sac compression and/or amputation of nerve root sheaths. MR myelography appeared to be especially useful in migrated disk herniation or in abnormal origin of nerve roots. Moreover, it allowed full and panoramic visualization of the subarachnoid spaces and excellent definition of the thecal sac, nerve roots and nerve root sheaths. In one patient only movement artifacts affected image quality. To conclude, even though it fails to yield any functional information, MR myelography appears to be an easy, rapid and noninvasive support to conventional MRI of the lumbar spine, to replace conventional myelography."
CD007431,0,9170044,0,Contrast enhancement pattern and frequency of previously unoperated lumbar discs on MRI.,"Enhancement frequency and patterns (linear intradiscal, nodular intradiscal, and peridiscal) of the 210 previously unoperated lumbar discs were evaluated using contrast-enhanced lumbar MRI. They also were compared with morphologic abnormalities (normal, bulging, protruded, and extruded) and signal alteration (high signal on T2-weighted images) of the disc. Image interpretation was decided by the consensus of two musculoskeletal radiologists. Enhancement was observed in 69 (32.6%) discs. The enhancement patterns were either intradiscal, linear of (79.7%) or nodular (10.2%), peridiscal (7.2%), or combined (2.9%). Thirty-five (77.8%) of the 45 herniated discs, 35 (77.8%) were enhanced, whereas 34 (20.6%) of 165 normal-appearing disc were enhanced. Enhancement was observed more frequently in discs with high signal intensity zones (P < 0.05). In the six patients with enhanced discs, surgery revealed granulation tissue in three extruded discs, two protruded discs, and one bulging disc. The authors believe that contrast enhancements are frequent in herniated discs and are not infrequent in normal-appearing discs. The understanding of various enhancement patterns may help in the interpretation of lumbar spine MRI."

CD007431,0,6450875,0,Lumbar dorsal ramus syndrome.,"Low back pain, referred pain in the lower limbs, and spasm of the back, gluteal, and hamstring muscles are clinical features which can be induced in normal volunteers by stimulating structures which are innervated by the lumbar dorsal rami. Conversely, they can be relieved in certain patients by selective interruption of conduction along dorsal rami. These facts permit the definition of a lumbar dorsal ramus syndrome, which can be distinguished from the intervertebral disc syndrome and other forms of low back pain. The distinguishing feature is that, in lumbar dorsal ramus syndrome, all the clinical features are exclusively mediated by dorsal rami and do not arise from nerve-root compression. The pathophysiology, pathology, and treatment of this syndrome are described. Recognition of this syndrome, and its treatment with relatively minor procedures, can obviate the need for major surgery which might otherwise be undertaken."

This phenomenon has been well documented after knee joint injury and has been generalised to occur at other joints of the human body, yet minimal research has been conducted in this regard. The response of the muscles crossing the ankle/foot complex after ankle injury and effusion is not well understood. AMI may occur after an ankle sprain contributing to residual dysfunction."
CD007431,0,8367766,0,The relationship of facet tropism to degenerative disc disease.,"The role of facet tropism (asymmetry) in the pathogenesis of degenerative disc disease is unknown, and several conflicting reports have been published. We studied this association using CT/discography performed at 324 lumbar levels (108 patients). The stage of disc degeneration as well as the patient's pain response upon discographic injection were scored using a standardized protocol. The facet angles were measured directly from the axial CT/discographic images and defined, in each case, as the angle formed by the facet orientation with respect to the midsagittal plane. The facet tropism angle was defined as the difference between the left and right facet angles at each disc level. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the tropism angles were calculated. From this calculation, each pair of facet joints was classified as symmetric (within 1 SD of the mean), moderately asymmetric (between 1 and 2 SD), or severely asymmetric (beyond 2 SD of the mean). There were no differences in degree of disc degeneration or pain response with respect to the facet tropism. The total facet angle was also studied. The total facet angle was greater at the more caudal levels. The total angle size was not associated, however, with disc degeneration or pain provocation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that there is an association between facet tropism and degenerative lumbar disc disease."

The purpose of the study was to establish the frequency of symptoms, clinical signs and tissue-specific diagnoses of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint in elderly subjects and their relation with respect to gender and type of prosthetic replacement. The study was conducted on 96 subjects, 48 complete denture wearers and 48 removable partial denture wearers, whose average age was 75.8 years. The diagnostic procedure used in this study was manual functional analysis consisting of specific techniques of dynamic compressions and translations in diagnosing internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint. Chi-square test for independent samples was used for statistical analysis of the results. The symptoms of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint were found in 9.3% of the subjects, and tissue-specific diagnoses were established in 52.1% of the subjects. The most common diagnoses were osteoarthrosis, total disk displacement with stable reposition and partial anterolateral disk displacement. No statistically significant differences in the frequency of symptoms, clinical signs and tissue-specific diagnoses were found between genders (P>.05) and complete and removable partial denture wearers (P>.05). The frequency of subjective symptoms of internal derangement in the temporomandibular joint of elderly subjects was low in relation to the frequency of intracapsular tissue-specific diagnoses."
CD007431,0,1834038,0,Trigger point of the posterior iliac crest: painful iliolumbar ligament insertion or cutaneous dorsal ramus pain? An anatomic study.,"A trigger point is frequently found over the iliac crest at 7 to 8 cm from the midline in low-back-pain syndromes. Previously, this was described as either a painful insertion site of the iliolumbar ligament or pain in the distribution of the cutaneous dorsal ramus of the first or second lumbar nerve. The authors performed 37 dissections, and they report their anatomic findings. The iliac insertion of the iliolumbar ligament is inaccessible to palpation, being shielded by the iliac crest. The dorsal rami of L1 or L2 nerve roots, however, cross the crest at 7 cm from the midline, and this distance closely correlates with the dorsal projection of the iliolumbar ligament insertion. These rami are superficial and dorsal to the crest, easily accessible to palpation. In two of the 37 dissections performed, some rami were found to be narrowed as they crossed through an osteofibrous orifice over the crest, thus being susceptible to an entrapment neuropathy. The authors conclude that the trigger point sometimes localized over the iliac crest at 7 cm from the midline likely corresponds to elicited pain from a cutaneous dorsal ramus originating from the thoracolumbar junction rather than from the iliac insertion of the iliolumbar ligament."

CD007431,0,11525209,0,Diagnosis and treatment of piriformis syndrome.,"Piriformis syndrome remains a controversial diagnosis, despite its having first been described over 60 years ago. The controversy stems from several factors: variable and sometimes unclear cause, similarity to other more easily recognizable causes of sciatica, lack of consistent objective diagnostic findings, and relative rarity. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to infer that sciatic pain may be caused by compression anywhere along its length, from the spinal root level to the popliteal fossa, as is peripheral nerve entrapment elsewhere in the body. Pathologic changes at the greater sciatic notch may well be the source of sciatic pain and should be considered by the clinician. The diagnosis of piriformis syndrome remains one of exclusion, however, and in patients who present with sciatica, more common causes such as lumbar disease should be investigated and ruled out first. After excluding the most common causes of sciatica, physicians can use the criteria described here to investigate the possibility of piriformis syndrome. If properly diagnosed, it can often be treated effectively with either surgical or nonsurgical means."

Primary lesions were located in the lung (9 cases), breast (9 cases) colorectal area (9 cases), prostate (7 cases) and so on. We correlated the radiologic findings, symptoms and clinical effects with metastatic features which were classified into 4 types by MR imaging: non-deformity, expanding, vertebral collapse, and destructive mass. Each type of metastasis was accompanied with or without epidural tumor. Osteolytic metastases were apt to create features of deformity (expanding type: 18 vertebrae, vertebral collapse type: 17 vertebrae, destructive mass type: 9 vertebrae). The features of osteoblastic metastases were no deformity (18 vertebrae) and expanding type (2 vertebrae). The symptom of pain only occurred most frequently in the lumbosacral spine. The vertebral body deformity of symptomatic sites was relatively slight (non-deformity type: 6 sites, expanding type: 6 sites, vertebral collapse type: 6 sites), and epidural tumors were seen at only 2 sites. The effect of radiotherapy was excellent (complete pain relief: 64.7%, partial pain relief: 29.4%). Radiculopathy occurred most frequently in the lumbar spine. Vertebral body deformity was noted in most symptomatic sites (expanding type: 9 sites, vertebral collapse type: 10 sites, destructive mass type: 2 sites). Complete relief was obtained in 6 sites (22. 2%), partial relief in 18 (63.0%). Myelopathy occurred most often in the thoracic spine, followed by the lumbar spine. The vertebral body deformity was severe (expanding type: 3 cases, vertebral collapse type: 3 cases, destructive mass type: 6 cases). Epidural tumors were also present in all but one case. Six of 13 patients treated with radiation alone improved. These 6 patients had non-deformity or expanding types with epidural tumor. No improvement was seen in the vertebral collapse type with epidural tumor or destructive mass type."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of motion measurements in the assessment of LBP. The motion characteristics of 138 LBP subjects were investigated, and the data compared with a previously published database of normal subjects. Values of range of motion and angular velocity were obtained for all subjects in each plane of motion. Analysis of these motion characteristics demonstrated significant differences (P < 0.0001) between the two populations; however both populations demonstrated considerable intersubject variation. Multiple regression analysis revealed that some of the variance in the LBP population was attributable to the underlying diagnosis. Patients with a spondylolisthesis tended to be hypermobile whilst those with spinal stenosis, disc prolapse or degenerative disc disease tended to be hypomobile. All diagnostic groups showed impairments in their velocity characteristics."

Thirty consecutive patients are included, all with a contained lumbar disc herniation on magnetic resonance imaging. There was a significant reduction in the sciatic pain and straight leg raising (SLR) test postoperatively at all the different measurements in the early course except for the sciatic pain at 2 weeks. On the same occasions, there was no change in the back pain or the Oswestry score. Ten patients needed subsequent open surgery. For the remaining patients, the long-term result showed a significant and unchanged improvement in the sciatic pain and SLR. In addition, the Oswestry score had now significantly improved. The failure rate of APLD turned out to be unacceptably high in this study, because 38% of the patients needed subsequent open surgery.

Scintigraphic activity at L2 was considered 100%, and the other levels were quantified in relation to L2. MRI scans were rated for disc signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The results show that an abnormal intervertebral MRI signal corresponds with an abnormal image on tomoscintigraphy. On tomoscintographic profiles, the disappearance of the 'discal dip' corresponds well with degeneration on MRI. Furthermore, a positive MRI at one level appears to influence other levels at which a significantly higher scintigraphic activity was observed. Of patients with acute LBP 50% had a normal disc SPECT; it is concluded that in these cases a non-discal origin for the pain must be sought."

A preliminary study.,"This article reports on a study of 51 consecutive patients (83 lumbar discs) with back pain who underwent anterior interbody lumbar fusion or combined anterior and posterior fusion at the same operation during a 2-year period. All patients met the criteria for diagnosis of a painful internal disc disruption and/or failed back syndrome and have had a lengthy trial of conservative treatment consisting of rest, physical therapy, back support, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, and guarded activity; this treatment was often supplemented by epidural cortisone injections, pain management, and functional rehabilitation. Patients with prolonged back pain who failed with conservative care after a minimum of 12 months of severely disabling symptoms were selected for surgery on the basis of a positive dynamic discogram reproducing their exact pain and demonstrating a morphologically degenerative disc (internal disc disruption). For the purpose of this study, patients were categorized into three groups and followed up for 15-36 months after the operation. There were no deaths or major complications, and the overall success in achieving measurable diminution of preoperative pain was 80%. This article discusses preliminary conclusions on the efficacy and safety on anterior and anteroposterior fusion for lumbar disc pain."

Nineteen oarsmen and 20 male controls matched for age, height and body mass performed a series of isokinetic and isometric strength tests on an isokinetic dynamometer. These strength tests focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Comparisons of strength were made between and within groups for right and left symmetry patterns, hamstring: quadriceps ratios, and trunk flexor and extensor ratios. The results revealed no left and right asymmetries in either the knee extensor or flexor strength parameters (including both isometric and isokinetic measures). Knee extensor strength was significantly greater in the rowing population, but knee flexor strength was similar between the two groups. No difference was seen between the groups for the hamstring: quadriceps strength ratio. In the rowing population, stroke side had no influence on leg strength. No differences were observed in the isometric strength of the trunk flexors and extensors between groups, although EMG activity was significantly higher in the rowing population. Patterns of asymmetry of muscle activity were observed between the left and right erector spinae muscles during extension, which was significantly related to rowing side (P < 0.01). These observations could be related to the high incidence of low back pain in oarsmen."

We analysed general data, the case history, the neurological examination at admission and all data from imaging examinations and therapy. In addition, all patients received a questionnaire based on the Low Back Outcome Score [9, 10]. The patients were re-examined after 2-8 months (103 days mean). According to their ratings on a pain grading scale, the patients were divided into a group with favorable and another with unfavorable results. These groups were analysed in relation to the patients' initial condition. At follow up, 88% of the patients had either completely recovered or their complaints had been relieved. According to the Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS), 64.5% went well. Used to evaluate the initial condition of the patients on admission the LBOS was able to predict favorable outcome in 68% and unfavorable outcome in 50%. To improve the prognostic value, we combined significant questions of the LBOS with the pain grading scale and significant prognostic factors to form a new prognostic score (Low Back Prognostic Score). With this new score we were able to predict a favorable outcome in 84% of our patients, and an unfavorable outcome in 71%. The Low Back Prognostic score seems to provide a sensitive method for predicting a favorable or unfavorable outcome for patients scheduled to undergo lumbar disc surgery."
CD007431,0,6320020,0,[Painful sciatic rubbing caused by benign synovioma of the spinal joints. Apropos of 4 cases].,"Synovioma, a benign neoplasm arising from pigmented villonodular synovium or synovitis, is uncommon. It involves the tendons and joints of the finger, ankle and foot. In this study four cases of villonodular synovioma of spinal joints are reported. The authors studied 555 cases of patients operated for sciatica due to herniated disk. Histopathology showed that in four out of 555 cases sciatica was found to be due to synoviomas of the spinal joints. The patients, three women and one man, were between 54 and 70 years of age and each had had a long history of low back pain with episodes of sciatica. Clinical evaluation at the time of surgery showed moderate severity of signs and symptoms. Roentgenographic studies of all four cases revealed osteoarthritic changes of vertebral apophyses, with two cases of spondylolisthesis. The pathogenesis of synovioma remains controversial and its histopathological characterization -hyperplasia VS/true tumours- has not yet been determined. It is possible that the number of recorded cases of sciatica due to synoviomas is small because surgical and pathological studies in patients with sciatica associated with osteoarthritic changes have not been adequately performed. Surgery consists of a large resection of the capsule and ligament including resection of intraspinal extension. Because this study involves only four cases, the first of which occurred in 1977, the possibility of recurrence cannot be evaluated."

CD007431,0,15974636,0,Rowing injuries.,"Participation in the sport of rowing has been steadily increasing in recent decades, yet few studies address the specific injuries incurred. This article reviews the most common injuries described in the literature, including musculoskeletal problems in the lower back, ribs, shoulder, wrist and knee. A review of basic rowing physiology and equipment is included, along with a description of the mechanics of the rowing stroke. This information is necessary in order to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment protocol for these injuries, which are mainly chronic in nature. The most frequently injured region is the low back, mainly due to excessive hyperflexion and twisting, and can include specific injuries such as spondylolysis, sacroiliac joint dysfunction and disc herniation. Rib stress fractures account for the most time lost from on-water training and competition. Although theories abound for the mechanism of injury, the exact aetiology of rib stress fractures remains unknown. Other injuries discussed within, which are specific to ribs, include costochondritis, costovertebral joint subluxation and intercostal muscle strains. Shoulder pain is quite common in rowers and can be the result of overuse, poor technique, or tension in the upper body. Injuries concerning the forearm and wrist are also common, and can include exertional compartment syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, deQuervain's and intersection syndrome, and tenosynovitis of the wrist extensors. In the lower body, the major injuries reported include generalised patellofemoral pain due to abnormal patellar tracking, and iliotibial band friction syndrome. Lastly, dermatological issues, such as blisters and abrasions, and miscellaneous issues, such as environmental concerns and the female athlete triad, are also included in this article.Pathophysiology, mechanism of injury, assessment and management strategies are outlined in the text for each injury, with special attention given to ways to correct biomechanical or equipment problems specific to rowing. By gaining an understanding of basic rowing biomechanics and training habits, the physician and/or healthcare provider will be better equipped to treat and prevent injuries in the rowing population."
CD007431,0,377120,0,[Clinico-radiological correlation and treatment of patients with absence of lumbar vertebral arch fusion].,"The authors observed 88 patients (18 women and 70 men) aged 16 to 61 years with lack of lumbar vertebral arch fusion (spina bifid occulta without spinal cord involvement). In 63 cases the clinical symptom complex was that of sciatic pains, in the remaining 25 cases no neurological defect was found. In 63 cases operation was done and 45 of them intervertebral disc prolapse was found. The decision to operate was based on the refractoriness and intensity of pain, presence of neurological defect and radiculography performed in 36 cases. It is stressed that such high proportion (51%) of cases with spina bifida coexistent with lumbar disc prolapse calls for a careful analysis of the cause of pain in patients with spina bifida."
CD007431,0,4000674,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of the narrow lumbar spinal canal].,"In 30%-40% of the patients who are operated on for herniation of lumbar discs, osseous stenosis plays a certain role. However, only in one-third of them are special operative measures such as laminectomy necessary with or without additional lumbar fusion. When spondylodesis is carried out after laminectomy it is often combined with metal implant, which can drastically reduce the time a patient requires perioperative treatment. In younger patients showing typical signs of nerve root compression due to osseous stenosis of lateral recess, only segmental decompression in the form of foraminotomy is done. On the other hand, in cases of narrow spinal canal, which is found in elderly patients, neurogenic intermittent claudication is the predominant clinical picture. Kyphosis, scoliosis, and vertebral displacement can lead to local spinal stenosis. On addition, local pressure and tension on unstabile segments in combination with secondary fibrosis can lead to compression of the neural structures. The diagnosis is based on the clinical history and myelography. Computed tomography helps reveal the presence of herniation of a lumbar disc, which should be simultaneously operated upon. For the operative treatment there is no age limit. All in all, the operative results are so good that one is inclined to decide in favour of operation."

The results in 100 patients treated with PELD were compared randomly with those in 100 patients treated by chemonucleolysis with chymopapain (CN) and 100 patients treated by automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy (APLD) at the same hospital. We followed the 300 patients postoperatively for 1 year, with physical examination, postoperative plain lumbosacral radiography, CT, MRI and a self-assessment questionnaire. Some 68% of the patients in the PELD group considered the outcome as excellent or good and 23% as fair; the corresponding figures were 55% and 27% in the CN group, and 48% and 32% in the APLD group. Nine percent of the patients in the PELD group underwent open microdiscectomy or were suffering from back pain with sciatica, compared with 18% in the CN group and 20% in the APLD group. PELD showed better extraction of the hernia mass than APLD and a lower rate of low back pain and less decrease in disc height than CN."

CD007431,0,538401,0,[Postoperative sciatica from epidural fibrosis and lumbar arachnoiditis. Results of 38 repeat operations].,"Lumbar epiduro-arachnoiditis is a well-known complication of surgery of the intervertebral disc. The epidural fibrous scar is the normal outcome of inflammatory activity secondary to the mechanical tissue disturbance resulting from surgery. In certain individuals, perhaps genetically predisposed as excessive quantity of fibrous tissue is deposited in the epi and/or nitradural space. This abnormal situation, comparable to cheloid cutaneous scars, is perhaps at the origin of the clinical symptoms. The authors report the clinical and radiological signs observed in 38 patients having had at least one operation for discal hernia, and who underwent further operations in the aim of freeing the roots and the dural sack from fibrous compression. Results of excision of the epidural ""cheloid"" were good in 13 cases, and average in 8 others. There was a complete failure in 17 other patients. Three explanations were offered to explain the frequency of the failures: 1) formation of a new cheloid, 2) difficulty of neurolysis of the arachnoiditis, 3) possibility of intrinsic lesions of the nerve associated with the epiduro-arachnoiditis."
CD007431,0,6217517,0,[70 patients operated on for sciatica without herniated disk].,"Seventy patients suffering from sciatica were operated in whom no disc herniation was found. In 42 instances, compression of bony origin was found. These cases were either due to general narrowing of the spinal canal with signs in the distribution of several roots with neurological intermittent claudication, or to narrowing of the lateral recess or intervertebral foramen with involvement of only one root. Decompressive surgery was always beneficial for pain. In 20 instances a disc was found to be only bulging; disc excision was performed in 17 of these patients. In 8 instances, no abnormality was found. Some patients were nevertheless cured by disc excision, a single laminectomy being useful. The incidence of additional psychological problems is discussed. It is concluded that the clinical signs should guide the surgeon rather than the radiological findings in decisions for surgical treatment. Patients who have been correctly treated by conservative means for an adequate time should be systematically operated on if they have not shown sufficient clinical improvement."
CD007431,0,9416012,0,Changes in stature following plyometric drop-jump and pendulum exercises.,"The aim of this study was to compare the changes in stature following the performance of plyometric exercises using drop-jumps and a pendulum swing. Eight male participants aged 21.7 +/- 1.8 years with experience of plyometric training gave their informed consent to act as participants. Participants undertook two exercise regimens and a 15-min standing test in a random order. The exercises entailed the performance of 50 drop-jumps from a height of 0.28 m or 50 pendulum rebounds. Participants were instructed to perform maximal jumps or rebounds using a 'bounce' style. Measurements of stature were performed after a 20-min period of standing (pre-exercise), 2-min after exercise (post-exercise) and after a 20-min standing recovery (recovery). Back pain and muscle soreness were assessed using an analogue-visual scale, at each of the above times and also 24 and 36 h after the test. Peak torque during isokinetic knee extension at 1.04 rads-1 was measured immediately before and after the exercise bouts, to assess the degree of muscular fatigue. Ground/wall reaction force data were recorded using a Kistler force platform mounted in the floor for drop-jumps and vertically on the rebound wall for pendulum exercises. Drop-jumps resulted in the greatest (p < 0.05) change in stature (-2.71 +/- 0.8 mm), compared to pendulum exercises (-1.77 +/- 0.7 mm) and standing (-0.39 +/- 0.2 mm). Both exercise regimens resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in stature when compared to the standing condition. Drop-jumps resulted in significantly greater peak impact forces (p < 0.05) than pendulum exercises (drop-jumps = 3.2 +/- 0.5 x body weight, pendulum = 2.6 +/- 0.5 x body weight). The two exercise conditions both invoked a small degree of muscle soreness but there were no significant differences between conditions. Both exercise regimens resulted in a non-significant decrease in peak torque indicating a similar degree of muscular fatigue. Based on the lower shrinkage resulted and lower peak forces, it can be concluded that pendulum exercises pose a lower injury potential to the lower back than drop-jumps performed from a height of 28 cm."

CD007431,0,15977116,0,[The delayed OP--indications for surgery of lumbar disc herniations].,"In Germany, lumbar disc herniations require surgical treatment in about 50,000 patients/year. The clinical and socio-economical results are determined by the preoperative duration of symptoms and preoperative time out of work (highly predictive). Other parameters such as severity of neurological deficits, morphology of disc herniation, age, associated diseases, type of surgery, working conditions or litigation processes are only weak predictors of outcome. Postoperative improvement of clinical symptoms as well as professional reintegration is strongly determined by the time period between onset of symptoms and surgery. Surgery performed ""too early"" diminishes the chance for improvement by conservative therapy. If surgery is performed ""too late"" the risk of a bad result is high, and the reintegration of the patient into his preoperative social and professional activities may be prevented. The duration of conservative therapy including so-called semi-invasive procedures is critical in this sense. If a therapeutic success (= professional and social reintegration) cannot be achieved by conservative measures and if there is a clear morphological correlate (= disc herniations with corresponding clinical symptoms) of the clinical symptoms an early change of the strategy towards surgical therapy is recommended."

Radiculopathy caused by an upper lumbar disc is occasionally difficult to diagnose secondary to ambiguous presenting symptoms. Once accurately diagnosed, the treatment program is straight-forward but specific for the high nerve root pathology. A series of three cases of high lumbar radiculopathies managed with an aggressive conservative approach are presented. This case series will review the diagnostic and treatment strategies that are useful in the identification and management of a high lumbar radiculopathy. Various pitfalls in the management of these cases are reviewed, all of which may worsen the patient's clinical situation. A high index of suspicion is necessary to elucidate this entity."

Selection criteria included patients with predominance of low-back pain, diffuse posterior disk bulges and concomitant spinal stenosis who are not normally accepted for nucleotomy. In all, 142 patients were treated. The overall success rate after an average observation time of 21 months was 56%. The results were not influenced by whether a diffuse posterior bulge or a focal hernia had been treated or not (p = 0.449). Spinal stenosis (p = 0.043) and disk space narrowing exceeding 25% of the expected width (p = 0.017) were associated with a poor outcome. By excluding these categories and patients with symptoms from more than one disk level, the success rate rose to 70%. With this selection, the results were equally good in patients with predominantly low-back pain compared to those with predominantly sciatica (p = 0.490)."
CD007431,0,438234,0,Management of severe spondylolisthesis in children and adolescents.,"Forty-three patients with a fifth lumbar-first sacral spondylolisthesis of 50 per cent or greater were reviewed. Four had been treated non-operatively; eleven, by arthrodesis; eighteen, by decompression and arthrodesis; and ten, by reduction and arthrodesis. The angle of slipping (measurement of the kyphotic relationship of the fifth lumbar to the first sacral vertebra) was found to be as important a measurement as the percentage of slipping in measuring instability and progression of slipping. Hamstring tightness did not correlate with neural deficit. Arthrodesis alone, even in the presence of minor neural deficits, tight hamstrings, or both, gave relief of pain and resolution of neural deficits and tight hamstrings. Our experience with a limited number of patients suggests that management by postoperative extension casts may achieve a significant reduction in percentage of slipping and in angle of slipping. Progression of the spondylolisthesis may occur following a solid arthrodesis."
CD007431,0,2303509,0,Elective discectomy for herniation of a lumbar disc. Additional experience with an objective method.,"An objective evaluation for the assessment of patients who have persistent low-back pain and sciatica was tested in eighty-four patients who were operated on by one of us (D.M.S.). In this scoring system, there are four major categories for preoperative assessment: neurological signs, sciatic-tension signs, psychological factors, and imaging studies. When the preoperative scores of the eighty-four patients were correlated with the findings at operation, the three patients who had the lowest scores were the only ones in whom the operative findings were negative. As shown by statistical analysis, the score for imaging studies correlated best with the operative findings. In contrast, in the sixty-one patients who were followed sufficiently to determine the clinical outcome, the psychological score was the best predictor of the outcome of treatment. On the basis of these studies, we concluded that the use of this objective scoring system reduced the incidence of negative findings at exploration of the disc and improved the clinical result after elective discectomy. The higher the score was preoperatively, the more likely the patient was to have a good result after discectomy."

Two groups with MR (with and without DS) participated in the study, having met the following criteria: similar age, moderate to mild mental retardation, Tanner stage V of sexual development, similar age of beginning to walk, and equal motor activities. The DS group consisted of 8 men 23.9 +/- 4.2 years, and the MR group without DS consisted of 8 men 23.5 +/- 3.6 years. The two groups were compared with 10 sedentary students of the same age range (25.9 +/- 2.9 years) attending our University. The BMD of the 2(nd) to 4(th) lumbar vertebrae was measured in the PA projection and the mean density was expressed as g/cm(2). The isokinetic muscle strength of the right quadriceps femoris and hamstrings muscles was measured on a Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer. The value measured was peak torque at angular velocities at 60, 120, and 300 degrees.sec(-1). The results showed that BMD in DS individuals versus young adults (reference group of the scanner) was lower at the 26% level (T-score - 2.66 +/- 0.29) and significantly lower (P = 0.002) than that of the MR group. Significantly different muscle strength was observed between the DS and non-DS MR group (in quadriceps at 300 degrees.s(-1): P < 0.01, at 120 and 60 degrees. s(-1): P < 0.05; in hamstrings at 300 degrees.s(-1): P < 0.05). Higher differences in muscle strength were found between MR and control men, but no significant difference existed in BMD between them. Bivariate correlation showed that quadriceps strength significantly predicted the BMD in the DS patients. Active lifestyle and increased physical exercise to improve muscular strength should be instituted to avoid the development of osteoporosis in DS patients."

One hundred three patients (14%) required a second posterior procedure, but only 24 (3%) cases represented true recurrent radiculopathy. There were 13 minor complications (1.5%) and no deaths or detectable incidence of air embolism. All operations were done with the patient in the sitting position. Central venous pressure monitoring was used only infrequently. There was a 96% incidence of relief of significant arm pain and/or paresthesia and a 98% incidence of resolution of preoperatively present motor deficit. Eight hundred twenty-eight procedures (98%) were preceded by Pantopaque cervical myelography. There was a 71.5% incidence of correlation between preoperative clinical findings (both sensory and motor) and operative findings. In 13% of the cases, two spaces were thought by the operating surgeon to be equally involved by the spondylotic process.

A precise cause could explain the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) lesion in 46 cases, the other 74 cases being considered idiopathic (25% of patients were obese). Only one case required surgery to relieve symptoms. LFCN conduction was studied orthodromically, distally from the anterior superior iliac spine. The side-to-side amplitude ratio (ssRatio) was greater than 2.3 in 118 of 120 patients (98.3%) and was a better index to confirm a lesion of the LFCN than SNAP amplitude, which was abnormal (less than 3 microV) in 88 cases (73.3%). Only two of the 11 bilateral cases had an ssRatio lower than 2.3 (they were both 2.0). An ssRatio of 2.3 or more and a SNAP amplitude lower than 3 microV provided a specificity of 98.75% or more. The mean axonal loss was 88%. These clinical and electrophysiological data highlight the central role the neurophysiologist should play in diagnosing MP by means of an LFCN conduction study."
CD007431,0,6446161,0,The relation between biomechanical and psychological factors in patients with low-back pain.,"Behavioral factors are increasingly being recognized for their role in determining the course and outcome of low-back disorders. This paper examines the relation between behavioral variables, which include psychological symptoms and pain tolerance, and biomechanical variables. The majority of the 89 patients tested could be classified into two groups. One group was intolerant of pain and showed reduced spinal mobility, restricted straight leg raising, and altered flexor-extensor muscle balance. The other group was more tolerant of pain and did not show restriction of motion or muscle imbalance. Spinal mobility was also related to psychological symptoms. A model is proposed which points to a feedback between spinal motion and the patient's ability to cope with pain as one mechanism that determines return to a functional range of motion."

CD007431,0,2402700,0,Lumbar spinal fusion. Assessment of functional stability with magnetic resonance imaging.,"Segmental spinal instability was evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computed tomography (CT), and conventional radiography in 33 patients who had undergone surgical spinal fusion. In 16 of the 19 patients who had a diagnosis of solid fusion, the immobilized vertebral bodies demonstrated areas of high signal intensity on images with short repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE). The signal intensity of these areas was either less intense or normal on images with long TR and TE. In 10 of the 14 patients with segmental instability at the fusion site, subchondral vertebral bands of low signal intensity were shown on short TR/TE images, which demonstrated high signal intensity on long TR/TE images. All but two of the patients showed vertebral signal changes 12 or more months past fusion or onset of clinical symptoms. The vertebral MR signal intensity in solid lumbar fusions might be related to marrow composition changes resulting from decreased biomechanical stress, while the vertebral signal intensities in patients with unstable fusions might be related to reparative granulation tissue, inflammation, edema, and hyperemic changes. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be unique in its assessment of functional fusion stability. Magnetic resonance may be most useful in patients symptomatic of fusion pseudarthrosis in whom conventional radiography and CT fail to demonstrate anatomic disruption."

CD007431,0,1490039,0,Comparison of MRI and discography in the diagnosis of lumbar degenerative disc disease.,"Recent reports have attempted to compare the relative value of discography and MRI in the evaluation of lumbar degenerative disc disease. None has compared the accuracy of the two techniques in regard to the detection of disc herniation specifically, and none has offered surgical correlation. In this prospective study, both techniques were used to evaluate 264 disc levels in 90 patients with incapacitating low back pain or radicular pain. The results showed an 86% agreement level both between tests and between the orthopaedist and radiologist on each test. Surgical findings agreed with diagnostic studies at 63 of 76 levels in 57 patients who underwent operative treatment. An analysis of the relative sensitivity and specificity of each test in the diagnosis of degeneration and herniation revealed that the greater sensitivity of MRI in the detection of herniation was the only statistically significant difference (p < 0.05)."

Within 3 years, 64% of these patients developed symptoms of lumbosacral radiculopathy. The clinical features of these patients comprise a syndrome significantly different from that typically associated with classical lumbar disc herniation: the syndrome described here carries a much higher incidence of silent root compression with minimal pain. Incidental lumbar myelographic defects are not necessarily benign findings, and patients in whom they are encountered deserve close clinical follow-up review and appropriate treatment if the defects become symptomatic."

Enhanced MR imaging was performed on 115 patients treated surgically for lumbar disc herniation. Nerve root enhancement was seen in 39.1% of the patients preoperatively and in 58.7% postoperatively. Preoperative root enhancement reflects the radicular pain intensity rather than the degree of neurological deficits, whereas postoperative enhancement did not correlate with the radicular symptoms. Nerve root enhancement represents an intraneural edema in the affected nerve root. Enhanced MR imaging is a potential method for the identification of an affected nerve root in patients with a discrepancy between the level of disc herniation and neurological manifestations."

CD007431,0,8483516,0,Surgical treatment and results in patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenoses.,"Stenosis of the lumbar spinal canal is contributing to 3-5% of all patients operated on a lumbar nerve root compression syndrome. Morphologically, a reduction of the midsagittal diameter of the spinal canal to less than 12 mm or stenoses of the lateral recessus or foramen intervertebrale have been described. In our department 37 patients with a lumbar spinal stenosis have been surgically treated between 1982 and 1987. Spinal stenosis is a disease of aged patients mostly suffering for a long history. The main symptoms are lumbar and sciatic pains, neurological deficits and a claudicatio intermittens spinalis. Neuroradiologically, the diagnosis can be confirmed by CT, myelography or MRI. These studies were demonstrating the stenosis in 69% at the level of L4/5, multiple stenoses have been found in 22% of all cases. An additional disc herniation existed in 35% of the patients. Concerning the specific complaints of the patients and their neuroradiological findings, the extent of the surgical decompression was decided on individually in each patient. We performed 22 laminectomies, 11 hemilaminectomies, in 3 cases an extended flavectomy and in one case an implantation of a dorsal column stimulation device. The postoperative follow-up period, ranging from 3 months to 3 years, demonstrated a complete recovery in 53%, a marked reduction of complaints in 44% of all cases. One patient did not respond to surgical treatment, but in the remaining cases surgical treatment led to satisfactory results."

Using a qualitative rating scale, 92 cases were analyzed retrospectively whose primary diagnosis was questioned because of conflicting data from clinical, neuroradiological and neurophysiological testing. In conclusion SEP techniques proved to be a useful tool in exclusing other e.g. demyelinating diseases. Except for the time-consuming method of segmental stimulation, the demonstration of the functional deficit itself by SEP techniques in general was frequently disappointing. The contribution of the different SEP parameters to clinical decision making and the clinical consequences are briefly discussed."

CD007431,0,6225597,0,Spinal manipulative therapy. A status report.,"Spinal manipulative therapy is one of the most commonly used treatments for patients with low back pain. It is both a manual diagnostic and a treatment method. Manual diagnosis includes the palpation of vertebral position, vertebral motion, joint play, end feel, soft tissue texture changes, and muscle contracture. Manipulative treatment can be divided into seven categories: long-lever, nonspecific manipulation; specific, short-lever high-velocity spinal adjustments; active or functional manipulation; mobilization; manual traction; soft tissue massage; and point pressure manipulation. Clinical experience with manipulation for low back pain is extensive, and controlled observations show that it is possible to produce immediate relief of pain in some cases. The effectiveness of manipulation is greatest in patients who have acute pain and no leg pain or neurologic deficits. Long-term effects of manipulation have not been demonstrated. Manipulation appears to increase spinal range of motion and straight leg raising but is not known to reduce intervertebral disc herniations. Complications following manipulation, although rare, can be catastrophic."

CD007431,0,2534533,0,Percutaneous automated lumbar nucleotomy.,"The results of percutaneous automated lumbar nucleotomy in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation were assessed in a series of 39 patients. The technique consists of mechanical decompression of the herniated intervertebral disc without total excision. Only one-space discs were treated by this method. Sciatica was the predominant clinical symptom in 30 cases, and lumbar pain in 9 cases. Good to very good results were obtained in 70% of patients with sciatica and in 55% of patients with lumbar pain. After 4 cases of nucleotomy performed after failure of nucleolysis were excluded, the proportion of very good results rose to 77% in sciatica. Conversely, it seems that a number of failed nucleotomies can be treated by nucleolysis. Nucleotomy is very well tolerated and deserves to be used as first-line treatment of single and radiologically well documented lumbar disc herniations."

An attempt was made to distinguish before re-operation whether the residue symptoms were due to recurrence of, or a fresh disc herniation, or to extradural scarring. Persistence of pain after the initial operation or the time interval before pain re-appeared did not help to distinguish the causative pathology. A recurrent disc herniation was found if a different disc was involved, but was else best distinguished by myelographic demonstration of a short indentation in the contrast column at the level of a disc or a short root sleeve with a thickened associated nerve root. An absence of indentation in the column suggested extradural scarring. At re-operation disc herniation and extradural scarring without herniation were found in approximately equal numbers of patients."

Sector CT scanning demonstrates preoperatively which neural foramina are narrow. This information, correlated with the patient's history and physical examination, indicates which foramina should be operated on and prevents unnecessary exploration of normal neural foramina. CT findings were confirmed surgically in 14 patients. Eleven of these 14 patients had excellent postoperative results and remain pain free."

Studies have stressed that misdiagnosis of root entrapment significantly contributes to the incidence of failed back syndrome. In an attempt to aid the proper selection of surgical candidates, dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials ( DSSEP ) have been used in conjunction with standard diagnostic techniques to evaluate our patients. The advantage of this technique lies in the root specificity. The authors studied the DSSEP using two methods. In Method 1, using myelograms as the standard, the accuracy was 85.7%. In Method II, using surgical outcome as the standard, the accuracy was 87.5%. As a result, the authors have found the noninvasive, relatively inexpensive DSSEP to be a useful adjunct in the selection of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery."
CD007431,0,15725222,0,Repetitive painful stimulation produces an expansion of withdrawal reflex receptive fields in humans.,"The aims of the present study were to investigate whether temporal summation of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex depends on the stimulation site on the sole of the human foot, and to characterize the reflex receptive fields (RRF) of lower limb muscles to repetitive stimulation. The cutaneous RRFs were assessed in 15 subjects in sitting position by recording the EMG from five lower leg muscles and the kinematic responses (ankle, knee, and hip joints) to repetitive painful electrical stimulation. The stimulus consisted of a series of five stimuli (frequency: 3 Hz) delivered randomly at 10 different sites on the sole of the foot. The size of the reflexes increased generally between the first and the second stimulus, however, the increment depended on the stimulation site. In tibialis anterior, the RRF covered the distal sole of the foot and gradually expanded during the stimulus train. No expansion toward the heel area was detected. In soleus, the reflexes were facilitated after the second stimulus at all sites and remained in this state until the last stimulus. In vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, and iliopsoas a gradual expansion of the RRF was seen, resulting in RRFs covering the lateral, distal foot, and part of the proximal foot (iliopsoas). Knee and hip flexion were evoked at all sites. Ankle dorsiflexion was evoked at the distal foot, while ankle plantarflexion was evoked at the heel. The enlargement of the RRF reflects spinal temporal summation leading to gradually stronger reflex responses. The degree of temporal summation was dependent on stimulation site. The facilitation of the withdrawal reflex responses due to repetitive stimulation might have potential applications in the rehabilitation engineering field, where these reflexes could be used to assist gait of patients with central nervous system injuries."
CD007431,0,6630258,0,The indications for metrizamide myelography. Relationship with complications after myelography.,"To test the validity of our impression that in the absence of objective clinical evidence of nerve-root impingement there is a disproportionately high incidence of complications associated with myelography, the results in 248 patients were reviewed retrospectively and those in 110 were studied prospectively. Of all 358 patients, 53 per cent had complications after myelography with injection of metrizamide, of which headache and nausea and vomiting were the most frequent. The incidence of complications in the 112 patients whose objective clinical and myelographic findings were consistent was compared with that in the 180 patients who had only subjective complaints and normal myelographic findings. The incidence of complications was 30 per cent in the former group and 70 per cent in the latter group, an almost twofold difference (p greater than 0.05). The 110 patients in the prospective study were asked to grade the intensity of their headache after myelography. Of the thirty-one patients with positive objective clinical and myelographic findings, ten complained of headache, which was mild in seven (70 per cent) and severe in three. Of the sixty patients with only subjective complaints, thirty-eight complained of headache, which was mild in twelve (32 per cent) and severe in twenty-six."
CD007431,0,3805082,0,The use of computerized tomography in evaluating non-visualized vertebral levels caudad to a complete block on a lumbar myelogram. A review of thirty-two cases.,"In thirty-two patients who demonstrated a complete or almost complete block on a lumbar myelogram, computerized tomography of the non-visualized vertebral levels caudad to the block was performed prior to surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of computerized tomography in detecting a lesion that is caudad to the level of a myelographic block. For twenty-three patients the cause of the myelographic block was stenosis of the spine; for five patients, a combination of stenosis of the spine and herniation of a disc; for one patient, herniation of a disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae alone; for two patients, arachnoiditis; and for one patient, kyphosis secondary to fracture. A total of fifty vertebral levels that could not be visualized because of the block were evaluated. Thirty (60 per cent) of the non-visualized vertebral levels, in nineteen (59 per cent) of the thirty-two patients, demonstrated stenosis of the spine or a herniated disc that was confirmed at the time of surgical treatment. The value of computerized tomography for the evaluation of the vertebral levels caudad to the level of a complete or almost complete block on a lumbar myelogram was threefold. First, it provided visualization of the vertebral levels that could not be evaluated by the myelography. Second, the findings on computerized tomography provided information that was essential for preoperative planning and it removed the so-called exploratory element from the operative procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,8492849,0,Cauda equina syndrome secondary to lumbar disc herniation.,"Between 1986 and 1991, 14 patients (nine men and five women), ranging in age from 22 to 67 years (mean, 43 yr), presented with acute cauda equina syndrome from a herniated lumbar disc. All presented with bilateral sciatica and leg weakness; 13 (93%) had urine or stool incontinence, or both. At presentation, all were emergently studied with myelogram/computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging. Nine (64%) had large or massive herniations, including two with tethered cords. Five had smaller herniations superimposed on preexisting stenosis. Three had previous surgery; two-thirds had a herniation at a different level. The levels of the herniations were L4-L5 in nine patients, L5-S1 in three patients, and L3-L4 in two patients. The time to surgery ranged from less than 24 hours to more than 30 days; 11 patients underwent surgery within 5 days of onset. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 5 years (mean, 3.3 yr). Postoperatively, six patients (44%) were normal, four (28%) had chronic pain and numbness, and four (28%) had persistent incontinence and weakness. All the patients were ambulatory. There were no operative deaths, and only one patient had a wound infection. Of the 10 patients who had no incontinence after surgery, 7 underwent surgery within 48 hours of onset. Of the four patients with persistent incontinence, all underwent surgery after 48 hours. Previous reports and our experience demonstrate the following most common characteristics for this presentation: 1) male sex; 2) L4-L5 herniations; and 3) onset in the 4th decade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007431,0,10422699,0,Outcome analyses in 1072 surgically treated lumbar disc herniations.,"This article reports the outcomes of 1072 consecutive patients surgically treated during a ten-year period. There are many new techniques for the treatment for lumbar disc hernia, but also the conventional standard discectomy procedure is still the most acceptable method today. 1072 consecutive, non-randomized patients with lumbar disc herniation were reviewed for a clinical retrospective study about the surgical outcome according to our functional grading system. The patients reported ruptured disc to be due to lifting (30.13%), trauma (9.42%), and sports (8.11%). Almost all patients had complained of radicular pain in a dermatomal distribution (90.39%) and 86.07% had low-back pain, 5.2% of the patients had complications. Eighty-five patients (7.92%) had a second lumbar disc operation. Thirty of these eighty-five patients underwent the operation at the same level. Patients were also rated to improve the ability. Almost 91% of the patients had excellent, good, and satisfactory outcome; 9% of patients had moderate and poor categories of outcome. Several conclusions can be drawn from this large series of patients who were operated for lumbar disc herniation. 1. Most patients had good-to-excellent surgical outcomes after lumbar discectomy. 2. The results of disc surgery depend not only upon operative technique and skill, the degree of neurological impairment but also upon the correct selection of cases."
CD007431,0,3356095,0,"Lumbar lateral canal entrapment: clinical, radiculographic and computed tomographic findings.","The radiculographic and computed tomographic findings in those nerve roots compressed by lumbar lateral canal entrapment have been assessed in a prospective series of 44 patients in whom such entrapment was found at surgery. The radiological procedures were reported by radiologists who were unaware of the clinical findings. Radiculography was performed in 41 of the patients and enabled the site or sites of entrapment to be correctly predicted in 62% of patients undergoing primary decompression and in 42% of patients undergoing revision surgery. Computed tomography (CT) was performed in 24 of the patients and enabled entrapment to be correctly predicted in 75% of the patients in both groups. We conclude that computed tomography is superior to radiculography in demonstrating lumbar lateral entrapment, and should usually be reserved for patients in whom operation or other intervention is warranted on clinical grounds. Otherwise false positive results may occur, especially in elderly patients, although the true incidence of false positive results in this condition is not known and has not been assessed in this study."

Eighteen cases (24%) were asymptomatic or only had neck or shoulder pain; 16 cases (22%) showed signs of radiculopathy, and the remaining 40 cases (54%) had myelopathy. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament developed most frequently at C5, and was rare in thoracic and lumbar regions. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament led to stenosis of the spinal canal; more marked stenosis caused clinical myelopathy. The data showed that 30% of stenosis caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament was critical for the production of myelopathy."
CD007431,0,8934890,0,[Far lateral lumbar disc herniation: clinical and radiographical features of three cases].,"The authors report three operated cases of far lateral lumbar disc herniation (FLLDH) during the past two years and discuss their diagnostic pitfalls. Until recently FLLDH was hardly ever diagnosed because the myelography was negative in almost all cases. Since the advent of CT and/or MRI, FLLDH has been found to be not such a rare entity. FLLDH has also been found to reveal characteristic clinical features and radiographical findings. Usual lumbar disc herniations occur at L4/5 or L5/S1 levels, producing low back pain with the pain or sensory disturbance from the posterolateral thigh down to the foot. In contrast, FLLDH affects upper lumbar levels and produces severe anterolateral thigh pain, dysesthesia resulting from nerve root or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) compression in the foraminal or extraforaminal region. The level predilection of these two groups can be attributed to the difference of the facet joint planes between the upper and lower lumbar levels. The facets with a coronal plane are resistant to lateral bending and rotational forces, but those with a sagittal plane are unstable resulting in more shearing stress to the intervertebral discs. A patient with definite neurological signs but a negative myelography should be examined for FLLDH by using a high-resolution CT or MRI. MRI clearly shows the detailed anatomical relationships between herniated disc and nerve root or DRG in the foraminal and extraforaminal regions. As well as thin-sliced axial images, sagittal MR images that include the foraminal zone are useful for detecting a direct nerve root compression from FLLDH. The authors conclude that gait disturbance due to severe leg pain, antero-lateral thigh pain or dysesthesia are characteristic of FLLDH, and that either a foraminal or extraforaminal herniated disc or both on a CT and/or MRI are diagnostic radiographical findings of FLLDH."

CD007431,0,6867309,0,Clinical usefulness of CT scanning in the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spine disease.,"CT scanning of the lumbar spine is in its infancy. Nevertheless, it has had a remarkable effect on the way we evaluate and treat patients. The principal advantages are the following: (1) If the scan alone in the diagnostic work-up of patients with lumbar disc herniation and correlative neurologic deficit. (2) The CT scan aids in the screening of patients with back and leg pain who did not have a neurologic deficit. It may determine the need for further studies such as myelography. (3) CT has become helpful in the evaluation of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and may replace myelography when greater experience is garnered. (4) CT is of great value in the evaluation of the lumbar spine previously operated on and may provide diagnostic information unavailable on the myelogram because of dural scar formation, arachnoiditis, and so on. (5) Future comparative studies probably will indicate greater accuracy with CT scanning than with myelography, and consequently, the overall diagnostic acumen in the treatment of patients with lumbar spine disease will be improved."

CD007431,0,2618816,0,Short-term outcome in lumbar spine surgery. A prospective study (Part I).,"A prospective survey of the outcome of lumbar surgery was carried out under conditions where all intervention was according to routine procedures. Of a consecutive series of patients 132 cases (92%) could be evaluated. The aim was to investigate possible predictive factors among self-reported data and clinical data readily available under routine circumstances. Follow-up was for six months post-operatively. Surgical findings were: herniated disc (62%), osteochondrosis (21%), other pathology (7%), and negative findings (10%). Unsatisfactory outcome was either relapse, operation before follow-up (9%) or persisting pain (30%). The surgical finding of a disc herniation predicted a significantly better outcome than any other finding. Cases previously operated upon (20%) fared equal with those operated upon for the first time irrespective of surgical findings. Self-reported weighting of preoperative pain and its location showed that predominant sciatica was significantly associated with the finding of a disc herniation, but also with satisfactory outcome irrespective of the operative finding.

The social consequences were associated with the duration of low back disease."
CD007431,0,6222717,0,Pregnancy and the herniated lumbar disc.,"During the last decade, five pregnant patients with symptoms and signs of a herniated lumbar disc were identified among a series of 48,760 consecutive deliveries at William Beaumont Hospital, an incidence of 1:10,000. In all cases, clinical evaluation and electromyography complemented conservative treatment during the final stage of pregnancy. Each patient was delivered by cesarean section. Large lumbar disc herniations in each case were subsequently identified by myelography. In all five cases, lumbar laminectomy was successful in facilitating the eventual resolution of the signs and symptoms of the radiculopathy. Although the mechanical and postural stresses of pregnancy have been cited as predisposing causes of a herniated lumbar disc, this study suggests otherwise. Lumbosacral vertebral disc ruptures of pregnancy, while relatively rare, should nevertheless be recognized early, distinguished from other causes of lumbosacral gestational plexopathy, and promptly treated."
CD007431,0,6635514,0,[Sciatic foramina radiculalgia. Apropos of 16 cases].,"Over a period of six years, the authors have seen sixteen cases of foraminal sciatica with an L5 topography which possesses the following unusual clinical features: long history of back pain with a grumbling course and without any acute episodes, progressive sciatica without any predisposing factors, paresthesiae particularly on standing with normal amipaque saccoradiculography and unresponsive to medical treatment. The operative finding in all of these patients was a disc compression in the intervertebral foramen (hernia, disc residue or softened disc), which was frequently associated with factors reducing the calibre of the foramen: abnormal position of the root and lowering of the pedicular roof caused by lumbosacral disc degeneration. This multi-factorial compression therefore required, depending on the case, curettage of the disc or a localized annulectomy combined with a facettectomy. The long term results of the operation can be considered to be favourable, in view of the long history of root pain (an average of 4 years) which largely explains the incomplete nature of the post-operative success."
CD007431,0,10398988,0,Long-term outcome of patients who underwent percutaneous nucleotomy for lumbar disc herniation: results after a mean follow-up of 5 years.,"A total of 41 patients who had undergone percutaneous nucleotomy for a single level lumbar disc herniation were clinically examined after a mean postoperative follow-up of 5 years (range 4 to 7 years). There were 14 (34%) male and 27 (66%) female patients with a mean age of 49 years. By intra-operative discography, the herniation had been graded as a protrusion in 21 (51%) patients and as a prolapse in 20 (49%) patients. At the time of the investigation, sciatica had completely recovered or markedly diminished in 32 (78%) patients, and 29 (71%) patients had returned to work. Evaluated by a 100 mm visual analog pain scale (VAS), the postoperative pain relief was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Clinical signs and symptoms of segmental instability of the lumbar spine were detected in 10 (24%) patients. Instability was significantly associated with an unsatisfactory long-term outcome in the patients with the occurrence of sciatica (p = 0.003) and low back pain (p = 0.001) as well as the VAS score (p = 0.005) and Oswestry index (p < 0.0001). Clinical investigation revealed sensory deficits in the leg in 12 (29%) patients, weakness of the extensor hallucis longus muscle in 5 (12%) patients and a total peroneal paresis in one (2%). The patellar and achilles tendon reflexes were depressed in 2 (5%) and 5 (12%) patients, respectively. During the follow-up period, recurrent disc herniation was detected in 3 (7%) patients who were all re-operated on. In addition, 3 (7%) patients were re-operated on for other back problems. Corroborating earlier findings, the results of this study indicate that percutaneous nucleotomy is an effective and safe alternative to open surgery in the treatment of patients with a small prolapse or a protrusion."
CD007431,0,3237291,0,[Spondylodiscitis following lumbar intervertebral disk surgery. Clinical aspects--diagnosis--therapy].,"From 1980 to 1986 6632 operations of the lumbar spine due to disc prolapse were carried out by the Department of Neurosurgery of the hospital of the Technical University of Munich. During this period we saw 14 cases of postoperative spondylodiscitis. Patients' main symptom was increasing low back pain. Physical examination showed difficulty in forward flexion of the body. The blood sedimentation rate was always examined: an average increase to 42/66 mm was recorded. X-ray examination of the lumbar spine and magnetic resonance imaging proved to be the most sensitive methods of investigation, better than scintigram and computed tomography. Our therapeutic management consists of fixation in normal position with a ""Light Cast"" corset and additional antibiotic therapy with cephadroxil. In comparison to other therapy methods, i.e. restcure, the advantage for our patients is that they can stay at home and move about. Therapy must be continued until the blood sedimentation rate is normal and radiological signs of consolidation can be seen for at least over 10 weeks. Good long-term results were seen in all patients."

CD007431,0,15843972,0,Subsidence after anterior lumbar interbody fusion using paired stand-alone rectangular cages.,"The authors conducted a study to determine at what stage after surgery the subsidence occurred, and to assess the relationships of radiographic fusion and the recurrence of symptoms with the development of subsidence. Ninety patients underwent a single-level anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) using paired stand-alone rectangular cages between November 2000 and June 2002. All patients had regular clinical or imaging follow-up for a minimum of 19 months (range 19-38 months, mean = 27 months). The ratio of male to female patients was 1:3.1. The patients' ages at the time of ALIF ranged from 25 to 72 years, with a mean of 53 years. The preoperative and postoperative intervertebral disc heights were serially measured by plain radiographs. The location of cage subsidence into the vertebral body and times until the presence of subsidence were also assessed. The mean preoperative intervertebral disc height was 11.6+/-3.1 mm, which spread immediately after surgery to 16.9+/-2.0 mm. This increase was statistically significant (P = 0.001). At the last follow-up visit, the mean intervertebral disc height had been reduced to 13.2+/-2.4 mm. Sixty-nine of 90 patients (76.7%) developed cage subsidence into the surrounding vertebral body. Subsidence was more often noted in the superior endplate above the cage with regard to the location of cage subsidence [superior endplate: 27 patients (39.1%), inferior endplate: 12 patients (17.3%), both: 30 patients (43.6%)]. The onset of subsidence varied from 0.25 to 8 months after surgery (median, 2.75 months). The 8-, 12-, and 16-week actuarial rates for developing cage subsidence were 38.9, 63.4, and 70.7%, respectively, when using the Kaplan-Meier method. There was no statistical correlation between the recurrence of symptoms (P = 0.3952) and radiographic fusion (P = 0.9518) with the log-rank test in development of subsidence. This study demonstrates that cage subsidence is an expected occurrence after ALIF using stand-alone rectangular cages. The 3- and 4-month actuarial rates for developing cage subsidence were 63.4 and 70.7%, respectively, and cage subsidence had no correlation with recurrence of symptoms and radiographic fusion in our study."
CD007431,0,2954226,0,Dallas discogram description. A new classification of CT/discography in low-back disorders.,"A new classification method for CT/discography was developed. The Dallas discogram description (DDD) related five separate categories of information. Degeneration and annular disruption were regarded as separate phenomena. Additionally, provoked pain response, contrast volume, and miscellaneous information were recorded. Discogram findings of 59 patients with low-back and/or leg pain were graded according to the new method and compared with standard methods using routine anteroposterior and lateral discographic images. Findings from routine discography and CT/discography were graded and correlated with myelographic and plain computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans. This study demonstrated that the contrast-enhanced axial view provided by CT/discography served as a useful projection for demonstrating disc pathology. CT/discography analyzed according to DDD offered a more sensitive discriminator of disc degeneration from annular disruption (disc protrusion/leaking). This evaluation can be recommended as the procedure of choice when revision of spine surgery is considered or when there is an equivocal or negative correlation between clinical information and myelography or CAT scan."

CD007431,0,6410824,0,Influence of spinal posture on abnormalities demonstrated by lumbar myelography.,"During spinal movements the dural end sac undergoes displacement and deformation, chiefly because of bulging of intervertebral disks and flaval ligaments in lumbar extension. Under normal circumstances these dural changes of form do not lead to clinical symptoms. However, in patients with spinal stenosis radiologic signs may be accentuated in lumbar extension. These tend to disappear in flexion. This implies that examination techniques performed in extension (prone lumbar myelography) tend to enhance abnormalities, while techniques in which the spine is more or less flexed (epidural phlebography, computed tomography) tend to mask them. In addition, there may be discrepancy between the picture during surgery (usually in lumbar flexion) and the situation in which a patient experiences symptoms (usually in lumbar extension in spinal stenosis)."

CD007431,0,7641460,0,Percutaneous laser disc nucleotomy.,"In September 1988, the first laser decompression of a symptomatic contained bulging disc was performed in the United States. This author participated in a case study of 333 patients treated with the neodymium (Nd)-impregnated yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser of 1064-nm wavelength. He also treated 117 patients with the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser of 532-nm wavelength. Detailed surgical techniques and followup statistics of the 117 patients treated with the KTP laser are presented and compared with those of a subset of 36 of the 333 patients treated with the Nd:YAG laser. Of the 117 patients treated with the KTP laser, 23 patients were at the 2-year followup, and 46 patients at the 1-year followup, at the time of this writing. A statistically significant reduction in overall average patient pain was documented by disc level as a function of followup duration. Variation in average specific neurologic findings (knee jerk, reflex, toe strength, ankle jerk, pinprick, and Lasague's sign) by disc level as a function of followup duration was not significant. These procedures were accomplished with no major complications. The success rate based on a 2-year followup was 72%. The success rate with the Nd:YAG laser was very similar, at 70%. These data provide encouraging information substantiating the validity of laser surgery for percutaneous disc nucleotomy."
CD007431,0,11513310,0,Concurrent improvements in cardiorespiratory and muscle fitness in response to total body recumbent stepping in humans.,"A group of 26 sedentary adults [mean age 48.4 (SD 6.4) years] were allocated randomly into either a non-exercising control group (CON, n =9) or an exercise group (EX, n = 17) that trained 3 days a week for 12 weeks using a total body recumbent stepper (TBRS). Training intensity and duration progressed from 50% of heart rate reserve maximum (HRRmax) for 20 min to 75% HRRmax for 40 min. Maximal exercise responses were measured during incremental treadmill (TM) and TBRS tests to examine the specificity of the adaptations to training. Muscle strength was measured using a one repetition maximum (1 RM) test for the leg press (LP), chest press (CP), and seated row (SR). Muscle endurance (END) was evaluated for LP, CP, and SR as the number of repetitions achieved before failure when exercising at an intensity of 60% of baseline 1 RM. Body composition was estimated using the sum of seven skinfolds. After training, significant increases (P < 0.05) in maximal oxygen uptake and exercise time were observed in the EX group on both the TM (9.3% and 4.8%, respectively) and TBRS (18.2% and 70.5%, respectively). The TBRS training resulted in significant increases (P < 0.01) in 1 RM and END of the legs, chest, and back, with greater magnitude of improvements observed for END. Furthermore, TBRS training resulted in a significant increase in lean body mass and significant reductions in fat mass and percentage body fat (P<0.01). The CON did not show changes in any measurement (P>0.05). These data indicated concurrent improvements in both cardiovascular and muscle fitness. The greater improvements observed on the TBRS test and in muscle endurance suggest the adaptations are specific to the mode of training."

CD007431,0,9883963,0,Comparison of three techniques of anterior fusion in single-level cervical disc herniation.,"This study compared the clinical and radiographic outcome of three techniques of anterior fusion for cervical disc herniation: Cloward fusion with autograft, Cloward fusion with freeze-dried bone, and BAK-C device fusion. In a cohort of 84 consecutive patients, 34 were treated by classic autograft Cloward's technique, in 26 patients freeze-dried xenograft Surgibone was used and in the last 24 patients a BAK-C titanium device was implanted. The mean follow-up period of this last group was 14.6 months. All patients were operated by the same surgeon at the same hospital and all underwent single-level surgery. Results were evaluated on the basis of patient satisfaction and postoperative capacity to work. There was no significant difference between the three groups related to the preoperative assessment. The analysis revealed that BAK-C patients had significantly shorter hospital stays. No postoperative cervical collar was worn by BAK-C patients and they had the highest percentage of excellent clinical results. Concerning radiographic evaluation, BAK-C achieved a more stable fixation of the involved segment without complications in contrast with the two others, which presented a significant incidence of extrusion, collapse, kyphosis and pseudarthrosis. Measurement of the progressive kyphosis grade shows statistically significant differences between the three groups. BAK-C patients had the lowest kyphosis grade at the end of the follow-up. There is an important correlation between collapse, collapse with kyphosis and pseudarthrosis with bad clinical results. In conclusion, the BAK-C device showed significant advantages, including higher patient satisfaction, unnecessary postoperative collar, early rehabilitation and a lower rate of complications. Furthermore, BAK-C is cost effective because of it shortens postoperative hospital stay and allows an earlier return to work."
CD007431,0,8750399,0,Comparison of the onset and intensity of action of intramuscular meloxicam and oral meloxicam in patients with acute sciatica.,"In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial, 113 patients with acute sciatica were treated with a single 15-mg dose of meloxicam given intramuscularly (n = 54) or orally (n = 59). There was a significant improvement in induced pain (as measured by using the straight-leg-raising test) in both treatment groups at 60 minutes (P < 0.005), and there was a significant difference in favor of the intramuscular formulation in terms of the time to maximum improvement of induced pain (P = 0.01). Changes in spontaneous pain were similar in both treatment groups and were significant versus baseline (P < 0.01) at 30 minutes after study drug administration. Global efficacy evaluations by both the patients and investigators confirmed that meloxicam 15 mg in an intramuscular or oral formulation was effective in relieving pain in patients with acute sciatica. Meloxicam was generally well tolerated, and the local tolerability of the intramuscular injection was found to be excellent on the basis of both clinical evaluation and assessment of creatine phosphokinase levels."

The review revealed a higher incidence of adolescent lumbar disk herniations in female patients and a higher percentage of patients with a family history than previously reported. Leg pain continues to be the primary presenting symptom in this group of patients and is often not recognized as the radicular pain of a herniated disk by the primary care physician. This reflects a lack of understanding of the relationship of the presenting symptoms to the pathology of the herniated nucleus pulposus, causing a delay in referral to the spine specialist."

CD007431,0,3381141,0,The lumbar facet syndrome.,"A clinical study was undertaken to formulate better criteria for accurate diagnosis of the lumbar facet syndrome and for predicting treatment response to facet joint injection. Twenty-two consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of lumbar facet syndrome, made by conventional diagnostic criteria, who were then treated with facet joint injection, were reviewed for their treatment responses. New diagnostic criteria were formulated based on a scoring system derived from the values observed in this review study. The scoring system has a total of 100 points, allocated as follows: back pain associated with groin or thigh pain, 30 points; well-localized paraspinal tenderness, 20 points; reproduction of pain with extension-rotation, 30 points; corresponding radiographic changes, 20 points; and pain below the knee, -10 points. A score of 60 points or more indicates a very high probability of satisfactory response to facet joint injection (100% prolonged response in this study). When only the conventional criteria were used, the overall results of prolonged relief of pain after facet joint injection was 50%. A ""scorecard"" system is proposed that may give a higher degree of diagnostic accuracy and predictability of successful response to facet joint injection."

CD007431,0,12177541,0,Local application of steroids following lumbar discectomy.,"In this prospective randomized clinical study, the effectiveness of epidural steroids to reduce pain following lumbar disc surgery was assessed. Sixty-one patients undergoing lumbar discectomy were included. They were assigned randomly to receive, immediately after removal of the disc, either 80 mg methylprednisolone acetate (Depomedrol) or the same amount (2 mL) of saline. Both were soaked in 2.5 x 2.5 cm of collagen absorbable hemostat (Instat) that was left on the decompressed nerve root. All discs were removed in the same way via unilateral flavectomy. The patients were asked to grade the pain intensity daily in the first 2 weeks and 1 year after surgery. Pain intensity was evaluated by the visual analog scale from 0 to 10, zero being no pain and 10 being the most severe pain. Statistically significant back pain relief was observed on postoperative days 1, 2, 6, and 14 in the study group (the group that received steroids). No difference between the two groups was found 1 year after surgery or when leg pain was compared. No side effects that could be related to the steroids were observed."

Surgery was most frequently required following L4/L5 than L5/S1 nucleolysis. The most frequent causes of failure of nucleolysis were lateral osseous stenosis (19 cases) and sub-ligamentous hernia (17 cases), apparently due to the ineffectiveness of the enzyme. Excluded hernia was rare (4 cases). Hernias at another level (4 cases) required surgery since it was not possible to repeat the injection of chymopapain. Three of these explorations were of the linea alba and one failure was due to spondylolisthesis due to isthmic lysis. Some failures occurred after some delay. The sciatic relapses after a period of complete clinical cure. In some cases, the relapse was in fact at another level or involved sub-ligamentous or excluded hernia. Surgery following nucleolysis is the same as that of an uninjected hernia; there are no adherences. The results are generally the same as those obtained by primitive surgery (two thirds favorable outcome). However, this depends mainly on what has been detected. The results are very good for hernias at another level and for excluded hernias. Fair results are obtained for stenosis and for sub-ligamentous hernias but only poor results in explorations of the linea alba."

Apropos of 120 cases surgically-treated].,"Lower-limb somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) of nerve-trunk (peroneal nerve, posterior tibial nerve) and dermatomal (L5 and S1) stimulation were recorded in 120 patients suffering from lumbosacral disk disease. Recordings were performed before surgery and on Days 4 and 50 after surgery. Electromyography was also performed before surgery. Dermatomal SEPs were shown to be sensitive (70%) and specific in both terms of their lateralizing value and their ability to identify the L5 or S1 level. Moreover, combining SEPs and EMG significantly increased the sensitivity of the electrophysiological testing when compared with each method alone. There was no relationship between SEPs performed before surgery and surgical outcome. Inversely, we demonstrated the prognostic value of SEPs performed on Day 4, SEP normalization at Day 4 was associated with a good outcome at Day 50 in 91.8% of examined cases, while the persistence of pathological SEPs at Day 4 was associated with poor outcome at Day 50 in 56% of the cases."
CD007431,0,15847323,0,[Use of movalis in treatment of dorsopathy].,"In regard to therapeutic effect of different medications used in dorsopathy treatment, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs rank first. Compounds selectively blocking COX-2 received special attention due to their minimal impact on COX-1 that provides good anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect with simultaneous dramatic reduction of ulcerogenic activity. One of the first drugs with such an action is Movalis (meloxicam). Thirty patients were divided into 2 groups, the first including 22 patients with vertebral diseases and musculotonic syndromes; patients of the second group (8) had a pain syndrome caused by disk herniation. During the first 3 days Movalis was administered in the form of injections (15 mg/day) and in the same doses in tablets for the following 20 days. After the treatment course, complete arrest of pain syndrome was observed in 33.3% patients, significant improvement--in 53.3% and insignificant effect--in 13.3%. Patients with reflex pain and musculotonic syndromes had a good analgesic effect after 3-day course of intramuscular injections, with the effect being mostly expressed in 8-10 days. Patients with diskogenic compressive radicular syndrome demonstrated a stable analgesic effect after a week of Movalis intake in tablet form. Movalis is well tolerated; side effects have occurred in 10 patients but they were minimal and did not lead to the change of medication dose or additional therapy."

Although pathological mechanisms underlying PLBP are obscure, dysfunction of the sacroiliac joints (SI-joints) seems to play an important role. A cross-sectional study was performed on 24 pregnant women with and without PLBP. The objective was to determine muscle activation patterns of trunk and leg muscles during the active straight leg raising test (ASLR) and static hip flexion, and to determine maximal hip flexion force at 0 and 20 cm leg raise height. Moreover, the effort to raise the leg was scored. The measurements resulted in several significant differences between the patients and healthy controls; among others (a) patients scored subjectively more effort during ASLR, (b) at both 0 and 20 cm leg raise height patients had less hip flexion force, and (c) patients developed more muscle activity during ASLR. Since pregnant women with PLBP developed a higher muscle activity during ASLR with a significantly lower output at 0 and 20 cm than healthy pregnant women, it could be proposed that the ASLR demonstrates a disturbed load transfer across the SI-joints in this population."

Forty patients with a clinical diagnosis of disc prolapse were examined pre-operatively. The following criteria were noted: 1. Level, 2. lateralisation, 3. medial or lateral position, 4. differentiation between protrusion and sequestration, 5 displacement of the sequestrum. In 38 patients surgery was performed. Criteria 1 to 3 had been correctly diagnosed in 35 and 34 resp. and Ct proved equally reliable in respect of criteria 4 and 5. It is concluded that the combination of clinical examination and CT provides adequate diagnostic information before surgery. Myelography should be used only where there is still doubt."

A prospective case series.,"All 38 patients listed for day-case spinal endoscopy over a 12-month period (April 1998 - April 1999), who had chronic severe low back pain with a radiculopathic element, were studied prospectively. The mean [range] pain duration before treatment was 10.9 [2-26] years and 50% had failed back surgery syndrome. In all patients in whom treatment was completed (n = 34), the pain-generating nerve roots were located through symptom interaction with the patient. All had epidural scar tissue, 14 (41%) having dense adhesions. Mobilisation of adhesions around the nerve root (neuroplasty) was performed so that a pocket was formed for the subsequent placement of bupivacaine, Depomedrone and clonidine. No intra-operative complications occurred and side-effects were minimal. Follow-up over a 12-month period showed statistically significant reductions in pain scores and disability. Spinal endoscopy may be the diagnostic method of choice for epidural fibrosis. It has substantial therapeutic and research potential. Prospective randomised studies are required."

Significant associations with abnormal MR imaging findings were shown for patients with pain, weakness, abnormal neurologic findings, and atypical curvatures. Furthermore, there was a striking association of convex left thoracic or thoracolumbar scoliosis with hydrosyringomyelia (six of seven cases).

CD007431,0,14534838,0,The effect of epidural free fat graft on the outcome of lumbar disc surgery.,"Numerous materials have been used to prevent epidural scar tissue after lumbar disc surgery. Free fat grafts are common both experimentally and clinically, but there is some doubt about their protection against fibrosis, and some complications have been reported. In this prospective study, the usefulness of free fat grafts during lumbar disc surgery was evaluated. Ninety-nine patients who had undergone operation due to lumbar disc herniation were divided in two groups: those with implantation of free fat grafts (group A) and those without (group B). Outcome was evaluated at a mean of 2.6 years postoperatively according to the following criteria: visual analog scale for back and leg pain, Hannover Questionnaire on activities of daily living, reflex findings, sensory and motor deficits, consumption of analgesics, walking distance, straight leg raising test, and clinical examination. The outcome variables showed no significant differences between the two groups ( P>0.05). This study suggests that the use of free fat grafts during lumbar disc surgery was clinically ineffective."

There was an overall concordance rate of 85% between CT scanning and myelography. In those 52 patients treated by surgery, concordance between the CT and the myelogram was similar at 86.5%. Myelography and surgical findings were in agreement in 94.2% of cases, while CT findings and surgical finding agreed in 92.3% of cases. The authors' data indicate that the CT scan is as accurate as myelography in the diagnosis of lumbar disc disease.

CD007431,0,18441759,0,Effects of electroacupuncture on a degenerated intervertebral disc using an in-vivo rat-tail model.,"Electroacupuncture (EA) has long been used as conservative treatment for low back pain (LBP). Its effect on relief of back pain has been demonstrated in many clinical studies. However, whether it has any effect on the biological properties of an intervertebral disc, which is one of the major causes of LBP, is still unclear. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the effects of EA with different simulation frequencies on an intervertebral disc with simulated degeneration using an in-vivo rat-tail model. In this study, 33 rats were used. Disc degeneration was simulated in the rat caudal 8-9 disc via continuous static compressive loading of 11 N for 2 weeks. EA with a frequency of 2 or 100 Hz was then applied to the degenerated disc for 3 weeks with 3 sessions/week and 20 min/session. The intervertebral disc height was measured before and after compression as well as after EA intervention for 3 weeks. The static compression was found to result in a reduction in the disc height of about 22 per cent. There was no evidence that this change could be reversed after resting or the EA intervention. However, EA at 100 Hz was found to induce a further decrease in disc height, which was not shown for the rats after resting or EA at 2 Hz. The results of this study showed that effects of EA on disc degeneration are frequency dependent and adverse effects could result if EA at a certain frequency was used."

For spinal nerve stimulation, we adapted a monopolar needle electrode inserted deep into the paraspinal muscle. The minimal latency, amplitude, and negative phase area of compound muscle action potential from myotomal muscles were recorded with computer assistance. Abnormality was considered to be significant when the value fell outside of 2 SD of control mean values. Among 17 patients with clinical evidence of radiculopathy, needle EMG was abnormal in 10 patients (58.8%), whereas in the nerve stimulation test the abnormalities were shown in 16 patients (94.1%); in amplitude difference and the abnormal area, differences were shown in 12 patients (70.6%). Among 23 patients with only subjective symptoms of radiculopathy, needle EMG was abnormal in nine patients (39.1%), whereas the abnormal amplitude differences were shown in 18 patients (78.3%) and 15 patients (65.2%) with abnormal area difference by spinal nerve stimulation, respectively.

CD007431,0,10333151,0,Relationship of pain drawings to invasive tests assessing intervertebral disc pathology.,"It has been found that the pain patterns in pain drawings are related to the presence of herniated disc identified by myelography. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the pattern of pain in the drawings or the type of pain indicated (aching, burning, numbness, pins and needles, stabbing) was related to the presence of symptomatic disc pathology identified by CT/discography. In a subgroup of patients who underwent myelography, the relationship of the drawings to myelographic findings was also investigated. Pain drawings were completed by 187 patients with low back and/or radicular pain who were undergoing CT/discography. The drawings were scored in two ways, first by the system described by Ransford and secondly by visual inspection. They were classified as being indicative, or not, of disc pathology. The CT/discograms were classified as disrupted, or not, and the pain responses were recorded upon injection of each disc, based on the similarity of the pain provoked to clinical symptoms. Among the 133 patients with discogenic pain confirmed by discography, 110 (82.7%) had pain drawings that were classified as indicative. Among the 45 patients without discogenic pain, 29 (64.4%) had pain drawings classified as non-indicative. Patients with discogenic pain used more symbols indicating burning pain and aching pain than did non-discogenic pain patients. Our results confirmed those reported earlier by Uden, who found a relationship between the pattern of pain in the drawings and myelographic findings. Pain drawings may be helpful in the diagnosis of symptomatic disc pathology."

CD007431,0,7709186,0,[Long-term results of diskectomy and primary spondylodesis in treatment of lumbar disk hernia].,"The indication for spine fusion in combination with diskectomy it neither clearly defined nor widely accepted. It largely depends on the specialist to whom the patient is referred. While orthopedists often perform primary fusions, neurosurgeons hardly ever do so, no matter what the nature of the complaint is. Therefore, the selection of the procedure seems to be a rather random choice. The question is not whether the combined operation or the simple disc excision is superior in itself, but which of the two should be chosen in a given case. For patients with disc displacement and radicular pain as the predominant symptom, undercutting hemilaminectomy and disc excision will generally yield satisfying results. The main indication for a combined operation is a history of instability complaints long before radicular pain caused by the disc displacement appears. Since the number of patients (of all age groups) that require a disc operation is ever increasing, the selection of patients suited for a combined operation is becoming more and more important, so as to bring down the number of secondary fusions for the treatment of invalidating low back pain after disc excision. The aim of our clinical research is to test the criteria for the selection of patients for the combined operation by taking into account both patients who underwent a combined operation and others whose postoperative condition was such as to require a secondary fusion within one year after diskectomy. In the majority of these cases, one can presume that the fusion should have been carried out on the occasion of the first operation. 26 (90%) out of 29 patients showed a good result three months after the combined operation; 25 (86%) were still satisfied four years later. This confirms that patients with a long history of low back pain as a symptom of instability--in addition to the recent symptoms of the herniation--and those with a significant dislocation of one vertebral body (retrolisthesis, spondylolisthesis and pseudospondylolisthesis), too, should be examined in view of a possible combined operation. However, the combined operation is needed in no more than about three to four per cent of all diskectomies."

To compare the clinical outcomes and the natural morphologic changes of between sequestered and large central extruded disc herniations. The spontaneous disappearance or diminution of large herniated lumbar discs in the spinal canal is known. Poor clinical outcome and small changes of herniated discs have been shown for large central extruded disc herniations with conservative treatment. The study population consisted of 22 patients with sequestration and a large central as extrusion established by an MR imaging study. Seventeen (11 patients with sequestration, and 6 patients with a large central extrusion) patients underwent a follow-up MR imaging study. The size of the herniated disc was measured on serial MR imaging studies, and the changes in size were classified into four categories. Clinical evaluations were also performed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), the Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire, the straight leg raising test (SLRT) and so forth. Both the sequestered and large central extruded disc herniations showed a successful clinical outcome after conservative treatment in 17 of 22 patients (77%) in total: 11 of 13 patients (85%) with sequestered disc herniations, and 6 of 9 patients (67%) with large central extruded disc herniations. VAS and Oswestry disability scoring showed a greater change in the group with sequestration than in the group with large central extrusions. In the group with sequestration, seven patients reported the disappearance of herniated disc materials, and four patients showed a marked decrease in the size of their herniated discs in follow-up MR images. However, in the group with large central extrusions, only two patients showed a decrease in the size of their herniated discs. Large central extruded disc herniations can be treated successfully by conservative treatment. Outcomes seemed to be as good as or slightly inferior to those of sequestered disc herniations. However, a greater morphologic decrease in the herniated discs occurred more frequently for sequestered disc herniations than for large central extruded disc herniations."

Thoracic myelopathy is rare, and there are many unsolved problems including its epidemiological and clinical features. We have established a registration system of spinal surgeries, which covered almost all surgeries in Miyagi Prefecture, and enrolled the data of 265 patients with thoracic myelopathy from 1988 to 2002. The annual rate of surgery gradually increased and averaged 0.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, which was less than 1/10 of that for cervical myelopathy. About 20 patients with thoracic myelopathy are operated on in Miyagi Prefecture each year. It frequently develops in middle-aged males. About half of the cases were caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum, followed by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, intervertebral disc herniation and posterior spur. Patients usually noticed numbness or pain in the legs and the preoperative duration was long, averaging 2 years. Its symptomatic similarities to lumbar disorders might cause difficulty in making a correct diagnosis. Since thoracic myelopathy can markedly restrict the activities of daily life, even general physicians should recognize this entity."

All patients had been under treatment with analgesic or anti-inflammatory agents. The intensity of the pain was measured 2, 7, 30, and 180 days after the percutaneous discectomy. An improvement in the painful symptomatology of less than 30%, observed in 11 cases and in 1 case of epidural pathology, was considered an unsuccessful result. A decrease of the pain of more than 70% was observed in 72% of cases, either with the end of the symptoms of pain as noted in 79.5% of patients or with a marked reduction of the medical treatments obtained in 21.5%. The results obtained were already almost definitive at the seventh day of follow-up, and further controls rarely demonstrated an improvement in the pain. The location of the herniated disc is a parameter which appears to be very important in the efficacy of percutaneous discectomy.

There were no differences in sexes, ages, or pain duration between the group of 37 patients with a herniated lumbar disc compared to the 44 patients with a normal myelogram. From the features of the pain drawing alone, it was possible to predict the presence or absence of a herniated disc with a high statistical significance (p less than 0.001). Patients with a disc herniation rarely had pain in the upper trunk or arms (three of 37) compared with the normal group (23 of 44). Only one of nine patients with pain in the groin had disc herniation, and the same was true concerning pain in the iliac crest. Three patients without pain below the knee had no prolapsed disc.

With regard to work-related factors, load lifting with 44.7 and body posture with 18.4 percent contributed to low back pain as the most important occupational causes among the patients. Observing recommended regulations and limitations of load lifting, modifying and optimizing ergonomic conditions in the workplace, selecting workers with suitable body strength on the basis of a pre-employment examination and implementing a continuous educational program for employees were the most important methods recommended to prevent low back pain."
CD007431,0,2608145,0,[Effect of surgery on neurological involvement caused by a lumbosacral radicular syndrome].,"Results of neurological assessment one year after surgical treatment of herniated lumbar intervertebral disc and lumbar stenosis are reported in 443 patients. Follow-up was performed during one year after operation. Preoperatively, surgeons found motor loss more frequently than patients, (28 and 12% respectively) and, postoperatively, motor loss was still present in 25% and 24%, respectively, of these cases. The operation had caused motor loss in 5% and aggravated motor loss in 3%. Sensibility was reported as abnormal one year after surgery by both patients and surgeons in one-third of the cases. Sensory loss, considered by the patient to have been caused or aggravated by the operation, occurred in 15% of the cases and in 12% of these the surgeons agreed. Preoperatively, unilaterally diminished knee and Achilles tendon reflexes were found in 9% and 42% respectively; one year after surgery, these had recovered in 65% and 57%, respectively. Surgery caused or aggravated unilaterally diminished knee or ankle jerks in 3% and 10%, respectively."
CD007431,0,2278776,0,Size of lumbar disc hernias measured using computed tomography and related to sciatic symptoms.,"The change in the relative size of lumbar disc hernias and its relation to sciatic symptoms was investigated in 30 consecutive patients after conservative treatment of CT verified lumbar disc herniations. CT and clinical examination were performed before the start of therapy (CT1), as well as 3 months (CT2) and 24 months (CT3) after institution of treatment. In each patient the size of the lumbar disc herniation in relation to the size of the spinal canal was measured on identical CT slices and expressed as an index. The disc herniation index decreased markedly from CT1 to CT2 (p less than 0.001). Between CT2 and CT3 the reduction of the hernias was less pronounced and not significant for hernias located centrally but still significant for intermediate (p = 0.03) and lateral (p = 0.04) hernias. The degree of sciatic symptoms also decreased markedly between CT1 and CT2 (p = 0.001) while no further improvement occurred from CT2 to CT3. There was a significant positive correlation between the improvement from sciatic pain and the reduction in the size of the individual hernia (CT1-CT2 p = 0.02, CT2-CT3 p less than 0.001). Thus, the disc herniation index provided a method to study the anatomic effect of conservative treatment as well as a method to evaluate sciatic symptoms in relation to anatomic changes."

The trend towards minimally invasive surgery that minimizes surgical exposure and reduces postoperative pain increasingly requires surgeons to accurately determine the operative level before an incision is made.

CD007431,0,8553881,0,Facilitation of the human nociceptive reflex by stimulation of A beta-fibres in a secondary hyperalgesic area sustained by nociceptive input from the primary hyperalgesic area.,"Hyperalgesia was induced in healthy volunteers by topical capsaicin applied on the dorsum of the foot within the receptive field of the sural nerve. Under presence of hyperalgesia different normally non-noxious conditioning stimuli were applied to the hyperalgesic area and the polysynaptic nociceptive spinal reflex and pain ratings were used to assess central excitability. The nociceptive reflex was measured in the knee extensor and flexor muscles evoked by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve trunk at an intensity of 1.5 times the initial reflex threshold (an intensity above the pain threshold). Thermal stimulation of the primary hyperalgesic area (re)established both on-going spontaneous pain and secondary hyperalgesia. Thus, increased nociceptive reflexes were recorded and increased pain intensity reported when A beta-fibres in the secondary hyperalgesic area were activated concurrently with the reflex testing after a non-noxious thermal stimulation of the primary hyperalgesic area. The A beta-fibre activation was achieved by continuous low-intensity electrical stimulation (40 Hz) that was initiated after on-going pain produced by the thermal stimulation had waned. The same measurement without prior thermal conditioning stimulation of the primary area resulted in no reflex facilitation, indicating rapid changes in the central excitability with existence of on-going nociceptive activity. This indicates that the development and maintenance of secondary hyperalgesia are dependent on sustained peripheral nociceptive activity. The study also shows that a central summation of nociceptive and non-nociceptive afferent activity can occur once secondary hyperalgesia is present."

Application of current through electrodes placed on the dorsal columns in these patients also relieved pain, but to a lesser degree and with the development of associated paresthesias. In one patient, application of current from anterior electrodes to posterior electrodes produced a zone of dissociated sensory loss.

CD007431,0,12384752,0,Blood clots in vessels surrounding symptomatic nerve roots in disc herniation patients: a pilot study.,"Mechanical compression and biochemical influences, e.g. by various inflammatory cells and mediators, have been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of sciatica. In addition, it has been suggested, but so far not clearly demonstrated, that blood pooling in the venous blood vessels surrounding nerve roots may contribute to impaired nerve root function and sciatica. There is also more direct evidence from studies on an animal model that nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue may induce blood vessel thrombosis. In the present study, a specific monoclonal antibody to platelet membrane glycoprotein complex GPIIb-IIIa was used for direct visualization of blood clots in tissue samples removed from the vicinity of symptomatic nerve roots in 20 disc herniation (DH) patients. For 12 patients, the DH was primary, for 7 patients recurrent and for 1 patient the index operation was for root canal stenosis following a DH operation 3 months earlier. Blood clots immunoreactive to GPIIb-IIIa were observed in small blood vessels in 11/20 tissue samples (55%), in 5/12 patients (42%) with primary DH and in 5/7 patients (71%) with recurrent DH. The presence or absence of GPIIb-IIIa complex immunoreactivity did not show a statistically significant relationship with pain duration, DH type (primary or recurrent), gender or straight leg raising (SLR). Thus, though immunohistochemically demonstrable, the observed periradicular blood clots could not be established to have a clinical role in sciatica in this pilot study."

Normal values and clinical application in disorders of the lumbar spine.,"Magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, motor roots, and proximal nerve trunks was performed in 46 healthy adults and in 73 consecutive patients with disorders of the lumbar spine. In combination with neurography and F-wave recordings, the fractionated stimulation of the motor pathways allowed calculation of conduction times of the pyramidal tract fibers, of the motor roots (ie, caudal fibers), and of the motor fibers of the lumbosacral plexus. Normal values for motor conduction times to the quadriceps, anterior tibial, and extensor digitorum brevis muscles were established. Patients had clinical and radiologic diagnoses of spinal stenosis (n = 43) and nerve root compression syndromes (n = 30). Motor conduction times to lower limb muscles were significantly delayed (above mean normal value +/- 2 x SD) in 65% of the patients with spinal stenosis and 50% of the patients with nerve root compression syndromes. Conduction slowing could be localized within the motor root and caudal fiber segment of the motor pathways in 80% of the patients in whom F-waves could be recorded. This method can be used to verify, quantify, and locate lesions of the motor pathways in conditions such as compression of the spinal cord, the caudal fibers (spinal stenosis), or the motor root passing through the intervertebral canal."

CD007431,0,2312537,0,Abnormal magnetic-resonance scans of the lumbar spine in asymptomatic subjects. A prospective investigation.,"We performed magnetic resonance imaging on sixty-seven individuals who had never had low-back pain, sciatica, or neurogenic claudication. The scans were interpreted independently by three neuro-radiologists who had no knowledge about the presence or absence of clinical symptoms in the subjects. About one-third of the subjects were found to have a substantial abnormality. Of those who were less than sixty years old, 20 per cent had a herniated nucleus pulposus and one had spinal stenosis. In the group that was sixty years old or older, the findings were abnormal on about 57 per cent of the scans: 36 per cent of the subjects had a herniated nucleus pulposus and 21 per cent had spinal stenosis. There was degeneration or bulging of a disc at at least one lumbar level in 35 per cent of the subjects between twenty and thirty-nine years old and in all but one of the sixty to eighty-year-old subjects. In view of these findings in asymptomatic subjects, we concluded that abnormalities on magnetic resonance images must be strictly correlated with age and any clinical signs and symptoms before operative treatment is contemplated."

Fifty-six percent of the herniations at L4-5. However, pain projection into the first sacral distribution was most common. Neurologic symptoms and signs of involvement of a single root were present in 239 cases and of two roots in 154 cases in L4-5 and L5S1 herniations. Pain projection into the fifth lumbar distribution was a very important symptom for identification of clinical findings of the fifth lumbar root involvement gave a level diagnostic accuracy comparable with myelography, while pain projection into the first sacral distribution was less reliable especially in cases with signs of two roots. The neurologic picture of high herniations was completely unreliable. Lumbar myelography or computer tomography is recommended as a routine preoperative study."

CD007431,0,9066539,0,Tissue characterization of symptomatic and asymptomatic disc herniations by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging.,"The purpose of this investigation was to determine differences in tissue composition of symptomatic and asymptomatic disc herniations as reflected in T1 and T2 relaxation times (quantitative magnetic resonance imaging). Thirty patients with sciatica severe enough to require a discectomy and 46 asymptomatic volunteers (controls) were included in this study. Both groups had a clinical examination as well as a magnetic resonance investigation of the lumbar spine. The longitudinal and transverse magnetic relaxation times (T1 and T2, respectively) were calculated from a set of 20 images obtained with five single-slice/multi-echo sequences at different repetition time values on a commercial whole-body system (1.5 T). Twenty-two symptomatic and asymptomatic disc herniations could be matched according to age, gender, disc level, and the extent of herniation (protrusion or extrusion) and were compared with regard to T1 and T2 relaxation times. Symptomatic disc herniations exhibited significantly (pT1 < 0.04 and pT2 < 0.003) shorter T1 (delta T1: -182.1 milliseconds, -15%) and T2 (delta T2: -11.0 milliseconds, -21%) relaxation times than matched asymptomatic herniations. Symptomatic disc herniations also exhibited more advanced disc degeneration as graded by Pearce's criteria (p < 0.01). These results suggest that symptomatic and morphologically matched asymptomatic disc herniations differ with regard to disc matrix composition."

CD007431,0,8975421,0,[Lumbar intervertebral disk prolapse in adolescents].,"We investigated the incidence, history, clinical findings and results of treatment of lumbar intervertebral disc herniation in adolescents. During the period January 1992 to medio March 1995 we operated on 20 adolescents aged 15 to 19 years (3.4% of all cases of lumbar disc herniation). In the case of five patients there was a delay of more than a year before the correct diagnosis was made. Ten women and ten men were operated on. Median time from start of symptoms to operation was 1 year (1 month-5 years). The dominant symptom was back pain with radiating pain (17/ 20). The straight leg raising test was positive in 19/20. Seven of the patients had scoliosis. The levels of herniation were ten in the 4th lumbar disc and nine in the 5th lumbar disc. The results were excellent or good in all patients, except in one patient in whom no disc herniation had been found. Lumbar disc herniation in adolescents should be considered in the case of back pain and radiating pain to one or both legs. Investigation and treatment should follow the same guidelines as for adults. The short-term results of surgical treatment are good."
CD007431,0,15830980,0,CAM versus nucleoplasty.,"In recent years the general trend in spinal surgery has been reduction and minimalization. In general, all these have shown a moderate or good clinical result but they have been associated with serious sequelae. Plasma-mediated electrosurgery, widely used in other medical fields, has demonstrated to be well suited for this new indication. To perform the Nucleoplasty (Coblation) and the CAM (Coblation-Assisted Microdiscectomy) is use the Perc-DLE SpineWand connected to a System 2000 generator (ArthoCare Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) was used. The device functions via plasma-mediated electrosurgery (Coblation) and differs from traditional electrosurgery. From a small sample 64 operated patients with contained disc herniation were analysed and classified into those who underwent percutaneous disc decompression (PDD) using coblation technology and patients who underwent CAM. All patients who presented with PDD were considered candidates for open surgery but all of them opted for the new technique. There was no contraindication. They had discogenic low back pain and/or leg pain and the procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. Follow-up data was of 1 to 12 months. Patients' gender distribution for PDD was 65% (41.6) male, 35% (22.4) female with a mean age of 43 years. The average duration of pain before nucleoplasty was of 18 months and none of them had previous lumbar surgery. At 6 to 12 months, 80% of the patients demonstrated an improvement in pain scores (75% very good, 5% good, 15% improved but not good, and 5% no effect). None of the patients was worse. Results indicate that Nucleoplasty may be an efficacious minimally invasive technique for the treatment of symptoms associated with contained herniated disc. However, randomized controlled studies are required to know with more precision the role of this procedure. CAM procedure (13 cases) is an excellent method in cases of root compression that needs liberation or in spine stenosis."

Clinical diagnostic criteria of nerve root pain, root irritation signs, and neurologic signs of root compression supplemented by myelography were shown to be much more accurate than myelography alone, both in predicting the presence or absence of nerve root involvement and in distinguishing disc prolapse from bony entrapment. Provided the clinical criteria were clearly defined, patients with three or more of the four criteria were usually found to have a disc prolapse while bony entrapment could frequently be identified with one or two criteria. It is concluded that although lumbar disc prolapse is well-recognized, in practice clinical assessment and diagnostic criteria need to be defined more clearly to match increasingly sophisticated radiology."

CD007431,0,10672297,0,Does additional discectomy and the degree of dural sac compression influence the outcome of decompressive surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis?,"The discussion regarding factors that reliably predict the long-term surgical results in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis is still going on. This retrospective study analyses the relation between the dimensions of the dural sac and patients' clinical status before and after decompressive operations performed with or without additional discectomy. The type of surgery performed in 134 patients and the dural sac dimensions measured on postmyelograpic computed tomography in 100 of these patients were related to the Prolo scores before surgery and at follow-up (mean 46 months). The degree of dural sac compression correlated significantly with the patients' postoperative Prolo score and with the difference between the pre- and postoperative scores. The dural sac diameters predicted outcome after surgery more reliably than the preoperative Prolo scores. There was no statistically significant difference in the outcome when comparing patients with and without additional discectomy. The results presented suggest that the relief of symptoms after decompressive surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis correlates with the degree of the dural sac compression and that the simultaneous presence of disc herniation necessitating additional discectomy does not influence the postoperative outcome. However, these results have to be confirmed by prospective studies."

Research protocol and report of 21 cases].,"Twenty one cases of schistosomal meningomyeloradiculopathy due to Schistosoma mansoni are reported. This result was attained after a 4- year research period based on a ""Clinical and Laboratory Investigation Protocol"" applied on 212 patients in Itabuna, a city of Southeast region of Bahia state in the Northeast of Brazil. This region is a non endemic one for schistosomiasis. The Protocol consisted in leading to investigation every patient that presented a clinical triad characterized by: lumbar pain, paresthesias in the inferior limbs, miction difficulties. Diagnostic criteria were based on clinical neurologic signs, presence of Schistosoma mansoni eggs on feces or rectum biopsy, positive immunofluorescence reaction for schistosomiasis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the inflammatory CSF characteristics, and an exhaustive research for differential diagnosis. The diagnosis has been essentially based on clinical and laboratory data, not having for any of the cases an histopathological study. The treatment was performed the earliest as possible, and corticosteroids associated to oxaminiquine were used for all cases. The patients were studied as to sex, age, profession, city of origin, initial symptoms, laboratory tests related to schistosomiasis, the onset type of neurologic clinical symptoms and several CSF aspects. Treatment beginning was related with time of disease. Clinical evolution and sequelae were analysed. Abdominal contractions were observed in 10 cases several hours before the clinical picture had been clearly presented. Clinical diagnosis is justified since it is performed under severe clinical and laboratory evidences, as well as an accurate search for differential diagnosis. The authors think that the schistosomal meningomyeloradiculopathy is a well defined nosological entity by its neurological picture, as also from the pathological point of view. Finally, the authors suggest to neurological services of the country the planning and application of similar or even more detailed Protocol in order to obtain an early diagnosis and treatment for the disease, preventing so irreversible damages and sequelae very harmful for the patients in their social life."

Of 38 patients with abnormal myelogram/CTs, 32 had abnormal SEPs, while 11 demonstrated EMG abnormalities. All 21 patients with normal myelogram/CTs had normal SEPs. SEP improved electrodiagnostic sensitivity in patients with weakness or reflex changes as well as in those with sensory deficits only. SEP was less sensitive in patients in whom spinal stenosis was the only radiographic finding. MRI generally corresponded well with the results of myelogram/CT and SEP but overestimated the significance of disk bulges in some patients. SEP is useful in the electrodiagnostic evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy, particularly when EMG is nondiagnostic."
CD007431,0,15830214,0,A prospective study of the interrelationship between subjective and objective measures of disability before and 2 months after lumbar decompression surgery for disc herniation.,"The value of range of motion (ROM) as an indicator of impairment associated with spinal problems, and in monitoring changes in response to treatment, is a controversial issue. The aim of this study was to examine the interrelationship between subjective disability (Roland-Morris scores) and objectively measured impairment (ROM), both before and in response to spinal decompression surgery, in an older group of patients with herniated lumbar disc (DH). Seventy-six individuals took part in the study: 33 patients (mean age 57 years, SD 9 years) presenting with DH and for whom decompression surgery was planned, and 43 controls (mean age 57 years, SD 7 years), with no history of back pain requiring medical treatment. In the patient group, pain intensity (leg and back; visual analog score), self-rated disability (Roland-Morris score), certain psychological attributes, and ROM of the spine (Spinal Mouse) were measured before and 2 months after decompression surgery. In addition, the patients rated the success of surgery on a 1-5 Likert scale. The pain-free control group performed only the tests of spinal mobility. Before surgery, compared with matched controls, significantly lower values were observed in the DH patients for standing lumbar lordosis (p=0.01), and for range of flexion of the lumbar spine (ROF(lumbar)) (p=0.0006), but not of the hips (ROF(hip)) (p=0.14). Roland-Morris Disability scores correlated significantly with ROF(lumbar) (r=0.61, p=0.0002), but less well with ROF(hip)(r=0.43, p=0.01). Two months after surgery, there were significant reductions in back pain and leg pain (p=0.0001) and in Roland-Morris Disability scores (p=0.019). There was also a significant decrease in the group mean values for lumbar lordosis angle (i.e., a ""flatter"" spine after surgery, p=0.002) and ROF(lumbar) (p=0.038). ROF(hip) showed a (nonsignificant) tendency to increase (p=0.08) towards normal control values. As a result of these two opposing changes, the range of total trunk flexion showed no significant changes from pre-surgery to 2 months post-surgery (p=0.60). On an individual basis, there was a highly significant relationship between the change in self-rated disability scores and the change in ROF(lumbar), pre-surgery- to 2 months post-surgery (r= -0.82; p<0.0001). Changes in ROF(hip) showed no such relationship (r= -0.30, p=0.10). The patients in the ""poor"" outcome group (""surgery didn't help""; 9%) had a significantly greater reduction in ROF(lumbar) post-surgery compared with the ""good"" outcome group (""surgery helped""; 91%) (p=0.04). In stepwise linear regression, the change in ROF(lumbar) was the only variable accounting for the change in self-rated disability pre-surgery to post-surgery (variables not included: pain intensity, psychological factors). The pivotal role of lumbar mobility in explaining disability emphasizes the importance of measuring lumbar and hip ranges of motion separately, as opposed to ""global trunk motion."" In the patient group examined, the determination of lumbar spinal mobility provides a valid, objective measure of function, that shows differences from normal matched controls, that correlates well with self-rated disability, and the changes in which correlate extremely well with subjective changes in disability following surgery."

Thirty consecutive patients referred to physical therapy by their primary care physician for LBP who met all eligibility criteria including a positive slump test but who had a negative straight-leg-raise test (SLR) agreed to participate in the study. All patients completed several self-report measures including a body diagram, numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Patients were randomized to receive lumbar spine mobilization and exercise (n = 14) or lumbar spine mobilization, exercise, and slump stretching (n = 16). All patients were treated in physical therapy twice weekly for 3 weeks for a total of 6 visits. Upon discharge, outcome measures were re-assessed. Independent t-tests were used to assess differences between groups at baseline and discharge. No baseline differences existed between the groups (P > .05). At discharge, patients who received slump stretching demonstrated significantly greater improvements in disability (9.7 points on the ODI, P < .001), pain (.93 points on the NPRS, P = .001), and centralization of symptoms (P < .01) than patients who did not. The results suggest that slump stretching is beneficial for improving short-term disability, pain, and centralization of symptoms. Future studies should examine whether these benefits are maintained at a longer-term follow-up."

CD007431,0,6648707,0,Variations in the pattern of muscle innervation by the L5 and S1 nerve roots.,"Evidence based on electrical studies is presented for the standard and anomalous patterns of innervation of muscles supplied by the fifth lumbar and first sacral nerve roots. Although considerable controversy still exists, previous work in this field suggests that the L5 nerve root supplies tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum brevis, and the lateral head of gastrocnemius, while the S1 nerve root innervates the medial head of gastrocnemius, soleus, and abductor hallucis. In order to confirm the reliability of this data, the L5 and S1 nerve roots of 50 patients were electrically stimulated during surgery, and distally evoked responses in the relevant muscles were recorded, using surface electrodes. The results confirm the essential reliability of the proposed table of segmental innervation and also demonstrate that most muscles have a dual innervation, with one nerve root being dominant. However, eight patients (16%) exhibited a marked departure from the normal pattern. For example, it is clear that on occasion the extensor digitorum brevis and the lateral head of gastrocnemius can be supplied by S1 and the soleus and medial head of gastrocnemius can be supplied by L5. In a prospective study of 100 patients presenting with clinical evidence of lumbosacral nerve root entrapment, the level of nerve root involvement, as predicted by electromyography, was compared with the operative findings. Correct preoperative nerve root localization was achieved in 84%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A long-term follow-up study.,"Twenty-two consecutive unselected patients who had severe spondylolisthesis were treated by a first-stage posterior decompression (Gill procedure) and a posterolateral arthrodesis, followed by halo-skeletal traction, and then by a second-stage anterior interbody arthrodesis, followed by immobilization in a cast. Nineteen patients had complete clinical and radiographic evaluation, with an average follow-up of five years (range, two to seven and one-half years). The slip angle averaged 71 degrees preoperatively, was corrected to an average of 31 degrees by reduction, and averaged 28 degrees at follow-up. The average preoperative percentage of slippage (98 per cent) did not change substantially. A pseudarthrosis developed in four patients, all of whom had a reoperation. The neurological deficits that had been present in ten patients preoperatively had completely resolved in all but one at follow-up. One patient had a cauda equina syndrome and two patients had a neuropathy of the root of the fifth lumbar nerve as a result of the reduction; complete recovery occurred in two patients and partial recovery, in one. Alignment in the sagittal plane was restored in seventeen patients, and the back pain and radicular symptoms were relieved in all patients except one who had had those symptoms preoperatively."
CD007431,0,11599754,0,Transpedicular decancellation osteotomy in the treatment of peridural fibrosis.,"From 1992 to 1997 a series of 12 multiply operated (averaging 2.5 previous operations) patients with recurrent peridural fibrosis and postlaminectomy kyphosis underwent surgery at our clinic. The surgery was designed to restore the physiological lordosis and relax tethered cord and epidural veins by transpedicular decancellation osteotomy at a vertebra other than the vertebra with peridural fibrosis. This paper presents the long-term functional outcome of these 12 patients. Clinical assessments were conducted pre-operatively and at 3-month intervals postoperatively and included X-ray assessment and evaluation of the patients' functional status by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and of pain by visual analogue scale (pain VAS). All symptoms and the pain due to peridural fibrosis disappeared in the early postoperative period. Patients had tower disability and pain scores at their early and long-term follow-ups (follow-up period 24-74 months, mean 36.3 months). For patients with failed medical therapy for peridural fibrosis accompanied by lumbar kyphosis or hypolordosis, transpedicular decancellation osteotomy should be the surgical treatment of choice."

Myelography and computed tomographic myelography (CTM) of the cervical spine documented major spondylotic compressive lesions mainly between the C3 and C5 levels. The cortical responses of dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (DSEPs) revealed progressively prolonged peak latencies and progressively decreased amplitudes of early components from C6 to C8 dermatomal stimulation. In comparison, the C5 and L2 DSEPs were affected to a lesser extent. This finding suggests that high cervical cord compression may produce dysfunction of the dorsal column caudal to the direct compressive sites. In other words, the funiculus cuneatus of C6-8 cord is most affected in high cervical myelopathy. Moreover, the funiculus cuneatus is within the border zone susceptible to an overall reduction in blood flow. We conclude therefore, that ischemia secondary to cord compression is the pathophysiology resulting in this unique syndrome of ""numb, clumsy hands"" and tactile agnosia."

CD007431,0,11964642,0,Effect of lumbar disc herniation on clinical symptoms in lateral recess syndrome.,"This study investigated the differences in the clinical features of lateral recess syndrome attributable to the bony entrapment of the spinal nerve root under the superior articular facet, and lateral recess syndrome and associated lumbar disc herniation. Ninety patients with pure bony entrapment (47 men, 43 women) ranging in age from 19 to 83 years (mean age, 63 years) and 59 patients with lumbar disc herniation in the lateral recess (43 men, 16 women) 19 to 85 years of age (mean age, 49 years) were included in this study. All patients had L5 root radiculopathies and were treated surgically. Although the early symptoms of patients with lateral recess syndrome often were in the lower extremities, many of the patients with associated lumbar disc herniation had a transition initially experiencing low back pain and subsequently having lower extremity symptoms. Flexion and extension of the lumbar spine exacerbated symptoms, particularly in patients with lumbar disc herniation. The results of the current study show that the clinical presentation of lateral recess syndrome differs depending on the cause of the compression in the lateral recess."
CD007431,0,15699793,0,Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF): technical feasibility and initial results.,"Forty-nine patients underwent minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) from October 2001 to August 2002 (minimum 18-month follow-up). The diagnosis was degenerative disc disease with herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) in 26, spondylolisthesis in 22, and a Chance-type seatbelt fracture in 1. The majority of cases (n = 45) were at L4-L5 or L5-S1. A paramedian, muscle-sparing approach was performed through a tubular retractor docked unilaterally on the facet joint. A total facetectomy was then conducted, exposing the disc space. Discectomy and endplate preparation were completed through the tube using customized surgical instruments. Structural support was achieved with allograft bone or interbody cages. Bone grafting was done with local autologous or allograft bone, augmented with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 in some cases. Bilateral percutaneous pedicle screw-rod placement was accomplished with the Sextant system. There were no conversions to open surgery. Operative time averaged 240 minutes. Estimated blood loss averaged 140 mL. Mean length of hospital stay was 1.9 days. All patients presenting with preoperative radiculopathy (n = 45) had resolution of symptoms postoperatively. Complications included two instances of screw malposition requiring screw repositioning and two cases of new radiculopathy postoperatively (one from graft dislodgement, the other from contralateral neuroforaminal stenosis). Narcotic use was discontinued 2-4 weeks postoperatively. Improvements in average Visual Analogue Pain Scale and Oswestry Disability Index (preoperative to last follow-up) scores were 7.2-2.1 and 46-14, respectively. At last follow-up, all patients had solid fusions by radiographic criteria. Results of this study indicate that minimally invasive TLIF is feasible and offers several potential advantages over traditional open techniques."

The growing economic and personal costs of this challenging entity have led to the development of a wide array of new treatments, ranging from pharmacotherapy with neuropathic medications to open surgical treatment. Among the therapeutic options to emerge are a plethora of minimally invasive treatments aimed at removing nuclear material and lowering intradiscal pressure through devices inserted percutaneously into intervertebral discs. Yet there is a compelling lack of clinical evidence to support the use of these procedures.

CD007431,0,16835739,0,"Relationship between alterations of the lumbar spine, visualized with magnetic resonance imaging, and occupational variables.","Although the effect of physical workload on the occurrence of low back pain (LBP) has been extensively investigated, few quantitative studies have examined the morphological changes visualized via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in relation to occupational variables. The relationship between the severity of some abnormalities such as lumbar spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis and physical or psychosocial occupational risk factors has not been investigated previously. In this cross-sectional study patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) long-standing (minimum 1-year) LBP radiating down the leg (or not); (2) age more than 40 years; (3) willingness to undergo an MRI of the lumbar spine; and (4) ability to speak Italian. Primary objective of the study was to investigate the association between occupational exposure and morphological MRI findings, while controlling for the individual risk factors for LBP. Secondarily, we looked at the influence of this exposure and the degenerative changes in the lumbar spine on clinical symptoms and the related disability. Lumbar MRI scans from 120 symptomatic patients were supplemented by the results of structured interviews, which provided personal, medical, and occupational histories. All occupational factors were arranged on scales of increasing exposure, whereas pain and disability were assessed using ad hoc validated questionnaires. Evidence of intervertebral disc narrowing or herniation and the occurrence and severity of spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis was obtained from the MRI scans and a summative degenerative score was then calculated. We detected a direct association between increasing age and the global amount of degenerative change, the severity of intervertebral disc height loss, the number of narrowed discs, stenosis, the number of stenotic levels, and spondylolisthesis. Physical occupational exposure was not associated with the presence of lumbar disc degeneration and narrowing per se, but a higher degree of such an exposure was directly associated with a higher degree of degeneration (P=0.017). Spondylolistesis and stenosis were positively related to heavy workload (P=0.014) and the manual handling of materials (P=0.023), respectively. Psychosocial occupational discomfort was directly associated to stenosis (P=0.041) and number of stenotic levels (P=0.019). A heavier job workload was the only occupational factor positively related to the degree of disability at the multivariate analysis (P=0.002). Total amount of degeneration in the lumbar spine directly influenced pain duration (P=0.011) and degree of disability (P=0.050). These results suggest that caution should be exercised when symptomatic subjects with evidence of degenerative changes on MRI scans engage in strenuous physical labor."
CD007431,0,15614653,0,[Lumbar discogenic pain].,"Lumbar discogenic pain in the sense of an internal disc disruption (IDD) represents a nociceptive pain syndrome with the source of pain in the innervated outer third of the annulus. Such discs anatomically appear with almost normal contours. Neither clinical nor technical assessments have any diagnostic value, with the exception of MRI which has been shown, if present in symptomatic patients, to have a positive predictive value of up to 89 % to indicate a strong correlation to a painful grade 3 or 4 fissure. However, only the stimulation of a disc (controlled provocation discography) with a subsequent CT scan is of exclusive diagnostic value. As an underlying pathomechanism, a compression fracture of the superior subchondral endplate like a fatigue fracture is discussed. In this way, a deterioration of the homogeneous intradiscal stress distribution could occur with consecutive damage to the internal disc environment and the expression of a radial fissure. The clinical picture of discogenic pain is non-specific. It does not correlate with degenerative changes. It does not differ from any other back pain. Thus, it has to be differentiated from zygapophysial joint pain as well as from sacroiliac joint pain and muscular-ligamentous pain sources. In a single study of American workers, the prevalence of IDD was 39 %, rendering it one of the most important causes for patients with a specified source of back pain."

The morphometry of the canal and dural sac at the intervertebral disc level was defined by reviewing normal levels of CT scans. Levels with herniated discs were then analyzed for comparison of treatment results between successful and unsuccessful procedures. The concept of spinal reserve capacity was evaluated. Significant differences between canal morphometric parameters of patients with treatment success or failure were then identified. The concept of spinal reserve capacity may be applicable in spinal stenosis, but we were unable to delineate any predictive value in the evaluation of patients with herniated lumbar discs undergoing chemonucleolysis."
CD007431,0,8990543,0,Do pain expectancies cause pain in chronic low back patients? A clinical investigation.,"The present study investigated whether pain expectancies cause pain in chronic low back patients. Back patients (N = 29) were requested to perform four exercise bouts (two with each leg), each consisting of flexing and extending the knee three times at maximal force (Cybex 350 System). During each exercise bout the baseline pain, the expected pain and experienced pain were recorded. Patients also reported their experienced fear of further injury to the back. Furthermore, the peak force of both knee flexors and extensors was assessed. Although patients did expect a back pain increase during the first exercise bout with each leg, no evidence was found for the thesis that pain expectancies generate increases in subjective pain experiences. Instead, the reported pain expectancy was readily corrected during the next exercise bout, whereas the experienced pain remained unchanged. Furthermore, a high pain expectancy co-occurred with (1) a marginally significant fear of (re)injury, and (2) a significant lower peak torque of the knee flexors. These results are consistent with conditioning models which state that pain expectations are associated with a fear response and an urge to avoid the pain."
CD007431,0,1852159,0,A technique for needle localization in paraspinal muscles with cadaveric confirmation.,"Invasive electromyography (EMG) of the paraspinal muscles is useful in clinical and research settings. No technique for localization of the needle in specific fascicles has been validated. Recent descriptions of the segmented innervation of the multifidus imply that such a technique would add greatly to the EMG determination of root level of a radiculopathy. We have developed a technique for localization which relies on palpation of bony structures and needle insertion at certain angles and depths. The technique was evaluated by injecting latex dye in 199 locations in 13 cadavers. Dissection demonstrated that the technique was accurate in 91 of 112 injections into specific fascicles of the multifidus (originating from different spinous processes), 39 of 43 injections into the longissimus, and 35 of 44 injections into the iliocostalis. Certain types of errors would not have occurred with the aid of EMG in vivo. When these are added to the correct injections, accuracy improves 97%, 93%, and 82%, respectively. The technique described here should be useful for kinesiological studies, biopsies and injections, as well as for the EMG confirmation of a radiculopathy."

In these situations, surgical correction is often necessary. We conducted a retrospective review of eight ambulatory patients with high sacral myelomeningocele and external tibial torsion who underwent 10 distal tibia and fibular internal derotation osteotomies. All patients had an increased valgus knee stress preoperatively. Pre- and postoperative three-dimensional gait analysis was used to evaluate coronal plane knee moments and dynamic sagittal plane knee motion. Postoperatively, a significant improvement in the abnormal internal knee varus moment (p < 0.005) as well as a significant increase in the stance phase knee extension (p < 0.01) was seen. Three patients had resolution of preoperative knee pain. We believe that patients with increased knee stress secondary to excessive external tibial torsion will benefit from a tibial derotation osteotomy that could delay or prevent the onset of late degenerative changes about the knee."

This study hypothesizes that there is good correlation between the diagnostic impression of an unblinded electromyographer, using clinical and electromyographic information, and an independent electromyographer, who uses the needle examination only to assess for lumbar radiculopathy. This is a prospective, single-blinded, observational pilot study. The needle examination was electronically recorded, reproduced, and shown to a second examiner, blinded to all clinical data. Diagnostic impressions from both examiners were recorded and evaluated for agreement. Six recorded cases were reviewed by 66 blinded examiners. Overall diagnostic agreement was 46.9% (60.5% faculty level, 28.5% resident level). Logistic regression shows a strong association between training level and agreement on diagnostic impression (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.22; P = 0.019). This study shows that there is fair interrater reliability between faculty-level examiners and poor reliability among resident-level examiners when the needle examination is used to evaluate patients with lumbar radiculopathy."

CD007431,0,8057762,0,"Quantitative MR imaging of lumbar intervertebral disc and vertebral bodies: methodology, reproducibility, and preliminary results.","Since relaxation times are influenced by the hydration of the tissue and the chemical environment of the water molecules, T1 and T2 measurements (quantitative MRI) could be used as an indicator for the water content and the biochemical composition of lumbar intervertebral discs. The discriminating power of quantitative MRI for tissue characterization in individuals (for clinical diagnosis) and in cohorts (e.g. for investigations on disc physiology or composition) relies on the reproducibility in relation to the expected tissue differences. We therefore investigated the reproducibility in vitro (lumbar spine phantom) and in vivo (10 volunteers). To estimate the differences between normal and pathologic tissues in vivo, 100 normal and 20 herniated intervertebral discs were examined by quantitative MRI in a first application of our method. The relaxation times were calculated from a set of 20 images obtained with five single-slice/multi-echo sequences at different TR values on a commercial whole-body system (1.5 T). We have found a satisfactory reproducibility in vitro (T1: 1.9%; T2: 6.2%), while the reproducibility was less satisfactory in vivo (T1: 16.4%; T2: 13.4%). Calculated from theses values, differences in relaxation times of various tissues must exceed 486 ms for T1 and 24 ms for T2 (tolerance limits) to allow discrimination with a 95% confidence in individuals. We observed statistically significant (p = 0.001) mean differences between normal (n = 100) and herniated (n = 20) intervertebral discs (delta T1: 196 ms; delta T2: 15 ms). Although statistical significant in cohorts, a discrimination of normal and herniated intervertebral discs is limited by quantitative MRI in individuals, since the differences are smaller than the tolerance limits necessary for a reliable clinical diagnosis. However, our results indicate that variations in the disc hydration and/or composition can be noninvasively detected by quantitative MRI in studies of cohorts with sufficient accuracy."

It was the aim of this study to assess the clinical relevance of inflammatory cells in herniated lumbar disc specimens. The presence of inflammatory cells was examined immunohistochemically in routinely processed resection specimens of the lumbar disc. The histological results were compared to prospectively obtained clinical data. Disc specimens of 179 patients who underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation were studied immunohistologically. Preoperatively each patient received a visual analogue scale for classification of the pain level and general clinical data were recorded prospectively. Varying amounts of inflammatory cells could be demonstrated in the resected disc tissue.

CD007431,0,8378668,0,Peripheral nerve injuries in athletes. Treatment and prevention.,"Peripheral nerve lesions are uncommon but serious injuries which may delay or preclude an athlete's safe return to sports. Early, accurate anatomical diagnosis is essential. Nerve lesions may be due to acute injury (e.g. from a direct blow) or chronic injury secondary to repetitive microtrauma (entrapment). Accurate diagnosis is based upon physical examination and a knowledge of the relative anatomy. Palpation, neurological testing and provocative manoeuvres are mainstays of physical diagnosis. Diagnostic suspicion can be confirmed by electrophysiological testing, including electromyography and nerve conduction studies. Proper equipment, technique and conditioning are the keys to prevention. Rest, anti-inflammatories, physical therapy and appropriate splinting are the mainstays of treatment. In the shoulder, spinal accessory nerve injury is caused by a blow to the neck and results in trapezius paralysis with sparing of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Scapular winging results from paralysis of the serratus anterior because of long thoracic nerve palsy. A lesion of the suprascapular nerve may mimic a rotator cuff tear with pain a weakness of the rotator cuff. Axillary nerve injury often follows anterior shoulder dislocation. In the elbow region, musculocutaneous nerve palsy is seen in weightlifters with weakness of the elbow flexors and dysesthesias of the lateral forearm. Pronator syndrome is a median nerve lesion occurring in the proximal forearm which is diagnosed by several provocative manoeuvres. Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment is common among tennis players and occurs at the Arcade of Froshe--it results in weakness of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal extensors. Ulnar neuritis at the elbow is common amongst baseball pitchers. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common neuropathy seen in sport and is caused by median nerve compression in the carpal tunnel. Paralysis of the ulnar nerve at the wrist is seen among bicyclists resulting in weakness of grip and numbness of the ulnar 1.5 digits. Thigh injuries include lateral femoral cutaneous nerve palsy resulting in loss of sensation over the anterior thigh without power deficit. Femoral nerve injury occurs secondary to an iliopsoas haematoma from high energy sports. A lesion of the sciatic nerve may indicate a concomitant dislocated hip. Common peroneal nerve injury may be due to a direct blow or a traction injury and results in a foot drop and numbness of the dorsum of the foot. Deep and superficial peroneal nerve palsies could be secondary to an exertional compartment syndrome. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a compressive lesion of the posterior tibial nerve caused by repetitive dorsiflexion of the ankle--it is common among runners and mountain climbers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Each examination was interpreted separately by a neuroradiologist who had no access to the patients' clinical findings or the results of any radiologic studies. On comparison of 290 interspace levels, there was agreement in definite abnormalities in 70%. Most discrepancies were due to suspicious findings and inconclusive studies of both kinds. In particular, there was poor correlation between the two examinations in the diagnosis of a slightly bulging disk. The major discrepancy rate was less than 5% overall and less than 1% among patients without prior surgery. On the basis of these findings, a diagnostic algorithm is suggested that would facilitate the workup of a similar group of patients."

The age range of the 189 patients was seventeen to eighty-four years. The six major diagnostic categories studied were herniation of a lumbar disc, a previous operation on the lumbar spine, spinal stenosis, cauda equina syndrome, acquired spondylolisthesis, and congenital spondylolisthesis. The diagnostic codes assigned by the physician were compared with the codes that had been assigned during the ordinary course of events by personnel in the medical records department of each of the eight hospitals. The accuracy of coding was also compared among the eight hospitals, and it was found to vary depending on the diagnosis. Although there were both false-negative and false-positive codes at each institution, most errors were related to the low sensitivity of coding for previous spinal operations: only seventeen (28 per cent) of sixty-one such diagnoses were coded correctly. Other errors in coding were less frequent, but their implications for conclusions drawn from the information in administrative databases depend on the frequency of a diagnosis and its importance in an analysis. This study demonstrated that the accuracy of a diagnosis of a spinal disorder recorded in an administrative database varies according to the specific condition being evaluated. It is necessary to document the relative accuracy of specific ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes in order to improve the ability to validate the conclusions derived from investigations based on administrative databases."
CD007431,0,17225000,0,Modifications of the sympathetic skin response in workers chronically exposed to lead.,"The long-term effects of low-level lead intoxication are not known. The sympathetic skin response (SSR) was evaluated in a group of 60 former workers of a primary lead smelter, located in Santo Amaro, BA, Brazil. The individuals participating in the study were submitted to a clinical-epidemiological evaluation including questions related to potential risk factors for intoxication, complaints related to peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement, neurological clinical examination, and also to electromyography and nerve conduction studies and SSR evaluation. The sample consisted of 57 men and 3 women aged 34 to 69 years (mean +/- SD: 46.8 +/- 6.9). The neurophysiologic evaluation showed the presence of lumbosacral radiculopathy in one of the individuals (1.7%), axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy in 2 (3.3%), and carpal tunnel syndrome in 6 (10%). SSR was abnormal or absent in 12 cases, representing 20% of the sample. More than half of the subjects (53.3%) reported a history of acute abdominal pain requiring hospitalization during the period of work at the plant. A history of acute palsy of radial and peroneal nerves was reported by about 16.7 and 8.3% of the individuals, respectively. Mean SSR amplitude did not differ significantly between patients presenting or not the various characteristics in the current neurological situation, except for diaphoresis. The results suggest that chronic lead intoxication induces PNS damage, particularly affecting unmyelinated small fibers. Further systematic study is needed to more precisely define the role of lead in inducing PNS injury."

CD007431,0,2770988,0,The symptomatic incompetent cervical intervertebral disc.,"A series of 16 patients with symptoms such as pain in the neck, occiput, shoulder and arm; numbness in the hands; and/or difficulty in walking, is described. Neurological examination of the upper extremities disclosed signs of nerve roots dysfunction in 5 patients and long tract signs in 12, whereas examination of the lower extremities disclosed long tract signs in every patient. Positive contrast cervical myelograms suggested mild posterior bulging of one or two intervertebral discs in every patient, but computed tomographic myelograms invariably demonstrated a coincident narrow cervical spinal canal, thus revealing the true compressive potential of the aforementioned mild disc protrusion on the spinal cord. All patients underwent anterior cervical microdiscectomy of the offending disc or discs, which were found to be degenerated. No case of frank rupture of the anulus was identified. Response to treatment was graded as excellent in 12 patients, who had complete relief of symptoms, and good in 4 patients, who had mild residual complaints. This study suggests that incompetence (bulging) of a cervical intervertebral disc may acquire important clinical significance in the presence of a narrow spinal canal by compressing the spinal cord and the corresponding nerve roots. Surgical removal of the diseased disc may result in restoration of neurological function."

CD007431,0,1664544,0,Predictability of adequacy of spinal root decompression using evoked potentials.,"Dermatomal evoked potentials are being used to obtain accurate information concerning the viability of specific nerve root pathways and the quality and extent of nerve root decompression. Twelve patients with quantifiable weakness were selected and tested before, during, and after surgery. Nine patients showed dramatic intraoperative electrical improvement, including decreased latencies and/or increased amplitudes; all had postoperative relief of pain and motor return. Three patients showed variable intraoperative electrical responses with complete pain relief but no motor improvement. No patients had false-negative findings. Intraoperative monitoring of dermatomal evoked potentials appears to be of value in predicting the quality of spinal decompression. Similar monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials alone cannot provide the specificity for individual root levels that is available by monitoring individual dermatomes."
CD007431,0,7089690,0,The clinical spectrum of lumbar spine disease in achondroplasia.,"A retrospective study was done to determine the entire clinical spectrum of lumbar spine disease in 47 adult patients, averaging 27.6 years of age, with achondroplasia. Five distinct clinical categories were defined. Twenty-eight percent of the patients were asymptomatic; 28% had only mechanical or degenerative lumbar pain; 6% had symptoms of a disc herniation; 21% had spinal claudication; and 17% had spinal claudication and objective neurologic deficits. Over 50% of the achondroplastic patients in this series had minor or no lumbar-spine-related symptoms through the third decade. The number of symptomatic patients did not increase in the older age groups. Ninety-one percent of symptomatic patients were 30 years of age or younger at the onset of symptoms. The presence of a thoracolumbar kyphosis, regardless of its magnitude, an L1 interpediculate distance less than 20 mm, and L5 interpediculate distance less than 16 mm, and a large structural lumbar lordosis were found more frequently in patients with disabling symptoms."

Lumbosacral spinal fibrosis is seen particularly often after extensive and repeated operations. Radicular pain responds better to stimulation than back pain. A favourable long-term effect on radicular pain has been observed in 67% of patients treated by epidural implantation, the corresponding average follow-up period being 4 1/2 years. 40% of these patients needed less analgesics after the operation, while 25% of them showed an improved fitness for work. Among about 5,000 patients who underwent surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation, an indication for spinal cord stimulation was found in 1.5%. By comparison, the frequency of the ""last resort"" procedure of microsurgical cordotomy was 0.3%. We no longer use other ablative methods like extirpation of spinal ganglia."

CD007431,0,1406196,0,Etiology of low back pain in elite boardsailors.,"Seven elite boardsailors reporting nonradiating low back pain without leg pain during sailing volunteered for detailed examination. In these subjects, the onset of pain was limited to those occasions when sailing positions were held for a significant period of time, e.g., close hauled sailing or in light winds. No pain was described at any other time. The determination of possible antecedent factors was based on the results of clinical assessment, radiological evaluation, and computer tomography (CT) scanning. Apart from limited flexibility in some subjects, the clinical examination of these athletes was normal; CT changes in this group were limited to disc protrusions and bulges, and pars interarticularis defects. Despite the small number of subjects in the present report, it appears that the frequency of these problems exceeds that in the normal population. It may be possible to suggest that risk factors such as body position during prolonged sailing, particularly under light wind conditions without a harness, and limited flexibility may be associated with the radiological findings and may be implicated in the presence of low back pain, although further investigations appears warranted."
CD007431,0,8347973,0,Trumpet laminectomy for lumbar degenerative spinal stenosis.,"The clinical and radiologic results of trumpet laminectomy, an improved method of extensive laminectomy preserving the facet joints (n = 35), and extensive laminectomy (n = 15) were compared in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. The results were evaluated using a rating system and serial radiographs and a follow-up of 2 to 10 1/2 years (mean, 5.2 years). The overall results corroborate the advantage of the trumpet laminectomy, demonstrating a lower incidence and lower grade of postoperative lumbar scoliosis as well as less symptom recurrence in the trumpet laminectomy group than in the extensive laminectomy group. Risk factors for postoperative spinal instability and scoliosis appear to be facet joint destruction and elderly females with a high level of physical activity."

For comparison, early and late cerebral potentials in response to electrical nerve stimuli (SEPn) were recorded in the same session. In 8 patients with localized impairment of pain and temperature sensitivity we found complete absence of SEPc after stimulation of the affected area; in another patient with similar sensory deficits, the SEPc was grossly attenuated and delayed. In 1 patient with intact pain sensitivity but absent temperature sensitivity, a well defined SEPc could be recorded. Both early cortical SEPn and late SEPn in response to conventional nerve stimuli were normal in all patients and thus did not differentiate control and affected areas. These data indicate that alteration of SEPc correlates with altered pain sensitivity in patients with a circumscribed spinal lesion. SEPc may thus be used as a neurophysiological test in the assessment of hypalgesic dermatomes."

Ten-year follow-up of 268 patients after chemonucleolysis.,"The effect of chymopapain injection was investigated in myelographically confirmed intervertebral disc herniation in 268 patients after ten years. Mean age is 39.4 years, 178 males and 90 females. Sixty-two patients had compensation or litigation and 12 had prior lumbar spine surgery. Discography was performed in 223 patients, resulting in 134 one-level injections, 124 two-level injections, and ten three-level injections. Forty percent of the patients experienced postoperative muscle spasm for several days. No complications were seen in 241 patients (92%) who were available for follow-up examination at ten years; 86% had less leg pain, 82% were employed at a capacity equal to or greater than before injection, 9% were at a less strenuous job, 1% were disabled, and 8% had retired. In 22 patients treated surgically within one year of chemonucleolysis, disc-related pathology was present in 14 cases and spondylosis or spinal stenosis was present in seven cases. One had a negative exploration and continued to be disabled. Eight patients came to surgical intervention after one year because of persisting symptoms: four patients had disc protrusion, three had laminectomy and spinal fusion, and one had a decompressive laminectomy secondary to spondylotic change. Chemonucleolysis did not prejudice the outcome of subsequent surgical treatment with good results following this intervention. One tumor, a neurofibroma, was found in this study. Chemonucleolysis with chymopapain was a safe and effective treatment of radicular complaints caused by well-documented intervertebral disc herniation."
CD007431,0,15446531,0,The association of lumbar spondylolisthesis with collagen IX tryptophan alleles.,"Two collagen type IX gene polymorphisms that introduce a tryptophan residue into the protein's triple-helical domain have been linked to an increased risk of lumbar disc disease. To determine whether a particular subset of symptomatic lumbar disease is specifically associated with these polymorphisms, we performed a prospective case-control study of 107 patients who underwent surgery of the lumbar spine. Patients were assigned to one of five clinical categories (fracture, disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis) based on history, imaging results, and findings during surgery. Of the 11 tryptophan-positive patients, eight had spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis and three had disc herniation. The presence of the tryptophan allele was significantly associated with African-American or Asian designation for race (odds ratio 4.61, 95% CI 0.63 to 25.35) and with the diagnosis of spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis (odds ratio 6.81, 95% CI 1.47 to 41.95). Our findings indicate that tryptophan polymorphisms predispose carriers to the development of symptomatic spinal stenosis associated with spondylolisthesis which requires surgery."

On the basis of characteristic clinical symptoms of radicular and pseudoradicular syndrome patients were divided into two groups: 45 patients with dominant pseudoradicular syndrome and 35 persons with dominant radicular syndrome. All patients underwent clinical examination before and after traction treatment. Clinical evaluation included: the pain syndrome, postural disturbances and nerve root dysfunctions. The effects of the traction treatment were significantly worse in patients with the pseudoradicular syndrome. These results suggest the necessity of differential therapeutic approach in lumbar disc disease patients depending on the predominance of the pathomechanism of disease."

CD007431,0,7833204,0,Lumbar disc degeneration and segmental instability: a comparison of magnetic resonance images and plain radiographs of patients with low back pain.,"We analyzed disc space height, angular displacement, tilting movement, and horizontal displacement in 109 patients with low back pain and/or sciatica, on plain radiographs of the lumbar spine. These parameters were compared with the grade of disc degeneration as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging with the aim of studying lumbar segmental instability. Disc space height decreased in proportion to the grade of disc degeneration. Angular displacement was significantly less with severe disc degeneration, accompanied by a tendency to stabilization of the motion segment. Tilting movement and horizontal displacement did not correlate with the grade of disc degeneration. Lumbar segmental instability was recognized at all levels even in individuals who appeared to be normal or to have mild disc degeneration. The incidence of lumbar segmental instability at the L3-4 level was significantly higher in patients with normal discs or mild disc degeneration. At the L4-5 and L5-S levels it did not differ between different grades of disc degeneration."
CD007431,0,6319062,0,Intra-articular radiation synovectomy.,"Fifty-three knees in 44 patients with severe, chronic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated by the instillation of an intra-articular radionuclide (dysprosium-165; 165Dy) coupled with a large, relatively inert carrier (ferric hydroxide macroaggregate). The extremely low leakage rates found in earlier animal experiments were confirmed in the human, with a mean leakage rate of 0.3% of the injected dose. This leakage corresponds to a total body dose of 0.4 rad and a liver dose of 2.5 rad, equivalent to a lumbosacral series of diagnostic radiographs. Eighty percent of the treated knees showed improvement, which was maintained as long as one year after treatment. There was a direct correlation between the preoperative radiographic stage and the response to treatment, with patients in Stages I and II more likely to have a good or excellent response at one year. There was also good correlation between clinical improvement and improvement in technetium-99m (99mTc)-pertechnetate flow scintigraphy. Chemical synovectomy by the instillation of appropriate radionuclides can be recommended as an effective means of reducing inflammation, effusion, and pain in patients with RA. The duration of favorable results cannot be predicted, but the results to date suggest that longevity should be comparable with that of surgical synovectomy. Like surgical synovectomy, radiation synovectomy is most effective in the early stages of the disease process, before there is extensive destruction of cartilage and bone."
CD007431,0,12610691,0,Clonus after human spinal cord injury cannot be attributed solely to recurrent muscle-tendon stretch.,"Clonus, presented behaviorally as rhythmic distal joint oscillation, is a common pathology that occurs secondary to spinal cord injury (SCI) and other neurological disabilities. There are two predominant theories as to the underlying mechanism of clonus. The prevailing one is that clonus results from recurrent activation of stretch reflexes. An alternative hypothesis is that clonus results from the action of a central oscillator. We present evidence that the mechanism underlying clonus in individuals with SCI is not solely related to muscle stretch. We studied electromyography (EMG) of the soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral hamstrings, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris from subjects with clinically complete and clinically incomplete SCI during stretch-induced ankle clonus, stepping, and non-weight-bearing standing. Clonic EMG of the SOL, MG, and TA occurred synchronously and were not consistently related to muscle-tendon stretch in any of the conditions studied. Further, EMG activity during stretch-induced ankle clonus, stepping, and non-weight-bearing standing had similar burst frequency, burst duration, silent period duration, and coactivation among muscles, indicating that clonic EMG patterns occurred over a wide range of kinematic and kinetic conditions, and thus proprioceptive inputs. These results suggest that the repetitive clonic bursts could not be attributable solely to immediate afferent feedback such as recurrent muscle stretch. However, these results support the theory that the interaction of central mechanisms and peripheral events may be responsible for clonus."

All patients were candidates for surgery. All underwent myelography, and most had computed tomography (CT) scans. The clinical status of patients was assessed at 6 weeks and at 6 months, and evaluation was made from responses of the patients to a questionnaire at 1 year. Evaluation at 1 year demonstrated that the results of chemonucleolysis were successful for 181 patients (84.6%). Of the 172 patients who received no worker's compensation, the procedure was successful for 90.7%. Of 42 with worker's compensation, the success rate was 59.5%. After chemonucleolysis, most patients showed neurologic improvement. Data comparing neurologic symptoms and signs between compensation and noncompensation patients are presented. This is the first report of objective data after chemonucleolysis in these two groups. A discussion on the morbidity and mortality of chemonucleolysis is included, along with a comparison of cost between chemonucleolysis and laminectomy."

Early clinical results with TDR have shown a significant reduction in low back pain and a significant improvement in disability scores. When compared to fusion, the results with TDR tend to be superior in the short-term follow-up and initial rehabilitation is faster. The radiological assessment is an integral part of the preoperative work-up. Plain X-rays of the lumbar spine should be complemented by flexion - extension views in order to assess residual segmental mobility. Computed tomography is used to exclude osteoarthritis of the zygapophyseal joints, Baastrup's disease (kissing spines) and other sources of low back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful to exclude substantial disc protrusions; it allows for the detection of disc dehydration and bone marrow edema in the case of activated spondylochondrosis. If osteoporosis is suspected, an osteodensitometry of the lumbar spine should be performed. Postoperative plain X-rays should include antero-posterior and lateral views as well as flexion - extension views in the later postoperative course. Measurements should determine the disc space height in the lateral view, the segmental and total lumbar lordosis as well as the segmental mobility in the flexion - extension views. The ideal position of a TDR is exactly central in the ap-view and close to the dorsal border of the vertebral endplates in the lateral view.

A pilot study was done in 1971 on six patients. In this trial, 28 patients were operated on with informed consent. Twenty-three had a minimum of five years' follow-up study. There were 14 men and boys, and nine women and girls. The average follow-up period was eight years and four months (range, five to 12 years three months).

Sixteen patients were in Group 1, three in Group 2, and three in Group 3. Flexion-extension radiographs showed 14 patients with no movement between the vertebral bodies adjacent to the operated disk, five with minimal movement, and four with definite movement. At the implant-bone interface, no radiolucent zone was seen in 18 patients, and a definite radiolucent zone was seen in five. Twenty implants were intact, three implants had developed a crack, and three were deformed. There were no complications.

CD007431,0,12782871,0,Efficacy of serotonin receptor blocker for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.,"Serotonin is one of the chemical mediators associated with nerve root inflammation and sciatic symptoms in lumbar disc herniation. The efficacy of serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor blocker was examined in 44 patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. A selective 5-HT(2A) receptor blocker (sarpogrelate hydroxychloride) was administered orally at a dose of 300 mg per day for 2 weeks. Visual analog scales of low back pain, sciatic pain, and numbness were significantly improved after the administration of the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor blocker. Clinical results were good (> 50% pain relief) in 23 patients, fair (25%-50% pain relief) in five patients, and poor (< 25% of pain relief) in 16 patients. Nineteen patients eventually required surgery because of muscle weakness or cauda equina symptoms. The effect of 5-HT(2A) blocker was good in 64% of patients who had uncontained disc herniation, whereas all patients with contained disc herniation had fair or poor results. Patients with uncontained disc herniation responded more favorably to the 5-HT(2A) blocker treatment than patients with contained disc herniation. A 5-HT(2A) blocker has the potential to block the cascade of acute nerve root inflammation and to alleviate symptoms in lumbar disc herniation."

In addition, the subjects were asked about leisure time physical activities in an interview preceding the measurements. Spinal muscular atrophy was the only finding that was more common among physically inactive subjects (p = 0.005). Moreover, increased occurrence of disk degeneration (DD) was observed in the low-activity group. However, the difference was not significant. Neither Scheuermann-type changes nor DD were related to spinal mobility or trunk muscle strength. Children with disk protrusion were, on the average, taller (p = 0.044), and their lumbar flexion measured by flexicurve was decreased (p = 0.043). Our results strengthen further the evidence that MRI is a sensitive measure and that imaging findings must be interpreted carefully with respect to pain and physical impairment of the lumbar spine. Furthermore, no clear evidence of the association between physical activity and early DD could be found."

CD007431,0,16807981,0,Postoperative spinal epidural hematoma: risk factor and clinical outcome.,"We report a series of epidural hematomas which cause neurologic deterioration after spinal surgery, and have taken risk factors and prognostic factors into consideration. We retrospectively reviewed the database of 3720 cases of spine operation in a single institute over 7 years (1998 April- 2005 July). Nine patients who demonstrated neurologic deterioration after surgery and required surgical decompression were identified. Factors postulated to increase the postoperative epidural hematoma and to improve neurologic outcome were investigated. The incidence of postoperative epidural hematoma was 0.24%. Operation sites were cervical 3 cases, thoracic 2 cases, and lumbar 4 cases. Their original diagnoses were tumor 3 cases, cervical stenosis 2 cases, lumbar stenosis 3 cases and herniated lumbar disc 1 case. The symptoms of epidural hematomas were neurologic deterioration and pain. After decompression, clinical outcome revealed complete recovery in 3 cases (33.3%), incomplete recovery in 5 cases (55.6%) and no change in 1 case (11.1%). Factors increasing the risk of postoperative epidural hematoma were coagulopathy from medical illness or anticoagulation therapy (4 cases, 44.4%) and highly vascularized tumor (3 cases, 33.3%). The time interval to evacuation of complete recovery group (29.3 hours) was shorter than incomplete recovery group (66.3 hours). Patients with coagulopathy and highly vascularized tumor were more vulnerable to spinal epidural hematoma. The postoperative outcome was related to the preoperative neurological deficit and the time interval to the decompression."

Ninty-one operated patient with lumbar disc herniation with or without balloon disc were also studied. The balloon disc was observed on an average of 14% regardless of age in the healthy population with an obvious male predominance and was most commonly observed in the taller adolescents. The difference between the primary site of the endplate concavity associated with a balloon disc and with a Schmorl's node are evident (P less than 0.01). The characteristics of the balloon disc in the healthy population consist of (1) an age-independent and nonregressive nature, (2) a normal developmental variation, (3) no association with low-back pain and herniated nucleus pulposus."

Its effectiveness as a therapy has been studied at the Mestre hospital where a clinical study has been undertaken to determine the effectiveness of reflexology in the reduction of pain. A group of 40 persons suffering almost exclusively from a lumbar-sacral disc hernia received three treatments of reflexology massage for a week. The results found that 25 persons (62.5%) reported a reduction in pain, (rating at 0.75 on a scale of 0-4).

CD007431,0,8434328,0,Cerebrospinal fluid proteins as indicators of nerve root compression in patients with sciatica caused by disc herniation.,"Patients with sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation were studied to identify biochemical changes in the cerebrospinal fluid related to myelographic findings and clinical observations. One hundred forty-three patients were evaluated by myelography with regard to involvement of the dural sac and the nerve root. A medial group (20 patients) with evidence of dural sac impingement was compared to a lateral group (63 patients) and an extreme lateral group (9 patients) whose condition primarily affected the nerve root. The remaining 51 patients comprised a mixed group with involvement of both the dural sac and the nerve root. The mean cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio, cerebrospinal fluid/serum immunoglobulin G ratio, and cerebrospinal fluid total proteins showed a significantly increasing trend from the medial through the lateral to the extreme lateral groups. Patients with lateral lumbar disc herniations more often showed neurologic deficits. These results indicate that the elevated cerebrospinal fluid total protein found in the patients with sciatica is due to leaking of plasma proteins primarily from the nerve root into the cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebrospinal fluid proteins may be used as diagnostic parameters of nerve root compression, especially when surgery is a consideration or in patients in whom sciatica is unlikely."

Most juxta-facet cysts are observed at the L4/5 level, which generally has the most motion within the lumbar spine. In this retrospective study 31 juxta-facet cysts in 28 patients were detected within 2898 lumbar MRI studies over a 2-year period (frequency 1%). 24 patients complained of back and lower extremity pain, the other 4 patients had unilateral back pain. In 7 cases radicular symptoms were observed, in 6 patients a neurogenic claudication. In 78% of the patients juxta-facet cysts were responsible for clinical symptoms. MRI is the diagnostic imaging technique of choice due to a high sensitivity. The juxta-facet cysts were located extradural, laterally to the thecal sack and adjacent to a degenerated facet joint. In all but one cases the cysts showed a signal intensity equivalent to cerebrospinal fluid. T2-weighted pulse sequences in sagittal orientation were very useful in delineating the hypointense cyst wall. In 1 patient with acute radicular pain MRI demonstrated a subacute hemorrhage within a juxta-facet cyst. Calcifications and gas-filled cysts can be missed with MRI, but will be demonstrated by computed tomography. 45% of the juxta-facet cysts showed an enhancement of the cyst wall after injection of Gd-DTPA. Spontaneous reduction or resolution of the cyst may occur during rest. Injection of corticosteroids into the corresponding facet joint may reduce the inflammatory process and resolve the symptoms in up to 70%. Surgical resection of the cyst is indicated in case of intractable pain and significant neurologic deficit and generally produces good relief from radicular symptoms."

However, there is a group of patients with less favorable result. The predictive factors affecting the result are not fully understood. In this paper a new radiological classification for lumbar disc herniations has been used in order to study the predictive value of the type and location of the herniation for the postoperative result. 142 patients operated with standard lumbar discectomy were included in the study. The preoperative CT-scans were used to classify the disc herniations in the transverse, sagittal and longitudinal directions and the size of the herniations were calculated. At a mean of 7.7 years postoperatively a patient administrated questionnaire was used to compare the clinical results to the radiological findings. A significantly smaller size of the lumbar disc herniation was found with increasing age, which could reflect the increased degeneration of the disc. Patients with a wide transverse distribution of the herniation seem to have a less favorable postoperative outcome in terms of higher rate of repeat surgery (p = 0.056). No other correlations were found."

The magnetic resonance findings].,"In order to evaluate the to potential hazards related to athletic functional overload on the intervertebral disk we studied with MRI the incidence of intervertebral disk abnormalities in a group of 45 volunteers who had been playing professional volleyball for 3-7 years. As a control group we examined with MRI 30 professional swimmers as well. Among the volley-ball players the incidence of intervertebral disk alterations was 44.4%; they were represented by 8 cases of disk degeneration, 11 cases of bulging and 9 disk herniations (in 8 patients the simultaneous presence of more than one lesion was observed). In the control group the incidence of such lesions was 20%. The obtained results were correlated with the clinical findings and the age of the athletes. Among the 26 athletes with back pain only 13 had positive findings at MRI, while among the 19 asymptomatic athletes 7 showed lesions detectable with MRI. As for age, we observed that the younger athletes (17-19 years) had positive MRI findings in 38.5% of cases, while the players in the age group ranging from 23 to 26 years, had positive MRI findings in 56.2% of cases. The analysis of the different types of training of the volley-ball players and the control group, showed that 19 volley-ball players who followed appropriate training procedures had positive MRI findings in 21.1% of cases (in the control group the percentage was 20%). Among the 26 athletes who were trained with exercises that caused significant functional overload, 16 had intervertebral disk lesions at MRI (61.5%). Moreover, our data showed that the correlation of the incidence of disk lesions with the type of training (and relative varying degree of overload) is definitely more important than the one existing with the age of volley-ball players and the overall period of their athletic activity. MRI proved to be a useful technique for the early assessment of the intervertebral disk damage caused by an incorrect training in young athletes, even when asymptomatic."

CD007431,0,2409171,0,The contribution of neurogenic inflammation in experimental arthritis.,"The release of the peptide neurotransmitter substance P from the peripheral terminals of nociceptive afferent neurons and the release of catecholamines from postganglionic sympathetic efferent neurons produce physiologic changes associated with acute inflammation. The contribution of these neurogenic mechanisms to inflammatory diseases has not been determined. Activation of central neural circuits elicits similar physiologic changes, and lesions of the peripheral and central nervous system are associated with alteration in activity of inflammatory diseases. We have evaluated the contribution of neurogenic inflammation to the severity of joint injury in experimentally induced arthritis in the rat. The finding of a greater density of substance P-containing nociceptive afferents in a joint that develops more severe arthritis (ankle) suggests a role of substance P in joint injury. Direct evidence that the proinflammatory factor released from these nociceptors is substance P is provided by the finding that the injection of substance P into a joint which normally develops less severe arthritis (knee) increases the severity of arthritis in that joint. A contribution of catecholamines to the severity of joint injury was suggested by the finding that both guanethidine-induced sympathectomy and reserpine-induced depletion of catecholamines attenuated the severity of joint injury. Finally, a contribution of central neural circuits to inflammatory processes was studied in a model in which activation of nociceptive afferents elicited swelling and tenderness at a remote site. This reflex neurogenic inflammation was inhibited by intracerebroventricular injections of morphine, which also attenuated the severity of arthritis. These studies provide evidence that elements of the peripheral afferent and sympathetic efferent neurons and of descending supraspinal, opioid-mediated, circuits in the central nervous system modulate the severity of joint injury in experimental arthritis in the rat."

Sciatica and root tension signs decreased promptly after surgery and remained largely unchanged during followup, which was not the case for neurologic signs. Similarly, pain relief was not associated with neurologic signs but was associated with lumbar mobility and root tension signs. Patients without neurologic symptoms before surgery did not report more sciatica after 2 years than did those with positive neurologic signs before surgery. Positive crossed Lasegue sign and restricted lumbar mobility before surgery predicted better chances for postoperative pain relief. Patients with a ruptured anulus fibrosus at surgery had less sciatica and back pain after surgery than did patients with an intact anulus fibrosus."

Average age at surgery was 67.3 years, and average follow-up was 23 months. Preoperatively, the predominant symptom was severe unilateral leg pain, and 13 patients were nonambulatory because of leg pain. Operative treatment included wide laminectomy in 8, hemilaminectomy in 3, fenestration in 10, and osteoplastic laminectomy in 2 patients. Four (17%) patients had disk herniation at the L2-L3 or L3-L4 level. Sequestered herniation with or without migration was observed in 15 (65%) patients. Of 14 sequestered disk fragments examined histologically, 8 (57%) specimens contained cartilaginous or bony end plate with anulus fibrosus or nucleus pulposus. Postoperatively, results were rated as excellent in 11 patients and good in 12; no patient was rated as fair or poor. Severe leg pain affecting activities of daily life is a predominant symptom of disk herniation in the elderly. For patients in whom conservative treatment has failed, operative treatment should be considered. In lumbar disk herniation in the elderly, the incidence of cephalad and lateral herniation is higher than in younger patients. In addition, sequestered and migrated herniations including end plate are frequent."
CD007431,0,2212906,0,Clinical aspects of lumbar intervertebral disc disease.,"The diagnosis and management of lumbar disc disease has undergone significant changes in recent years.

CD007431,0,15024661,0,EMG recovery and ratings after back extensor fatigue in patients with lumbar disc herniation and healthy subjects.,"This prospective study aimed to examine whether patients with lumbar disc herniation, before and after surgery, showed impaired recovery from fatigue measured with EMG and subjective ratings as compared to healthy subjects. Forty-three patients due for, and after, lumbar disc surgery and 60 healthy subjects were fatigued using a modified Sørensen's test. Recovery of back extensor muscles was assessed using electromyography and the Borg scale ratings at 1, 2, 3, and 5 minutes of recovery, and was further analyzed using an exponential time-dependence model. The patients completed four questionnaires: the Oswestry, the Roland-Morris, a self-efficacy scale and the SF-36. The exponential time-dependence model was successful for 14 of the 43 patients and 57 of the 60 healthy subjects. The patients for whom the model succeeded had significantly better scores on the questionnaires than those for whom the model was unsuccessful. Specific items related to standing and lifting were identified. The patients' recovery was impaired compared to the healthy subjects, as determined by use of the exponential time-dependence model. The combination of fatigue and recovery measures was reflected in the questionnaire scores and is therefore important for evaluating patients with lumbar disc herniation."
CD007431,0,7105575,0,Lumbar spinal nerve lateral entrapment.,"In past years, lumbar nerve lateral entrapment seldom has been diagnosed. A presumptive preoperative diagnosis has been made based on clinical findings and radiographs demonstrating disc resorption. The Computed Tomography scan has made it possible to diagnose the lesion with certainty and accuracy. Treatment for patients who do not respond to conservative measures is a bilateral minimal partial laminectomy. The lateral canal is enlarged by removing the medial and anterior parts of the superior articular process. Adhesion formation is prevented by placing a free fat graft posterior to the dura. Instability is diagnosed by examining stress radiographs and, when present, is treated by a one level posterolateral fusion. After operation, marked improvement was obtained in 62% of patients and slight improvement in another 21%; 17% were unimproved. Sixty-two per cent of patients reported no pain or mild pain. Sixty-six per cent resumed their previous occupation."

CD007431,0,3374776,0,Surgical management of extreme lateral lumbar disc herniations: review of 138 cases.,"Extreme lateral disc herniations in the authors' series account for 10% of all lumbar herniations; 80% occurred at the L3, L4 and L4, L5 interspaces. The authors review the clinical findings in 138 patients and point to the characteristic features of the clinical syndrome. They compare the accuracy of various diagnostic studies and conclude that computed tomography is highly accurate and should be used before other diagnostic studies. Discography is still helpful as a confirmatory study in some cases, whereas myelography is particularly useful in disclosing other associated lesions. Analysis of the operative series revealed a high percentage of extruded fragments (60%) and a significant number of double herniations on the same side and at the same level (15%). These two findings may respectively preclude chemonucleolysis and microsurgery from the surgical management of extreme lateral herniations. Double herniations explain some discrepancies in the clinical picture and are emphasized as a potential source of error in diagnosis. The surgical technique allows exploration for herniations within the intervertebral canal as well as for extraforaminal herniations without sacrifice of the facet. Operative results are presented."

The diagnosis of Buerger's disease was based on following criteria: smoking history, onset before the age of 50 years, infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease, either upper limb involvement or phlebitis migrans, absence of atherosclerotic risk factors other than smoking. In the last 10 years (1986-1996), we identified 29 patients who met these rigid criteria. There were 24 men and 5 women, aged 32.4 years at the moment of the disease first clinical symptom. The cumulative tobacco use averaged 16 pack-years for each patient. The initial symptom was limited gangrene of a toe (n = 9) or a finger (n = 2), foot claudication (n = 6), calf claudication (n = 3), rest pain (n = 3), migratory superficial phlebitis (n = 4), and Raynaud phenomenon (n = 2). Angiography and/or Doppler ultrasound revealed digital, pedal and calf artery involvement in all patients, with proximal extension in ten patients (femoropopliteal in ten, including three cases with external iliac artery involvement). Seven patients had also evidence of upper limb involvement. Histologic proof was available in only seven patients. Only nine patients completely stopped smoking. Treatment was exclusively medical in five cases. Twenty-four underwent sympathectomy (20 at lumbar, and four at thoracic level), with good immediate result in 16. In 11 patients a vascular reconstruction was done (eight femorocrural and three iliofemoral bypasses), with a patency rate of only 36% at two years. Amputation was required in 16 patients (a mean of 2.7 amputations per patient) at one or more levels: toe (n = 19), forefoot (n = 5), below knee (n = 8), above knee (n = 2), finger (n = 3). Two patients ended up with bilateral leg amputation. Overall, 23% (7/30) of the patients required major leg amputation during the course of the disease. Disease progression was moderately related to continued tobacco use. Buerger's disease still entails considerable risk of major amputation. Complete abstinence from tobacco use is crucial to expect stabilization of the process. However, in advanced stages of the disease and despite cessation of smoking recurrent episodes of ischaemia or tissue loss are not excluded."

CD007431,0,17356146,0,Interbody fusion with allograft and rhBMP-2 leads to consistent fusion but early subsidence.,"We carried out a prospective study to determine whether the addition of a recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) to a machined allograft spacer would improve the rate of intervertebral body fusion in the spine. We studied 77 patients who were to undergo an interbody fusion with allograft and instrumentation. The first 36 patients received allograft with adjuvant rhBMP-2 (allograft/rhBMP-2 group), and the next 41, allograft and demineralised bone matrix (allograft/demineralised bone matrix group). Each patient was assessed clinically and radiologically both pre-operatively and at each follow-up visit using standard methods. Follow-up continued for two years. Every patient in the allograft/rhBMP-2 group had fused by six months. However, early graft lucency and significant (> 10%) subsidence were seen radiologically in 27 of 55 levels in this group. The mean graft height subsidence was 27% (13% to 42%) for anterior lumbar interbody fusion, 24% (13% to 40%) for transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, and 53% (40% to 58%) for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Those who had undergone fusion using allograft and demineralised bone matrix lost only a mean of 4.6% (0% to 15%) of their graft height. Although a high rate of fusion (100%) was achieved with rhBMP-2, significant subsidence occurred in more than half of the levels (23 of 37) in the lumbar spine and 33% (6 of 18) in the cervical spine. A 98% fusion rate (62 of 63 levels) was achieved without rhBMP-2 and without the associated graft subsidence. Consequently, we no longer use rhBMP-2 with allograft in our practice if the allograft has to provide significant structural support."

CD007431,0,9312686,0,[Juxta-facet cysts as space-occupying intraspinal processes].,"Ganglionic and synovial cysts (juxta-facet cysts) causing nerve root compression are very rare. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best means of diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the cysts, though spontaneous remissions do occur. CT-guided aspiration of the cysts and corticosteroid injection can lead the symptoms to disappear, but only for a short time. In a retrospective study covering a period of 16.5 years, we discovered 24 juxta-facet cysts (10 ganglionic and 14 synovial cysts) with clinical symptoms in a total of 19,107 lumbar and thoracic operations performed to relieve nerve root compression: 16 cysts were located at the level L4-5,3 at the level L5-S1,2 at L3-4, and 1 each at the levels L2-3, L1-2, and T10-1. Seven patients complained of radicular pain, and the other 17 patients also had neurological deficits. Fourteen cysts were resected, and in 10 cases the lumbar disc was removed simultaneously. The average follow-up in 23 of the 24 patients was 26.6 months. Most (74%) of the patients became free of pain. Pareses disappeared in 89% and sensory deficits in 73% of cases."
CD007431,0,9144678,0,Side effects and complications of automated percutaneous lumbar nucleotomy.,"We reviewed the records of 243 patients treated at 271 disc levels to determine the incidence of side effects and complications of percutaneous nucleotomy. In our early experience there were 7 technical failures (2.5% of all attempts), of which 6 were at the 5th disc level. The success rate dropped from 67% at 3 months to 60% 1 year after treatment due to recurrences in 16 patients (6.6%). Extruded or sequestered fragments were found in 6 patients (2.4%), and may have been caused by nucleotomy. However, only one was accompanied by aggravation of symptoms. Discitis was seen in 2 patients (0.8%), both treated at two separate disc levels. About half the patients experienced increased low back pain, mean duration 9 days, after treatment, and 3 (1.2%), of whom 2 also had nonorganic disorders, needed admission to hospital because of severe pain. Mild spasm and a sensation of instability were noted by 9.6% and 25% of the patients respectively. Injury to nerves, bowels, vessels or ureters or a dural leak never occurred. The study confirms earlier reports that the rate of serious complications is low."
CD007431,0,18163905,0,Health-related quality of life of patients following selected types of lumbar spinal surgery: a pilot study.,"Over 500,000 spinal surgeries are performed annually in the United States. Although pain relief and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are expectations following lumbar spinal surgery, there is limited research regarding this experience from the individual's perspective. In addition, no studies have examined the HRQOL of persons who have had this surgery using a comprehensive approach. The intent of this study was to address this deficiency by an assessment of both the individual and environmental factors that impact perceived HRQOL using the Wilson and Cleary Model for Health-Related Quality of Life in persons who have undergone lumbar spinal surgery."
CD007431,0,11132978,0,Disc degeneration in patients with lumbar spondylolysis.,"The grade of intervertebral disc degeneration in 73 symptomatic patients with lumbar spondylolysis was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging to assess the prevalence of disc degeneration. The results were compared with those of age- and sex-matched asymptomatic control populations and with patients with clinical back pain symptoms but without spondylolysis. The relationship between disc degeneration and age of patients, the duration and severity of clinical symptoms, and the grade of vertebral slip was evaluated. A five-point grading scale based on T2 signal intensity recommended by Gibson et al. was used to evaluate the degree of disc degeneration. The grade of disc degeneration below the spondylolytic defect in the patients was highly significantly related to the age of patients (p < 0.01) and was more severe than in the controls (p < 0.01), but there was no difference of disc degeneration above the defect between the patients and the controls (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the grade of disc degeneration below the spondylolytic defect in the patients was highly significantly correlated with the duration of clinical symptoms (p < 0.01), although it was not associated with the severity of clinical symptoms or the grade of vertebral slip (p > 0.05). The results suggest that the degree of disc degeneration at the spondylolytic level is a more important determinant for choice of the fusion procedure than the age of the patients or the grade of vertebral slip, and that preoperative magnetic resonance examination is of great importance to evaluation of disc degeneration."
CD007431,0,11132979,0,Abnormalities of the soleus H-reflex in lumbar spondylolisthesis: a possible early sign of bilateral S1 root dysfunction.,"Using routine electrodiagnostic procedures, the authors searched for physiologic evidence of nerve root compromise in patients with chronic mechanical perturbation to the lumbar spine. They examined 37 patients with spondylolisthesis and various degrees of degenerative changes in the lumbar canal. Clinical and neurophysiologic findings were compared with data obtained from 36 healthy persons. The soleus H-reflex appeared to be a sensitive indicator of sensory fiber compromise at the S1 root level, because changes correlated well with the focal sensory signs and preceded clinical and electromyographic signs of motor root involvement. When these occurred, the clinical findings were consistent with a more severe nerve root deficit and with radiographic evidence of neural compression. The greater sensitivity of the soleus H-reflex may be related to the pathophysiologic events that occur at the lesion site."
CD007431,0,9506196,0,"Clinical assessment of a novel antiadhesion barrier gel: prospective, randomized, multicenter, clinical trial of ADCON-L to inhibit postoperative peridural fibrosis and related symptoms after lumbar discectomy.","A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of ADCON-L Anti-Adhesion Barrier Gel (a medical device by Gliatech Inc, Cleveland, OH) was conducted in 298 patients undergoing first-time lumbar discectomy to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ADCON-L in preventing postoperative peridural fibrosis and in improving patient clinical outcome. After lumbar discectomy, patients were randomized to receive either ADCON-L gel or nothing (control group) at the conclusion of the surgical procedure. Six months after surgery, peridural scar was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, and postoperative pain and straight-leg-raise angle were assessed. No statistically significant differences between the ADCON-L and control groups were observed in terms of adverse events or wound healing characteristics. ADCON-L gel was shown to be safe and to significantly inhibit peridural scar compared with the control group (P = 0.002). That peridural scarring was reduced with ADCON-L gel was further supported by direct visualization of scar tissue at reoperation in both groups. ADCON-L-treated patients had better clinical outcomes than did control patients. The incidence of activity-related pain was significantly reduced (P = 0.013), straight-leg-raise examination scores were significantly improved (P = 0.024 on the operative side and P = 0.015 on the nonoperative side), and ADCON-L reduced low back pain when it was most severe (P = 0.047) and at the end of the day (P = 0.044)."
CD007431,0,135669,0,Variations in size of the bony lumbar canal in patients with prolapse of lumbar intervertebral discs.,"Prolapse of the lumbar intervertebral disc is one of the commonly accepted causes of low back pain. Most patients respond well to conservative treatment, but some may not respond at all. Though the reason for this variation is not clearly understood, it is felt that a developmentally narrow spinal canal might have some relation to the persistence of backache and sciatica. The canal was therefore measured at each of the lumbar vertebral level by a method described by Jones and Thomson (1969) in 100 consecutive patients operated upon for prolapsed lumbar intervertebral discs, in 100 normal patients for comparison. This method does not give direct measurements of the bony spinal canal but provides a ratio of the size of the canal to the adjacent vertebral body. We found a trend towards the presence of a narrower than normal lumbar canal in patients with prolapsed lumbar intervertebral discs. It is concluded that in patients with prolapsed lumbar intervertebral discs necessitating operation, the canal tends to be narrower than normal, and such narrowing enhances the effect of any disc protrusion leading to severe symptoms of backache and sciatica."
CD007431,0,12384741,0,The dynamic neutralization system for the spine: a multi-center study of a novel non-fusion system.,"Various forms of lumbar instability require a surgical stabilization. As an alternative to fusion, a mobile, dynamic stabilization restricting segmental motion would be advantageous in various indications, allowing greater physiological function and reducing the inherent disadvantages of rigid instrumentation and fusion. The dynamic neutralization system for the spine (Dynesys) is a pedicle screw system for mobile stabilization, consisting of titanium alloy screws connected by an elastic synthetic compound, controlling motion in any plane (non-fusion system). This prospective, multi-center study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Dynesys in the treatment of lumbar instability conditions, evaluating pre- and post-operative pain, function, and radiological data on a consecutive series of 83 patients. Indications consisted of unstable segmental conditions, mainly combined with spinal stenosis (60.2%) and with degenerative discopathy (24.1%), in some cases with disc herniation (8.4%), and with revision surgery (6.0%). Thirty-nine patients additionally had degenerative spondylolisthesis, and 30 patients had undergone previous lumbar surgery. In 56 patients instrumentation was combined with direct decompression. The mean age at operation was 58.2 (range 26.8-85.3) years; the mean follow-up time was 38.1 months (range 11.2-79.1 months). There were nine complications unrelated to the implant, and one due to a screw malplacement. Four of them required an early surgical reintervention. Additional lumbar surgery in the follow-up period included: implant removal and conversion into spinal fusion with rigid instrumentation for persisting pain in three cases, laminectomy of an index segment in one case and screw removal due to loosening in one case. In seven cases, radiological signs of screw loosening were observed. In seven cases, adjacent segment degeneration necessitated further surgery. Mean pain and function scores improved significantly from baseline to follow-up, as follows: back pain scale from 7.4 to 3.1, leg pain scale from 6.9 to 2.4, and Oswestry Disability Index from 55.4% to 22.9%. These study results compare well with those obtained by conventional procedures; in addition to which, mobile stabilization is less invasive than fusion. Long-term screw fixation is dependent on correct screw dimension and proper screw positioning. The natural course of polysegmental disease in some cases necessitates further surgery as the disease progresses. Dynamic neutralization proved to be a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of unstable lumbar conditions."

CD007431,0,8578893,0,[Lumbar epidural lipomatosis].,"Spinal epidural lipomatosis is a pathological accommodation of fat tissue in the spinal canal. It seems to be a disease entity, which, though rare, has recently been diagnosed more frequently and can be accompanied by neurological deficits. The thoracic spinal canal is the preferred localization. Eighteen cases of symptomatic lumbar epidural lipomatosis have been described in the literature. We are reporting on our experience with another 8 patients. Three of these patients presented with the typical signs of spinal nerve irritation. In these cases epidural lipomatosis was associated with a small disk herniation without direct contact to the spinal nerve. Another 5 patients showed the clinical picture of a spinal claudication. In all 5 patients, there was a concentric compression of the thecal sac by epidural fat. In one patient, the cause of the lipomatosis was assumed to be long-term steroid therapy following kidney transplantation. Four patients suffered from extreme obesity. No cause for lipomatosis could be found in 3 patients. A microdiskektomy was performed in the 3 patients with the associated disk herniation; the remaining patients were treated conservatively. In 6/8 patients (3x surgery/3x diet), an ""excellent"" or ""good"" clinical result could be achieved after 1 year. Two patients had a ""satisfactory"" result. Lumbar epidural lipomatosis can be treated conservatively in cases with only mild neurological dysfunctions and known cause (e.g. obesity, steroid therapy). The surgical removal of associated disk herniation proved to be sufficient in cases described in this paper."

The radiological diagnosis according to the original x-ray report was correlated with the surgical findings at reoperation. Myelography reports describe morphological changes but often contain no definite diagnosis. CT reports usually contain detailed tissue diagnosis, but correlation with surgical findings is generally poor. Review of the original x-ray films leads to the following conclusions: At present, myelography is always indicated, except in suspected extreme lateral disc herniation. CT should be reserved for particular clinical or myelographic problems."

In 3 cases free gas was found in the epidural space, and one patient presented an intraspinal gas-filled ""bleb"". Gas collection in intervertebral disk spaces and facet joints was found in a total of 60 patients. The CT findings and surgical results were compared to determine whether gas collection contributes to clinical symptoms. In most cases the presence of gas was not clinically important, but in one patient it presented as a spinal mass, causing pain and radiculopathy."

The relation of nerve root enhancement to dysfunction also remains controversial. To investigate the clinical significance of contrast enhancement we looked at the symptoms and signs and gadolinium DPTA-enhanced images of 71 consecutive surgical candidates in a standardised fashion. Annular rupture and disc enhancement were found to be closely related, and correlated with sensory loss and paresis, respectively. Nerve root enhancement was found to be related to neurological deficits in general and sensory impairment in particular."
CD007431,0,18084782,0,Predictive factors for long-term outcome of anterior cervical decompression and fusion: a multivariate data analysis.,"We conducted a prospective randomized study to investigate predictive factors for short- and long-term outcome of anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) as measured by current pain intensity on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and by disability using the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Current understanding about how preoperative and short-term outcome data predict long-term outcome is sparse, and there are few studies involving analysis of short-term follow-up using multivariate approaches with quantification of the relative importance of each variable studied. A total of 95 patients were randomly allocated for ACDF with the cervical intervertebral fusion cage or the Cloward procedure. The mean follow-up time was 19 months (range 12-24) for short-term follow-up and 76 months (range 56-94 months) for long-term. Background factors, radiologically detected findings, physiological measurements, treatment type, pain, and disability were used as potential predictors. Multivariate statistical analysis by projection to latent structures was used to investigate predictors of importance for short- and long-term outcome of ACDF. A ""preoperative"" low disability and pain intensity, non-smoking status, male sex, good hand strength, and an active range of motion (AROM) in the neck were significant predictors for good short- and long-term outcomes. The short-term outcome data were better at predicting long-term outcome than were baseline data. Radiologically detected findings and surgical technique used were mainly insignificant as predictors. We suggest that the inclusion criteria for ACDF should be based on a bio-psycho-social model including NDI. NDI may also be regarded as an important outcome measurement in evaluation of ACDF."

CD007431,0,15731680,0,Donor-site morbidity of the pedicled rectus femoris muscle flap.,"The rectus femoris muscle flap is well known for its reliable anatomy, the ease with which it can be harvested, and its great versatility. As a pedicled or free flap, it is used to cover soft-tissue defects and to recreate motor function. Although the muscle is very reliable, it is not well respected because of its assumed donor-site morbidity, such as weakened knee extension force and decreased range of motion of the knee. To date, these clinical assumptions have only rarely been quantified in terms of objective scores, concerning force deficit and functional or aesthetic outcome. From 1995 to 2002, the authors treated 24 patients with pedicled rectus femoris muscle flaps. Fourteen patients were followed up. Follow-up time ranged from 3 to 56 months postoperatively. The results were evaluated by a standard questionnaire in which pain in relation to walking distance, subjective feeling of weakness, sensibility disorders, everyday function, and aesthetic aspects were assessed. Range of motion in the hip and the knee was measured. For objective verification of a decrease of maximal voluntary contraction force of the remaining quadriceps muscle and for detecting differences in true muscular capacity and voluntary activation, 10 patients with unilateral rectus femoris flaps were tested using the twitch interpolation technique. The authors' patients assessed the remaining function and the aesthetic result of the thigh as at least satisfactory. Two patients complained about pain and weakness in the thigh. Eight patients reported hypesthesia in the lateral suprapatellar region. The maximal voluntary contraction and true muscular capacity values were reduced by 21.8 percent and 18 percent, respectively, when compared with the healthy leg. The range of motion in the knee and hip was not influenced by muscle harvesting. The twitch interpolation technique revealed a mild voluntary activation deficit, probably caused by inhibitory regulation in the spinal cord. In conclusion, donor-site morbidity of the rectus femoris muscle flap is evident but well compensated. There is no decrease in active range of motion in the knee and hip. Patient satisfaction with the functional and aesthetic outcome was high."

Normal data and their range are given for 54 subjects (108 legs). The latency of the peak of the first positive wave (P40) can be predicted from the subject's height from the regression formulae: P40 latency in msec = height in metres X 23.7 + 8.6 for the L5 dermatome. P40 latency in msec = height in metres X 24.5 + 8.7 for the S1 dermatome. P40 latency in msec = height in metres X 15.0 + 14.6 for the posterior tibial nerve. The standard deviations are 2.90 for L5; 2.95 for S1 and 1.60 for the posterior tibial nerve. Age and sex of the subjects had no significant effect. The data will have value when dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials are used to investigate radiculopathies.

Pudendal nerve stimulation was used to monitor 154 patients. Eleven patients (7.14%) had responses that were either difficult or impossible to interpret in that they were not consistently replicable. In one case (0.65%), responses were lost during surgery, and there were no subsequent neurologic sequelae (false-positive response). No patients had postoperative deficit to the sacral roots or to the global cord. Although it is possible to obtain definitive dermatomal responses down to S1, the use of pudendal nerve stimulation was found to provide additional means of monitoring lower sacral roots. Since the pudendal nerve is intimately associated with bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction, easily obtainable routine monitoring of this nerve can provide significant safety that the conventional somatosensory and dermatomal responses give to higher spinal levels."
CD007431,0,9513866,0,Centralization of low back pain and perceived functional outcome.,"McKenzie's methods for evaluating and treating low back pain are used often but studied little. When using the McKenzie system, it is important to observe signs of symptom movement to a central location (centralization). This study investigated the relationships between centralization of low back pain and/or radiculopathy and the subjects' rating of functional outcome. Thirty-six subjects with low back pain volunteered to participate and were evaluated and treated by six researchers. Subjects were tested initially and again 14 days after initiation of treatment using the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and the Performance Assessment and Capacity Testing Spinal Function Sort (SFS). Symptoms were monitored for the occurrence of ""complete centralization."" Of the 36 subjects, 25 showed complete centralization within 14 days. The SFS score changes were significantly higher for subjects who completely centralized (p = 0.015). The results supported the hypothesis that subjects who centralize will have improved functional outcome and, thus, quality of life. However, shorter time to occurrence of complete centralization does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome."

We found significant correlations between pain score and functional limitations, iliopsoas length, and back extensor endurance. We also detected significant differences in functional limitations, iliopsoas length, back extensor strength, and back extensor endurance between those with and without LBP. We saw significant differences in back extensor strength and back extensor endurance between those with transtibial and transfemoral amputations. Differences exist in physical measures of individuals with LLA with and without LBP. Clinicians should consider these impairments in individuals with amputation who experience LBP. Because of the participants' characteristics, these findings may be applicable to veterans with LLA."

Percutaneous minimally invasive neurolysis according to the Racz technique is increasingly applied and discussed controversially. So far there is no prospective randomized controlled study for evaluation of a possible treatment effect. In a prospective pilot study, 25 patients with monosegmental radiculopathy of the lumbar spine were treated with minimally invasive percutaneous epidural neurolysis according to Racz's technique.

The average age of the patients was 51+/-16 years, the average duration of the symptoms was 28 months. Twelve weeks after the procedure patients had significant clinical improvement. The Oswestry score increased from 64+/-17 to 22+/-12 points. Subjective pain sensation according to the McNab score showed improvement too. None of the patients had worsening of the situation compared to preoperative findings. No clinically relevant complications were observed. The results are being used to design a clinical trial in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of the procedure. The described technique is still a clinically experimental procedure. However, due to a low probability of side effects and due to the good results reported so far by most authors, the Racz catheter technique may be applied in certain patients with chronic radiculopathy refractory to conservative treatment."
CD007431,0,14579016,0,[Laser-evoked potentials: diagnostic approach to the dorsal root].,"Functional diagnostics of the dorsal root are especially effective via nociceptive fibers on account of less intersegmental overlap compared to large-diameter fibers of the mechanoreceptive afferents. Laser-evoked potentials (LEP) are induced by short, painful heat stimuli. The aim of this work was to describe changes of the LEP in cases of dorsal root damage. The recorded LEP changes will be discussed with regard to their prognostic value as well as pathophysiologic aspects of dorsal root damage. Dorsal root function was tested in 21 patients suffering from clinically proven radiculopathy in one of the segments L4 to S1. Mechanosensibility and thermosensibility were clinically investigated. LEP were induced by slightly painful stimuli (80 on the affected and 80 on the contralateral unaffected dermatome). The LEP were evaluated by amplitude of the averaged electroencephalogram (EEG). In addition, a subjective pain rating was recorded after each stimulus. Investigation of dorsal root function by LEP in patients with radiculopathy yields two typical changes of the amplitude. On the one hand, there were significant reductions of amplitude, and on the other hand, a complete loss of LEP was found. LEP changes allow a graduation of patients who show no obvious differences in their clinical appearance. Which mechanisms are responsible as concerns deafferentiation and neuropathy of the dorsal root fibers are discussed. With regard to the LEP changes, a prognostic relevance in patients with dorsal root affections is likely. This question will be addressed in a prospective study soon."

At 2 or more years of followup, all patients in Group 1 who had complete operative disc removal achieved solid arthrodesis. There were no revision surgeries. However, in Group 2, there were seven patients who had a pseudarthrosis and an additional patient with early postoperative cage displacement, which resulted in eight patients in Group 2 requiring revision surgery. The differences in operative preparation of the disc space for BAK instrumentation surgery resulting in complications proved to be significant. The use of interbody titanium cages dramatically increases the biomechanical efficacy of anterior fusions. Original proponents of cages advocated removing a cylindrical channel of disc material using a drill. A prospective review of 100 patients who had complete versus partial discectomy revealed 14% of patients in Group 2 eventually had a pseudarthrosis develop."
CD007431,0,2731524,0,Effect of epidural clonidine on somatosensory evoked potentials to dermatomal stimulation.,"The effect of lumbar epidural clonidine 150 micrograms on early (less than 0.5 s) somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) to electrical stimulation of the L1 and S1 dermatomes was examined in twelve cancer patients. Epidural clonidine led to a minor but significant decrease in amplitude of two components (N1 and N3) following S1 stimulation while SEP latency was prolonged only in the P1 and P3 components (P less than 0.05). In all patients the pain score decreased, mean score at rest from 4.9 +/- 0.5 to 0.6 +/- 0.2 and during mobilization from 7.4 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased from 118 +/- 4/72 +/- 5 mmHg to 99 +/- 5/60 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than 0.01), respectively. It is concluded that epidural clonidine has a minor effect on the early SEPs to electrical dermatomal stimulation. Additionally, a pronounced effect on cancer pain was seen."
CD007431,0,16341712,0,A randomized clinical trial and subgroup analysis to compare flexion-distraction with active exercise for chronic low back pain.,"Many clinical trials on chiropractic management of low back pain have neglected to include specific forms of care. This study compared two well-defined treatment protocols. The objective was to compare the outcome of flexion-distraction (FD) procedures performed by chiropractors with an active trunk exercise protocol (ATEP) performed by physical therapists. A randomized clinical trial study design was used. Subjects, 18 years of age and older, with a primary complaint of low back pain (>3 months) were recruited. A 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for perceived pain, the Roland Morris (RM) Questionnaire for low back function, and the SF-36 for overall health status served as primary outcome measures. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either FD or ATEP. The FD intervention consisted of the application of flexion and traction applied to specific regions in the low back, with the aid of a specially designed manipulation table. The ATEP intervention included stabilizing and flexibility exercises, the use of modalities, and cardiovascular training. A total of 235 subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and signed the informed consent. Of these, 123 were randomly allocated to FD and 112 to the ATEP. Study patients perceived significantly less pain and better function after intervention, regardless of which group they were allocated to (P<0.01). Subjects randomly allocated to the flexion-distraction group had significantly greater relief from pain than those allocated to the exercise program (P=0.01). Subgroup analysis indicated that subjects categorized as chronic, with moderate to severe symptoms, improved most with the flexion-distraction protocol. Subjects categorized with recurrent pain and moderate to severe symptoms improved most with the exercise program. Patients with radiculopathy did significantly better with FD. There were no significant differences between groups on the Roland Morris and SF-36 outcome measures. Overall, flexion-distraction provided more pain relief than active exercise; however, these results varied based on stratification of patients with and without radiculopathy and with and without recurrent symptoms. The subgroup analysis provides a possible explanation for contrasting results among randomized clinical trials of chronic low back pain treatments and these results also provide guidance for future work in the treatment of chronic low back pain."

CD007431,0,15129048,0,Sexual responsiveness in women with spinal cord injuries: differential effects of anxiety-eliciting stimulation.,"Sexual dysfunction is a common problem in women after spinal cord injuries (SCIs). Recently, the use of anxiety-provoking stimulation has been explored as a means of improving sexual responses in able-bodied sexually functional and dysfunctional women. In this laboratory-based study, we assessed the sexual and autonomic responses of women with SCIs with varying degrees of preservation of sympathetic innervation to their genitals to respond to anxiety-provoking audiovisual (AV) stimulation. Subjects were 45 women with SCIs and 11 able-bodied women. For purposes of analysis, SCI subjects were grouped on the basis of the degree of preservation of sensation in the T11-L2 dermatomes. Results revealed that women with low sensory scores in these dermatomes achieved higher vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) responses to audiovisual erotic stimulation after anxiety preexposure than after neutral preexposure; however, women with SCIs and the greatest degree of preservation of sensory function in the T11-L2 dermatomes, as well as able-bodied controls, did not. Moreover, these same 2 groups of subjects had a decrease in VPA responses during baseline periods in which an anxiety-provoking video sequence was shown, but not during the neutral sequence. It is concluded that these findings are due to the proximity of sensory and autonomic neurologic elements in the spinal cord. Moreover, they demonstrate the differential effects of sympathetic stimulation on genital sexual arousal."
CD007431,0,2527432,0,[Backache--risk of disability?].,"Low back pain and lumbo-ischialgia are symptoms of degeneration of the intervertebral disc with protrusion. The possible invalidity in these patients is difficult to assess. Several factors do influence the outcome of conservative and/or neurosurgical treatment: Some patients are treated as out-patients only instead of the necessary in-patient treatment. Only in case of a paresis or disturbances of the urine bladder function, operation must be done without pretreatment. The quality of the postoperative treatment decides on the later result! The clinical assessment of a patient is not possible without examination and intensive questions about the circumstances of daily life, holiday activities, hobbies and so on. Discrepancies between the result of examination and the answers to these questions give a signal to a very critical evaluation of this patient."
CD007431,0,15082121,0,Possible association of interleukin 1 gene locus polymorphisms with low back pain.,"Based on a hypothesis that interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity is associated with low back pain (LBP), we investigated relationships between previously described functional IL-1 gene polymorphisms and LBP. The subjects were a subgroup of a Finnish study cohort. The IL-1alpha(C(889)-T), IL-1beta(C(3954)-T) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN)(G(1812)-A, G(1887)-C and T(11100)-C) polymorphisms were genotyped in 131 middle-aged men from three occupational groups (machine drivers, carpenters and office workers). A questionnaire inquired about individual and lifestyle characteristics and the occurrence of LBP, the number of days with pain and days with limitation of daily activities because of pain, and pain intensity, during the past 12 months. Lumbar disc degeneration was determined with magnetic resonance imaging. Carriers of the IL-1RNA(1812) allele had an increased risk of LBP (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0-6.0) and carriers of this allele in combination with the IL-1alphaT(889) or IL-1betaT(3954) allele had a higher risk of and more days with LBP than non-carriers. Pain intensity was associated with the simultaneous carriage of the IL-1alphaT(889) and IL-1RNA(1812) alleles (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.9). Multiple regression analyses allowing for occupation and disc degeneration showed that carriage of the IL-1RNA(1812) allele was associated with the occurrence of pain, the number of days with pain and days with limitations of daily activities. Carriage of the IL-1betaT(3954) allele was associated with the number of days with pain. The results suggest a possible contribution of the IL-1 gene locus polymorphisms to the pathogenesis of LBP. The possibility of chance findings cannot be excluded due to the small sample size."

CD007431,0,2138156,0,Diurnal changes in spinal mechanics and their clinical significance.,"Diurnal changes in the loads acting on the spine affect the water content and height of the intervertebral discs. We have reviewed the effects of these changes on spinal mechanics, and their possible clinical significance. Cadaveric lumbar spines subjected to periods of creep loading show a disc height change similar to the physiological change. As a result intervertebral discs bulge more, become stiffer in compression and more flexible in bending. Disc tissue becomes more elastic as its water content falls, and its affinity for water increases. Disc prolapse becomes more difficult. The neural arch and associated ligaments resist an increasing proportion of the compressive and bending stresses acting on the spine. Observations on living people show that these changes are not fully compensated for by modified muscle activity. We conclude that different spinal structures are more heavily loaded at different times of the day. Therefore, the time of onset of symptoms and signs, and any diurnal variation in their severity, may help us understand more about the pathophysiology of low back pain and sciatica."

CD007431,0,6497609,0,On the pathogenesis of spondylosis deformans and arthrosis uncovertebralis: comparative form-analytical radiological and statistical studies on lumbar and cervical vertebral bodies.,"To investigate the etiopathogenesis of the common clinical symptoms of the lower lumbar spine (LS) and cervical spine (CS) (lower back pain and local cervical spine syndrome), the dimensions of the third to fifth lumbar vertebral bodies (LVB) and the fifth to seventh cervical vertebral bodies (CVB) were studied quantitatively and morphometrically in frontal and sagittal planes, as a function of sex and age, in 105 human cadavers of both sexes aged between 16 and 91 years. The evaluation was done in X-ray pictures of 100-micron-thick polished bone sections with the aid of the Macro Facility of the Leitz Texture Analysis System. In each case, the maximum and minimum heights and widths and depths and the computed differences in heights, widths, and depths were determined. The results were evaluated statistically and compared within and between the two regions of the spine, using regression-correlation analyses. The heights, widths, and depths of the VB are all greater in men than in women; their behavior during ageing is, however, identical for both sexes. The heights of all the VB examined remain constant throughout life after termination of growth. The maximum widths and the width differences reveal an increase in both LVB and CVB in old age. All depth parameters reveal constancy in the case of the LVB but an increase in the case of the CVB in old age. The correlation coefficients of the maximum width of the VB within the spinal regions are very high in the LVB, but lower in the CVB. Between the two regions, in contrast, they are very low. This behavior suggests a superordinate action principle within each of the spinal regions which is based on characteristic anatomical construction and functional stressing. The static stressing of the LVB leads, laterally to disc protrusions. As a result of this, traction forces acting on the weak lateral elements of the anterior longitudinal ligament, stimulate the accretion of spondylotic osteophytes at the point of insertion of the ligament on the vertebral body. Anteriorly, in contrast, the particular strong anterior longitudinal ligament prevents such a remodelling process. Posteriorly, the longitudinal ligament is attached to the intervertebral discs, and can thus not stimulate the vertebral body to produce osteophytes. The dynamic stressing of the CVB leads laterally to friction between the VB in the region of the uncovertebral joints and to the formation of arthrotic osteophytes. Anteriorly, owing to the weak configuration of the anterior longitudinal ligament in this aspect, disc protrusion occur and, subsequently, spondylotic osteophytes accrete."

For a differential classification of TMJ diseases, we developed an electronic axiography system which facilitates a recording of lower jaw movements. It works 3-dimensionally and relates to the joints. The measuring system, which was internationally patented, is based on a linear resistive foil for the sagittal plane and an inductive gauge for the horizontal plane. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the usefulness of our electronic axiography system in obtaining a differential diagnosis of craniomandibular disorders. We examined 30 patients (60 joints) with complaints in the TMJ area (pain and TMJ sounds). Clinical examinations yielded only uncertain indications of TMJ disease. With the help of electronic axiography we could differentiate the TMJ diseases into microtrauma and macrotrauma. Both forms may show a loss of function and an audible TMJ clicking. 23 joints had a macrotrauma (disk displacement with reduction, 20 times; disk displacement without reduction, 3 times). In 8 joints, a microtrauma was found. 3 joints showed a subluxation. In 4 uncertain cases, the diagnosis was confirmed with the help of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients with a diagnosed arthrogenic disorder received adequate treatment with reposition splints. Our initial results show that 3-dimensional electronic axiography can be a good aid in further characterization of craniomandibular disorders and permits an effective therapy."
CD007431,0,6475211,0,[Computerized tomography in lumbar compression syndrome].,"Computertomography has been shown to be a reliable method for evaluation of lumbar compression syndromes. Excellent apparative equipment and differentiated examination techniques are required. As compared with myelography CT offers the advantages of a non-invasive procedure. Due to simultaneous axial visualisation of bone and soft tissue all components contributing to lumbar compression syndromes are included. This so far cannot be achieved by conventional radiographic methods. CT is superior to myelography concerning specificity and sensitivity of the diagnosis of primary and surgically treated herniated discs. It demonstrates extreme lateral dislocation of disc tissue as well as centrally located disc material at the L5/S1 level. Furthermore, compressing structures such like monosegmental osseous stenosis and stenosis of the spinal canal are well to be recognized. Tumors may be ruled out. Verification of postoperative hematoma and scar formation is of high clinical value. Myelography, however, remains being the method of choice when clinical symptoms are not to be appointed to a certain segment."

We have introduced some measurements to document asymmetrical holding of the body and limbs: the distance between the sternoclavicular joint-spina iliaca ant. sup. and the distance between the acromion and spina iliaca post. sup. We found that in the distension (blockade) of the 5th rib, constant spasms are present in m. abdominis obliquus ext., in the most lateral part of the adductors and in the most medial part of the great gluteal muscle. In 6th rib distension, spasms in the external part of the m. rectus abdominis, and in the mediolateral fascicles of thigh adductors and in the external part of m. glutaeus max. could be palpated. In 7th sternocostal distension there are spasms in the most medial parts of m. rectus abdominis, and of thigh adductors and m. glutaeus medius of the same side. After mobilization, statistically significant improvement of body asymmetry (p less than 0.01), improvement of anteflection, bending to the side, Laségue's and Patric's phenomena were found. Surgery was indispensable only in 6% of our patients suffering from severe lumbar disc hernianion (in 3 out of 50). The CT appearance of the prolapse remained unaltered even after clinical remission. There were some changes before and after mobilization in the CT picture of sternocostal joints. The importance of strengthening of the great pectoral muscles--in which preexistent relative weakness was found--is stressed. The beneficial effect of mobilization of the respective sternocostal blockade on the pain syndrome, body asymmetry and mobility is described."

CD007431,0,3883019,0,Charles Lasègue and his 'Considerations on Sciatica'.,"The eponym Lasègue sign has been applied to the increase in sciatic pain caused by flexing the extended lower extremity on the abdomen. The sign was never put into writing by Lasègue but by his pupils. He did not describe the test in the usual reference, ""Considerations on Sciatica,"" in 1864. That article has to do with his analysis of then-current theories of sciatica and his own clinical observations. Sciatica was divided into a benign and a serious form, and two examples of each were described. Emphasis was laid on the constant, fixed sciatic pain, as contrasted with the irregular, largely nocturnal, episodes of lancinating pain. Atrophy of leg muscles was not to be explained on the basis of disuse but by a disorder of the nerve, which also was responsible for the typical neuralgia, unlike that of any other part of the body except possibly neuralgia of the brachial plexus. Treatments currently available (cupping, vesicants, and injections of atropine solution) were unavailing. The steps are unknown by which Lasègue came to modify his 1864 views that any sort of flexion or extension of the lower extremity did not exacerbate the pain; in the 1881 thesis of his pupil, Forst, that straight-leg raising sign is described and illustrated and ascribed to his teacher, Professor Lasègue."

When the different factors were entered in the same order as presented clinically, history and pain analysis contained most of the predictive information available. When all factors were entered simultaneously in the computations, the following factors (in order of relative importance) predicted relief of sciatica after 2 years: rupture of the anulus (as opposed to bulging disc or negative exploration), no preoperative comorbidity, and male gender. The following factors predicted return to work at 2 years: no preoperative comorbidity, duration of sciatica less than 7 months, education or vocational training in addition to compulsory school, age younger than 41 years, male gender, and no previous nonspinal surgery. Return to work does not seem to be a valid result parameter in lumbar disc surgery. The most important physical signs were root tension tests and lumbar range of motion, whereas neurologic signs were of secondary importance. Many people have asymptomatic herniations, and today supersensitive diagnostic imaging is widely available. Thus, the importance of clinical evaluation has increased, and most of the relevant information can be obtained by listening to the patient. A simple anamnesis apparently is a good alternative to psychologic tests in surgical triage."

CD007431,0,3581573,0,Effects of joint pathology on muscle.,"The muscle wasting associated with joint damage may be highly selective; knee disorders produce quadriceps wasting but little change in the size of the hamstrings. This causes isolated quadriceps weakness, so predisposing to a position of knee flexion. Nociceptors and other receptors in and around the joint can have flexor excitatory and extensor inhibitory actions. At the knee, these receptors are likely to excite hamstrings and inhibit quadriceps. Although other actions could occur, quadriceps inhibition may be favored by a position of knee extension. Quadriceps inhibition will weaken voluntary contraction, reduce tone, and contribute to wasting of the muscle, further predisposing to a position of knee flexion. The potency of quadriceps inhibition may be considerable, even in the absence of perceived pain. A small, apparently trivial effusion (or even a clinically undetectable effusion) may cause important inhibition. In order to improve the orthopedist's ability to prevent flexion contracture of the injured or operated joint, he must look not only for ways of reducing joint pain, but also for ways of preventing activity in other joint afferents. For example, he must consider the possible effects of joint position, intraarticular pressure, suture-line tension, and afferent blockade."

Thirty-eight (72%) of these investigations were performed as a routine pre-operative procedure to identify occult spinal dysraphism in patients with childhood scoliosis; the remainder were because of the ""orthopaedic syndrome"", cervical radiculopathy, back pain and patients with clinical findings to suggest spinal dysraphism. In the 20 patients (38%) with idiopathic scoliosis, there was no case of spinal dysraphism and CT myelography provided no additional information to the myelogram. In the seven patients with spinal dysraphism the plain radiographic abnormalities identified were lumbar vertebral abnormalities (five), thoracic vertebral abnormalities (one), and sacral agenesis (one). Diastematomyelia was found in four patients, a low tethered cord and lipoma in two patients and a large lipoma in one patient. In all of these cases the myelogram indicated the intraspinal abnormalities; however, CT myelography provided more precise anatomical detail.

Augmentation of kinetic response of a knee-jerk reflex on the side of pain in this patient population is deemed to be a major cause of relief of the reflex ability of spinal centres. The above-described way in which the bioelectric excitation of muscles of the lower extremities makes itself evident in eliciting knee-jerk reflexes indicates some change(s) in reflex excitation of spinal centres in patients with lumbar osteochondrosis, which fact suggests to us an involvement of these structures into the pathological process."

The accuracy of MRI, CT, and R for the diagnosis of lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus ws compared prospectively in 120 patients, undergoing surgical exploration. MRI was the most accurate test (100%) compared with CT (95%) and R (92.5%). The false positive rate was lowest for MRI (0%), followed by CT (5%) and R (7.5%). MRI proves very favorable compared with other currently available imaging modalities for diagnosis of lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus which allows to differentiate hernia and protrusion. MRI is noninvasive, has no known side effects and no radiation exposure. It is the procedure of choice for the radio-diagnosis of lumbar disc herniations."

Discogram pattern was divided in four types: normal disc, degenerative pattern, degenerative pattern with extravasation, and annular injection. The myelograms were graded into a mild defect, a moderate defect, or a severe defect. Follow-up averaged 20 months. Conclusions of this study were Chymopapain can be considered as an alternative to lumbar laminectomy for relief of sciatica secondary to herniated disc. Statistically significant improved postinjection results were noted when patients presented with three out of four objective physical findings consisting of positive straight leg raising, reflex change, dermatomal paresthesia pattern, and/or mild motor weakness. Placement of the needle within the nucleus leads to a statistically significant improved result over placement of the needle into the annulus.

Positive straight leg raising test, paresis, altered sensibility, reduced reflexes, and type of treatment were related to the CSF protein concentrations in 180 patients with sciatica caused by verified lumbar disk herniation. Significantly higher values of the CSF/serum albumin ratio and the CSF/serum immunoglobulin G ratio were found both in patients with positive straight leg raising test results and paresis compared with patients with no clinical findings. In the patients who had undergone emergency surgery, the same ratio parameters were significantly higher when compared with those who had undergone routine surgery and those had not undergone surgery.

CD007431,0,1869942,0,Treatment of chronic pain by epidural spinal cord stimulation: a 10-year experience.,"Epidural spinal cord stimulation by means of chronically implanted electrodes was carried out on 121 patients with pain of varied benign organic etiology. In 116 patients, the pain was confined to the back and lower extremities and, of these, 56 exhibited the failed-back syndrome. Most patients were referred by a pain management service because of failure of conventional pain treatment modalities. Electrodes were implanted at varying sites, dictated by the location of pain. A total of 140 epidural implants were used: 76 unipolar, 46 Resume electrodes, 12 bipolar, and six quadripolar. Patients were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 10 years, with a mean follow-up period of 40 months. Forty-eight patients (40%) were able to control their pain by neurostimulation alone. A further 14 patients (12%), in addition to following a regular stimulation program, needed occasional analgesic supplements to achieve 50% or more relief of the prestimulation pain. Pain secondary to arachnoiditis or perineural fibrosis following multiple intervertebral disc operations, when predominantly confined to one lower extremity, seemed to respond favorably to this treatment. Uniformly good results were also obtained in lower-extremity pain secondary to multiple sclerosis. Pain due to advanced peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs was well controlled, and amputation below the knee was delayed for up to 2 years in some patients. Pain due to cauda equina injury, paraplegic pain, phantom-limb pain, pure midline back pain without radiculopathy, or pain due to primary bone or joint disease seemed to respond less well. Patients who responded to preliminary transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation generally did well with electrode implants. Notable complications included wound infection, electrode displacement or fracturing, and fibrosis at the stimulating tip of the electrode. Three patients in this series died due to unrelated causes. Epidural spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective and safe means of controlling pain on a long-term basis in selected groups of patients. The mechanism of action of stimulation-produced analgesia remains unclear; further studies to elucidate it might allow spinal cord stimulation to be exploited more effectively in disorders that are currently refractory to this treatment modality."

A preliminary report of a double-blind study.,"Sixty patients with unilateral sciatica resulting from lumbar intervertebral disc herniation were entered into a double-blind study. All patients had failed to respond to conservative management, and the diagnosis had been confirmed by metrizamide myelography. Following a randomized schedule, 30 patients had intradiscal injections of chymopapain and 30 patients had intradiscal injections of an equivalent volume of normal saline solution. Complete relief of sciatica was obtained in 63% of patients treated with chymopapain, compared with 27% of saline-injected patients. Six weeks after the injection, 73% of patients treated with chymopapain and 37% of patients treated with saline solution considered that the treatment was successful. The success rate at six months was 80% for patients treated with chymopapain and 57% for saline-injected patients. From the preliminary results of this study, chymopapain is recommended for the treatment of sciatica from intervertebral disc herniation when conservative measures have failed and before disc fragment excision is considered."

Patients were examined 4 times at 1-week intervals for their capability to do daily tasks, for their capacity for forward bending, thoraco-lumbar torsion, straight leg raising, static hip flexion and sit-ups, and for subjective assessment of pain. Side-effects were recorded on a questionnaire. Both treatments produced marked improvement in most of the parameters assessed, often within the first week and, overall, the results were similar with the two drugs. Few side-effects were reported and those that were recorded were slight and similar in incidence apart from nausea in 5 meptazinol-treated patients and smarting and burning on urination in 2 patients receiving diflunisal."

CD007431,0,3346682,1,The value of accurate clinical assessment in the surgical management of the lumbar disc protrusion.,"One hundred patients with lumbar disc protrusions were studied. Thirty six ""control"" patients were admitted in the same time period with low back pain and sciatica but with subsequently ""normal"" myelograms and no surgery. The aim of this paper was to relate history and clinical signs to the myelograms and surgical findings. Ninety nine per cent of our patients presented with sciatica (controls 94%). The most frequently found sign in patients with a disc protrusion was reduction of ipsilateral straight leg raising (98%). However, 55% of controls also showed this sign. There were three signs that, when present, particularly indicated a disc protrusion; ""crossed straight leg raising"" (pain on contralateral straight leg raising), measured calf wasting and impaired ankle reflex: the latter being especially indicative of an L5-S1 disc protrusion. There were two further important signs, weakness of dorsiflexion of the foot and scoliosis of the lumbar spine. However, such signs occurred in about half the patients and so clinical diagnosis in the remaining half depended on obtaining a good history of sciatica, and paying due regard to severity of the pain, the mobility of the patient, the ability and desire to work and the overall personality. Satisfactory results of surgery simply depend on finding and removing a definite disc protrusion. Using these methods of selection, 98% have returned to their original employment, 86% within 3 months of the operation. For a patient with no abnormal signs and a normal myelogram, surgical treatment should not be advised."

The aim of the current studies was to determine whether the annular tear of a painful disc proved by discography is the cause of radiating leg pain (radiculopathy) in patients with discogenic low back pain. Forty-two patients with discogenic low back pain at single disc level with concomitant radiating leg pain were studied in order to analyse the relationship between site of annular tear and side of radiating leg pain. Electromyogram and motor nerve conduction velocity were monitored to examine nerve root injury. The current studies found that there was a significant positive correlation between the site of annular tear and the side of radiation pain. Abnormalities of electromyogram and reduction of motor nerve conduction velocity were found on the side of radiating leg pain. The studies indicated that leakage of chemical mediators or inflammatory cytokines, which are produced in the painful disc, into epidural space through annular tear could lead to injury to adjacent nerve roots, and it might constitute the primary pathophysiologic mechanism of radiating leg pain in patients with discogenic low back pain but with no disc herniation."

The intervertebral foramen is a three-dimensional area demarcated primarily by the pedicles; we call it the lateral interpedicular compartment. The extraforaminal zone is the space outside the lateral border of the pedicles. All patients were evaluated by computed tomography (CT), water soluble myelography, postmyelographic CT scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging. Fifteen patients consecutively underwent disco-enhanced CT to adjust a correct diagnosis and to distinguish extraforaminal from foraminal herniation. In 10 cases of extraforaminal herniation, a selective radicular decompression with good-to-excellent clinical results was achieved by an extra-axial lateral decompression of the interpedicular compartment, with preservation of the facet joint. The operative target was the lateral aspect of the pars interarticularis and not the intertransverse space, as previously described. In two cases of both foraminal and extraforaminal herniation, the same technique was used. Fourteen patients with foraminal disc herniation and three patients with both foraminal and extraforaminal herniation underwent a standard intervertebral foraminotomy.

EMG was abnormal in 34.4% and H reflex in 30.4% of the affected limbs. Furthermore, the EATR taken separately was more sensitive than the H-reflex (42.8% versus 30.4%). Pathological ETR were elicited in a considerable percentage of the clinically normal tendon reflexes (TR): 7.3% of the knee and 14.1% of the Achilles TR. On the other hand 65% of the clinically absent ATR were recorded electrically producing abnormally low and delayed muscle evoked potentials."

Much has been written on the subject of cervical discography. However, little is of use to the clinician seeking objective validation of this procedure. Many papers relate to specific workers' own experiences and one cannot but be disturbed at the wide diversity of opinion that has been expressed on the efficacy of cervical discography. In this paper, we review the extensive literature on cervical discography and present our own findings from both in vitro and clinical studies. We conclude that as a technique to locate symptomatic levels, cervical discography is worthless but that the findings of a normal nuclear image will probably indicate an asymptomatic level.

One hundred patients underwent surgery solely on clinical grounds. Fifty-eight had disc herniation. The level of disc herniation was correctly predicted in three quarters of patients with a prolapsed disc. The outcome after surgery was good in 77 patients. Only few clinical features, namely male sex and scoliosis were predictors of a good outcome. Lasegue's sign was indicative of root compression in 90%, but only two-thirds had disc herniation. Conversely one-third had disc herniation in spite of a ""negative"" test. Lasegue's sign was not superior to other clinical tests in predicting outcome. The most important indicator of a good outcome was the presence of disc herniation at surgery. Patients with disc pathology other than true disc herniation fared equally with patients, who had normal discs disclosed at surgery.

CD007431,0,17909209,0,Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: a joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society.,"RECOMMENDATION 1: Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low back pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain, back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause. The history should include assessment of psychosocial risk factors, which predict risk for chronic disabling back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: Clinicians should perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed tomography only if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 6: For patients with low back pain, clinicians should consider the use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back care information and self-care. Clinicians should assess severity of baseline pain and functional deficits, potential benefits, risks, and relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For most patients, first-line medication options are acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RECOMMENDATION 7: For patients who do not improve with self-care options, clinicians should consider the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits-for acute low back pain, spinal manipulation; for chronic or subacute low back pain, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)."
CD007431,0,16838375,0,"Strain and excursion of the sciatic, tibial, and plantar nerves during a modified straight leg raising test.","A modified straight leg raising (SLR) in which ankle dorsiflexion is performed before hip flexion has been suggested to diagnose distal neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome. This study evaluates the clinical hypothesis that strain in the nerves around the ankle and foot caused by ankle dorsiflexion can be further increased with hip flexion. Linear displacement transducers were inserted into the sciatic, tibial, and plantar nerves and plantar fascia of eight embalmed cadavers to measure strain during the modified SLR. Nerve excursion was measured with a digital calliper. Ankle dorsiflexion resulted in a significant strain and distal excursion of the tibial nerve. With the ankle in dorsiflexion, the proximal excursion and tension increase in the sciatic nerve associated with hip flexion were transmitted distally along the nerve from the hip to beyond the ankle. As hip flexion had an impact on the nerves around the ankle and foot but not on the plantar fascia, the modified SLR may be a useful test to differentially diagnose plantar heel pain. Although the modified SLR caused the greatest increase in nerve strain nearest the moving joint, mechanical forces acting on peripheral nerves are transmitted well beyond the moving joint."
CD007431,0,1783549,0,Extraforaminal lumbar disk herniation. Clinical features and computerized tomography.,"Disk herniation lateral to the intervertebral foramen is defined as extraforaminal. Its particular anatomical site makes its clinical and neurologic features completely different from those of posteromedial and posterolateral disk herniations. Prior to the advent of computerized tomography, only diskography was capable of preoperatively identifying this rare disease. We present 5 cases of extraforaminal disk herniation, the clinical and tomographic diagnosis of which was confirmed at surgery. All patients had severe motor deficit and reported sciatica as prevalent over low back pain. The herniated disk was L4-5 in 2 cases and L5-S1 in 3 cases. The CT scan suggested disk protrusion in 2 cases, extrusion in 2 cases, and sequestration in 1 case. Four of these findings were confirmed intraoperatively. Diskectomy was done after hemilaminectomy and partial or total facetectomy. The clinical result was excellent in 2 cases and good in 3 cases after an average follow-up of 10 months. The use of CT scan as part of the routine diagnostic procedure in patients with radicular pain has lowered the number of cases which the surgical findings were inexplicably negative for disk herniation without having to resort to more complex and invasive diagnostic techniques such as myelo-CT and disk-CT. Moreover, preliminary tomographic localization of the extraforaminal disk herniation makes it possible to operate on the affected level using more conservative techniques. In any case, thorough clinical examination is essential for both correct interpretation of the CT scan and appropriate choice of treatment."
CD007431,0,10394282,0,[Mobilizing or stabilizing exercise in degenerative disk disease in the lumbar region?].,"Degenerative disc disease may affect younger and middle-aged people with a kind of premature disc degeneration. The majority of these low back pain patients are not candidates for a spinal fusion and are in need of a structured conservative treatment. In a controlled clinical trial, 27 low back pain patients (mean age 40 years, range 25-48) with a mean duration of symptoms of 7.4 years, were randomized to mobilizing (n = 12) or stabilizing (n = 15) daily half hour exercise for an eight weeks period. A clinical overall score (COS) based on pain intensity (VAS), physical signs, functional status (Oswestry) and analgetics was used as outcome criterion. The treatment results were best for the group undergoing stabilizing treatment. They achieved a 17% reduction in COS, compared to a 10% increase in the group undergoing mobilizing treatment (p = 0.02). These types of exercises are discussed in relation to the instability theory in disc degeneration."
CD007431,0,11013689,0,"Are there differences in the symptoms, signs and outcome after lumbar disc surgery in the elderly compared with younger patients?","Age is claimed by several authors to be a predictor of bad outcome after lumbar disc surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of the patients age on preoperative symptoms and the outcome. General data, symptoms, signs and neurological findings of 219 patients were recorded preoperatively Ninety-two per cent of the patients received a follow-up examination by an independent investigator after a mean of 298 days. All patients older than 59 years were defined as belonging to the group of elderly patients (n = 30). The other patients were defined as the younger group (n = 189). The outcome was measured by a visual analogue rating scale. Outcome was not statistically different in both groups. In our opinion, the indications for surgery for a lumbar disc herniation should be no different for older patients even though nerve root tension signs appear to be less marked in older patients."

To get a comprehensive picture of the appropriateness of a new technology the latter factors need to be explored and included in an assessment. In a prospective study, eight patients with signs of lumbar disc herniation underwent myelography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A structured patient interview on attitudes to these technologies was carried out after all three examinations had been carried out. Myelography was most often reported painful and unpleasant among the three modalities. Discomfort due to magnetic resonance imaging stem from the narrow calibre of the machine and the noise. In computed tomography immobilization was the main reason for discomfort. Altogether most patients preferred computed tomography. In view of the fact that myelography must be considered as diagnostically inferior to the other two examinations, the reported discomfort from myelography indicates that computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging should be the primary examinations for patients with lumbar disc herniation."

All patients (except one) showed a variable degree of tenderness in the motor-points related to the relevant myotomes as determined by clinical examination. The greater the tenderness, the longer was the period of disability. The degree of tenderness seemed to have a prognostic value related to recovery from pain and the length of disability as judged by absence from work."

A retrospective study of thirty-four cases.,"As life expectancy increases and spinal imaging techniques improve, surgery is being increasingly viewed as a therapeutic alternative for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis in patients older than 80 years. Thirty-four patients (21 men and 13 women) who had surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis in our department between 1979 and 1994 were studied retrospectively. The most common initial symptoms were walking-related disorders (n = 29) and sciatica or femoral neuralgia (n = 34). All 34 patients underwent laminectomy at one or more levels. Ten patients also had a herniated disk. There were no deaths and only two patients had serious complications (persistent foot drop in one and left-sided hemiplegia in the other). Results were evaluated immediately after surgery and after three and 12 months. The overall result on pain and walking-related disorders was good in 53% of cases, acceptable in 32%, and poor in 15%. Our data suggest that surgery is a reasonable alternative in symptomatic elderly patients who are in good general health. Satisfactory results can be obtained although disabling complications can occur."

Imaging of osseous structures in the axial plane by CT was excellent in all cases, even in the lower part of the cervical spine where soft-tissue discrimination is often impossible because of shoulder artifacts. In about half of the patients with nerve-root symptomatology as well as with signs of involvement of long tracts, narrowing of the foramen intervertebral, respectively of the spinal tract, was seen, attributable to degenerative osseous apposition with excellent clinical segmental and (according to radicular symptoms) side correlation. In contrast to these results the group of patients with posttraumatic clinical symptoms showed almost 50 per cent less preexisting degenerative disorders of the cervical spine. In conclusion, we assume that high-grade osseous appositions of the dorsal part of the vertebral body play an important role in the development of radicular symptomatology and cervical myelopathy, respectively. Hypertrophic changes of the processus articularis with narrowing of the spinal canal occurred in 14 per cent and were therefore of minor clinical significance."

CD007431,0,880005,0,Chemonucleolysis: evaluation of effectiveness by electromyography.,"Findings in 97 consecutive patients who had undergone chemonucleolysis were analyzed. The purpose of this prospective clinical study was two-fold: (1) to provide a comparison of preoperative findings of electromyography, myelography and discography and (2) to evaluate postoperative electromyography as an objective test of recovery. All the patients had complete history and physical examination, five-view roentgenographic study of the lumbosacral spine, electromyography preoperatively and again at three months postoperatively, myelography and discography. Computer analysis of the results was done for the multiple cross-correlations in the study. All patients had had at least three months preoperative conservative care without relief of symptoms. The study shows that electromyographic study three months postchemonucleolysis is of value for corroboration of clinical improvement only if the EMG becomes completely normal. A greater percentage of patients recovered clinically after chemonucleolysis when the preoperative EMG was normal as compared to those for whom the preoperative EMG was abnormal. We were surprised to find no significant correlation between end result and the existence of pending litigation."

According to the clinical symptoms presented at admission, 7 cases were classified as encephalitis, 44 as meningitis, 15 as radiculitis, 19 as ventriculitis, 61 as meningoencephalitis and 9 as meningoradiculitis. In 78% of these cases, the causative bacteria were either isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or other relevant sources (blood, wound swabs) or identified by serological methods; (all cases of CNS borreliosis, and 3 of the 5 cases of listeriosis were identified by means of the last mentioned method). CNS infections caused by staphylococci and Borrelia burgdorferi were most frequent, followed by those due to pneumococci, meningococci and other streptococci. CNS infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae were less frequent. In comparison to the CNS infections due to other bacteria, the pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitic infections were associated with more pronounced CSF alterations (on the average, there were higher white blood cell counts, and higher CSF protein and lactate). Pneumococci predominated in older patients and those with an impaired immune system, or infections of organs neighboring the CNS. Meningococci were most frequent in young and previously healthy individuals. All patients with CNS listeriosis had predisposing conditions. Meningococcal meningitis was either fatal or resolved with or without minimal neurological deficits. Infections caused by staphylococci or pneumococci were associated with a high percentage of neurologic sequelae."

CD007431,0,8988096,0,Hyperactive pectoralis reflex as an indicator of upper cervical spinal cord compression. Report of 15 cases.,"Myelopathy from cervical spondylosis is often accompanied by hyperreflexia of the upper-extremity deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). Reflexes such as the pectoralis jerk and the deltoid jerk may only be apparent in the context of hyperreflexia. Although the nerve roots involved in the reflex arcs are well described, levels of cervical spinal cord compression that lead to the hyperreflexia are not as clear. This is of particular significance for patients with multilevel cervical spondylosis in determining the levels responsible for their symptoms. The authors examined 15 consecutive patients who presented for treatment of cervical myelopathy. The clinical examination was then correlated with levels of cervical spinal cord compression by cervical magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography with intrathecal contrast enhancement. The presence of a prominent pectoralis jerk was seen only in patients with spinal cord compression at the C2-3 and/or C3-4 levels (nine patients). No patient with compression at or below the C4-5 disc space without coexisting compression at a higher level had hyperactive pectoralis reflexes. This association between the C3-4 level and a hyperactive pectoralis reflex was significant (p < 0.004, Fisher's exact test). The deltoid reflex was tested in the last nine consecutive patients. It was present in patients with compression of the upper spinal cord at levels C3-4 and C4-5 (four of five patients) but appeared in only one of four patients with compression below C4-5. This association did not attain statistical significance. The presence of a hyperactive pectoralis reflex is specific for lesions of the upper cervical spinal cord. Examination of upper-extremity DTRs may be helpful in planning the appropriate levels for surgical decompression in patients with multilevel spondylosis and myelopathy."

The patients with osteoarthritis had increased levels of SPLI in CSF (p < 0.001) compared to the controls. A positive correlation was also seen between the CSF SPLI and the degree of pain. At a second lumbar puncture 5 months after operation, SPLI had decreased, but was still significantly higher than in the controls. No difference in CSF SPLI was seen in the patients with herniated lumbar disc compared to the controls, neither before treatment, nor at follow up CSF postoperatively. The results suggest that nociceptive joint pain is consistent with increased SPLI in CSF. Differences in SPLI in CSF may be useful to differentiate pain from various origin, and may also increase our understanding of different pain mechanisms."

In the treatment group the patient received 250 mg Solu-Medrol intravenously and 160 mg Depo-Medrol intramuscularly. Before closure of the wound, a free fat transplant soaked in 80 mg Depo-Medrol was placed on the dural sac. In the control group the same procedure was performed, but sodium chloride was given instead of Depo-Medrol. All patients underwent a clinical examination before surgery and at 2, 6, 12, 26, 52 and 104 weeks postoperatively, rating their pain with the visual analog scale (VAS) and function with the Disability Rating Index (DRI). The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter (P=0.01) in the treatment group (1.7 days) compared to the control group (2.3 days). Time taken to return to full-time work was also significantly shorter in the treatment group (P=0.003). VAS-W (Worst Pain during last week) was significantly lower in the treatment group (P=0.02).

The criteria of instability were defined strictly by both the clinical symptom of ""instability catch"" and the radiological findings that fulfilled Nachemson's criteria. Low back pain and/or sciatica that interfered largely with the patients' work or quality of life were the indications for this treatment. All the operations were performed by one surgeon with the same spinal instrumentation system-""AO internal fixator"". The follow-up period was between 16 and 36 months (mean 24 months). Face to face questionnaire revealed that this treatment modality is encouraging. Fourteen patients (82%) had complete or nearly complete relief from all the pre-operative symptoms. Two (12%) had partial relief of the symptoms that required a subsequent discectomy or wider laminectomy. Only one case (6%) with osteoporosis remained unchanged after the operation. On the follow-up radiographs, sixteen patients (94%) showed good alignment and solid arthrodesis of the treated motion segment. These radiological findings correlated quite well with the absence of the clinical symptom of ""instability catch"". A common, but acceptable, complication found in this series was a variable degree of low back stiffness secondary to the instrumentation. Fracture of the screw was found in one patient and pull out of the screw was found in another patient. However, they did not elicit detectable symptoms. Osteoporosis, concomitant disc herniation and persistent spinal stenosis at/or adjacent to the operated level were the three main factors that may contribute to unsatisfactory results secondary to this treatment. These problems remain to be resolved in the future."

CD007431,0,15262072,0,A preclinical post laminectomy rat model mimics the human post laminectomy syndrome.,"Chronic low back pain with sciatica complicating post laminectomy surgery is poorly understood. It is likely that some aspects of persistent pain of the syndrome results from spinal facilitation in which there is lowering of pain excitation levels. A small animal preclinical model is needed that mimics the clinical condition to permit detailed studies of the underlying altered neurochemistry of the sensory pathways. We propose herein a rat laminectomy model containing the elements required for study of the neurobiology of the condition. The model consists of a surgical laminectomy that includes L5 spinal nerve manipulation and disc injury, elements necessarily employed in human disc herniation surgery. At 8 weeks post laminectomy the proposed model demonstrates paraspinous muscle spasm, tail contracture, behavioral pain behavior, tactile allodynia, epidural and nerve root scarring, and nerve root adherence by scar to the underlying disc and adjacent pedicle. Two underlying pain facilitation states are invoked in the clinical condition: (1) an inflammatory state required to achieve wound healing; and (2) a nerve injury state resulting from nerve manipulation and subsequent epidural scarring, spinal nerve scarring, and spinal nerve tethering to the adjacent disc and pedicle. Both pain facilitation states are active in the model."

This study investigated structural, process and outcome quality. One of the study questions asked is whether AOTR is as effective for (1) patients with low back pain and clinical signs of disc problems and (2) patients with cruciate ligament injury as the routinely practised inpatient rehabilitation. In a quasi-experimental cohort study patients from five AOTR centers were compared to patients from five orthopedic rehabilitation clinics with regard to their rehabilitation outcome measured on the clinical, disability and handicap level. At the beginning (t0) and the end (t1) of the rehabilitation, data were collected from patients and therapists and 6 months later (t2) only from patients by means of questionnaires. The inclusion criteria for patients with back problems had to be broadened (""patients with low back pain"") because of difficulties with patient sampling.

At baseline, ambulant patients with low back pain were younger (43 vs. 49 years) and better off with regard to disabilities and handicaps than patients from rehabilitation clinics. Clinical signs (e.g., neurological signs, Lasègue sign, flexibility of the spine) showed smaller differences. At t1 clinical, disability and handicaps variables had improved considerably in both groups. At t2 the improvements had stabilized or had become greater. Analyses of variance showed that improvements in the ambulant group were not much greater after accounting for the different baseline status. The sample size of patients with knee ligament injury was n = 66 (AOTR: 50, inpatient: 16). Ambulant patients considerably improved with regard to knee function and handicaps. Despite of small sample sizes this study provides some evidence that (1) AOTR and inpatient rehabilitation both are effective for treating subgroups of patients with low back pain and (2) AOTR is effective for treating patients with cruciate ligament injury."
CD007431,0,1485138,0,[Diagnosis of extruded herniated disks].,"In a patient with disk herniation it is often difficult to establish that the disk is free in the spinal canal. A retrospective medical record study comparing 65 cases of free herniated disk (FHD) confirmed upon surgery and 65 cases of disk protrusion (DP) demonstrated that FHD was more common in young male blue collar workers, especially those who worked in the sitting position. No clinical findings were diagnostic of FHD although the straight-leg raising test was positive at smaller angles than in disk protrusion. In this study, sensitivity and specificity of CT scan for the diagnosis of FHD were 75% and 80%, respectively. CT scan findings suggestive of FHD included a free disk fragment, found in 22.5% of cases, and an acute connecting angle. Saccoradiculography was more sensitive but less specific than CT scan in this study. In FDH, migration was common and ragged hernia contours were seen on the saccoradiculography images."

CD007431,0,8172510,0,Instrumental straight-leg raising: results in patients.,"Straight-leg raising is used as a diagnostic test for both elastogenic (passive muscle stretch test) and nonelastogenic (Lasègue's test) pathology in patients unable to bend forward from the standing position while holding the knees in extension. The test assessment is based on the range of the leg excursion and the type of pain that is provoked. An instrumental version of Lasègue's test (instrumental straight-leg raising) provides information about the extensibility, elasticity and electrical activity of the hamstrings and back muscles and about pelvic rotation. To investigate the diagnostical value of the additional information, both clinical and instrumental straight-leg raising was done by 30 patients who were unable to touch the ground while bending forward from the standing position with the knees extended. In one group of patients, the electrical activity of the muscles was comparable to that observed in the muscles of a control group of healthy volunteers; in a second group, however, the electrical muscle activity was aberrant. Muscle extensibility and passive muscle elasticity was comparable in patients in the first group and the healthy controls. In the patients with aberrant muscle activity, the elasticity of the passive muscles was not different from the control group, but both leg excursion and muscle extensibility were much smaller. Comparison of the clinically and experimentally diagnosed cause (elastogenic or non-elastogenic) of the movement restriction showed a remarkable discrepancy. We conclude that instrumental straight-leg raising provides valuable additional diagnostical information."

CD007431,0,3263774,0,CT-guided nerve root block and ablation.,"We report our experience in performing 52 CT-guided peripheral nerve root blocks and 27 CT-guided nerve root ablations. The nerve root block procedures were performed as diagnostic tests to determine the clinical significance of equivocal herniated disk or foraminal stenosis (n = 33) and before nerve root ablations (n = 19). To evaluate the clinical significance of these nerve root blocks, we performed 52 procedures at the vertebral level where a herniated disk or foraminal stenosis had been identified on CT or MR images. In 51 of 52 cases, the procedures were successful in anesthetizing the intended nerve root, which allowed us to determine whether that particular nerve root was the source of pain. By relieving or not relieving pain, the results of the diagnostic nerve root blocks helped determine whether a protrusion or foraminal stenosis was clinically significant. The nerve root ablations were done exclusively for treatment of pain in patients with malignant disease. Significant relief of pain was obtained in 17 (63%) of 27 patients. The thoracic nerve ablations were the most successful (9/10 or 90%) because the correct thoracic nerve innervation to the offending lesion could be identified. The lumbosacral nerve ablation procedures were the least successful (6/14 or 43%) because the innervation of the pelvic neoplasms was complex, arising from multiple lumbosacral nerves that often were bilateral. Equivocal foraminal stenosis and disk protrusion are common findings on CT and MR imaging, and CT-guided nerve block procedures can help determine which of these findings are clinically significant. CT-guided nerve root ablations have limited efficacy but can help control pain in patients with a malignant disease, especially when the pain is in the distribution of a thoracic nerve dermatome."

A herniated disk resulting in nerve root impingement was found in 79 patients (83 herniated disks) and lumbar spinal stenosis in 21. The level of nerve root compromise was L2-L3 in eight cases, L3-L4 in 35 cases, and L4-L5 in 40 cases. Herniated disks were divided into several groups based on their location with regard to the intervertebral foramen: posterolateral herniations were entirely contained within the spinal canal (n = 12; 14.5%), whereas far lateral, or foraminal, herniations (n = 71; 85.5%) involved the intervertebral foramen. Twenty-nine foraminal herniations (34.9%) had a component located within the spinal canal (medioforaminal herniations), 33 (39.8%) were entirely contained within the foramen (pure foraminal herniations), and nine (10.8%) were located lateral to the foramen (lateroforaminal herniations). As compared with posterolateral herniations, foraminal herniations were associated with shorter symptom duration at admission (p < 0.05), a greater likelihood of nocturnal exacerbation of pain (p < 0.001) and of a positive femoral stretch test (p < 0.01), and failure of the pain to worsen during Valsalva maneuvers (p < 0.01)."

CD007431,0,10631642,0,Measurement of the effect of a bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen by a repetitive movement test.,"We assessed the repetitive movement (RM) test for measuring the effect of a trial bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen on spasticity. The RM test measures passive range of motion (ROM) by electrogoniometry and stretch reflex activity (SRA) of the flexors and extensors of the knee and ankle by surface electromyography. The SRA has a dynamic component (dynamic stretch reflex, DSR) and a tonic component (tonic stretch reflex, TSR). Four hypotheses were formulated: (a) RM results show a negative relationship between SRA and ROM; (b) values on the RM test are correlated with clinical scores of tonus and spasticity; (c) RM results show a reduction in SRA after administration of the clinically optimal dose of baclofen; and (d) RM results show a dose-dependent effect of intrathecal baclofen on SRA. Twenty-four patients were selected because they had impairments and disabilities caused by intractable spasticity. A bolus of baclofen was administered with incremental doses (25-150 micrograms) until an optimal effect or no effect was obtained. The main outcome measures were RM test and clinical assessments of the Ashworth and spasm score. The results were (a) For the ankle a negative correlation was found between ROM and TSR of the flexor and extensors; for the knee a significant negative correlation was found only with the DSR of the biceps femoris. (b) A positive correlation was found between the Ashworth score and TSR of the extensors and between the spasm score and DSR and TSR of the gastrocnemius muscle. (c) Significant differences were found between baseline measurements and the optimal dose of baclofen for all measures. (d) A significant dose-dependent effect of intrathecal baclofen on the level of SRA was observed. The RM test is thus a useful clinical tool for objectively measuring the effect of intrathecal baclofen administration on spasticity in patients with an upper motor neuron syndrome."

Previous studies have suggested that the disorder is a neck flexion induced cervical myelopathy. We report clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings in nine patients with Hirayama's disease. Cervical imaging of seven patients revealed spinal cord changes consisting of focal atrophy and foci of signal alterations. On neck flexion a forward movement and mild reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the lower cervical cord against the vertebral bodies was noted in affected individuals as well as in five normal controls. In contrast to earlier reports, none of our patients showed complete obliteration of the posterior subarachnoid space. Measurement of the anteroposterior spinal cord diameter in each vertebral segment (C4-C7) revealed no significant differences in the degree of spinal cord flattening between the two groups. Furthermore, two of our patients had significant degenerative changes in the cervical spine (disc herniation, retrospondylosis) contralateral to the clinically affected side. These degenerative changes resulted in a marked cord compression on neck flexion but were not associated with ipsilateral clinical abnormalities or spinal cord alterations. Our results argue against a flexion-induced cervical myelopathy and support the view that Hirayama's disease is an intrinsic motor neuron disease."

We have retrospectively analysed 30 patients (29-82 years) with a minor sensory/motor deficit and an unequivocal MRI finding (20 disc herniations, 10 foraminal stenoses) treated with a selective nerve root block. Based on the clinical and imaging findings, surgery (decompression of the nerve root) was justifiable in all cases. Twenty-six patients (87%) had rapid (1-4 days) and substantial regression of pain, five required a repeat injection. 60% of the patients with disc herniation or foraminal stenosis had permanent resolution of pain, so that an operation was avoided over an average of 16 months (6-23 months) follow-up.

CD007431,0,17075165,0,Finite element analysis of the spondylolysis in lumbar spine.,"Spondylolysis is a fracture of the bone lamina in the pars interarticularis and has a high risk of developing spondylolisthesis, as well as traction on the spinal cord and nerve root, leading to spinal disorders or low back pain when the lumbar spine is subjected to high external forces. Previous studies mostly investigated the mechanical changes of the endplate in spondylolysis. However, little attention has been focused on the entire structural changes that occur in spondylolysis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical changes in posterior ligaments, disc, endplate, and pars interarticularis between the intact lumbar spine and spondylolysis. A total of three finite element models, namely the intact L2-L4 lumbar spine, lumbar spine with unilateral pars defect and with bilateral pars defect were established using a software ANSYS 6.0. A loading of 10 N.m in flexion, extension, left torsion, right torsion, left lateral bending, and right lateral bending respectively were imposed on the superior surface of the L2 body. The bottom of the L4 vertebral body was completely constrained. The finite element models estimated that the lumbar spine with a unilateral pars defect was able to maintain spinal stability as the intact lumbar spine, but the contralateral pars experienced greater stress. For the lumbar spine with a bilateral pars defect, the rotation angle, the vertebral body displacement, the disc stress, and the endplate stress, was increased more when compared to the intact lumbar spine under extension or torsion."
CD007431,0,206669,0,Clinical and electrophysiological appraisal of the significance of radicular injury in back pain.,"Clinical electrophysiological studies were analysed in 60 consecutive patients with back pain with or without other evidence for a radiculopathy.

Segmental denervation was found in 29 of the 60 patients. In 57 patients, abnormal slowing of the F response was present in 27, either unilaterally (25) or bilaterally (two). In 18 of 47 patients with H reflex studies, the H reflex was either unilaterally absent (12), asymmetrically prolonged (five), or bilaterally prolonged (one). Statistically significant (P less than 0.05) associations were found between (1) abnormalities of H reflexes and F responses, (2) F response slowing and radicular injury shown by EMG, (3) segmentally consistent radiographic defects and abnormalities of both H reflexes and F responses, and (4) depressed Achilles reflexes as well as sensory loss and abnormal H reflexes. No significant association, however, was present between abnormalities of EMG, F responses, or H reflexes and pain radiation by history or positive straight leg-raising tests. These data suggest that pain in radicular syndromes is related to the functioning of smaller afferent fibres."

The diagnosis was made based on the complaint of constant pain unrelated to physical activity in the absence of overt sepsis or implant loosening. In six of these cases, other factors may have clouded the diagnosis. Thirteen (44.8%) patients obtained complete relief following an average of 1.8 blocks. Three of these patients had symptoms for more than two years. Twelve patients had complete or partial relief for varying periods of time, but the relief was not sustained. Three obtained no relief at all, and in one the block could not be successfully carried out. This success rate, while shedding no light on the etiology or diagnostic accuracy, has encouraged the authors to continue with this method of treatment in such cases."

The sample size must be consistent with the objectives (at least 40 patients per group). The selection criteria must be well specified and the comparability of baseline data assessed. The most appropriate study design for assessing clinical efficacy is to compare two parallel groups of out patients treated during five to fifteen days. The main criterion of efficacy should be based on the judgments of both patients and physician. Time course of pain, improvement in the patient's functional capacity, improvement in physical findings (Schober, Lasègue), dosage of concomitant analgesic treatments when these are allowed, and evaluation at three and six months can also be used as efficacy criteria. Assessment of clinical and biological tolerance is mandatory. Considering the frequent use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs in treating sciatica, there is a strong need for rigorous investigations."
CD007431,0,6983719,0,The value of dorsal column stimulation in multiple sclerosis.,"Ten patients with definite and one with probable MS, all markedly inflicted, but with a varying degree of motor and bladder dysfunction were subjected to spinal cord stimulation in a controlled study. None of the patients exhibited appreciable fluctuation in symptoms in the pre-study period. Bladder symptoms were most markedly influenced by electrical stimulation. The reduction in hesitancy and urgency was of great importance to the patients. In 9 of 10 patients reduction in voiding frequency took place, the all over reduction being 8%. Maximum extension torque increased by 9% and flexion torque by 29% during the stimulation when compared to the first placebo period. In selected MS patients, i.e. patients with bladder dysfunction and with a certain muscular reserve, electrical spinal cord stimulation may have an indication."
CD007431,0,842090,0,[Clinical signs of the narrow lumbar spinal canal (author's transl)].,The syndrom of the narrow spinal canal is today to be separated from other lumbar diseases by its nosological entity. It starts slowly and becomes manifest in middle and advanced age. Claudicatio intermittens is the characteristic symptom of this disease the aetiology of which is multifactory. Most patients show in the myelogram konstitutionell alterations combined with localized or generalized degenerative narrowing of the spinal canal. The clinical findings correspond to the lumbar segments affected. With localized narrowing the differential diagnosis of disc herniation is generally possible by myelography. This is of therapeutic consequence because in this cases a removal of the disc is unnecessary.

Prior to embarking on such a course the surgeon must have a precise neurologic diagnosis. This diagnosis must be clinical, with corroborating radiographic, electrodiagnostic and nerve block evidence. The important concept is: think nerve root. Surgical management must be tailored to the individual, depending on that individual's local anatomy and local pathology, be it disc or lateral bony entrapment. The surgeon should not have preconceived ideas about the cause of nerve compression and should be guided by the findings at operation. To prevent intractable back pain following nerve decompression, those patients with spondylolisthesis or segmental instability should be considered candidates for a spinal fusion."

At least one test revealed a pathologic abnormality preoperatively in 13 patients, but in 5 patients only the nerve root level corresponded to computed tomographic findings. Discordance between neurophysiologic and radiologic findings did not predict a surgical success rate. if all neurophysiologic tests were normal the outcome was significantly worse than if any of the tests showed an abnormality (P < 0.01). Four patients who were improved after surgery still had abnormal neurophysiologic findings. In conclusion, neurophysiology is not useful to diagnose the exact level of a nerve root lesion, but may reveal whether it is present. Electrodiagnosis is recommended if radiology and clinical testing conflict. If positive, it may then serve to justify surgical exploration."

Ninety-nine patients were subsequently examined after median 376 days. The clinical outcome was scored using the Low Back Pain Rating Scale. Enhanced CT-scanning was assessed regarding the degree of scar tissue and survival of the fat transplant. There was no difference in the clinical outcome between the two groups.

CD007431,0,6223390,0,Low back pain.,"Low back pain probably always will be a problem because of the anatomic arrangement of the lower spine and posture in standing and walking. However, during recent years, new attempts at diagnosis and treatment of this difficult problem have occurred, and it is now possible, in most cases, with a good history, physical examination, and diagnostic work-up to determine the cause of the problem. The injuries are still difficult to treat in many cases, but often with a thorough explanation to the patient about the underlying problem and mechanism of pain, and with use of the ""back school"" and conservative measures, most of the patients can continue on with daily activities. Formal surgery is playing less of a role in the treatment of back problems, with the development of various injections and percutaneous techniques. Still to be addressed, and where considerable effort and energy should be spent, is in the prevention of back problems with changes in daily habits and in increased awareness of ways to avoid back injuries."

A simple objective test in evaluation of low-back pain with neurological involvement.,"Clinical evaluation of a patient with low-back problem is based mainly upon the subjective impressions of the physician. Accuracy in neurologic evaluation and follow-up of these patients depends upon objective and quantitative procedures. A handy instrument, simple to use by the clinician in his office, was developed in our laboratory and tested on healthy volunteers and patients with low-back problems. The instrument measures or records the power of the extensor hallucis longus. Weakness of this muscle represents the vast majority of root involvement in discogenic lesions. The measurement is compared with the result obtained on the contralateral side. The instrument includes a mobile mechanical spring gauge of 100-2000-gr range and a leg splint. A single channel polygraph can be connected to record the measurement. The technique was tested on healthy volunteers and good reproducibility and accuracy were found. Seventy-five patients were examined and the power of EHL measured. The patients were divided into three groups according to the nature of their back problems: 1) acute discogenic; 2) chronic low back problems with acute exacerbations; and 3) acute trauma. The quantitative measurements of EHL were of great help in evaluating and following treatment of patients with discogenic lesions and in deciding further surgical treatments. The test was valuable in evaluating malingeres and compensation cases. Eight of the patients with chronic, recurrent low-back problems were found to have weakness of EHL; further investigations showed root pressure mostly due to osteophytes pressing on the nerve roots. After acute trauma, the EHL power test also revealed weakness in patients with higher lumbar injuries, probably because of spreading."

The authors' purpose was to define the diagnostic value of lumbar phlebography in the investigation of intervertebral disc lesions and to compare these results with those obtained from clinical examination and plain X-rays. They conducted a retrospective study of 200 cases of patients hospitalized for sciatica who were investigated by lumbar phlebography using selective catheterization, without any prior neuro-radiological examination. 104 of these cases were operated on. The lumbar phlebography was interpretable in 99 p. cent of cases. Severe thrombo-embolic episodes occurred in two cases. In the 104 patients who went to operation, the surgical procedure confirmed the presence of a herniated disc (suspected on phlebography) in 96 p. cent of cases. Topographical agreement between the phlebographic data and the operative findings was observed in 81 p. cent of cases. Phlebography proved to be more reliable at L4-L5 than at L5-S1. In the patients in whom clinical examination and plain X-ray findings provided coherent information as to the site of the herniated disc, phlebography was considered to be of no use. In those patients for whom this examination did not provide coherent information, phlebography proved to be valuable in the topographical diagnosis of the herniated disc."

A compressive brachial plexopathy from abnormally attached or enlarged scalene muscles that affected both upper and lower trunks of the brachial plexus was found at surgery in all patients. In 13 patients, at least one fibrous band compressed the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. Therefore, neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome can occur from cervical bands and scalene muscle anomalies without intrinsic hand muscle atrophy, cervical ribs, enlarged C7 transverse processes, or EMG abnormalities."

Twenty patients with hamstring muscle strains were assigned randomly to an Experimental Group (n = 10) or a Control Group (n = 10). Peak torque production of the quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles and hamstring muscle length were measured before and after treatment. The hamstring muscles of the Experimental and Control groups were treated with moist heat followed by passive stretching. The Experimental Group also received manipulation of the sacroiliac joint. The change in hamstring muscle peak torque was significantly greater for the Experimental Group than for the Control Group (p less than .005). No significant differences existed between the two groups in either quadriceps femoris muscle peak torque or hamstring muscle length. The results of this study suggest a relationship between sacroiliac joint dysfunction and hamstring muscle strain.

While upper limb motor and sensory loss are doubtless due to nerve root compression in cases of ""pure' brachial neuritis, they are more likely to be due to cord damage in cases with myelopathy (with spastic paraparesis of lower limbs). In either group of cases, neurological features in the upper limbs are not very helpful in localizing the level of significant intervertebral disc pathology. Contrast radiology (myelography and possibly discography) is a reliable guide judging by the excellent results obtained by anterior route (Cloward's) operation at specific disc levels in a series of cases with longstanding complaints unrelieved by conservative treatment.

The open-door laminoplasty procedure presently reported consisted of the same approach evaluated by Hirabayashi in 1977, except that the authors of this report used three rib allografts to anchor the ""open door,"" rather than spinous process sutures or autologous bone grafts. Posterior foraminotomies and decompression were performed in patients with clinical radiculopathy and radiographic evidence of foraminal stenosis. Preoperatively, gait disturbance was present in all patients. All 25 patients (100%) had long-tract signs on presentation. Nondermatomal upper-extremity symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain) were quite common in this group of patients. Bowel, bladder, and/or sexual dysfunction was found in 13 (52%) of 25 patients. Preoperative radiographic studies showed a mean midline anteroposterior diameter spinal canal/vertebral body (SC/VB) ratio of 0.623 and a mean compression ratio (sagittal/lateral diameter ratio x 100%) of 37%. This procedure was quite successful in relieving preoperative symptoms and few complications occurred. Gait disturbance was improved in 21 (84%) of 25 patients and hand numbness and tingling were improved in 13 (87%) of 15 patients. Bowel or bladder function improved in 10 (77%) of 13 patients. Radiculopathy, when present, was alleviated in all four patients after the decompressive procedure. The postoperative SC/VB ratio, as measured by plain lateral radiographs and/or computerized tomography scans, was improved to 0.871, a 38% improvement. In a comparison with the preoperative SC/VB ratio using the two-tailed t-test, alpha was less than 0.001. The compression ratio improved to 63% postoperatively, which yielded an alpha of less than 0.005 according to the two-tailed t-test. Only one postoperative complication, an anterior scalene syndrome, was encountered. Various predictors of surgical outcome based on gait improvement were evaluated. Age greater than 60 years at the time of presentation, duration of symptoms more than 18 months prior to surgery, preoperative bowel or bladder dysfunction, and lower-extremity dysfunction were found to be associated with poorer surgical outcome. Even when these conditions were present, gait improvement was noted in at least 70% of the patients."
CD007431,0,6474257,0,Lumbar intervertebral disk herniation in teenage children: recognition and management of associated anomalies.,"Herniated disks in children and adolescents can be extremely disabling and difficult to diagnose because of the paucity of neurologic abnormalities and the consequent suspicions of hysteria. The Laségue sign is often the only consistent positive finding, and when persisting without remission, justifies early diagnostic studies such as CT scanning, and electromyography. Myelography may be avoided if these studies are definitively diagnostic. The almost uniformly good results that follow diskectomy do not justify prolonged conservative care. Management is facilitated by awareness of often unrecognized structural abnormalities found in these patients. These include spinal stenosis, lateral recess narrowing, and transitional vertebra. Spinal fusion, while rarely indicated, should be considered where motion segment instability contributes to persistent backache. The management of 25 patients is recorded. Twenty-one of these presented with an anomaly worthy of record requiring modifications in surgical technique to provide proper decompression and lasting relief of symptoms."

The relationship between the intensity of the Lasegue test and intraoperative localization of disc herniation is presented. The material comprised 87 cases (54 males and 33 females) aged 47 (+/- 9) years. Duration of symptoms was on average 9 months (+/- 7.5 months). The Lasegue sign was positive in 84 patients and negative in 3 patients (absent in 1 case, and more than 70 degrees in 2 cases). In the investigated group the Lasegue sign was positive at 39 degrees (+/- 22 degrees) on average. The obtained results indicate a strong relation between a positive Lasegue sign and disc herniation leading to direct spinal nerve or nerve sheath compression."

CD007431,0,8410084,0,The utility of F wave chronodispersion in lumbosacral radiculopathy.,"The sensitivity of F wave chronodispersion (Fc) in evaluating nerve root pathology is unknown. We compared Fc in 91 patients with clinical and EMG evidence of L5 or S1 radiculopathy with Fc in 81 controls in order to evaluate its sensitivity in lumbosacral radiculopathy. F waves were obtained by stimulating the peroneal and tibial nerves behind the knee and recording from the extensor digitorum brevis (L5 predominant) and flexor hallucis brevis (S1 predominant) muscles, respectively. Fc was calculated by subtracting the shortest F wave latency from the longest and, in controls, ranged from 0.2 to 23.4 ms in the peroneal nerve, and from 1.2 to 13.4 ms in the tibial nerve (95th percentile = 13 ms for the peroneal nerve and 9.2 ms for the tibial nerve). In the patient group, Fc also ranged from 0.2 to 23.4 ms in the peroneal nerve, and from 0.4 to 18.2 ms in the tibial nerve. Only 5 (5.5%) and 8 (11.3%) patients for the peroneal and tibial nerves, respectively, had Fc values which fell beyond the 95th percentile, a percentage far below the sensitivity of F wave latency measurement and not substantially different from chance. Thus we conclude that Fc has no substantial additional value in evaluating lumbosacral radiculopathy over that of F wave latency."
CD007431,0,3179982,0,Comparison of T1 and T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine.,"In order to develop an optimal routine magnetic resonance (MR) spine scanning protocol, we have compared the relative efficacy of performing T1- and T2-weighted images in patients with various disorders of the lumbar region. Forty cases were randomly selected from studies performed from 1984 to 1987 and the T1- and T2-weighted images of each case were separated and interpreted blindly and independently by two neuroradiologists. Our results indicate no significant difference between T1- and T2-weighted images in the depiction of disc protrusion. The T2-weighted images were superior in depicting disc dessication, but the clinical significance of identifying a dessication disc remains uncertain. No significant difference in the depiction of osteophytes was seen between T1- and T2-weighted images. Cases of tethered cord, metastatic disease, and arachnoiditis were better delineated with T1-weighted images. The increase in signal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with T2-weighting often obscured lesions within the spinal canal. In a signal case of postoperative discitis, the T2-weighted images disclosed disc space abnormalities and epidural fluid collections not appreciated on T1-weighted images. The T1-weighted images, however, did show thecal sac and adjacent epidural extension more clearly. In cases of metastatic disease, increase in the signal of metastases with T2 weighting often rendered them isointense to surrounding medullary bone. Given the lack of superiority of T2-weighted images over T1-weighted images in evaluating intervertebral disc protrusions and the superiority of T1-weighted images in depicting nearly all other abnormalities observed in this series, we no longer acquire T2-weighted images of the lumbar spine on a routine basis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD007431,0,454142,0,[Cauda equina syndrome with total myelographic block (author's transl)].,"Twenty-seven cases of complete subarachnoid block discovered through myelography are analysed with regard to the causes of obstruction, the neurologic symptoms, and the cerebrospinal fluid. The neurologic signs in cases of cauda equina compression, most often caused by massive disc protrusions (20 patients), vary considerably and rarely correspond to the gross myelographic findings. Bilateral neurologic symptoms of any degree with or without sphincter disturbance were observed in 21 among 27 cases and are signs of cauda compression. In contrast to cases of sciatica with unilateral root compression and radicular symptoms neurological symptoms are not reliable in revealing the site of the lesion in cases of massive central disc protrusions. Therefore radiculography (myelography of the cauda equina) is necessary for diagnosis. In addition to the well-known elevation of the spinal fluid protein and pleocytosis, the presence of neutrophile granulocytes is frequently found (11 of 20 cases) in cytological analysis."
CD007431,0,14657747,0,Pitfalls of anterior cervical fusion using titanium mesh and local autograft.,"Cervical fusion cages have been developed to provide an anterior structural support without harvesting tricortical iliac bone. Limited numbers of investigations have focused on pitfalls of anterior cervical fusion using cage implants. The objective of this study is to report clinical results and implant-related complications in anterior cervical fusion using titanium mesh and anterior plating. Twenty-four cases with anterior cervical fusion using a titanium mesh with local autograft and anterior plating were reviewed. One-level fusion was performed in 7 cases, and 17 patients underwent two-level fusion with corpectomy. The mean follow-up period was 27 months. Radiographic assessment included sagittal alignment, fusion status, and complications related to cage implants. Iliac bone graft harvesting was obviated in all the patients, whereas 15 patients required concomitant use of ceramic bone substitute. Sagittal alignment of the operative level was lordotic in 19 cases (79%) and neutral in 5 cases (21%) at the final follow-up. No late kyphotic collapse was observed. Twenty-three cases (96%) achieved a solid fusion, whereas the time to fusion was averaged 6.2 months. Cage subsidence frequently occurred in 42% of upper vertebrae and 50% of lower vertebrae. The use of titanium mesh and local autograft for anterior cervical fusion obviated the need for harvesting iliac bone block and provided structural anterior column support. However, it required a longer period to achieve a solid fusion when compared with tricortical iliac autograft. Cage subsidence was frequently observed in the early postoperative period."
CD007431,0,10815135,0,Prediction of spinal epidural metastases.,"Early diagnosis and treatment of spinal epidural metastases (SEM) is of the utmost importance to prevent neurological deficit due to spinal cord compression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the final tool in that diagnostic process. However, access to MRI is still limited in The Netherlands, requiring cost-effective use. It is generally acknowledged that patients with systemic cancer who present with a radiculopathy or myelopathy should undergo an MRI. However, the diagnostic policy in patients with systemic cancer who present with recently developed back pain is still a matter of debate."

CD007431,0,16047210,0,The pathogenesis and clinical significance of a high-intensity zone (HIZ) of lumbar intervertebral disc on MR imaging in the patient with discogenic low back pain.,"Recently, the presence of a high-intensity zone (HIZ) within the posterior annulus seen on T2-weighted MRI has aroused great interest and even controversy among many investigators, particularly on whether the HIZ was closely associated with a concordant pain response on awake discography. The study attempted to interpret the correlation between the presence of the HIZ on MRI and awake discography, as well as its characteristic pathology. Fifty two patients with low back pain without disc herniation underwent MRI and discography successively. Each disc with HIZ was correlated for an association between the presence of a HIZ and the grading of annular disruption and a concordant pain response. Eleven specimens of lumbar intervertebral discs which contain HIZ in the posterior annulus from 11 patients with discogenic low back pain were harvested for histologic examination to interpret the histologic basis of a nociceptive response during posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF). The study found that in all of 142 discograms in 52 patients, 17 presented HIZ. All 17 discs with HIZ showed painful reproduction and abnormal morphology with annular tears extending either well into or through the outer third of the annulus fibrosus. The consecutive sagittal slices through the HIZ lesion showed that a notable histologic feature of the formation of vascularized granulation tissue in the outer region of the annulus fibrosus. The current study suggests that the HIZ of the lumbar disc on MRI in the patient with low back pain could be considered as a reliable marker of painful outer anular disruption."
CD007431,0,2913859,0,Intrathecal fentanyl depresses nociceptive flexion reflexes in patients with chronic pain.,"To investigate the selective role of intraspinal opioids on the perception and modulation of pain, seven subjects with chronic hip or back pain and one subject with C-6 quadriplegia received 25 micrograms of intrathecal fentanyl. The effect of lumbar intrathecal fentanyl on reported pain, nociceptive flexor withdrawal reflexes, a monosynaptic motor arc (H-reflex), and supraspinal effects such as miosis, nausea, respiratory depression was evaluated. In five of eight subjects the flexor withdrawal reflex was completely abolished within 15 min. In the others the reflex was significantly depressed from control values. Decreases in reported pain paralleled the decrease in the flexor reflex, H-reflexes remained unchanged, and no supraspinal side effects were observed. It is likely that these selective changes observed were from the isolated effect of fentanyl modulating nociception at the spinal cord level."

Isokinetic recordings of maximal voluntary strength showed that in 6 out of 8 patients, weakness of the foot dorsal flexor muscles could be more or less completely restored after one session of autotraction resulting in pain relief. In a group of patients with clinical signs of impaired sensibility, the low or abolished SEP responses to nerve stimulation on the affected side were restituted in 4 out of 5 cases during autotraction. The asymmetric leg skin temperatures in 10 patients with sciatic pain levelled off in the 6 cases obtaining pain relief by the traction. The results suggest a causal relationship between pain relief and restitution of certain neurological deficits."

Eighty patients with monoradicular pain corresponding to the fifth lumbar or the first sacral nerve root were included. Pre-operatively a number of clinical parameters were recorded and compared to the intra-operative finding of a disc herniation. The parameters were analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results from the available literature were analysed by ROC curves for comparison. In 76% of the cases a disc herniation was discovered. The level of the disc herniation was correctly predicted in 93% of these cases by the location of the pain alone or supplemented by neurological signs. Apart from radicularly distributed pain, all parameters in the present study and in the literature had no or low diagnostic accuracy. Thus, in patients with monoradicular sciatica further clinical parameters do not add to the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation."

The patients averaged 65 years of age, with women outnumbering men by a ratio of 2:1. Symptoms in the lower extremities had been present for 3 months to 10 years, although varying back pain had existed for longer periods. Two-thirds showed signs of motor dysfunction. Sensory alterations and a positive Las ègue's sign could be demonstrated in only one-half of the patients studied. Four of 5 patients developed intermittent neurogenic claudication, with varying evidence of painful radiculopathy. The marked disability caused by claudication contrasted sharply with the lesser neurological changes, and these patients required early surgical decompression. Diagnostic studies included electromyography, plain x-ray films, tomography, computed tomographic scanning, and myelography. The latter outlined a relative stenosis caused by olisthesis as well as arthrotic and spondylotic changes that determined the extent of decompressive operation required. The L-4, L-5 interspace was involved in 56 patients, L-3, L-4 was involved in 2, and L-5, S-1 was involved in 2. The ideal operation with L-4, L-5 olisthesis included complete laminectomy of L-4 and L-5 with unroofing of the lateral recesses and foraminotomy. This more extensive procedure was justified because of the failures encountered in previous patients in whom inadequate decompression had been performed. Among failures, obesity, diabetes, hyperlordosis, and extensive long-standing dysfunction were prominent. The relief of symptoms of intermittent neurogenic claudication was the most gratifying response observed. There was no unusual morbidity."

Median nerve SEPs were always compared with the results of SEPs after stimulation of at least one other nerve relevant to the site of the lesion as suspected clinically and electromyographically. All patients presented with unilateral brachial plexus problems and all root lesions were verified by clinical presentation, EMG studies, myelogram or surgery. There were 19 brachial plexus injuries, 13 cases with cervical spondylopathic radiculopaties without myelopathy and 7 patients presented brachial plexopathy with systemic cancer. It was found that median nerve SEPs were always normal in injuries of upper trunk and root avulsions confined to one or two root levels. Median nerve SEPs were abnormal in multiple trunk lesions and multiple root avulsions. In patients with spondylopathic radiculopathies median nerve SEPs were normal apart from one case where involvement of multiple roots was present. Median nerve SEPs were useful in assessing patients presenting brachial plexus problems in the presence of systematic cancer apart from cases where lower trunk involvement was present. In general, median nerve SEPs are useful if they are combined with SEP testing of other nerves anatomically more closely related to the problem as outlined clinically and electromyographically."

Data from the National Swedish Register for lumbar spinal surgery between 2001 and 2002 were used and, in addition, a comparison between our cohort and a Swedish EQ-5D population survey was performed. We analysed the pre- and post-operative quality of life data, age, gender, smoking habits, pain and walking capacity. The mean age of the patients was 42 years (20 to 66); 155 (59%) were men and 69 (26%) smoked. Pre-operatively, 72 (17%) could walk at least 1 km compared with 200 (76%) postoperatively. The mean EQ-5D score improved from 0.29 to 0.70, and the HRQOL improved in 195 (74%) of the patients. The pre-operative score did not influence the post-operative score. In most patients, all five EQ-5D dimensions improved, but did not reach the level reported by an age- and gender-matched population sample (mean difference 0.17). Predictors for poor outcome were smoking, a short pre-operative walking distance, and a long history of back pain."

All patients in this study were treated nonoperatively for radicular pain and neurologic loss. The following questions were addressed: 1) Does perithecal or perineural fibrosis result when extrusions are not removed surgically, and 2) Do disc extrusions spontaneously resolve, and, if so, how rapidly? The study population consisted of 11 patients with extrusions and radiculopathy. All patients were successfully treated nonoperatively. All had a primary complaint of leg pain and all had positive straight leg raising reproducing their leg pain at less than or equal to 60 degrees. Additionally, 87% had muscle weakness on a neurologic basis in a root level distribution corresponding to the site of disc pathology. Computed tomographic (CT) examinations were obtained on all patients at the inception of treatment. These studies were compared with follow-up MRI studies. The initial CT scans were evaluated for the following criteria: disc size and position, thecal sac effacement, nerve root enlargement or displacement, and evidence of central or intervertebral canal stenosis. In addition to the pathomorphology evaluated on the CT scans, follow-up MRI studies also evaluated disc hydration at the herniated and contiguous levels, and the presence of perithecal or perineural fibrosis. The following grading system was used to evaluate change in fragment size on the follow-up studies: Grade 1-0 to 50% decrease in size; Grade 2-50 to 75% decrease in size; Grade 3-75 to 100% decrease in size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Nineteen of the 33 patients with a re-prolapse presented with persistent or recurrent sciatica within 1 year of their first operation. The other 14 patients presented with a late re-prolapse (after 1 year) and their clinical outcome was better than for those patients with an early re-prolapse (12/14 vs 11/19 satisfactory result, respectively).

There were 88 subjects: 53 normals, 17 L-5, and 18 S-1 radiculopathy subjects. The clinical EDBR revealed a 91% specificity, with 18% sensitivity for L-5, and 11% for S-1. The electrodiagnostic EDBR yielded increased sensitivities of 35% for L-5 (P = 0.07) and 39% for S-1 (P = 0.04), with 87% specificity. H-reflexes showed 50% sensitivity for the S-1 group (P = 0.0006) and 91% specificity. EDBR latencies were significantly related to age and leg length (r2 = 0.46, P < 0.0001). Age alone explained 26% (P < 0.0001) of the EDBR variability and leg length 20% (P < 0.0001).

Neurophysiological studies suggested subclinical PNS involvement in 6 additional patients (3 with distal axonal polyneuropathy, 1 with probable myopathy and superimposed polyneuropathy, 1 with trigeminal neuropathy, and 1 with focal ulnar neuropathy). Even though subjective muscular complaints were numerous (16 patients, 50%), a defined primary muscular disease could be demonstrated only in 5 patients (16%). Our results indicate that peripheral neuropathy in scleroderma is not as uncommon as previously estimated."

CD007431,0,12489347,0,Changes in alpha-motoneuron excitability with positions that tension neural tissue.,"The slump test assesses the contribution of neural tissue to the referred symptoms associated with spinal pain and musculo-skeletal injuries of the lower limb. The limitation to full range of movement in performing this test has, in the past, been attributed to a mechanical restriction in mobility of neural tissue. Recent literature suggests that the limitation may be caused by protective reflex muscle action. The purpose of this study was to establish whether the slump test was associated with an increase or a decrease in excitability of alpha-motoneurons and, therefore, an alteration in muscle activity at the end of the range of movement of the test. Forty-three normal subjects and eight subjects with abnormal neural tension participated in this study. Changes in alpha-motoneuron excitability in neck flexion, moderate slump, and maximum slump positions were assessed by observing changes in H-reflex recruitment curves. Linear regression analysis on the rising portion of the H-reflex recruitment curve enabled calculation of the dependent variable Hslp for statistical analysis. Normal subjects in the moderate and maximum slump positions demonstrated a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the slope of the H-reflex recruitment curve. Subjects with abnormal neural tension showed a non-significant increase in slope when in these positions. Subject flexibility had a significant influence on motoneuron excitability in the moderate neural tension position with inflexible subjects demonstrating a significant inhibition of motoneurons. The difference between the flexible or moderately flexible subjects and inflexible subjects was not significant in the maximum neural tension position. These findings have important implications for the rationale for treatment selection and success of treatment outcomes in the clinical setting."

Analysis of clinical and radiographic findings in 43 cases.,"This study is based on 43 cases of lumbar spinal stenosis-37 involving the spinal canal and 6 involving isolated radicular canals. The clinical features are analysed, also the radiographic investigations currently used in the investigation of this pathological condition. Three distinct clinical syndromes are differentiated; continuous (acute or chronic), intermittent, combined. The last is the most frequent type. All the patients with stenosis of the canal showed significant radiographic changes, the most frequent being total or subtotal block on myelography with posterior impingement on the dural sac. In stenosis of the radicular canal the affected root was either displaced medially or cut off (amputated). Computerised tomography gives less precise results than radiculography."
CD007431,0,981929,0,[Arthrotic sciatica caused by radicular compression of osteophytic origin in the lateral recess.

The authors study the clinical and radiological characteristics that may indicate the diagnosis and discuss the different mechanisms by which vertebral arthrosis can lead to radicular compression. When surgery is necessary because of the persistent nature of the sciatica, a broader approach should be undertaken than that required for excision of the disc, in order to explore fully the roots, the multiplicity of possible compression sites being one of the essential characteristics of these cases of arthrosic radiculopathy. Study of the literature and of the series of sciatica patients operated upon by the authors shows that although discal hernia is far from being the most frequent cause of common sciatica, arthrosic compression is a cause that cannot be ignored, especially in aged subjects."

CD007431,0,8800224,0,Estimating mechanical parameters of leg segments in individuals with and without physical disabilities.,"Methods are described for estimating the inertia, viscosity, and stiffness of the lower leg around the knee and of the whole leg around the hip that are applicable even to persons with considerable spasticity. These involve: 1) a ""pull"" test in which the limb is slowly moved throughout its range of motion while measuring angles (with an electrogoniometer) and torques (with a hand-held dynamometer) to determine passive stiffness and 2) a ""pendulum"" test in which the limb is moved against gravity and then dropped, while again measuring angles and torques. By limiting the extent of the movement and choosing a direction (flexion or extension) that minimizes reflex responses, the mechanical parameters can be determined accurately and efficiently using computer programs. In the sample of subjects studied (nine with disability related to spinal cord injury, head injury, or stroke, and nine with no neurological disability), the inertia of the lower leg was significantly reduced in the subjects with disability (p < 0.05) as a result of atrophy, but the stiffness and viscosity were within normal limits. The values of inertia were also compared with anthropometric data in the literature. The identification of these passive parameters is particularly important in designing systems for functional electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles, but the methods may be widely applicable in rehabilitation medicine."
CD007431,0,4021986,0,Lumbar spinal-lateral recess stenosis.,"The syndrome of a lumbar spinal and lateral recess stenosis is characterized by pain and a variety of paresthetic symptoms occurring principally when the patient stands or walks. Sitting or lying down alleviate the symptoms promptly. The neurologic examination is characterized by a negative straight leg-raising test and a paucity of abnormal neurologic findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by a high-resolution CT scan. If conservative treatment fails, a myelogram is in order to establish a definitive diagnosis and assess the severity of neural compression prior to placing the indication for a surgical decompression of the stenotic spinal canal. The surgical procedure consists of a laminectomy and a partial facetectomy of the hypertrophied portion of the facet joint that compresses the adjacent lumbar nerve root from a dorsal direction. It is important to recognize all associated pathologic processes that must be dealt with accordingly at the same time in order to assure success of the operative procedure. The results of a surgical decompression for a lumbar spinal and lateral recess stenosis are excellent."

These patients were divided into two groups, i.e., non-positivisation and positivisation group. In the former, positive wave ratio was highest at the L5/S upon stimulating the peroneal nerve. In the latter, the positivisation at the L4/5 upon stimulating the peroneal nerve spread not only to the cranial level but also to the caudal-L5/S level. Based on these experimental results, the factors causing positivisation in the L5/S level without lesion were: 1) curving effect of the L5 nerve root, 2) augmentation of current density within the spinal canal and 3) the amount of individual impulses propagating along the L5 and S1 root."
CD007431,0,2972071,0,Annular protrusion: pathophysiology and roentgenographic appearance.,"The degenerative changes of the lumbar spine in 100 patients with symptomatic low-back pain were reviewed using plain roentgenograms and computed tomographic scans in order to determine the relationship between degeneration and annular protrusion. Additionally, the lumbar spinal units of 25 fresh cadavers were roentgenographed, injected with a mixture of methylene blue and renografin-60, dissected, and studied. The state of degeneration of each of the intervertebral units of both groups was graded on a four-point scale based on the roentgenographic presence or absence of osteophytes and facet joint changes, and the intervertebral disc height. The degree of annular protrusion was measured by dividing the anteroposterior diameter of the intervertebral disc by the anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral plate as determined on the radiographic studies. In the clinical group, 39 intervertebral discs having Grade II and III degeneration exhibited a statistically higher annular/vertebral diameter ratio (A/V index) of 1.30 as compared to the normal invertebral discs, with an A/V index of 1.12 (P less than 0.001). The dissection of the disc spaces of the cadavers with radiographic evidence of disc space narrowing and marginal osteophytosis, Grade II and III degeneration, displayed significant interruption and tearing of the annular fibers and peripheral migration of collagenized nuclear fragments. In both the clinical and pathologic groups, there was a direct correlation between the size of the annular bulge, as indicated in the A/V index, and the degree of narrowing of the disc space. Therefore, this study indicated that annular protrusion is an intricate part of the degeneration process."
CD007431,0,10853164,0,Epidural corticosteroid injection in the conservative management of sciatica.,"In this prospective randomized clinical trial, the results of epidural corticosteroid injections were evaluated in patients with lumbosciatic pain caused by herniated nucleus pulposus. Thirty-six patients with radicular lumbosciatic pain and positive straight leg raising test because of confirmed prolapsed intervertebral lumbar discs were randomized into two groups with (17 patients) and without (19 patients) epidural corticosteroid injection. Members of the treatment groups received three injections of 100 mg methylprednisolone in 10 mL bupivacaine 0.25% each. Additional therapy was standardized and identical in both groups. Followup examinations were performed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months. The examinations included pain level (visual analogue scale), straight leg raising test, and functional status (Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire). At 2 weeks, patients receiving methylprednisolone injection showed a significant improvement in straight leg raising test results compared with patients in the control group. Results were better in the methylprednisolone group, although not statistically significant for pain relief and mobility. At 6 weeks and 6 months, pain relief, improvement of straight leg raising, and improvement of functional status showed no statistical significance. Epidural corticosteroid injections can be recommended as additional therapy only in the acute phase of the conservative management of lumbosciatic pain."

Preoperatively and 3 and 6 months after surgery, patients were assessed on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and on a visual analogue scale (VAS) for the subjective perception of pain. At 3 and 12 months, we found that patients with lower SDS scores (n=41) had a better outcome regarding pain than patients with relevant depressive symptoms (n=32). In agreement with the literature, our results confirm the negative role of depression in outcome after lumbar disc surgery. We emphasize the consideration of psychological factors in the management of lumbar disc herniation."

CT is now used to detect lesions formerly difficult to diagnose, such as subluxation, arthrosis, facet osteophytes, and stenosis of the vertebral canal, as well as herniated disks and lateral disks. The findings in over 1,000 patients examined by CT for lumbosacral spinal pathology are documented.

CD007431,0,11812711,0,Epidural infusion pressure in degenerative spinal disease before and after epidural steroid therapy.,"The analgesic mechanism of epidural steroids in reducing pain associated with degenerative spinal disease (DSD) is poorly understood. We report increased inline epidural infusion pressure in patients with DSD and assess whether this phenomenon is affected by administration of an epidural steroid injection. We collected data during epidural placement for routine surgery or epidural steroid therapy. Using a 17-gauge Tuohy needle, with patients in the right lateral decubitus position, loss of resistance to 2 mL of saline identified the epidural space. Two minutes later the needle was attached to saline-filled tubing connected to a pressure transducer (Baxter PX 260 pressure monitoring kit with Truwave TM disposable pressure transducer). In the first part of the study, 4 successive boluses of 3 mL of local anesthetic were administered at a rate of 6 mL/min to 15 patients (age 47 +/- 6 yrs) with radicular back pain and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) evidence of DSD, and to 8 control patients with no history of back pain (age 44 +/- 5 yr) while inline epidural infusion pressure was measured. In the second part of the study 44 patients with low back pain and MRI or CT evidence of DSD presenting to the pain clinic were infused with 8 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine and 40 mg of methylprednisolone (20 mg/mL) at a rate of 6 mL/min while inline epidural infusion pressure was measure and recorded. This was repeated 3 wk later. Initially, DSD patients had significantly increased infusion pressures over normals, which most likely reflects outflow resistance or obstruction. A significant decrease in inline epidural infusion pressure was observed after epidural steroid treatment. This change in pressure may indicate efficacy from epidural steroid injection."
CD007431,0,2925709,0,Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the knee. Treatment using continuous epidural anesthesia.,"We retrospectively reviewed the cases of fourteen patients who had reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the knee. All fourteen were hospitalized, and epidural block anesthesia was instituted with an indwelling catheter for an average of four days, during which continuous passive motion, manipulation (as necessary), stimulation of muscles, and alternating hot and cold soaks were used. The average length of follow-up was thirty-two months. Eleven patients had complete resolution of the symptoms, two had sufficient intermittent aching with changes in the weather to need medication, and one had no relief. The diagnosis was confirmed if the symptoms were relieved by a lumbar sympathetic block. Pain that was out of proportion to the severity of the injury was the most consistent finding, being present in all fourteen patients. However, variation in clinical severity is characteristic of the syndrome. Eleven of the fourteen patients had had a previous patellar operation. After the onset of the symptoms, nine patients had two or more arthroscopic examinations, without notable findings. All fourteen patients had had extensive physical therapy and medical treatment before the epidural block was performed."
CD007431,0,11430790,0,Isokinetic evaluation of the ankle before and after surgical treatment of the lumbar disc herniation.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the ankle strength before and after surgical treatment for herniated lumbar intervertebral disc. DESIGN: Isokinetic test of ankle joint and statistical analysis were designed to evaluate the results before and after surgery. BACKGROUND: Assessments of the results before and after treatment of lumbar herniation of intervertebral discs (HIVD) in previous papers were all based on patients' symptoms, activity, working condition, the angle of straight leg raising test, and requirement of pain medication. We designed a prospective study of isokinetic measurement of the ankle joints in those patients with HIVD to try to find a quantitative method of evaluation. METHODS: The criteria of selecting patients were single level disc herniation of lumber spine, without associated major neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorder, normal mental status and cooperative, clinically evident radiculopathy, failure of conservative treatment, and age under 45. The isokinetic strengths of the ankle joints, of both involved and uninvolved limbs, were evaluated with plantarflexion or dorsiflexion, in the velocities of 30, 60, 120, and 180 degrees s(-1), according to their affected levels. Standard laminotomy with removal of intervertebral disc was undertaken for all patients under general anesthesia. The isokinetic strength of the ankle joints were evaluated with Kin-Com dynamometer before surgery, and post-operatively at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months, and 3 months. All data were collected and analyzed with linear mixed model for analysis of variance with repeated measures. RESULTS: From January, 1996, 5 patients entered this study, 2 patients were L4-L5 herniation, and 3 for L5-S1. The estimated mean strength ratio and standard error was 55.04 +/- 2.21% preoperatively, 46.42 +/- 2.22% postoperatively at 1 week, 64.35 +/- 2.23% postoperatively at 2 weeks, 73.93 +/- 2.23% postoperatively at 4 weeks, 100.40 +/- 2.22% postoperatively at 2 months, and 104.55 +/- 2.21% postoperatively at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary prospective study, there seems no correlation between duration of the symptoms and isokinetic strength of the ankle joint. There is, however, marked improvement of isokinetic strength of ankle joint postoperatively at 2 months, which was statistically significant."
CD007431,0,16133074,0,Intervertebral disc degeneration in relation to the COL9A3 and the IL-1ss gene polymorphisms.,"Disc degeneration is a complex condition in which environmental factors and multiple genes are expected to act together to determine the degenerative phenotype. Recently associations of COL9A2 (Trp2 allele) and COL9A3 (Trp3 allele) polymorphisms with lumbar disc disease characterized by sciatica have been reported. However, it is not known whether the Trp2 or Trp3 alleles contribute to disc degeneration (DD). In this study, the association between the collagen genes polymorphisms and lumbar DD was investigated. Furthermore, the influence of the IL-1beta(C(3954)-T) polymorphism on the association of collagen genes polymorphisms with DD was examined. Lumbar intervertebral discs of 135 middle-aged occupationally active men were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, using decreased signal intensity of the nucleus pulposus, disc bulges, and decreased disc height as signs of degeneration. Blood samples were analysed for the presence of COL9A3 and COL9A2 tryptophan alleles (Trp3 and Trp2 alleles). The COL11A2, COL2A1 and IL-1beta(C(3954)-T) polymorphisms were also analysed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis allowing for occupation and body mass index showed that the carriage of the Trp3 allele in the absence of the IL-1betaT(3954) allele increased the risk of dark nucleus pulposus (OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.3-38.8) and joint occurrence of degenerative changes (OR 8.0, 95% CI 1.4-44.7). There was no effect of the Trp3 allele on DD in the presence of the IL-1betaT(3954) allele. The carriers of the COL11A2 minor allele had an increased risk of disc bulges (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0-4.2) as compared with non-carriers. The results suggest that the effect of the COL9A3 gene polymorphism on DD might be modified by the IL-1beta gene polymorphism."

There has been no direct prospective comparison, however, between SCS and other techniques for pain management. Therefore, we have designed a prospective, randomized comparison of spinal cord stimulation and reoperation in patients with persistent radicular pain, with and without low back pain, after lumbosacral spine surgery. Patients selected for reoperation by standard criteria are randomly assigned to initial treatment by one or the other technique. The primary outcome measure is the frequency of crossover to the alternative procedure, if the results of the first have been unsatisfactory after 6 months. Results for the first 27 patients reaching the 6-month crossover point show a statistically significant (p = 0.018) advantage for spinal cord stimulation over reoperation. Many other potentially important outcome measures will now be followed long-term as a larger overall study population accumulates."

CD007431,0,11293373,0,Predicting factors of successful recovery from lumbar spine surgery among workers' compensation patients.,"It is commonly believed that patients who are compensated for a work-related injury have less incentive to return to work. This study evaluated how various factors affected the outcomes of lumbar spine surgery in terms of pain relief, functional status, return to work, and general health. Eighty-seven workers' compensation patients had spinal fusion or microdiskectomy. Subjects were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively using the Oswestry disability scale and the Visual Analog Scale for Pain. The type of surgery performed significantly affected patient outcomes, while such factors as gender, age, smoking, and litigation were insignificant. Microdiskectomy patients, for example, had greater reduction in pain and disability than did fusion patients (P < .01). Return-to-work status was negatively affected by fusion (P < .01). Overall, 55% of patients did return to work in some capacity, but the rate was 72% for microdiskectomy patients versus 43% for fusion patients. While outcomes significantly improved, postoperative scores remained severe. This did not correlate with return-to-work rates, suggesting that outcomes measures may not be effective."

CD007431,0,14526194,0,Posterior lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative disc disease using a minimally invasive B-twin expandable spinal spacer: a multicenter study.,"Acquired degenerative disc disease causes gradual disc space collapse, concurrent discogenic or facet-induced pain, and possible compression radiculopathy. Surgical treatment aims to re-expand the intervertebral space and stabilize the involved segment in balanced alignment until fusion is complete. The prevailing methods make use of a twin cage device of predetermined size. Their implantation requires extensive exposure, entailing the sacrifice of posterior stabilizing structures. The procedure also results in significant traction on the dural sac and the cauda equina and is thereby a potential source of neurologic damage. The new expandable spinal spacer (ESS) was designed to mitigate all the shortcomings alluded to above. A prospective multicenter clinical study was conducted of 87 patients with chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease, treated by posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using a newly designed ESS. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of all the participating institutions. The objective was to test the safety and efficacy of the device. Each participant was followed periodically for >1 postoperative year. The ongoing record included intraoperative difficulties and complications, if any, radiologic evidence of fusion and clinical outcome as scored by pre- and postoperative questionnaires pertaining to pain intensity and degree of disability. No dural lacerations or neurologic deficit occurred. There were no mechanical failures of the spacer. Radiologic study demonstrated fusion in all but one patient. Disc space height that averaged 7.53 +/- 2.42 mm before surgery increased to 10.03 +/- 2.00 mm at the time of surgery and stabilized at 9.47 +/- 2.10 mm upon final follow-up. Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Index decreased by 60% and 58%, respectively. PLIF using the ESS achieves the same ultimate outcome as do other methods currently in use but does not share the handicaps and hazards and is more user-friendly to the surgeon."

The aim of the study was to establish normal values for L3, L4, L5 and S1 dermatomes and to introduce this method for the neurophysiological diagnosis of chronic lumbosacral pain and disc disease. The signature areas of dermatomes in both legs separately were stimulated according to the method described by Sedgwick and Katifi (1985). DSEPs were recorded from the scalp electrodes placed at Cz', referred to Fpz. The latencies and amplitudes of consecutive components of DSEPs: N33, P40, N50, P60, N75 and side to side differences were measured and evaluated. Statistical analysis of the results revealed significant positive correlation of DSEPs latencies as a function of height. The correlation of amplitudes with height was less significant. Age, on other hand, showed only negative correlation with amplitudes of later DSEP components. On the basis of the performed analysis the latency of P40 and amplitude of P40-N50 seem to be the best parameters for the evaluation of pathological DSEPs. The range of normal value of latencies for stimulated roots should be calculated from regression equation with the subject's height. As regards amplitude, side to side mean value difference above two standard deviation appears to be more useful."
CD007431,0,14526193,0,Prospective study evaluating total disc replacement: preliminary results.,"For many years, there has been an interest in disc replacements. There are a few retrospective studies from Europe reporting promising results for these devices. The purpose of this study is to review the preliminary results of the SB Charité disc replacement device in a prospective study. The study group consists of a consecutive series of our first 57 patients who received the Link SB Charité device implanted through a mini-open anterior approach. The primary clinical indications for disc replacement were single-level symptomatic disc disease at L4-L5 or L5-S1 and no significant facet joint changes. The outcome data include the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessing pain intensity and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire. Data were collected prior to surgery and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. Twenty-four-month follow-up data are currently being collected. The mean VAS score improved 50.8% by the 6-week follow-up, and significant improvement was maintained throughout follow-up. The mean Oswestry score improved 38.7% at the 6-week follow-up, and further slight improvement was noted during the later follow-up periods. This study found that significant improvements were achieved by the 6-week postoperative visit in the pain and disability scores following disc replacement surgery. Significant improvement was maintained through the 12-month follow-up visit. Although these preliminary results are encouraging, long-term follow-up and a greater number of patients are needed to further evaluate the outcome of these devices."
CD007431,0,14526191,0,Long-term flexion-extension range of motion of the prodisc total disc replacement.,"The rationale for total disc replacement is avoidance of the junctional degeneration seen after arthrodesis by preservation of segmental motion. To justify the use of disc prostheses, it is essential to document maintained range of motion (ROM) and sagittal alignment at long-term follow-up. This is a retrospective radiographic study of 42 patients who had placement of 58 first-generation Prodisc prostheses at a mean follow-up of 8.7 years. Flexion-extension ROM was measured by Cobb's method. Junctional levels were evaluated for junctional degeneration. Pre- and postoperative global and segmental lordosis were measured. Prognostic patient factors predicting ROM of <2 degrees were evaluated. We observed ROM of at least 2 degrees in 66% of Prodisc prostheses at 8.7-year follow-up, although ROM was less than that reported in asymptomatic normal individuals. Mean ROM for disc prostheses with motion was 7.5 degrees at L3-L4, 6.2 degrees at L4-L5, and 4.1 degrees at L5-S1. Mean ROM for all prostheses was 3.8 degrees. The incidence of radiographic junctional degeneration was 24%, although no patients required surgery for symptomatic junctional degeneration. Mean ROM of prostheses below a degenerated junctional disc was 1.6 degrees compared with 4.7 degrees below a normal junctional disc (P < 0.035). Females were 3.5 times more likely to have ROM of <2 degrees. This is the longest published follow-up study of a lumbar disc replacement. The data show that ROM is preserved at long-term follow-up in the majority of patients. Global and segmental sagittal alignment improve after surgery. Furthermore, there is an association between ROM of disc prostheses and the development of junctional degeneration."

CD007431,0,6089537,0,Electrodiagnosis of motor unit disorders.,"Electromyography and nerve stimulation studies evaluate the function of lower motor neurons, nerve roots, plexus, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junctions and muscles. Electrodiagnostic studies differentiate myopathic and neuropathic muscle weakness. No single abnormality is diagnostic for a particular disease. The combination of certain abnormal findings and their pattern of presentation in specific muscle groups, when correlated with the patient's history and clinical findings, will help to identify and localize a lesion in the motor unit pathway."
CD007431,0,8993999,0,Comparison of dermatomal SEPs and operative findings in lumbar disc disease.,"This report deals with an estimation of the diagnostic value of dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), by correlating the neurophysiological data to clinical, neuroradiological and operative findings in lumbar disc protrusion. Our material consists of 12, surgically treated patients with lumbar disc protrusion in which diagnostic work up included history, neurological examination, routine lumbar spine films, computerised tomography and MRI of the lumbar spine, in addition to neurophysiological investigation, especially conduction velocity studies, and SEPs recorded by the standard methods, as well as after dermatomal stimulation. The retrospective analysis disclosed a correlation for the SEPs after dermatomal stimulation and surgical findings, in 83% of our cases."
