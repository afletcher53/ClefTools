CD012083,0,18071718,0,Role of cyanoacrylate in the management of low fistula in ano: a prospective study.,"Fistulotomy has remained the gold standard in the management of fistula in ano, especially low fistula in ano. Although highly effective in the management of fistula in ano, fistulotomy is associated with considerable discomfort and incontinence. This study was designed to evaluate the role of cyanoacrylate in the management of low fistula in ano. We present our short-term results with a 6-month follow-up."

CD012083,0,26334607,0,Guidelines for the Management of a Pregnant Trauma Patient.,Physical trauma affects 1 in 12 pregnant women and has a major impact on maternal mortality and morbidity and on pregnancy outcome. A multidisciplinary approach is warranted to optimize outcome for both the mother and her fetus. The aim of this document is to provide the obstetric care provider with an evidence-based systematic approach to the pregnant trauma patient.
CD012083,0,21599942,0,Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency.,"Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (G6P deficiency), or glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI), is a group of inherited metabolic diseases, including types Ia and Ib, characterized by poor tolerance to fasting, growth retardation and hepatomegaly resulting from accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver. Prevalence is unknown and annual incidence is around 1/100,000 births. GSDIa is the more frequent type, representing about 80% of GSDI patients. The disease commonly manifests, between the ages of 3 to 4 months by symptoms of hypoglycemia (tremors, seizures, cyanosis, apnea). Patients have poor tolerance to fasting, marked hepatomegaly, growth retardation (small stature and delayed puberty), generally improved by an appropriate diet, osteopenia and sometimes osteoporosis, full-cheeked round face, enlarged kydneys and platelet dysfunctions leading to frequent epistaxis. In addition, in GSDIb, neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction are responsible for tendency towards infections, relapsing aphtous gingivostomatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Late complications are hepatic (adenomas with rare but possible transformation into hepatocarcinoma) and renal (glomerular hyperfiltration leading to proteinuria and sometimes to renal insufficiency). GSDI is caused by a dysfunction in the G6P system, a key step in the regulation of glycemia. The deficit concerns the catalytic subunit G6P-alpha (type Ia) which is restricted to expression in the liver, kidney and intestine, or the ubiquitously expressed G6P transporter (type Ib). Mutations in the genes G6PC (17q21) and SLC37A4 (11q23) respectively cause GSDIa and Ib. Many mutations have been identified in both genes,. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, on abnormal basal values and absence of hyperglycemic response to glucagon. It can be confirmed by demonstrating a deficient activity of a G6P system component in a liver biopsy. To date, the diagnosis is most commonly confirmed by G6PC (GSDIa) or SLC37A4 (GSDIb) gene analysis, and the indications of liver biopsy to measure G6P activity are getting rarer and rarer. Differential diagnoses include the other GSDs, in particular type III (see this term). However, in GSDIII, glycemia and lactacidemia are high after a meal and low after a fast period (often with a later occurrence than that of type I). Primary liver tumors and Pepper syndrome (hepatic metastases of neuroblastoma) may be evoked but are easily ruled out through clinical and ultrasound data. Antenatal diagnosis is possible through molecular analysis of amniocytes or chorionic villous cells. Pre-implantatory genetic diagnosis may also be discussed. Genetic counseling should be offered to patients and their families. The dietary treatment aims at avoiding hypoglycemia (frequent meals, nocturnal enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube, and later oral addition of uncooked starch) and acidosis (restricted fructose and galactose intake). Liver transplantation, performed on the basis of poor metabolic control and/or hepatocarcinoma, corrects hypoglycemia, but renal involvement may continue to progress and neutropenia is not always corrected in type Ib. Kidney transplantation can be performed in case of severe renal insufficiency. Combined liver-kidney grafts have been performed in a few cases. Prognosis is usually good: late hepatic and renal complications may occur, however, with adapted management, patients have almost normal life span. DISEASE NAME AND SYNONYMS: Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency or G6P deficiency or glycogen storage disease type I or GSDI or type I glycogenosis or Von Gierke disease or Hepatorenal glycogenosis."

CD012083,0,22338429,0,Spectrum of clinical presentation and surgical management of intestinal tuberculosis at tertiary care hospital.,"Tuberculosis can involve gastrointestinal tract anywhere from mouth to anus, the peritoneum and pancreatobiliary system. It has varied clinical presentations sometimes mimicking other common abdominal diseases. Tuberculosis continues to be a major problem especially in developing countries, being responsible for 7-10 million new cases and 6 per cent of deaths worldwide annually. Objective was to assess and evaluate various clinical presentations and management of intestinal tuberculosis at Liaquat University Hospital, Jamshoro/Hyderabad."
CD012083,0,10402774,0,Aortic valve replacement after retrosternal gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer.,"A 59-year-old man with a history of the thoraco-abdominal esophagus resection with retrosternal gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer complicated by anastomosis leakage and purulent pericarditis was admitted for aortic regurgitation due to infective endocarditis. Floppy vegetation and worsening cardiac failure indicated aortic valve replacement. In a median sternotomy approach, the thickest adhesion between the cervical esophagus and posterior surface of the manubrium sternae was freed using an ultrasonic osteotome. Severe adhesions in the pericardium due to purulent pericarditis were found. Median sternotomy enabled minimal exposure of the aortic root, upper right atrium, and right superior pulmonary vein for instituting extracorporeal circulation and replacing the aortic valve. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. For cardiac surgery in patients with a retrosternal gastric tube, left anterior or right thoracotomy may be considered to avoid gastric tube injury. Median sternotomy, however, is an alternative enabling safe heart exposure, and the ultrasonic osteotome was very useful in incising the sternum without injuring the cervical esophagus, which had no serosa."

CD012083,0,10786985,0,Multiple gastrointestinal atresias with cystic dilatation of the biliary duct.,"A term newborn developed signs and symptoms of an upper-intestinal obstruction. A palpable transverse upper-abdominal mass was identified. An ultrasound examination demonstrated a cystic mass with massive dilatation of the biliary tree. At laparotomy, dozens of segmental intestinal atresias (IA) from the jejunum to the rectum were identified. The cystic mass was the duodenum, obstructed distally from the atresias and proximally from an antral web. The biliary dilatation was due to normal drainage into a closed-loop duodenal obstruction, and was relieved by division of the web. The multiple atresias were explored, but establishment of intestinal continuity was impossible. The entity of multiple segmental IAs in association with cystic biliary dilation has been previously described, but there are no recorded survivors; 35 patients have been reported in the world literature. Our patient was the longest survivor; she finally died after 2 years of gastrostomy-tube drainage and total parenteral nutrition while awaiting intestinal transplantation. Only 5 patients other than ours had documented immune-system abnormalities. We review the findings and management of this rare syndrome."
CD012083,0,16728304,0,Esophageal Doppler monitoring for hemodynamic assessment.,This article reviews the importance of hemodynamic monitoring in adding to the clinical assessment of critically ill patients. The esophageal Doppler monitor (EDM) provides a less invasive way of obtaining hemodynamic information quickly and safely at the bedside. The concepts of Doppler signal acquisition and important nursing considerations are reviewed. Case studies are provided to understand how data from the EDM can impact patient care decisions at the bedside.
CD012083,0,21229692,0,[Case of tracheal agenesis found during surgery].,"We reported a case of tracheal agenesis (TA) that was diagnosed during surgery. A female infant, weighing 1,104 g, was born at the 29 weeks of gestation. She showed severe respiratory distress without crying. Oxygenation was improved by mask ventilation, but tracheal intubation was very difficult. Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) was suspected because significant amount of air from nasogastric tube was noticed. Physical examination and X-ray findings suggested Gross E type TEF, duodenal atresia and cloaca. On the second day of life, ligation of TEE gastrostomy and colostomy were scheduled. Although operation was started without problems, ventilation became impossible when TEF was clamped and release of clamping made it possible. Bronchoscopic investigation revealed that tracheal tube was located in the esophagus. We have never doubted the esophageal intubation, because patient was ventilated preoperatively and signs of respiratory distress syndrome were successfully treated by the surfactant replacement therapy through tracheal tube. Type II TA according to Floyd's classification was diagnosed by bronchoscopic and echographic investigations. Distal esophageal ligation, gastrostomy and esophagostomy were performed. She died on the 12th day of life in spite of vigorous ventilatory and cardiovascular support."
CD012083,0,23154229,0,"Direct thrombin inhibitors: a case indicating benefit from 'plasmapheresis' in toxicity: a call for establishing ""guidelines"" in overdose and to find an ""antidote""!","Patient presented with passage of fresh blood mixed with clots per rectum. In the ER, she was found to have bright red blood per rectum with clots, with frank blood on nasogastric tube. She was on dabigatran for atrial fibrillation and aspirin, with intermittent intake of ibuprofen. Vitals were positive for orthostatic hypotension. The pertinent findings in the physical examination were altered mental status with orientation*1, weak peripheral pulses, irregularly irregular heart rate, and bilateral pitting edema 2+ in bilateral lower extremities. Patient was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. A massive transfusion protocol was followed. Laboratories and imaging: hemoglobin/hematocrit, 7.2/22.1; white blood cells, 7.7, platelet, 210; international normalized ratio, 2.5; prothrombin time, 19.2; activated partial thromboplastin time, 88.2; CMP was WNL; BNP, 621; fibrinogen, 500 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with inferolateral ischemia. Ultrasonography of the liver and gallbladder showed no acute pathology. Echocardiogram showed an EF of 70% with hyperdynamic LV. Patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Dabigatran, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were discontinued, and antihypertensives were held. She was given blood and FFPs. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and coagulation profile was monitored every 6 hours. Gastroenterology, general surgery, interventional radiology, and hematology services were called stat. IR placed a double-lumen, power central venous catheter. In gastroenterology, EGD and colonoscopy was performed, which showed active bleed at distal esophagus, stopped with local epinephrine. No active bleed seen on colonoscopy. The patient was put on Nexium drip. Hematology service recommended thrombin time (>200) and factors 2, 5, 7, 9, 10-41(l), 80, 68, 48(l), 61. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time mixing studies were done, which indicated the presence of thrombin inhibition. Prothrombin complex concentrate at 50 U/kg was started to reverse the effect of dabigatran, and platelets were transfused to reverse the effect of aspirin. They also discussed that the half-life of dabigatran being 17 hours, and the drug would not be toxic at this point, as the patient was already 24-hour inpatient by now. The hemoglobin trend: 7.4→6.4→8.2→7.5→6.6. At this point, the need for further intervention in form of hemodialysis or plasmapheresis was considered. The patient was given plasmapheresis and hemoglobin and hematocrit stabilized. The patient was kept on continued mechanical ventilator support for the night and extubated next day. The hemodynamics stabilized and the patient was transferred to the general medical floors after 1 day of observation, after extubation."
CD012083,0,8827577,0,The movements of fetuses with congenital myotonic dystrophy in utero.,"The movements in two fetuses with congenital myotonic dystrophy were recorded on fetal actocardiograms. The two fetuses showed gross movements associated with FHR accelerations as normal fetus. One of them showed swallowing on amniofetogram, and hiccuping on fetal actocardiogram. Both, however, were extremely hypotonic and neither displayed any gross movement, respiratory movement or swallowing postnatally. Intubation and nasal feeding were required for a long period of time after birth in both cases. The buoyancy of amniotic fluid may help the affected fetus to make gross movement in utero."
CD012083,0,9456966,0,Recognition of intussusception around gastrojejunostomy tubes in children.,We describe antegrade intussusceptions of duodenum and jejunum around gastrojejunostomy tubes seen on sonography and fluoroscopic contrast tube studies. Reduction of the intussusception was achieved by bolus injection of air or contrast medium through the tube or exchange over a wire.
CD012083,0,12018723,0,Fatal aortoesophageal fistula in two cases of tight vascular ring.,"Vascular rings are rare vascular congenital anomalies causing oesophageal and tracheal compression. An aortoesophageal fistula is a devastating, in part iatrogenic, complication of vascular rings. It is seen with increasing frequency, and can be misleading, since differential diagnosis with other causes of haematemesis and melaena is often difficult, especially in infants. We report two infants with aortoesophageal fistulas secondary to double aortic arches forming a vascular ring. In both, the diagnosis was missed, and massive haemorrhage led to death. In both cases, the fissuration on the oesophageal and aortic sides of the fistula had sharp edges, highly suggestive of an iatrogenic laceration caused by manipulation of nasogastric tubes. The key for the diagnosis of vascular rings is, therefore, clinical suspicion and awareness of this condition. Prompt identification in infants with stridor, wheezing, or respiratory distress can prevent prolonged intubation, thus avoiding the formation of an aortoesophageal fistula and hopefully preventing a fatal outcome."
CD012083,0,19321900,0,"Methods for the assessment of gastric emptying in critically ill, enterally fed adults.","Critically ill patients may experience delayed gastric emptying. Patients receiving enteral feeding are monitored closely to detect a delay of gastric emptying, assess feeding tolerance, and prevent aspiration pneumonia. The most common practice for assessing gastric emptying is to measure the aspirated gastric residual volume; however, this is an unreliable method that lacks standardization, fails to differentiate normal digestive secretions from enteral formula, and results in unnecessary interruptions of enteral nutrition. The aim of this review is to identify an alternative method to assess gastric emptying, which should be reliable, sensitive, harmless, feasible, and inexpensive. Several techniques are discussed: scintigraphy, paracetamol absorption test, breath tests, refractometry, ultrasound, and gastric impedance monitoring. Refractometry seems to be the most appropriate tool for the regular assessment of enteral nutrition; however, standardization and validation of this method are needed before it can be routinely used to monitor critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition."
CD012083,0,10914772,0,Endoscopic placement of Sengstaken-Blakemore tube.,"A Sengstaken-Blakemore (SB) tube, when used approximately, still has a place in the management of acute variceal bleeding. Due to a number of reported complications from the misplacement of this tube, an x-ray localization before full inflation of the gastric balloon is recommended as the standard of care. Here, we report a new technique of SB tube placement with endoscopic confirmation in three patients. This technique is easy, accurate, and can be performed in any unit where a patient with variceal bleeding can be managed. Because it cuts down on the need for an x-ray or ultrasound confirmation, this technique may well become the ""standard of care"" among the practicing gastroenterologists."
CD012083,0,18322883,0,Severe paraneoplastic gastroparesis associated with anti-Hu antibodies preceding the manifestation of small-cell lung cancer.,"Gastroparesis is a common but challenging disorder which can be idiopathic or induced by a variety of underlying diseases, most frequently by diabetes, or post-surgical conditions of the upper abdomen. Clinicians must also consider rare causes of gastric motor dysfunction, such as collagen vascular disorders and paraneoplastic syndromes. Here we present the case of a patient with severe gastroparesis, who was admitted to our hospital for vomiting and weight loss of 25 kg within four months. Endoscopy showed a dilated fluid-filled stomach without peristalsis but no obstruction. High titres of anti-Hu antibodies were detected in patient's serum, supporting the diagnosis of severe paraneoplastic gastroparesis with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Fine-needle aspiration of suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes guided by endoscopic ultrasound revealed lymphatic metastases of a small-cell lung carcinoma. Jejunal tube feeding and chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide were initiated. Paraneoplastic gastrointestinal dysmotility is rare, however, clinicians should consider this differential diagnosis in otherwise unexplained gastrointestinal motor dysfunction. The pathophysiology of paraneoplastic gastroparesis, the diagnostic relevance of anti-Hu antibodies as well as therapeutic options are discussed."
CD012083,0,7710796,0,Percutaneous gastrostomy guided by ultrasound and fluoroscopy.,"Percutaneous gastrostomy, utilizing a dedicated catheterization kit, with a combination of ultrasonographic (US) and fluoroscopic guidance, was carried out in 27 patients. The main indication for gastrostomy was the need for nutritional support in malignant esophageal stricture. After distending the stomach with water via a nasogastric tube, the gastric antrum was punctured under US guidance and a guide wire was inserted, followed by fluoroscopically guided tract dilatation and insertion of a 2.5-mm Cope-loop catheter. In all patients but one (96%) the procedure was successfully completed in one or 2 attempts. Two complications occurred: one case of a small subcutaneous abscess near the puncture site, and one late incident of dislodgement of a catheter without string-loop fixation, which had been inserted at a catheter exchange after 6 weeks. Percutaneous gastrostomy guided by US and fluoroscopy is a safe and efficacious alternative to endoscopic and surgical gastrostomy."
CD012083,0,25188737,0,Hypervitaminosis A causing hypercalcemia in cystic fibrosis. Case report and focused review.,"Hypercalcemia is a rare complication of hypervitaminosis A. We report a pediatric patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency who was found to have hypervitaminosis A causing hypercalcemia, complicated by nephrocalcinosis and renal impairment. The patient is a 4-year-old girl with pancreatic-insufficient CF, gastroesophageal reflux, oral aversion, and failure to thrive requiring gastrostomy tube placement. She was prescribed Source CF vitamins, but rarely received the full dose, due to emesis and intolerance. She had routine annual labs that revealed hypercalcemia with elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, which were not present in her previous annual labs. Upon further questioning, her mother reported that she seemed more fatigued for a few weeks, had abdominal pain, and was urinating more frequently. Upon admission to the hospital, laboratory results revealed elevated HCO3, while serum levels of potassium, phosphorus, and albumin were within normal limits. Vitamin D (25-hydroxy) level was low, and vitamin A level was elevated. Extensive metabolic and hormonal workup for the etiology of the hypercalcemia revealed evidence of chronic renal insufficiency and elevated vitamin A levels. She had a renal ultrasound that revealed bilateral nephrocalciosis. Diagnosis of chronic hypervitaminosis A complicated by hypercalcemia was made and was managed by holding vitamin A supplements, aggressive diuresis, and prednisolone. This case emphasizes the importance of regular vitamin A monitoring in patients with CF. There is a wide variability for the lowest intake required to cause toxicity, and the lower limit to cause toxicity has not been determined."
CD012083,0,19769822,0,Improvement in otitis media with effusion in patients undergoing tracheostomy after prolonged endotracheal intubation.,Otitis media with effusion (OME) has a higher incidence in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients. This observational study sought to examine the effect of tracheostomy on OME in critically ill patients and explore the predisposing factors.
CD012083,0,22828845,0,Front-end receiver electronics for a matrix transducer for 3-D transesophageal echocardiography.,"There is a clear clinical need for creating 3-D images of the heart. One promising technique is the use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). To enable 3-D TEE, we are developing a miniature ultrasound probe containing a matrix piezoelectric transducer with more than 2000 elements. Because a gastroscopic tube cannot accommodate the cables needed to connect all transducer elements directly to an imaging system, a major challenge is to locally reduce the number of channels, while maintaining a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. This can be achieved by using front-end receiver electronics bonded to the transducers to provide appropriate signal conditioning in the tip of the probe. This paper presents the design of such electronics, realizing time-gain compensation (TGC) and micro-beamforming using simple, low-power circuits. Prototypes of TGC amplifiers and micro-beamforming cells have been fabricated in 0.35-μm CMOS technology. These prototype chips have been combined on a printed circuit board (PCB) to form an ultrasound-receiver system capable of reading and combining the signals of three transducer elements. Experimental results show that this design is a suitable candidate for 3-D TEE."
CD012083,0,19842192,0,Brainstem disconnection associated with nodular heterotopia and proatlantal arteries.,"We report on a patient with brainstem disconnection associated with periventricular nodular heterotopia and bilateral proatlantal intersegmental arteries. The patient was a girl born after 37 weeks of gestation with birth weight of 1,938 g. Polyhydroamnios and lack of swallowing movement were noted on fetal ultrasonography. No spontaneous body movement or respiration was observed after birth, whereas facial movement was preserved. She had marked generalized weakness and absent deep tendon reflexes. She remains alive and hospitalized at 4 years of age but requires mechanical ventilation and feeding through a gastrostomy tube. MRI showed absence of the lower pons and the medulla oblongata associated with hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres. In addition, ventriculomegaly and periventricular nodular heterotopia were observed in the cerebrum. MR angiography demonstrated the absence of vertebral arteries and presence of bilateral proatlantal intersegmental arteries arising from the external carotid arteries. Array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis did not show any genomic copy number aberrations. No mutation was found in the FLNA gene or the EN2 gene. The constellation of the malformations of our patient suggested that genes related to the development of the central nervous and vascular system may be involved in the pathogenesis of brainstem disconnection."
CD012083,0,8299328,0,Sonographic findings in gastrointestinal and peritoneal tuberculosis.,"The various ultrasound (US) findings in 90 patients with abdominal (gastrointestinal, peritoneal, mesenteric and lymph node) tuberculosis (TB) studied in an area of high incidence of TB over a 1 year period were analysed. The lesions encountered were intestinal (n = 31), extraintestinal (n = 39), or a combination (n = 20). The extraintestinal lesions included free and loculated ascites (n = 36), localized ascites ('Club Sandwich sign') (n = 4), adhesions (n = 14), peritoneal thickening (n = 14), peritoneal nodules (n = 3), lymphadenopathy (n = 23) and cold abscesses (n = 10)-of these, the presence of fine fibrinous strands in the ascetic fluid, localized ascites and caseous or calcified lymph nodes were highly suspicious of a diagnosis of TB in appropriate clinical settings. The bowel lesions were characterized by concentric bowel wall thickening (n = 31) with ulceration in six. Bowel thickening, when present in the ileocaecal junction and especially when situated in the subhepatic position, was suggestive of a tuberculous etiology. Complex masses in the abdomen pointed to an advanced stage of the disease. US is a useful imaging modality in patients clinically suspected of having abdominal TB for diagnosis and follow-up, although in a few cases differentiation of it from metastatic disease is difficult. When bowel involvement is suspected, barium studies should be performed."

Recently, enteral stenting has also provided a means of reestablishing gastrointestinal flow in proximal and colonic obstructions."
CD012083,0,18172346,0,[A case of afferent loop syndrome treated by endoscopic drainage procedure using nasogastric tube].,"Afferent loop syndrome is an uncommon complication which occurs in patients with Billroth II partial gastrectomy. Clinically, the diagnosis of afferent loop syndrome may be difficult to establish and thus, depends on the finding of computed tomography, abdominal ultrasound, barium studies and hepatobiliary scan. When the diagnosis is made, most of the cases are treated by surgical operation. We present a case of 67-year-old male patient with afferent loop syndrome associated with acute pancreatitis which was treated by endoscopic drainage procedure using a nasogastric tube."
CD012083,0,22971943,0,Evaluation of tissue blood flow of the gastric tube after vessel anastomosis for esophageal reconstruction.,Impaired blood flow of the upper end of the gastric tube is one of the major causes of anastomotic leak following esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy for cancer. We applied an additional microvascular anastomosis procedure--the supercharging technique--to improve blood flow. We investigated blood flow improvement in 15 patients who underwent the supercharging technique after total excision of the thoracic esophagus and gastric tube reconstruction through the posterior mediastinal route from August 2003 to March 2005.
CD012083,0,21140106,0,Sonographic findings of superior mesenteric artery syndrome causing massive gastric dilatation in a young healthy girl.,"Acute gastric dilatation due to superior mesenteric artery syndrome in healthy individuals is extremely rare. A 17-year-old girl who complained of epigastric pain for two days following excessive eating was admitted to our hospital. She was nauseated but was unable to vomit. Succussion splash was positive. Bedside ultrasonography revealed a hyperactive duodenum, a distended stomach compressing on the inferior vena cava and a narrowed angle between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the aorta. Abdominal computed tomography imaging confirmed the above findings. The angle between the aorta and SMA was only eight degrees. Gastrograffin follow-through showed complete obstruction of the third part of the duodenum. 3,500 ml of fluid was immediately drained through the nasogastric tube. Another gastrograffin study conducted five days later showed normal results. Bedside ultrasonography thus proved to be useful for both the diagnosis and management of superior mesenteric artery syndrome."
CD012083,0,2455407,0,Klatskin tumours.,"Klatskin tumours are cholangiocarcinomas localized in the bifurcation of the common hepatic bile duct in the liver hilum. The tumor is rare. The recent increase in incidence is probably due to more accurate diagnostic procedures. The tumours constitute approximately 30 percent of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. The symptoms are progressive obstructive jaundice, weight loss and pain. In the early stage of the disease the diagnosis is difficult, as is preoperative histological verification. Ultrasonography reveals dilated intrahepatic bile ducts and a normal common duct. Sometimes the tumour in the liver hilum can be seen and fine-needle biopsy obtained. In nearly all cases transhepatic cholangiography can verify the diagnosis. Evaluation of resectability includes hepatic arteriography and portography. The tumour is very rarely resectable when vessel involvement is apparent. Resection of the tumour provides the only chance of cure, but only 25 per cent of the tumours are resectable and only half of these can be resected completely. Resection of the quadrate liver lobe facilitates dissection, and hemihepatectomy is often necessary for a curative resection. Surgical bypass and intubation may palliate jaundice, but a similar palliation may be obtained by non-operative biliary drainage by endoprostheses. The median survival for resected patients is approximately 1 1/2 year. Median survival for patients with unresectable tumours is less than 6 months and insignificantly prolonged by palliative procedures. Cholangiocarcinoma localized at and obstructing the bifurcation of the common hepatic bile duct (Fig. 1) has obtained the name Klatskin tumour from Gerald Klatskin, who in 1965 described 15 cases and found some characteristics for this type of cholangiocarcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD012083,0,8059157,0,[Role of biliary intubation in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis without known etiology].,"Biliary tubage, is interesting in the aetiological research of acute pancreatitis, when the origin is unknown after anamnesis, clinical examination, abdominal ultrasonographic studies and retrograde cholangiography. The sludge is the aetiology fond in 40% of the cases. Microscopic crystals are either cholesterol monohydrate, either calcium bilirubinate, or calcium carbonate microspheroliths. Biliary microscopic crystals drive the patients to the cholecystectomy to prevent acute pancreatitis relapses."
CD012083,0,24997185,0,Hiatal hernia causing extrapericardial tamponade after coronary bypass surgery.,"Cardiac tamponade is defined as compression of the heart due to accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, leading to raised pericardial pressures with haemodynamic compromise. We describe the case of a 76-year old female patient who underwent a routine off-pump coronary artery bypass graft operation and within 48 h developed classic signs of cardiac tamponade. The perioperative echocardiogram and operative findings at re-exploration revealed no clots or fluid collection. A giant hiatus hernia was found to be responsible for the tamponade through extrinsic compression. After insertion of a nasogastric tube and decompression of the stomach, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical picture. The remaining postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 5 days later, with referral to the general surgeon for further management. We conclude that, in cases of tamponade post-cardiac surgery, extrapericardial pathologies should be considered."
CD012083,0,20700608,0,Endoscopic nasobiliary drainage is the most suitable preoperative biliary drainage method in the management of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.,Controversy exists over the preferred technique of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCA). The goal of this retrospective study was to identify the preferred technique of PBD for HCA.
CD012083,0,3615851,0,[Percutaneous gastro-enterostomy].,"Percutaneous gastrostomies or gastroenterostomies serve for temporary or permanent enteric feeding in patients with obstruction or functional derangement of the esophagus or hypopharynx. In addition, this radiological procedure may be indicated for small bowel decompression. The authors present their experience in 71 patients. Insufflation of air through a nasogastric tube or catheter is the preferred method for gastric distension. The inferior margin of the left lobe of the liver and the transverse colon are localized sonographically and fluoroscopically prior to puncture. Either Seldinger or Trocar-techniques have proven effective in establishing access to the stomach. The feeding tube is advanced into the proximal jejunum to reduce the likelihood of gastroesophageal reflux and possible aspiration. Complications were encountered in four patients and included catheter dislocation in three and respiratory distress in one patient."
CD012083,0,15513355,0,Reliability of the [13C]-acetate breath test in the measurement of gastric emptying of ethanol solutions: a methodological study.,"The [13C]-acetate breath test is a clinically well-established test for measuring gastric emptying of liquids and correlates significantly with scintigraphy. However, no studies have been undertaken to examine the relationship between gastric emptying measured by the [13C]-acetate breath test and ultrasonography. Furthermore, it is not known how ethanol may affect gastric emptying as measured by the [13C]-acetate breath test. This is particularly important because of the additional steps of absorption, metabolism and exhalation of the tracer involved in the [13C]-acetate breath test compared to the simple measurement of gastric emptying by ultrasonography. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between the gastric half emptying times measured by the [13C]-acetate breath test and by ultrasonography and to determine the effect of ethanol on the comparability between both methods."

The 52-year-aged female patient came to hospital with unclear pain in the lower abdomen and ascites that was refractory to therapy. The computed tomography of the thorax showed right-sided confluating lymphoid nodes, the CT of the abdomen showed ascites and nodular structures near the coecum. Tissue samples were taken from the mucosa of the colon, the inflammatory altered peritoneum, the left bronchus of the upper lobe and the confluating lymphoid nodes in the mediastinum during colonoscopy, diagnostic laparoscopy and bronchoscopy. The samples from the peritoneum showed granulomas with caseating necroses in histological slices. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected by PCR in the tissue samples from the lymphoid tissue of the mediastinum. Furthermore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis grew in cultures from samples of the abdominal ascites. The symptoms and pathological findings improved under a therapy comprising isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamid."

CD012083,0,17103307,0,Effects of intragastric L-arginine administration on proximal stomach tone under basal conditions and after an intragastric diet.,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role as a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. Our study aims were to investigate the effect of a single intragastric L-arginine (L-Arg) administration, as a source of NO, on proximal stomach tone in basal and postintragastric administration of a polymeric diet in humans and to evaluate concomitantly the effect on antral area as an indirect assessment of gastric emptying. Eight healthy volunteers were studied in a randomized double-blind crossover study after, respectively, 15 g L-Arg, 30 g L-Arg, or placebo administered in the stomach through a gastric tube. The drug administration was followed by a polymeric diet infusion (500 ml/500 kcal) at a rate of 250 ml/hr. Gastric tone variations were recorded with an electronic barostat, gastric emptying was concomitantly estimated by repeated ultrasound measurements of antral area, and symptoms were recorded throughout the experiment.L-Arg administration was associated with significantly higher increases in barostat bag volumes at both dosages, 30 g (117+/-16 ml) and 15 g (67+/-15 ml), compared to placebo (46+/-11 ml; P < 0.05). In response to the polymeric diet the 30-g L-Arg challenge was associated with a smaller increase in intrabag volume, whereas postinfusion final volumes did not differ in the three treatment conditions. Antral areas were not different at any time of measurement among the three challenges. Bloating and diarrhea were observed after 30-g L-Arg administration in five subjects of eight. Short-term L-Arg administration was able to induce proximal stomach relaxation that allowed a secondary response to enteral feeding only at the 15-g dosage. This 15-g dosage was as well tolerated as the placebo and was associated with no significant changes in gastric emptying patterns."

CD012083,0,15894446,0,Percutaneous gastrostomy in patients with complete obstruction of the upper digestive tract.,"Gastrostomy for nutritional support can be performed radiologically when endoscopic technique is not possible. In patients with complete obstruction of the upper digestive tract, the radiological technique in its conventional method may not be possible, as insertion of naso-gastric tube for gastric insufflation is not always successful. We reviewed our experience of gastrostomy insertion in nine such patients after failure of the conventional method. In seven of the nine patients, initial gastric puncture was achieved with a 22G needle under direct ultrasound visualisation. In the remaining two patients, initial puncture was made into locules of gas in the stomach with fluoroscopy. The stomach was then distended with air and a gastrostomy tube inserted by conventional technique. We conclude that percutaneous gastrostomy can be undertaken safely even in the presence of complete obstruction of the upper digestive tract and recommend this technique in this selective group of patients."

CD012083,0,19553500,0,"Comparative effects of oral and intraduodenal glucose on blood pressure, heart rate, and splanchnic blood flow in healthy older subjects.","Postprandial hypotension occurs frequently, particularly in the elderly. The magnitude of the fall in blood pressure (BP) and rise in heart rate (HR) in response to enteral glucose are greater when gastric emptying (GE) or small intestinal infusion are more rapid. Meal ingestion is associated with an increase in splanchnic blood flow. In contrast, gastric distension may attenuate the postprandial fall in BP. The aims of this study were to evaluate, in older subjects, the comparative effects of intraduodenal glucose infusion, at a rate similar to GE of oral glucose, on BP, HR, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) flow, and blood glucose. Eight healthy subjects (5 men, 3 women, age 66-75 yr) were studied on two occasions. On day 1, each subject ingested 300 ml of water containing 75 g glucose. GE was quantified by three-dimensional ultrasonography between time t = 0-120 min, and the rate of emptying (kcal/min) was calculated. On day 2, glucose was infused intraduodenally at the same rate as that on day 1. On both days, BP, HR, SMA flow, and blood glucose were measured. The mean GE of oral glucose was 1.3 +/- 0.1 kcal/min. Systolic BP (P < 0.01), SMA flow (P < 0.05), and blood glucose (P < 0.01) were greater and HR less (P < 0.01) after oral, compared with intraduodenal, glucose. There were comparable falls in diastolic BP during the study days (P < 0.01 for both). We conclude that the magnitude of the fall in systolic BP and rise in HR are less after oral, compared with intraduodenal, glucose, presumably reflecting the ""protective"" effect of gastric distension."

CD012083,0,19816035,0,Congenital high airway obstruction syndrome due to complete tracheal agenesis: an accident of nature with clues for tracheal development and lessons in management.,"Congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by complete blockage of the fetal airways associated with hydrops. We present a case of CHAOS due to the rare cause of complete tracheal agenesis. The ex utero intrapartum therapy (EXIT) strategy was employed to allow for neck and mediastinal exploration. Thymectomy allowed dissection to the level of the carina demonstrating the confluence of dilated mainstem bronchi but no trachea and no connection to the esophagus. A 2.5 endotracheal tube was inserted into the right mainstem bronchus and secured to the left clavicle. At 3 months of age, the infant succumbed to sepsis from Enterobacter mediastinitis due to friction between the tracheostomy tube and the nasogastric tube resulting in erosion of the esophagus. Complete tracheal agenesis, as seen in this case, is consistent with the failure of normal tracheal elongation as suggested by newer theories of foregut development. This case illustrates the most severe form of tracheal atresia causing CHAOS ever salvaged by the EXIT procedure at birth. The subsequent postnatal course highlights the need for early tracheal replacement in this particularly challenging form of CHAOS."
CD012083,0,9200092,0,Diagnosis and management of duodenal injuries in children.,"Traumatic duodenal perforations in children pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. To identify specific diagnostic criteria and define an optimal therapeutic protocol, we reviewed all duodenal injuries treated at our institution in the past 10 years. There were 14 hematomas and 13 perforations. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT), ultrasound scan (US), upper gastrointestinal contrast studies (UGI), or at laparotomy. The clinical findings and CT findings of the two groups were compared. Children with suspected duodenal hematomas were treated expectantly, and children with duodenal perforations were treated surgically. Twenty-five associated injuries (10 pancreatic) occurred in 19 children. Children with perforations had higher injury severity scores (ISS) (25 v 9), but the two groups could not be differentiated based on presenting signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings. CT findings of retroperitoneal air or contrast were seen in 9 of 9 perforations and in 0 of 10 hematomas. CT findings of intraabdominal or retroperitoneal fluid, mesenteric enhancement, and thickened duodenal wall did not differentiate the two groups. Duodenojejunostomy was performed in one patient, and primary repair was performed in 11 children who had perforation. In five children, duodenostomy tube drainage with feeding jejunostomy or gastrojejunostomy were added. Complications occurred in three of four children in the first 5 years of the study and in two of nine children in the last 5 years. The decreased morbidity rate correlated with reduced time to definitive therapy (28 v 7.8 hours). Duodenal fistulae resulted in three of seven children treated without duodenostomy tube drainage and zero of five treated with drainage. Enteral feeds resumed faster (average, 12 v 27 days) if repair of perforation was combined with feeding jejunostomy or pyloric exclusion and gastrojejunostomy. Children with duodenal hematoma resumed eating an average of 16 days after injury. Only one child required surgery for persistent obstruction. The findings of retroperitoneal air and contrast extravasation on CT accurately distinguish duodenal perforation from hematoma. Conservative management of hematoma is safe and effective. Primary repair of perforation with duodenal drainage results in fewer postoperative complications, and gastrojejunostomy or feeding jejunostomy shorten the time to resumption of feeds."

CD012083,0,23513323,0,Implementing a perpetual anesthesia setup standardized for the trauma room in a level I trauma center.,"The trauma room in a level I trauma center is a dynamic environment that provides little room for error. Significant variability can exist if anesthesia providers set up the room differently. Standardization provides a system that is consistent, reliable, and cost-effective. This study examines the process of creating and implementing a standardized anesthesia setup in the trauma room of a level I trauma center. As a result of this study, the medication cart and airway setups have been standardized. Providers are encouraged to only draw up medications that will be immediately used and to ensure that prefilled syringes have been incorporated into the pharmacy formulary. Using the EZ Endo prestyleted endotracheal tube (ETT) vs a regular ETT with stylet has yielded an annual cost savings of $2,673. Ensuring that items such as an esophageal temperature probe, humidifier, and nasogastric tube are available but unopened has provided a savings of $1,989.25 per year.

Personal experience in 137 cases].,"Percutaneous gastrostomy is reported to be an effective alternative to total parenteral feeding or long-term nasogastric tube in the treatment of mechanical or functional dysphagia. The authors report their personal experience with 137 percutaneous gastrostomies performed on 98 men and 39 women from January 1986 through December 1993. All the maneuvers were performed under fluoroscopic guidance in the patients with head or neck cancer, neoplastic, vascular or post-traumatic neuropathy and upper GI tract cancer. To avoid left hepatic lobe trauma, percutaneous gastrostomy needs to be performed under US guidance. A 7F nasogastric tube is used to fill the stomach with air. After distending the gastric cavity, with the Seldinger technique under local anesthesia, fascial dilators of progressively increasing caliber are introduced into the gastric cavity and the final 12F gastrostomy catheter is positioned under fluoroscopic guidance. No major complications, such as hemorrhage or peritonitis, occurred. In one case, during the maneuver, the patient complained of severe epigastric pain which regressed with no further problems two hours later. In three cases the gastrostomy catheter fell out of place and was replaced by running the fistolous tract with a venous cannula and then a guidewire for gastrostomy repositioning. With this type of treatment, the patient can be given enteral feeding the following day. The maneuver requires approximately 10 minutes to perform and is well tolerated by the patient as it requires no general anesthesia. Percutaneous gastrostomy is more cost-effective than surgery or endoscopy and hospitalization is shorter. The only contraindications to this maneuver are hepatomegaly (because of the risk of liver trauma during percutaneous maneuvers), ascites (because of the risk of infection) and finally the complications resulting from gastric resection."

The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of swallowing between the period of tube-bottle (TBF) and bottle (BF) feeding by means of cervical auscultation in premature infants. Twenty-three premature infants were enrolled (mean gestational age 34.7 +/- 1.7 weeks). Audiosignal recordings were made during TBF and BF with a small microphone set in front of the cricoid cartilage. The following parameters were calculated for 2 min and reported at 1 min: the percentage of time involved in swallowing (ST), the numbers of swallows (SN) and swallowing bursts (SB) and swallowing groups (SG). Individual histograms were established to show the individual pattern of swallowing behaviour and the distribution of groups, bursts and swallows over 2 min. Mean (STm), (SNm), (SBm), (SGm) values were calculated (+/- S.D.). Statistical analysis was used to compare the means and to establish correlations between parameters and curves. (STm), (SNm) and (SBm) increased significantly during BF compared with TBF for all premature infants and during follow-up. The histograms showed that in BF the groups were high in bursts. These findings and the histograms for each infant will allow determination of transition to bottle feeding without risk corresponding to the stage of maturation of swallowing function."

Abdominal CT revealed a foreign body in the duodenum resembling a suction cup of the type commonly used in kitchens and bathrooms. The object could not be removed because it was deeply embedded in the hypertrophic intestinal mucosa. A nasogastric tube was inserted for feeding, since the object impeded the passage of solid foods. The patient's fever and abdominal pain subsequently resolved, and laboratory data improved. The indwelling feeding tube prevented recurrence of cholecystitis. Since pica is common not only in patients with mental retardation but also in dementia patients, the present case may also relate to the treatment of acute abdominal conditions in dementia patients."
CD012083,0,24594366,0,Cell-free DNA testing: an aid to prenatal sonographic diagnosis.,"Sonographic diagnosis of fetal abnormalities is based on the recognition of sonographic patterns associated with structural abnormalities. Although diagnosis in some situations, such as neural tube defects, gastroschisis, and omphalocoele, can be straightforward, in many situations, the constellation of fetal abnormalities suggest an underlying chromosomal or genetic cause. In these situations, invasive testing is needed to provide the information required to make a definitive diagnosis, and thus accurately counsel parents. Since the identification of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma, the potential for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis is increasingly becoming possible. In this chapter, the current role and future potential of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis, combined with new molecular techniques as an aid to sonographic diagnosis, will be discussed."

Recently, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has been advocated as a safer, quicker, less expensive method in children. We report our experience with 16 percutaneous gastrostomies in 14 infants and children; in all cases, both sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance were used. Four patients had had previous surgical gastrostomy in which the tubes could not be replaced once they were removed. The remaining patients were referred for percutaneous placement of gastrostomy tubes as the first procedure. In 13 procedures, parenteral sedation and local anesthesia were used; the remaining three procedures were done with the patient under general anesthesia. Tubes were successfully placed in all procedures. In two patients, tubes became dislodged, necessitating a second procedure. There were no instances of local infections, hemorrhage, or peritonitis, and none of the patients died. Two patients had postprocedure septicemia, which responded to antibiotics.

The incidence of RLNP was not significantly different between TEE group and non TEE group, but the incidence in female TEE group was higher than that in female non TEE group. The mechanism of RLNP following TEE as well as the insertion of nasogastric tube may be compression injuries of the branches of the posterior division of the recurrent laryngeal nerves.

Recent studies suggest that the magnitude of the fall in postprandial blood pressure (BP) may be attenuated by gastric distension. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of gastric distension on the hypotensive response to intraduodenal (ID) glucose. Eight healthy subjects (5 males, 3 females, aged 65-76 years) received an ID infusion of either 1) 50 g glucose in 300 ml saline (ID glucose) over 60 min (t=0-60 min), 2) 50 g glucose in 300 ml saline over 60 min and intragastric (4) infusion of 500 ml water between t=7-10 min (IG water and ID glucose), or 3) ID saline (0.9%) infusion over 60 min and IG infusion of 500 ml water (IG water and ID saline) all followed by ID saline infusion for another 60 min (t=60-120 min) on three separate days. BP and heart rate (HR) were measured. Gastric emptying (GE) of the IG water was quantified by two-dimensional ultrasonography. Between t=0-60 min, systolic and diastolic BP was greater (P<0.05 for both) with IG water and ID saline compared with IG water and ID glucose, and less (P<0.05 for both) with ID glucose compared with IG water and ID glucose. These effects were evident at relatively low IG volumes (approximately 300 ml). GE was faster with IG water and ID saline when compared with IG water and ID glucose. We conclude that, in healthy older subjects, IG administration of water markedly attenuates the hypotensive response to ID glucose, presumably as a result of gastric distension."

CD012083,0,21497055,0,Duodenal perforation due to compression necrosis by the tip of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a common and safe procedure for enteral nutrition. There are few reports concerning its complications. We managed a 31-y-old bedridden case with punched out duodenal perforation without inflammation, from which the tip of the PEG tube protruded. Simple x-ray and computed tomography showed incarceration of the balloon in the duodenal bulb and extravasation of the tip of the tube. We performed simple closure with omental patching for duodenal perforation. Postoperative gastrointestinal fiberscopy on the 11th day revealed scar phase. Some PEG tubes have a balloon, which can prevent the removal of the tube, fix the position of the tube, and prevent the leakage of gastric contents from fistula. However, in our case, the inflated balloon was transferred into the duodenal bulb according to gastric strong peristalsis. This pathophysiologic mechanism is the same as ball bulb syndrome, which is known as gastroduodenal obstruction by incarceration of the gastric submucosal tumor. There is a risk of wedging of the inflated balloon of the PEG tube and perforation of the duodenum. We must not insert the tube too deeply, must not continue to inflate the balloon for a long time, and must check its position using a stethoscope, simple x-ray examination, or ultrasound."

CD012083,0,15666270,0,Bedside emergency ultrasonographic diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture in blunt abdominal trauma.,"Abdominal injury from significant blunt trauma can include injury to bowel, kidneys, liver, and spleen. In approximately 5% of all injuries one of the diaphragms is ruptured. Diaphragmatic rupture may not be easily detected and this can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. Rupture may be suggested on chest X-ray film especially with abnormal nasogastric tube location but the accuracy of this method is modest only. Abdominal computed tomography is not accurate and magnetic resonance imaging, although very sensitive and specific, is not feasible in most trauma situations. Surgeons have often resorted to exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy to make the diagnosis. Although not typically part of the basic Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination, ultrasonographic diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture is possible with little added time to the examination. We present 3 cases of diaphragmatic rupture discovered shortly after the patients' arrival, on initial trauma evaluation with the FAST. A discussion of previous literature and ultrasound technique for diagnosis follows the cases."
CD012083,0,24837648,0,[Acute pancreatitis: an overview of the management].,"Over the past decades, the incidence and the number of hospital admissions for acute pancreatitis have increased in the Western countries. The two most common etiological factors of acute pancreatitis are gallstones (including small gallstones or microlithiasis) and alcohol abuse. Acute pancreatitis is associated with a significant mortality (4-10%) and 25% in case of pancreatic necrosis, especially. Edematous pancreatitis is benign and oral feeding can be restarted once abdominal pain is decreasing and inflammatory markers are improving. Enteral tube feeding should be the primary therapy in patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis who require nutritional support. Enteral nutrition in acute pancreatitis can be administered via either the nasojejunal or nasogastric route. In case of necrosis, preventive antibiotics are not recommended. The single indication is infected necrosis confirmed by fine needle aspiration. The incidence trends of acute pancreatitis possibly reflect a change in the prevalence of main etiological factors (e.g. gallstones and alcohol consumption) and cofactors such as tobacco, obesity and genetic susceptibility. Priority is to search for associated causes, especially in cases with atypical symptoms. In case of first acute pancreatitis in patients older than 50 years, the presence of a tumor (benign or malignant) has to be specifically ruled out, using CT-scan, MRI and endoscopic ultrasound."

On admission, the patient underwent physical examination, laboratory analysis, abdominal ultrasound and plain abdominal x-ray. Physical examination revealed diffuse and rebound tenderness and extreme rigidity of the abdomen, guarding and decreased bowel sounds. Standard surgical techniques were used (median laparotomy, primary anastomosis, nasojejunal three-luminal tube for feeding and gastric decompression). At exploration, we found complete transection of the duodenum just below the pylorus and between the second and third part of the duodenum. We performed primary anastomosis of both transections with interrupted sutures in two layers. Prior to discharge magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Early diagnosis of duodenal rupture is important. When dealing with trauma patients with pain greater than local findings, the mechanism of injury should always be taken into account."

The infant had respiratory distress, which increased rapidly when he was 6 days old. Radiography revealed right-sided hydrothorax that had not been evident a day earlier but no sign of a perforated esophagus. We performed sonography, which revealed fluid in the right pleural cavity and extra-esophageal placement of the feeding tube. Analysis of a fluid specimen obtained on thoracocentesis indicated that the fluid was feeding formula. The feeding tube's misplacement was confirmed sonographically by injecting a small amount of sterile distilled water into the tube and visualizing its entry into the pleural cavity. The feeding tube was removed, and antimicrobial agents were administered. When the infant was 15 days old, feeding resumed through another tube, the placement of which was verified radiographically. The infant was discharged when he was 118 days old with no severe complications, although he had mild chronic lung disease. Because radiography did not reveal the tube's misplacement in this case, we believe that the use of sonography can contribute to an early diagnosis of esophageal perforation in such cases."

CD012083,0,14749955,0,Imaging of gastrointestinal and abdominal tuberculosis.,"This article discusses the range of manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) of the abdomen, including involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, the peritoneum, mesentery, omentum, abdominal lymph nodes, solid abdominal organs, the genital system and the abdominal aorta. Abdominal TB is a diagnostic challenge, particularly when pulmonary TB is absent. It may mimic many other abdominal diseases, both clinically and radiologically. An early correct diagnosis, however, is important in order to ensure proper treatment and a favorable outcome. Modern imaging is a cornerstone in the early diagnosis of abdominal TB and may prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Generally, CT appears to be the imaging modality of choice in the detection and assessment of abdominal tuberculosis, other than gastrointestinal TB. Barium studies remain superior for demonstrating mucosal intestinal lesions. Ultrasound may be used for follow-up to monitor therapy response. The diagnosis of abdominal TB should be considered if suggestive imaging findings are found in patients with a high index of suspicion."

CD012083,0,23440988,0,A microscopically calcified Meckel's diverticulum: a histopathological perspective of a case of both gastric and pancreatic mucosae.,"A 2-year-old child presented with a 1-week history of abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting. Upon examination, the abdomen was distended and faecal aspirate was noted from a nasogastric tube. Ultrasound scan and a failed air enema demonstrated intestinal intussusception warranting a surgical intervention. The intraoperative findings were of an ileocolic intussusception that was reduced and a Meckel's diverticulum (MD) was noted as a lead point necessitating resection with an end-to-end anastomosis. Histopathological analysis revealed a heterotopic MD containing both gastric and pancreatic mucosae with dystrophic calcification. MD is a pathologically diverse condition. The commonest histopathological picture in MD is that of an ectopic gastric mucosa at the terminal ileum. The histopathological analysis of this case demonstrated the interesting heterotopic results with calcification, which the histopathologist needs to be aware of when interpreting a surgical specimen with a clinical picture consistent with intussusception."
CD012083,0,2978282,0,Perinatal management of the fetus with an abdominal wall defect.,"The antenatal diagnosis of abdominal wall defects has allowed improved perinatal management. For fetuses with associated anomalies, the options of elective termination or minimal intervention can be offered. Our ability to predict the extent of bowel damage in gastroschisis based on the ultrasound findings enables us to offer early delivery to those fetuses who are at high risk. The data are not clear at the present time whether cesarean section offers any advantage. These fetuses should, however, be delivered at a center which is capable of providing high level medical and surgical care to these potentially ill infants. Initial resuscitation of these neonates requires early insertion of an intravenous line and a nasogastric tube, the administration of antibiotics, sterile coverage of the eviscerated bowel, and careful attention to temperature instability. Neonates with gastroschisis should be operated on as soon as they are stable, whereas infants with omphalocele can be investigated for associated anomalies prior to surgery. Primary fascial closure is performed whenever possible. Where this is not possible, a staged repair using a silastic chimney achieves closure within 3-6 days. Skin coverage alone or nonoperative management is reserved for the few cases with giant omphalocele, associated anomalies, or poor operative risk. Decisions about primary versus delayed closure, while usually dictated by clinical judgement, can be aided by indirect measurement of intraabdominal pressure. Postoperative ventilation, and consideration of long-term nutritional needs, are also important parts of the perioperative management."

Abdominal imaging findings on plain radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and gastrointestinal contrast studies included tuberculous peritonitis and ascites in all patients, tuberculous adenopathy in two, gastrointestinal tuberculosis in two, and omental tuberculosis in two. The radiographic features particularly characteristic of abdominal tuberculosis were: (1) low attenuating adenopathy with rim enhancement, (2) omental or ileocecal inflammatory mass, (3) high density ascites, and (4) gastrointestinal enteritis involving the ileocecal region. All patients had acid-fast bacilli identified in cultures of bodily fluids and/or pathologic specimens and three patients had cultures positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient with a negative culture had a positive PPD skin test and a surgical specimen showing caseating granulomata and acid-fast bacilli in the omentum. The radiologist must maintain a high degree of suspicion for abdominal tuberculosis particularly in normal or immunosuppressed children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Fine needle aspiration and biopsy of abdominal adenopathy, inflammatory mass or ascites may be necessary for diagnosis."

We utilized a convenience sample of patients undergoing elective surgery during July 2004 in an urban teaching hospital. Trained Emergency Physician sonographers performed transtracheal ultrasounds of intubations to identify esophageal intubation. In 35 of the 40 patients enrolled, there was intubation of the trachea, whereas esophageal intubation occurred in five patients. Sonographers correctly identified all five esophageal intubations, for a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48-100). Ultrasound correctly identified 34 of 35 tracheal intubations and misidentified one resulting in a specificity of 97% (95% CI 90-100).

No single confirmation strategy has emerged as ideal in all circumstances. Our objective in this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a novel approach to verify endotracheal intubation using transcricothyroid ultrasonography (US). We performed a prospective, randomized double-blinded trial in a human cadaver model. A 7.5-MHz curvilinear probe was placed longitudinally over the cricothyroid membrane as cadavers were randomly intubated in either the trachea or esophagus in two phases: 1) as the intubation was being performed (dynamic) and, 2) after intubation had been completed (static). Volunteer emergency medicine (EM) residents, blinded to tube placement, assessed for esophageal vs. tracheal ET placement using dynamic and static US views. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detecting esophageal ET placement with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Seven EM residents made a total of 70 dynamic and 70 static assessments of ET position using transcricothyroid US. Dynamic assessment resulted in 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting esophageal ET placement. Static assessment resulted in only 51% sensitivity and 91% specificity. This pilot study suggests that dynamic transcricothyroid US is a potentially accurate method of confirming ET placement during the intubation process. Further investigation in live humans is warranted to validate these data."

CD012083,0,8164143,0,[Pediatric matrix biplane transesophageal echo probe: evaluation of probe selection in patients].,"We have developed four different probes for the wide use of transesophageal echocardiography in children. The adult matrix biplane probe (M-BP) can generate transverse and longitudinal plane images simultaneously from a single transducer, and facilitates easier and faster understanding of the three-dimensional anatomy of the heart. This probe can be used in patients weighing more than 15 kg. The pediatric matrix biplane probe (PM-BP) has the same function as the M-BP in a smaller probe head and shaft, and can be used in patients weighing more than 5 kg. The conventional pediatric biplane probe (P-BP) with two transducers has a smaller probe head profile than the PM-BP, and can be used in a baby as small as 2.7 kg. The newborn single plane probe (N-SP) has the smallest profile with a 4 mm diameter shaft, and can be used like a nasogastric tube. We choose probes according to the size of the patient and purpose of the study. As a rule, smaller probes are less invasive and reduce the risk of the study. However, larger probes have better image quality and penetration. Proper selection of the probe is the key to the safe and effective use of this new methodology."

In other faculties with non-critically ill patients, such as (oncologic) surgery, neurology, paediatrics or even in palliative care medicine feeding tubes are used under various circumstances as a temporary or definite solution. The advantage of enteral feeding tubes is the almost physiologic administration of nutrition, liquids and medication. Enteral nutrition is thought to be associated with a reduced infection rate, increased mucosal function, improved immunologic function, reduced length of hospital stay and reduced costs. However, the insertion and use of feeding tubes is potentially dangerous and may be associated with life-threatening complications (bleeding, perforation, peritonitis, etc.). Therefore, the following article will give a summary of the different types of enteral feeding tubes and their range of application.

CD012083,0,2190330,0,Initial evaluation of the patient with blunt abdominal trauma.,"Unrecognized abdominal injury remains a distressingly frequent cause of preventable death following blunt trauma. Peritoneal signs are often subtle, overshadowed by pain from associated injury, and masked by head trauma or intoxicants. The initial management of the patient with blunt abdominal trauma should parallel the primary survey of airway, breathing, and circulation. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage remains the cornerstone of triage in patients with life-threatening blunt abdominal trauma. The only absolute contraindication to the procedure is an existing indication for laparotomy. Computed tomography is useful as a complementary diagnostic tool in selected patients, and it is the critical test for guiding nonoperative management of known intraperitoneal trauma. Routine ancillary tests for potentially occult injuries include nasogastric-tube placement for ruptures of the left diaphragm, Gastrografin contrast study for duodenum perforation, and pyelography for urologic injury. Ultrasonography may become a valuable tool in the initial assessment of the injured abdomen. Ultimately, the most important principle in the management of blunt abdominal trauma is repeat physical examination by an experienced surgeon."
CD012083,0,23456644,0,Emergency management of acute abdomen in children.,"Acute abdomen can be defined as a medical emergency in which there is sudden and severe pain in abdomen with accompanying signs and symptoms that focus on an abdominal involvement. It accounts for about 8 % of all children attending the emergency department. The goal of emergency management is to identify and treat any life-threatening medical or surgical disease condition and relief from pain. In mild cases often the cause is gastritis or gastroenteritis, colic, constipation, pharyngo-tonsilitis, viral syndromes or acute febrile illnesses. The common surgical causes are malrotation and Volvulus (in early infancy), intussusception, acute appendicitis, and typhoid and ischemic enteritis with perforation. Lower lobe pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis and acute porphyria should be considered in patients with moderate-severe pain with little localizing findings in abdomen. The approach to management in ED should include, in order of priority, a rapid cardiopulmonary assessment to ensure hemodynamic stability, focused history and examination, surgical consult and radiologic examination to exclude life threatening surgical conditions, pain relief and specific diagnosis. In a sick patient the initial steps include rapid IV access and normal saline 20 ml/kg (in the presence of shock/hypovolemia), adequate analgesia, nothing per oral/IV fluids, Ryle's tube aspiration and surgical consultation. An ultrasound abdomen is the first investigation in almost all cases with moderate and severe pain with localizing abdominal findings. In patients with significant abdominal trauma or features of pancreatitis, a Contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) abdomen will be a better initial modality. Continuous monitoring and repeated physical examinations should be done in all cases. Specific management varies according to the specific etiology."

CD012083,0,1899988,0,Gastrointestinal blood flow velocity after the first feed.,"Twenty preterm infants (gestational age range 27-36 weeks) who had never been fed enterally were studied. Doppler indices of flow velocity from the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries were measured immediately before, and at postprandial time intervals up to 60 minutes after, a first feed of 1 ml of milk given through a nasogastric tube. There were no significant differences between the preprandial and postprandial values of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, and pH. The median peak systolic velocity (PSV) (55.9 cm/sec) and time average mean velocity (TAV) (10.6 cm/sec) before the feed at the superior mesenteric artery rose progressively and significantly to postprandial peaks of 88.5 cm/sec and 20.5 cm/sec at 45 minutes, respectively. Significant postprandial rises in the median PSV and TAV values at the coeliac artery were also observed, with a peak at 45 minutes. There were no significant correlations between blood flow velocity indices (preprandial or postprandial) and gestational age, postnatal age, conceptional age, or birth weight. We conclude that the first exposure of preterm babies to a small volume of milk feed is associated with postprandial changes in blood flow velocity consistent with an increase in blood flow in the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries, although the mechanism of this response is uncertain."

CD012083,0,2516531,0,Gallbladder distention in premature neonates receiving parenteral nutrition.,Contraction of the gallbladder is mediated through the release of cholecystokinin from duodenal cells secondary to enteral feedings. Premature infants are often nourished by parenteral hyperalimentation leading to prolonged inactivation of the gallbladder. Such inactivation probably accounts for the increased incidence of gallbladder distention observed in premature neonates. Two cases of premature infants are described in whom distention of the gallbladder occurred during parenteral hyperalimentation. The distention resolved spontaneously secondary to the introduction of enteral feedings. A trial period of oral or tube feeding is recommended in such cases prior to any attempt to release the distention by a surgical intervention.
CD012083,0,1632272,0,[Rehabilitation of oro-pharyngeal dysphagia of neurogenic etiology using radiological examination: preliminary results].,"Dysphagia is more frequently observed in patients with neurologic diseases (stroke, bulbar or pseudo-bulbar syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cranial trauma). Furthermore, the presence of this pathology is obviously more frequently noted in the light of the increase in the length of the human life span. It has become evident that alternative feeding procedures such as the nasogastric tube or gastrostomy may bring about complications and deprive patients of the oral phase of deglutition which plays a leading role in stimulating digestive functions. The Authors report a systematic research on the rehabilitation aspects of neurogenous dysphagia. All the patients studied underwent a neurological examination and oropharyngeal functional evaluation using echo-videorecording of the oral phase of deglutition and fluoro-videorecording of the pharyngeal phase. The data obtained allowed for the selection of five patients considered suitable for the rehabilitation program. One of them had a multi-infarct encephalopathy, two a spastic hemiplegia f.b.c., a fourth a cerebellar syndrome and the last a sequela of meningioma removal of the ponto-cerebellar angle with peripheral paralysis of the right VII, IX, X, XI cranial nerves. This last patient also underwent a crico-pharyngeal myotomy. Therapy consisted in making the patient sensitive to swallowing movements and in training them to assume a compensatory posture as well as functional rehabilitation of the organs involved in deglutition. The first datum emerging from the study is the lack of etiological homogeneity found in the cases treated with evident variability in different deglutition organ impairment, even though there was the common denominator of the dysphagia symptom. With regard to the results obtained, there was a complete resolution in one patient, while in the other four there was such an improvement as to allow the patients a safe autonomous oral assumption of food. The positive results obtained are not only linked to the recovery of damaged organs, but also to the development of compensatory strategies such as the choice of appropriate food consistency and the assumption of postures which protect the respiratory tract from aspiration and favor crico-pharyngeal relaxation."

CD012083,0,7624559,0,Sonohysterography: a technique for endometrial evaluation.,"Sonohysterography involves the instillation of sterile saline under continuous sonographic visualization to assess the endometrial cavity. The technique is most useful for evaluating women with fertility problems, postmenopausal bleeding, or an abnormal endometrial interface as seen at baseline sonography. The procedure is performed with saline instilled into the endometrial cavity through a 5-F pediatric feeding tube or a hysterosalpingography or insemination catheter. In the normal uterus, the endometrium appears symmetric, surrounding the anechoic, saline-distended endometrial cavity. Adhesions appear as bridging bands of tissue that distort the uterine cavity or as very thin, undulating membranes, best seen at real-time examination. An intracavitary polyp is seen surrounded by anechoic fluid, with the point of attachment and thickness of the stalk clearly demonstrated. The location of leiomyomas can be determined: Intramural lesions do not distort the endometrial cavity, whereas submucosal lesions often do, with the overlying normal layer of endometrium clearly seen. In women with abnormal bleeding, focal areas of asymmetric endometrial thickening can be identified. Sonohysterography allows differentiation of intracavitary, endometrial, and submucosal abnormalities without the use of ionizing radiation or contrast agents."

We included 60 stroke patients (30 tube-feeding-dependent and 30 on regular oral intake) and 30 healthy controls. An additional 10 healthy people were recruited to assess the reliability of SUS. Measurements of hyoid bone displacement using videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and SUS were compared for 12 stroke patients to assess the correlation between the two methods. Changes in tongue thickness and hyoid bone displacement were significantly less in the tube-feeding group. Those with a tongue thickness change of less than 1.0 cm and hyoid bone displacement of less than 1.5 cm were likely to be tube-feeding. SUS showed good intra-rater/inter-rater reliability and correlated well with VFSS measurement. SUS can be an adjunct assessment tool of swallowing.

CD012083,0,11560751,0,Integral role of interventional radiology in the development of a pediatric liver transplantation program.,"The aim of this study was to examine the role of interventional radiology (IR) in the pretransplant evaluation of potential living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) donors and in the post-transplant management of pediatric liver transplant recipients. Medical records and procedural reports were reviewed of 12 potential donors and five recipients for left lateral segment liver transplants. Procedures performed by the IR Division, clinical indications, and complications were tabulated. Retrospective calculation of radiation exposure to the skin and gonads of the donors and recipients were made. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) was used in all 12 potential donors to screen for the donor with the most appropriately sized left lateral segment. The four optimal donor candidates underwent contrast angiography in order to measure the diameter and screen for variant arterial supply to the left lateral segment. Pretransplantation, one recipient underwent mesenteric angiography with indirect portography to confirm thrombosis of the portal vein and to prove patency of the splenomesenteric venous confluence. Three children underwent LRLT and two children received split livers from cadaveric donors. Thirty-two IR procedures were performed after transplantation (Tx) in the four transplant survivors (one child died following Tx). These IR procedures included: ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy to evaluate the pathologic cause of liver dysfunction (seven); placement of nasal jejunal feeding tubes (three) or a peripherally inserted central catheter (four) for nutritional and pharmacologic support; large-volume diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis (two) and thoracentesis (one); percutaneous catheter drainage of symptomatic large pleural effusions (two), large-volume chylous ascites (one) (with later drain removal [one]), and a large biloma (one); percutaneous biliary drain placement (three), biliary drain replacement (two), and balloon cholangioplasty (four) to relieve obstructive jaundice from biliary enteric anatomic strictures; and mesenteric arteriography (one) for suspected thrombosis of the hepatic artery. No complications occurred. Mean skin and gonadal radiation doses were 193 mGy and 27 mGy, respectively, for donors, and 164 mGy and 60 mGy, respectively, for recipients. Even in a program such as this, with a limited series of pediatric liver Txs, it is apparent that IR plays an integral role in optimizing the clinical outcome and use of resources. Specific benefits included: selection of optimal donors; accurate mapping of the donor and occasionally recipient hepatic vasculature; and, most importantly, providing relatively safe minimally invasive procedures for nutritional support and diagnosis and management of untoward events after Tx. When possible, ultrasound guidance should be used to avoid excessive cumulative fluoroscopic exposure to recipients."
CD012083,0,12424581,0,Evaluation of oesophageal atresia without fistula by three-dimensional computed tomography.,"During the last decade, an increasing number of paediatric surgeons have chosen to perform a delayed oesophageal anastomosis for oesophageal atresia (OA) without tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF). The gap between the two oesophageal pouches is an important determinant in the surgical management of these patients. We describe a new method using spiral computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the gap between the proximal and distal oesophageal pouches. In our last four cases of OA without TOF, Stamm gastrostomy was performed soon after birth. At about 4 weeks of age, these patients underwent spiral CT with air inflation via the gastrostomy feeding tube with 3 mm slice thickness, pitch 1, and reconstruction interval every 1.5 mm. A three-dimensional reconstruction was done and measurements of the gap between the two segments were recorded. The procedure was repeated at monthly intervals until the optimal conditions for surgery were observed. All the babies thrived well on gastrostomy feeding. The gap distances were 2.4, 3.8, 4.2 and 5.9 cm respectively. Delayed primary oesophageal anastomosis was accomplished in three cases and gastric transposition was performed in another case at 12, 13, 14 and 16 weeks of age. The exact anatomical position the operation correlated well with the pre-operative three-dimensional CT results."

CD012083,0,1987582,0,Gastrointestinal radiology from the time of Walter B. Cannon to the 21st century.,"From its very inception, gastrointestinal radiology was at the forefront of radiology, combining physiologic and anatomic information. From evaluation of esophageal motility to the first depiction of gastric ulcers and carcinomas of the alimentary tube, gastrointestinal radiology became indispensable to physicians and surgeons. Improvements in fluoroscopic and radiographic equipment, the tilting table, the image intensifier with the television train, the introduction of selective visceral angiography with safer contrast media and, more recently, digital subtraction angiography, digital ultrasound (US), color Doppler US, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging--all of these advances have made imaging diagnosis more precise and specific. A new modality--localized tissue MR spectroscopy--should offer an insight into metabolism and suggest optimal modes of treatment and follow-up. The gastrointestinal radiologist of the future will have to be multimodality trained. A new generation of alimentary tract interventional radiologists will further the trend toward less invasive surgical therapy. No end of advances is in sight."

Thirty-six neonates (20 males and 16 females) born with EA-DF were included in this study. After obtaining chest radiographs of the neonates with a coiled nasogastric tube in the upper esophageal pouch, longitudinal esophageal high-frequency US was performed. The esophageal structures were displayed, and the IDs measured on US images were compared with the surgical findings. With the use of US, the structure of EA-DF was accurately depicted, and the ID detected by US correlated well with the surgical findings. Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the ID as assessed by US and surgery (R = 0.99, P < 0.001).). US findings were crucial for planning the surgical strategy in 9 (25.0%) patients.

CD012083,0,8313842,0,[Duodenal tuberculosis. A rare cause of a covered perforation in the duodenal bulb].,"Vague upper abdominal pain, weight loss (10 kg) and recurrent bouts of fever had been present for several months in a 77-year-old woman. Abdominal ultrasonography in the region of the head of the pancreas and duodenum had demonstrated several lymphomas, some of them with ""air streaking"". This finding suggested penetration from the duodenum to neighbouring lymph nodes. Plain film of the abdomen did not show free air, but at gastroscopy a covered perforation into the surrounding lymph nodes was found. At first lymphoma or Crohn's disease were considered in the differential diagnosis. But the finding of acid-fast bacteria in a biopsy from the pelvic crest suggested intestinal tuberculosis with dissemination. This diagnosis was confirmed by the direct demonstration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in gastric juice. Under tuberculostatic treatment with daily 0.3 g isoniazid, 0.45 g rifampicin, 0.8 ethambutol and 1.5 g pyrazinamide, as well as 50 mg prednisolone to prevent stricture, the size of the tuberculous ulcer had markedly decreased within 2 weeks. Follow-up gastroscopy after 6 months showed almost complete healing without stricture. However rare, gastrointestinal tuberculosis should not be forgotten in the differential diagnosis because it can imitate a large variety of gastrointestinal diseases."

In 91 of 123 cases (74%), the gallbladder expanded for a short time prior to contraction during feeding. The examination on eight patients after gastrectomy and seven patients after a medically induced vagotomy revealed contraction only in response to feeding. In seven normal adults, 200 ml of air injected rapidly into stomach through a gastric tube was seen to induce gallbladder expansion. These results suggest that the gallbladder expands in response to feeding via a cholinergic vago-vagal reflex."

CD012083,0,11874558,0,Low antroduodenal pressure gradients are responsible for gastric emptying of a low-caloric liquid meal in humans.,"The motor mechanisms responsible for transpyloric flow of gastric contents are still poorly understood. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between luminal pressures and gastric wall motion and between gastroduodenal pressure gradients and pressure waves, and ante- and retro-grade transpyloric flow. In eight healthy volunteers, intraluminal pressures were recorded from the antrum and proximal duodenum. Transpyloric flow was monitored simultaneously using duplex ultrasonography, before, during and after ingestion of 300 mL meat soup. Transpyloric emptying occurred as sequences of alternating periods of emptying-reflux-emptying. Approximately one-third of the sequences were not associated with peristalsis. The antroduodenal pressure gradients were significantly lower during nonperistaltic-related emptying than during peristaltic-related emptying (0.15 (0-0.3) kPa, and 1.7 (0.2-2.0) kPa, respectively [mean plus minus (range)], P < 0.005). The duration of emptying episodes not associated with peristalsis were significantly longer than those associated with peristalsis at (6.5 (3-8.7) s and 4.4 (2-6) s, respectively, P=0.059). Manometry detected only 56% of the antral contractions seen on ultrasound. We concluded that gastric emptying of a low-calorie liquid meal occurs both during peristaltic and nonperistaltic antral activity. In spite of lower antroduodenal pressure gradients, the emptying episodes were longer for nonperistaltic emptying, which is likely to be caused by low pyloric resistance. Considerable flow seems to occur without peristalsis during gastric emptying of a low-calorie, liquid meal in humans."

CD012083,0,11680941,0,Intussusception during enteral nutrition: a case report.,"We report a case of intussusception during enteral nutrition after esophagectomy. The case was a 60-year-old patient who underwent subtotal esophagectomy via the right thoraco-abdominal approach, reconstructed with esophagogastrostomy. He underwent tube feeding through gastrostomy after surgery. The tip of the feeding tube was emplaced in the jejunum. He complained of intermittent abdominal pain and the drainage volume through the gastric decompression tube was increased on the 2nd week from surgery. There was no abnormal finding on abdominal CT or or radiography of the digestive tract, and so a diagnosis of intussusception was made and laparotomy was performed. There was descending intussusception with the jejunum where the feeding tube was emplaced. Enterectomy was not necessary in this case. Adult intussusception is rare. The surgery is sometimes the cause for intussusception. Another cause is use of a long intestinal tube. Since enteral nutrition has priority for nutritional support after esophagectomy, it is important to make an early decision whether surgical intervention is required or not, using abdominal examination by CT, ultrasound and contrast radiography, when bowel obstruction occurs during enteral nutrition through a feeding tube."
CD012083,0,8211045,0,[Assessment of gastric emptying].,"In the absence of overt mucosal lesions, abnormalities of gastroduodenal motorfunction are considered to be important in the pathogenesis of many upper abdominal symptoms. These may be idiopathic, occur following gastric surgery, or in association with diseases such as diabetes mellitus. A variety of investigations have been developed to examine the motility of the stomach and duodenum. To date the most reliable and useful techniques are those which assess gastric transit either radiologically or scintigraphically. Assessment of the expulsion of radio-opaque gastric markers with a single abdominal x-ray can be performed as a simple outpatient screening procedure. More precise radioisotopic definition of delayed gastric emptying, however, requires access to a Nuclear Medicine Department. A number of other approaches are currently under investigation as potential diagnostic tests. The future role of these techniques is unclear, although 13C breath testing may soon permit rapid and simple screening of gastric emptying abnormalities without exposure to ionizing radiation. At present, other techniques such as ultrasound, antropyloroduodenal manometry, and magnetic resonance imaging have application only in research centers."
CD012083,0,10522616,0,Complete recovery after spontaneous drainage of pancreatic abscess into the stomach.,"Pancreatic abscess is a dreaded complication of acute pancreatitis, with a high death rate even with aggressive surgical treatment. We report two cases in which recovery followed spontaneous drainage into the stomach. A 75-year-old woman with biliary pancreatitis and a 63-year-old man with ethanol-induced pancreatitis both developed pancreatic abscess, diagnosed by computed tomography scans and ultrasound. The spontaneous gastric fistula was heralded by a large emesis of purulent and necrotic material in one case and copious nasogastric tube secretions of a similar material in the other. Defervescence was immediate, and both patients went on to complete recovery without any further interventions. Contrast studies showed the fistulae. It is concluded that in the event that a pancreatic pseudocyst spontaneously drains into the stomach a 'wait and see' policy should be adopted, and a favorable outcome can be expected."

Postoperatively there was no problem concerning liver function and surgical morbidity. In real-time sonography the aberrant artery could be postoperatively seen precisely in 19%, but duplex signal was found in 63%. Limited visualization in sonography may be caused by technical problems due to anatomy and overlying air from small-bowel reconstruction after gastrectomy."

Nasogastric tube aspiration got more than 50 ml of blood-tinged fluid. Roentgenography demonstrated a high jejunal obstruction as well as a normally rotated colon. Laparotomy disclosed proximal jejunal atresia with typical ""apple peel"" appearance of the distal small bowel. An end-to-end anastomosis was performed smoothly after resection of both the proximal and distal small bowels. A reduction tapering antimesenteric jejunoplasty was also done.

CD012083,0,18094979,0,Non-endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy placement in children with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.,"Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is associated with high nutritional demands, esophageal strictures and dysphagia. About one quarter of the patients require gastrostomy tube placement to maintain adequate nutritional status. To minimize trauma to the skin and pharyngoesophageal mucosa caused by commonly used gastrostomy tube insertion techniques, we used a non-endoscopic, percutaneous, image-guided approach. This approach combines the use of ultrasound for mapping of the liver and spleen, water-soluble contrast enema to visualize the colon, and gastric insufflation to define the stomach. The gastrostomy tube is replaced by a low-profile button gastrostomy tube 10-12 weeks postoperatively. The five female patients reported in this series ranged in age from 6 to 9 years. They all tolerated the procedure well and no perioperative complications were encountered. All were able to tolerate feedings on postoperative day 1 and all underwent successful replacement of gastrostomy tubes by low-profile button tubes. Our experience suggests that a non-endoscopic, image-guided approach to gastrostomy tube placement offers a safe, effective, and minimally traumatic alternative to more commonly used approaches. It minimizes the risk of procedure-related morbidity and leads to overall improvement in the quality of life. As such, we strongly recommend that it be included in the treatment armamentarium for patients with epidermolysis bullosa and nutritional failure."

After 1 month he presented with colicky type of pain in the abdomen and vomiting. Sonogram of abdomen revealed a target sign and a feeding tube in a dilated jejunum. Abdominal CT proved the sonographic impression of jejuno-jejunal intussusception. He, therefore, underwent exploratory laparotomy and resection and anastomosis of the intussuscepted bowel.

CD012083,0,10453304,0,Recent advances in the placement of tubes for enteral nutrition.,"Enteral nutrition is the preferred route for nutritional support compared with parenteral nutrition if the gastrointestinal tract is functionally preserved. Long-standing nasogastric or nasoenteric feeding tubes are not well tolerated. Alternative routes are gastrostomy and jejunostomy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy or those guided by fluoroscopy, sonography or tomography should be the first choices. Laparoscopy or laparotomy gastrostomy/jejunostomy routes should be reserved for specific situations. Insufflation of the stomach with air or saline solution facilitates the placement of nasoenteric feeding tubes or percutaneous sonographic-guided gastrostomy. The gastrostomy button is a safe and aesthetic alternative, at least in children. Comparison between percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and surgical gastrostomy performed either via laparotomy or laparoscopy favours the first in terms of costs and risks. Whenever associated intra-abdominal procedures or anatomic difficulties arise, a laparoscopic or an open access becomes necessary. Complications with feeding tubes are not uncommon and should be promptly recognized and treated."
CD012083,0,9595928,0,[The role of jejunal feeding in the treatment of acute necrotizing pancreatitis and in recurrence of chronic pancreatitis with severe necrosis].,"Acute necrotising is the most serious form of pancreatic inflammatory diseases leading to multiorgan failure and high (15-20%) mortality. The poor nutritional and metabolic condition of the patient and secondary bacterial translocation further rise the mortality. A recently introduced method of continuous nasojejunal feeding putting the pancreas into rest with basal pattern of secretion resulted in lower mortality rate by using adequate nutrition into the second loop of jejunum bypassing duodenopancreatic stimulations via an endoscopically placed feeding tube. The better nutritional and immunological states of the patients, the restored absorption and intestinal motility promote the recovery of pancreatitis, prevent bacterial translocation, resulting in time and in financial spares. Although surgery is occasionally inevitable because of progression of pancreatitis, nasojejunal feeding improves the general condition of patients more efficiently than parenteral nutrition and makes the scheduling of the operation optimal. The authors retrospectively analyse the results of treatment in 56 patients suffering from acute necrotising pancreatitis, as well as in 30 patients with chronic pancreatitis accompanied with more than 20% of necrosis in the pancreas and admitted to their gastroenterological medical department during 5 years. The effect of parenteral nutrition were less beneficial than that of jejunal feeding regarding the mortality and the necessity of operative interventions. Chronic pancreatitis with severe necrosis behaved similarly to the acute necrotising pancreatitis. The continuous nasojejunal feeding seems to be a promising new method for acute necrotising pancreatitis preventing complications and severe catabolic state of the disease by a cost--effective manner."

Surgery has proved to be one of the most effective methods of helping patients to achieve sustainable weight loss. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a relatively new bariatric surgical technique. A staple line is placed in a line parallel to the lesser curve of the stomach, excluding up to 85% of the volume of the stomach. The excluded stomach is then resected leaving a 'tube' of residual stomach. Radiologists may be asked to perform and interpret imaging studies in the postoperative period and should be familiar with the normal appearances and common complications. Postoperative radiological investigations will typically be for suspected leak or obstruction. A water soluble contrast upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series should be performed in both suspected leak and obstruction if the patient is conscious and able to swallow. A normal postoperative UGI series will show free flow of contrast into the gastric remnant, which will be tubular with no spillage of contrast beyond the staple line, which is located on the caudal aspect of the gastric remnant. Stenosis or obstruction of the stomach may occur if the stomach remnant is too tight or torsion of the stomach. Stenosis is usually treated endoscopically with dilation and torsion is treated surgically. Leaks are often treated with covered stents which may be placed with endoscopic or radiological guidance. Collections may be drained under fluoroscopic, ultrasound or computed tomography guidance."

Having previously taught radiology at the University of Nairobi, Kenya, for 4 months in 1992, I felt prepared for the advanced diseases, limited supplies, broken equipment, and challenging environment that I would encounter in Nepal. The Radiology Outreach Foundation sponsored me (W. E. Brant) for 3 months to teach radiology at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) in Kathmandu in the spring of 1995. I was concerned about how effective my teaching would be, how well I could relate to the local conditions of practice, and whether my English-only language skills would be sufficient. My hosts in Nepal proved as eager to teach me as to learn from me. I was captivated by the ability of the TUTH faculty to innovate. Nephrostomy drainage could be accomplished with a feeding tube or refashioned angiography catheter (Fig. 1). Complete aspiration of a hepatic abscess could and should be performed with a single needle at the time of diagnosis because the patient may never be able to return for follow up. One day's film review revealed every manifestation of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), as well as worms in the bile ducts and hydatid cysts in the liver. Without CT scanning, sonography was the prime diagnostic tool. Although my prepared lectures were well received, teaching is best accomplished while the daily film stack and with sonography transducer in hand.

The tubes had been in place for 3 and 4 weeks, respectively, in the first two infants when classic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) was found during fundoplication and gastrostomy tube placement. The last child had a failed attempt at nasogastric tube feedings following 3 months of nasojejunal tube feedings. A repeat ugi suggested HPS, which was confirmed by pyloric ultrasound. This infant underwent pyloromyotomy alone. The late presentation of HPS in these infants suggests that transpyloric tubes might cause the development of HPS and exacerbate the symptoms of preexisting GER. In infants who are expected to eat by mouth, pyloromyotomy alone might allow the reinstitution of orogastric feedings without the perioperative morbidity of fundoplication and gastrostomy tube placement."

CD012083,0,6826724,0,Gallbladder and small intestinal regulation of biliary lipid secretion during intraduodenal infusion of standard stimuli.,"The gallbladder and small intestine are reservoirs for the bile acid pool during its enterohepatic circulation and, as such, may regulate biliary secretion of bile acid. During studies of biliary bile acid secretion, a stimulus to gallbladder contraction is continuously infused into the duodenum. Under these conditions, it is assumed that the gallbladder is tonically contracted and that the rate of bile acid secretion into the duodenum equals the hepatic bile acid secretion rate. However, secretion rates vary by as much as 100%, depending upon which of two standard stimuli is used. Therefore, we studied the role of gallbladder emptying and small intestinal transit in determining biliary lipid secretion rate and composition during infusion of these stimuli in five healthy subjects. Each subject was studied with a liquid formula containing 40% of calories as fat, and with an amino acid solution for 10 h. Bile acid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and markers were measured in duodenal bile and hourly secretion rates were calculated by marker dilution technique. Real-time gallbladder sonographs and serum pancreatic polypeptide levels were obtained every 30 min. Small bowel transit time was estimated levels were obtained every 30 min. Small bowel transit time was estimated by the breath hydrogen response after giving lactulose intraduodenally.During liquid formula infusion, gallbladder emptying was more complete, small intestinal transit was faster, and pancreatic polypeptide levels were higher. Secretion rates of all lipids were greater and molar percent cholesterol was lower. For the combined data from both infusions, the secretory relationships of cholesterol to bile acid, cholesterol to phospholipid, and phospholipid to bile acid were curvilinear. We conclude that more complete gallbladder emptying and faster intestinal transit increase the enterohepatic cycling of bile acids and lower the molar percent cholesterol of bile. Some of the fluctuation observed in biliary lipid secretion rates, especially during amino acid infusion, is due to gallbladder refilling and emptying."

CD012083,0,9589929,0,[The clinical significance of phasic duodenal intubation and ultrasonic monitoring of the gallbladder in healthy subjects].,"Overall twelve essentially healthy subjects were evaluated for the tone and contractile function of the gallbladder according to phases of interdigestive motility of duodenum as were for effects on these functions of phase-by-phase administration of 30 ml of 33% solution of magnesium sulphate. The gallbladder in healthy individuals was found out to function according to phases of duodenal interdigestive motility and be ready to evacuate bile during phase II. Prior diagnostic techniques did not take advantage of interdigestive phase of duodenal and gallbladder motility during which phase a standard stimulating agent was routinely employed. This can lead to wrong diagnosis of the functional state of the biliary tract, gallbladder and their sphincters in the interdigestive period: incomplete gallbladder emptying from bile in case the stimulating agent is being introduced during phase I or III; hyperdiagnosis of cholecystitis; heterodirectivity of the same patient's notion about type of dyskinesias of the gallbladder and biliary tract."

Questionnaires were sent to 75 cardiothoracic surgeons, known to perform thoracic surgery regularly; we had a 100% response. The commonest preoperative investigations for carcinoma of the oesophagus were serum alkaline phosphatase (90%), GGT (69%), contrast swallow (80%), ultrasound of abdomen (71%) and CT scan of chest and abdomen (60%). After oesophagectomy, 84% of the surgeons inserted nasogastric tubes and 31% sent their patients to the intensive care unit. Oral fluids were started on days 3-5 in 81% of cases, and 58% of the surgeons requested a postoperative contrast swallow, usually between the seventh and tenth postoperative days, after oral fluids had been started. Most of the surgeons nearly always used staplers for a given procedure or else completely avoided them for that part of the operation. The commonest use of staplers was for bronchial closure in pneumonectomy (67%) and lobectomy (48%) and in constructing an oesophageal anastomosis (25%). Twenty per cent of the surgeons did not insert a chest drain after pneumonectomy, while 65% observed the protocol of chest drain insertion with short intermittent unclamping, usually every hour, followed by removal of the drain, usually the next morning. Thoracic surgeons vary widely in their surgical practices.

It may result in narrowing of the esophageal lumen through fibrosis and esophageal stricture in rare situations, mostly encountered in children. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of esophageal stricture secondary to allopurinol-induced TEN in an adult patient. A 70-year-old male presented to our clinic with severe dysphagia secondary to allopurinol-induced TEN involving his mouth and esophagus. At the time of presentation the patient had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding tube and was unable to handle his oral secretions. Endoscopy revealed near complete proximal esophageal stricture. A bidirectional esophageal dilatation procedure via the mouth and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site was successfully performed over a guidewire for treatment of this patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with dilation was performed in a regular anterograde fashion five times over the next three months.

CD012083,0,6676962,0,Transgastric ultrasonography of the pancreas.,"This is a report of initial experience gained with the transgastric diagnostic examination of the pancreas in a total of 80 patients. The examinations were carried out with two different instruments. One of the two fiberscopes carries on its tip a mechanical sector scanner, the scan plane of which is angulated through 90 degrees vis-a-vis the longitudinal axis of the instrument. The other ultrasonic endoscope is provided with an ultrasonic linear array assembly arranged along the longitudinal axis of the instrument. The sonic frequency is 7 and 7.5 MHz, respectively, so that the quality of resolution obtained is equal to that of a ""small parts"" scanner. Intubation of the stomach is readily possible with either instrument. In contrast, owing to the relatively long flexible tip of the instrument, intubation of the duodenum proved impossible in about one quarter of the patients, in particular when the duodenum was deformed by scar tissue. The topographic-anatomic orientation proved difficult, in particular since the scan planes are strictly determined by the position of the endoscope. A systematic examination of the pancreas in two planes is, as a result, virtually impossible. All in all, therefore, the technique must be considered merely as a supplementary procedure to external diagnostic ultrasonography. Thanks to its superior resolution, and the avoidance of such obstacles as ""bowel gas"", however, it is capable, as a supplementary examination, of providing additional diagnostic information about lesions of the pancreas."

Although lubricating jelly is useful during the insertion phase, insertion can still cause great discomfort. Furthermore, the jelly is rapidly absorbed and therefore is unable to decrease the friction between the tissues and the tube during the indwelling phase of the nasogastric tube. The aim of this study was to test a device, the NG-Shield, that generates surface acoustic waves on the surfaces of the nasogastric tube to reduce contact time and thus friction between the nasogastric tube and body tissues."

Ileus developed postoperatively and plain X-ray of the abdomen showed distended small bowel loop with scanty colon gas. Small bowel series performed with water-soluble contrast medium revealed substantial fluid retention in the stomach, duodenum and proximal jejunum. Infusion of contrast medium into the feeding tube revealed normal caliber of the distal small bowel. Abdominal sonogram revealed target sign as well as the feeding tube in a dilated jejunum. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed the sonographic impression of jejunojejunal intussusception. Reduction of intussusception was done during exploratory laparotomy.

We recently cared for two infants who presented with clinical deterioration. An abnormally placed feeding tube seen on the chest radiograph revealed underlying serious conditions. The first case was an infant 29 weeks of age who presented with right-sided pneumothorax after birth. By history and a right-side-displaced orogastric (OG) tube, iatrogenic esophageal perforation was diagnosed. The second case was a 16-day-old infant who presented with recurrent vomiting. An OG tube extending into a cystic mass at the right cardiophrenic angle resulted in diagnosis of a herniated stomach with organoaxial-type volvulus, which required surgical repair. Both cases recovered uneventfully. As illustrated in these two rare cases, feeding tube position is not only important for feeding practice, but it also has diagnostic implications in newborn infants."

CD012083,0,8085760,0,[Large calculi of the common bile duct. Value of lithotripsy].,"Certain stones need to be fragmented before being extracted via endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES). From April 1988 to December 1991, extracorporeal lithotripsy was used in this indication in 28 patients (22 females, 6 males) with a mean age of 77 +/- 20 years, using an ultrasound-guided electrohydraulic lithotriptor. Stone detection was performed after perfusion of the nasogastric tube and was easy in 20 cases (71%), difficult in 6 cases (22%) and impossible in 2 cases (7%), which could not be treated by this method. The patients had an average of 1.4 +/- 0.9 stones measuring 19.6 +/- 8 mm and received an average of 2.480 +/- 580 shock waves in a single session for 24 patients and in two sessions for 2 patients. Radiologically obvious fragmentation was achieved in 11 out of 26 cases (42%) and was found to be effective at a further extraction attempt in 4 other cases. Complete clearance of the common bile duct was achieved in 15 cases (57.7%). The size of the stones (> or < 20 mm) and the solitary or multiple nature of the stones did not significantly influence the fragmentation results. No complication related to the technique was observed apart from the constant development of cutaneous petechiae. An improvement in the power of the generator and the use of fluoroscopic rather than ultrasonographic guidance should allow an improvement of these results in the future. Because of its safety, this lithotripsy method can be proposed following failure of mechanical lithotripsy."

A mild amount of free fluid in the pelvis was found on abdominal ultrasound but there was no sonographic evidence of a pelvic mass or of a tubo-ovarian abscess. Plain radiography and computer tomography (with contrast) of the abdomen revealed a high-grade partial small bowel obstruction. Conservative treatment, which included intravenous fluids and antibiotics together with continuous bowel decompression via nasogastric tube, led to resolution of the small bowel obstruction within 2 days and to resumption of oral feeding within 4 days of treatment. Follow-up for 6 months after this episode was uneventful. The present case calls for inclusion of plain radiography of the abdomen in the evaluation of PID associated with emesis.

Polyhydramnios is associated with a wide range of fetal abnormalities, but most commonly it pursues a benign course. Similarly the sonographic absence of a stomach bubble may point to a variety of fetal anomalies.The combination of polyhydramnios and absent stomach bubble in two small series offers a modest positive predictive value of 44 and 56% respectively. Prenatal scanning for EA/TEF identifies a larger proportion of fetuses with Edwards syndrome; there is also a higher proportion of isolated EA in comparison to postnatal studies.Current ultrasound technology does not allow for a definite diagnosis of EA/TEF and therefore, counseling of parents should be guarded.Postnatal diagnosis of EA is confirmed by the failure to pass a firm nasogastric tube into the stomach; on chest X-ray, the tube is seen curling in the upper esophageal pouch.

CD012083,0,24079990,0,Transient left ventricular and stomach apical ballooning syndromes: when the trigger is also a clinical emergency.,"A 59-year-old woman was referred to our emergency department because of epigastric pain and incoercible vomit. Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in anterior-lateral leads, but coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary tree and left ventricular angiography showed apical and midventricular akinesis with preserved basal systolic function: a diagnosis of apical ballooning syndrome was made. During the following days, the patient complained about persistent abdominal pain, and a nasogastric tube drained more than 1000 cc of dark fecaloid material. Urgent abdominal computed tomography scan showed a mural thrombus in the apex of the left ventricle and a huge diaphragmatic hernia through which more than one-half of the stomach was herniated and presented a sort of “apical stomach ballooning.” Gastropexy was done; surgical diagnosis was a type IV giant diaphragmatic hernia complicated by recent gastric volvulus caused by rotation along the longitudinal cardiopyloric axis. Type IV giant diaphragmatic hernia is relatively rare, representing only about 5% to 7% of all hernias. Gastric volvulus is a severe complication, with acute mortality reported to be as high as 30% to 50%. In our case, a severe life-threatening condition as gastric volvulus triggered an apical ballooning syndrome, a transient cardiomyopathy, usually induced by emotional stressors with a long-term good prognosis. Apical ballooning syndrome must be considered an epiphenomenon of other organic diseases that may have an important role in the prognosis of the patient not only in acute but also in chronic setting. Only early determination of the true cause of apical ballooning syndrome ensures a proper treatment."

CD012083,0,2076720,0,Effects of cimetropium bromide on gallbladder contraction in response to oral and intraduodenal olive oil.,"To evaluate the influence of the stomach and the cholinergic system on gallbladder contraction induced by physiological stimuli, the reduction in gallbladder volume in 7 healthy volunteers has been studied by real-time ultrasonography after the oral and intraduodenal administration of olive oil, preceded by pretreatment with cimetropium bromide or placebo. After an overnight fast, each subject swallowed 50 ml olive oil or it was administered through a naso-duodenal tube in the proximal duodenum. Cimetropium bromide 5 mg or placebo was given intravenously under double-blind control. After the placebo pretreatment, gallbladder contraction was greater and faster after intraduodenal oil than after oral oil. Cimetropium bromide decreased the extent, velocity and duration of gallbladder contraction induced by intraduodenal olive oil but it only reduced the velocity of the contraction induced by oil given orally. It is concluded that in normal human subjects the stomach modulates the extent and velocity of postprandial gallbladder contraction and that anticholinergic agents antagonize the gastric and duodenal phases of the response of the gallbladder to a meal."

A 59-year-old woman who had previously undergone esophagectomy for leiomyosarcoma was admitted in a state of hypovolemic shock. Ultrasonography revealed multiple tumors in the left lobe of the liver and massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage, confirmed by paracentesis, possibly due to spontaneous rupture. Subsequent hepatic angiography showed extravasation from the tumor, and embolization of the feeding left hepatic artery was performed. After achieving hemostasis, a left hepatic lobectomy was carried out just beneath the reconstructed stomach tube. The patient made an uneventful recovery and remains well after one year. Emergency arterial embolization followed by hepatectomy is an appropriate treatment for patients with spontaneous rupture of liver metastases."
CD012083,0,8223812,0,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia presenting after the newborn period.,"Late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is often difficult to diagnose and delay in treatment is common. Seven patients were operated beyond the newborn period for left-sided Bochdaleck hernia. Their age ranged from 1 month to 9 years. Six of them became symptomatic within the 1st year of life (1 week to 9 months of age). Either feeding difficulties or recurrent respiratory infections were initially present. In all of them chest X-rays were performed but delay in diagnosis ranged from 1 week to 5 years. All diaphragmatic defects could be closed by an abdominal approach without postoperative complications. Clinical symptoms disappeared postoperatively. In children with respiratory complaints or feeding difficulties one should be aware of late presenting CDH. A careful analysis of chest films and searching for ""connecting"" bowel segments passing through the diaphragmatic defect may help to avoid incorrect diagnosis and undesirable delay in treatment. Confusion with pneumonia or pneumothorax can be diminished by placing a feeding tube and instillation of contrast material. Ultrasound should be used supportively in all suspected diseases of the diaphragm."
CD012083,0,21819484,0,Safe esophageal reconstruction by ileocolic interposition.,"Many techniques have been proposed for esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy when a gastric tube cannot be employed. There are two essential criteria for such a substitute: substitute length and sufficient blood supply. We propose ileocolic interposition as an easy and safe option. Two technical aspects contributing to the high success rate of this method are the preservation of an intact arterial network allowing normal blood flow to the ileocolic area, and the ability to quantify blood flow using a Doppler pulse flow meter in six cases. These are enabled by a long (up to 20cm) ileocolic segment. The preservation of the right colic artery is important, because its interruption would reduce blood supply to the long ileum segment. Between July 2003 and October 2008, we used this method in six patients in whom a gastric tube was not an option. We assessed perioperative morbidity and swallowing difficulties in each patient, quantifying dysphagia on scale of 0 to 4. There was no mortality and no anastomotic leak. There was one wound infection, and in one patient, recurrent nerve paralysis was observed. The postoperative hospital stay was 29.5 ± 10.8 days. The average dysphagia score for the six patients was 0.17 ± 0.41 after the operation. All patients can eat normally, without any dietary limitations. Ileocolonic interposition after esophagectomy requires careful assessment of the vascular supply. In this small series, morbidity was low and there was no perioperative mortality. We believe that this is an easy and safe method of reconstruction after esophagectomy in cases in whom a gastric tube cannot be used as a substitute."

The therapeutic procedures have to cure the stasis. In the case of mechanical obstruction cure is achieved by operation, while functional ileus may be healed by conservative treatment. Implantation of a gastric tube or Dennis' tube can evacuate the small intestine. Several peristalsis-inducing drugs are in use, although their clinical relevance remaines to be demonstrated. Clinical examination and anamnesis offer initial information; X-ray of the abdomen confirms the diagnosis of ileus and is the baseline examination.

CD012083,0,11021010,0,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia misdiagnosed as pneumothorax in a newborn.,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is usually left sided and has a large defect allowing abdominal viscera herniated into thoracic cavity. The chest films usually show air-filled stomach and/or loops of bowel in the ipsilateral hemithorax with mediastinal shift. We report a newborn with CDH, presenting as hyperlucent hemithorax, right-shifted mediastinum, apparently normal pattern of abdominal bowel gas, with the tip of nasogastric tube below the left hemidiaphragm on the radiograph. It was initially misdiagnosed as pneumothorax, and the acute respiratory distress was temporarily relieved by needle aspiration. Hyperlucent hemithorax due to intrathoracic gastric dilatation alone is an unusual presentation of CDH in neonatal period. Absence of stomach bubble in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, in both radiography and abdominal sonography, is an important clue to make diagnosis of CDH in this misleading condition."

This chapter surveys these methods, subdividing them into a) measurements; b) Doppler and c) imaging. The survey ranges from early work of Cieszynski on the feasibility of echocardiography to more recent intra-arterial catheter tip Doppler with guidewire and balloon as described by Serruys. Examples of ultrasound catheter tip echography in combination with other techniques such as angioscopy, laser ablation and spark erosion are also described. Today practical approaches are limited to imaging only. The three major approaches for catheter tip echo imaging are described and compared.

CD012083,0,12819458,0,Doppler-based hemodynamic monitoring: a minimally invasive alternative.,"Doppler-based hemodynamic assessment affords a magnitude of diagnostic applications including evaluation of blood flow from the left ventricle. Doppler echocardiography, in the form of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, allows for intermittent evaluation of hemodynamic information including aortic blood flow, global and regional wall motion, and valvular integrity. In the hands of a skilled operator, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography provides reliable cardiac output determinations. However, these are not considered routine for hemodynamic monitoring in the critically ill. Neither of the echocardiographic approaches provides the continuously available data needed for ongoing evaluation of response to interventions. In contrast, esophageal Doppler monitoring, a minimally invasive hemodynamic assessment tool, provides the ability for ongoing real-time hemodynamic assessment of the critically ill or compromised patient. This simple-to-use technology requires that a probe, similar in size and shape to a gastric tube, be inserted into the esophagus to obtain measurement of blood flow in the descending aorta. Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac output, preload, afterload, and contractility are measured or derived from the esophageal Doppler monitoring waveform."
CD012083,0,15593456,0,Outcomes after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for early gastric cancer: a prospective multicenter trial.,"The aim of the present study was to compare in a prospective, multicenter trial the results early and late after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) versus conventional distal gastrectomy (CDG) with Billroth I anastomosis for early gastric cancer. Eighty-one patients with early gastric cancer were randomized and then underwent either PPG or CDG. Duration of operation, intraoperative blood loss, days until removal of the nasogastric tube, days until start of oral intake, and decrease in body weight were studied as parameters for outcomes early after the surgery. Late results were studied in patients followed for longer than 3 years. Change in body weight, status of oral intake, symptoms suggesting early dumping syndrome, and overall satisfaction were addressed in the questionnaire. The presence of gallstones was examined with ultrasonography. There were no differences in early results between PPG and CDG. The incidence of early dumping syndrome was lower in PPG (8%) than in CDG (33%). Other late results including the incidence of gallstones were not different between the 2 groups. These results indicate that PPG is as safe as CDG and has an advantage in terms of early dumping syndrome."
CD012083,0,10803831,0,The role of laparoscopy in the treatment of intra-abdominal malignancies.,"The role of laparoscopy in the care of patients with cancer is currently evolving. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have attempted to elucidate the nature and cause of port-site metastases--particularly to discern whether they simply are a marker of advanced disease, or if they are a result of the laparoscopic intervention. Laparoscopy has a role in establishing the diagnosis of cancer in some situations by allowing biopsy of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses, lymph nodes, and visceral lesions, as well as examination of abdominal contents under direct vision or with ultrasound probes. Laparoscopy is useful in the staging of established malignancies such as pancreatic cancer, hepatic lesions, lymphoma, and esophageal cancer. Laparoscopy also has a role in the surgical treatment of a variety of malignancies, including gastric carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, splenic malignancies, adrenal cancers, and colon cancer. The safety of laparoscopy for the definitive resection of colon cancer has not yet been proven, and until the results of a randomized prospective trial currently underway are known, should be performed only in the context of a clinical trial. Lastly, laparoscopy can play an important role in the palliative care of the cancer patient in performing procedures such as feeding-tube placement or intestinal stoma creation. It is imperative that using laparoscopy in the care of patients with malignancies be carefully and thoroughly evaluated since this technique can either benefit or adversely affect survival or quality of life."
CD012083,0,15520484,0,Abdominal tuberculosis.,"Tuberculosis can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is the sixth most frequent site of extrapulmonary involvement. Both the incidence and severity of abdominal tuberculosis are expected to increase with increasing incidence of HIV infection. Tuberculosis bacteria reach the gastrointestinal tract via haematogenous spread, ingestion of infected sputum, or direct spread from infected contiguous lymph nodes and fallopian tubes. The gross pathology is characterized by transverse ulcers, fibrosis, thickening and stricturing of the bowel wall, enlarged and matted mesenteric lymph nodes, omental thickening, and peritoneal tubercles. Peritoneal tuberculosis occurs in three forms : wet type with ascitis, dry type with adhesions, and fibrotic type with omental thickening and loculated ascites. The most common site of involvement of the gastrointestinal tuberculosis is the ileocaecal region. Ileocaecal and small bowel tuberculosis presents with a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant and/or complications of obstruction, perforation or malabsorption especially in the presence of stricture. Rare clinical presentations include dysphagia, odynophagia and a mid oesophageal ulcer due to oesophageal tuberculosis, dyspepsia and gastric outlet obstruction due to gastroduodenal tuberculosis, lower abdominal pain and haematochezia due to colonic tuberculosis, and annular rectal stricture and multiple perianal fistulae due to rectal and anal involvement. Chest X-rays show evidence of concomitant pulmonary lesions in less than 25 per cent of cases. Useful modalities for investigating a suspected case include small bowel barium meal, barium enema, ultrasonography, computed tomographic scan and colonoscopy. Ascitic fluid examination reveals straw coloured fluid with high protein, serum ascitis albumin gradient less than 1.1 g/dl, predominantly lymphocytic cells, and adenosine deaminase levels above 36 U/l. Laparoscopy is a very useful investigation in doubtful cases. Management is with conventional antitubercular therapy for at least 6 months. The recommended surgical procedures today are conservative and a period of preoperative drug therapy is controversial."
CD012083,0,10603138,0,Conservative treatment for chronic renal failure from birth: a 3-year follow-up study.,"Fifteen children with chronic renal failure from early infancy who did not require renal replacement therapy were followed for 3 years. Chronic renal failure was defined as a serum creatinine at or above 1 mg/dl for the entire 1st year of life. These patients were treated conservatively with diet and supplements of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, calcium and vitamin D. Erythropoietin was given to 5 patients. Neither nasogastric nor gastrostomy tube feeding was used, and none of the patients received recombinant human growth hormone. We analyzed length, weight, and head circumference at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months of age. All three variables displayed a significant drop in the first 3 months, but remained stable for the whole observation period thereafter. At the age of 3 years, the patients' mean values of length, weight, and head circumference standard deviation score were -1.96, -1.37, and -1.07, respectively. Height velocity during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year was 22.2, 10.9, and 7.6 cm per year, respectively. The first two figures and the cumulative height velocity are significantly better than those from a large cohort of chronic renal failure patients collected by the European Study Group for Nutritional Treatment of Chronic Renal Failure in Childhood; here the corresponding figures of height velocity were 12.3, 8.3, and 7.6 cm per year. Median serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and albumin levels remained within normal limits for the entire study period. Therapy-resistant hyperparathyroidism occurred in 1 patient and radiological signs of renal osteodystrophy in 4 patients. Kidney length, as measured by ultrasonography, showed almost no growth."

CD012083,0,14567739,0,Xanthelasma or xanthoma of the fallopian tube.,"We report a case of a 24-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, a tense abdomen, and rebound tenderness. A vague, ill-defined mass was palpated, and an ultrasound examination revealed a cystic lesion in the left adnexal region. At laparotomy, a slightly dilated fallopian tube was seen and excised. Light microscopy showed intact fallopian tube mucosa, with a diffuse infiltrate of foam cells in the lamina propria. There were no associated inflammatory cells. The foam cells were positive for CD68 and negative for AE1/AE3. Discontinuous areas of the epithelium also showed epithelial cells with ""foamy cytoplasm."" These cells were negative for CD68 but positive for AE1/AE3. To our knowledge, this represents the first case of a fallopian tube xanthelasma that shows a resemblance to lesions encountered in the stomach. Fallopian tube xanthelasma must be distinguished from xanthogranulomatous salpingitis, which is associated with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, often including giant cells. However, this lesion may share pathogenetic similarities with xanthogranulomatous salpingitis, since both processes are mediated by inflammation."
CD012083,0,12918205,0,[The enteral feeding during the treatment of appendicular peritonitis in children].,"A total of 65 patients, aged 3 to 14, with different forms of appendicular peritonitis, in whom the intestinal insufficiency syndrome (IIS), stage 2, was diagnosed, were investigated. 35 patients were in the main group, and 30 patients were in the control group; the subjects of the latter group had a similar form of peritonitis, i.e. IIS, stage 2, it was confirmed clinically and by ultrasound examinations. The laparoscopic operations were carried out in all patients. The patients of both groups received postoperatively a similar therapy, i.e. the antibacterial, metabolic and infusive ones, as well as vitamins and parenteral feeding (daily caloric values--50-120 kcal/kg, protein--2-3 g/kg/day) according to a child's age and a clinical course of peritonitis. All children of the main group received postoperatively an early enteral therapy (EET), which involved 4 stages. Stage 1: introduction of the salt solution with added glutamine through the naso-gastric probe by increasing volumes and with respect to an individual tolerability of a patient; stage 2: introduction of semi-element mixtures; stage 3: introduction of 10% solutions of polymer balanced mixture; stage 4: introduction of 20% solutions of polymer mixtures. Ultrasound scanning and clinical methods were used to assess the efficiency of the recovery of intestinal peristalsis. The conducted investigations showed that the mean duration of the gastric-type EET amounted to 3-4 days, and the IIS was, on the average, arrested by days 6 or 7. The duration of infusive therapy and parenteral feeding went down, in the main group, by 2 days. A trend towards an increase of the erythrocyte level was noted in these patients. No differences were registered in the values of concentrations of total protein and albumin in the blood serum of patients in both groups from the 1st to 7th postoperative days, however, the infusions of plasma and albumin were made by 2 times more often in the main group as compared to the control one. The EET technique preserved the gastric mucous tunic intact, which cut the postoperative complications 2-fold, and consequently, it reduced the stay of patients in hospital on the average by 8 days. A conclusion was made, on the basis of the conducted study, that EET is a pathophysiologically substantiated treatment method for IIS, stage 2, in children with appendicular peritonitis; EET ensures a rapid recovery of gastric-tract functions, it reduces the frequency rate of postoperative complications and cuts the length of both the infusive therapy and of the patients' stay in hospital."
CD012083,0,18158671,0,Integration of role-playing into technical skills training: a randomized controlled trial.,"Recently, efforts have been undertaken to enhance the face validity of technical skills training by introducing role-plays and standardised patients. Since little is known about the effects of role-playing with respect to the realism of a training situation and students' objective performance, we performed a randomized controlled trial."
CD012083,0,15370684,0,Effect of ethanol and some alcoholic beverages on gastric emptying in humans.,"There is a paucity of detailed and controlled studies on the action of ethanol and alcoholic beverages on gastric emptying in humans. This study was designed to compare the effect of beer, red wine, whisky and their comparable pure ethanol solutions on gastric emptying in a controlled and randomized investigation."

Complications due to the improper placement of NGT are well known. In this prospective descriptive study, the effectiveness of ultrasound (US)-guided NGT placement was investigated."
CD012083,0,2275157,0,[The diagnosis of a cystic duct blockade in patients with chronic cholecystitis].,The authors describe a method of complex examination of patients with diseases of the external biliary tract with the aim of diagnosing cystic duct blocks. Intravenous cholangiography using billignost and albumin in 2:1 ratio proved highly effective. Of essential help in the diagnosis of cystic duct block was dynamic ultrasonic examination. Cystic duct block is a distinct sign of cholecystitis requiring operative intervention.

CD012083,0,21953368,0,Sonographic detection of transient gas in the portal vein in an infant following abdominal surgery: a possible sign of adhesive small bowel obstruction.,"We present a case of sonographically detected transient gas in the portal vein in a 4.5-month-old infant who had a history of two consecutive jejunectomies due to jejunal stenoses and was admitted to our hospital with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with a subacute small bowel obstruction and dehydration. Sonography excluded other pathologies and the patient was treated conservatively with success. The presence of gas in the portal vein could be a sign of an underlying mechanical obstacle, as another episode of small bowel obstruction 1 month later required surgical treatment of adhesive intestinal obstruction."
CD012083,0,23355320,0,Sonographic confirmation of the correct placement of a nasoenteral tube in a woman with hyperemesis gravidarum: case report.,"Hyperemesis gravidarum is a serious systemic disorder of pregnant women characterized by intractable vomiting resulting in metabolic, biochemical, and hematologic changes. Enteral nutrition has been used successfully and has a lower complication rate than parenteral nutrition. Tube feeding requires location of the feeding tube tip before the infusion of nutritional substance is started. We report a case of assisted feeding tube tip location using real time sonography in a pregnant women treated for hyperemesis gravidarum. Sonographic examination may be used as an alternative to x-ray for the confirmation of feeding tube location in pregnant women and thus eliminate exposure of the fetus to ionizing radiation."
CD012083,0,16154594,0,Intraoperative Doppler assessment of gastric tube perfusion in esophagogastroplasty.,Intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography is a non-invasive method with a great potential for the assessment of perfusion in surgery. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of Doppler ultrasonography in the assessment of blood flow on the top of an Akiyama-fashioned stomach tube for esophagus substitution. A secondary point of interest was the real length gained after construction of the gastric tube.
