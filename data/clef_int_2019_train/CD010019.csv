CD010019,0,26948766,0,Warfarin Anticoagulation and Spontaneous Pectoral Haematomas.,"Warfarin is the oldest and most commonly used anticoagulant in the outpatient setting. Major bleeding events remain as the most life threatening complication of this medication. Bleeding into enclosed structures and body cavities can be fatal in acute scenarios or cause continuous exsanguination if left unnoticed. Pectoral haematomas are an unusual presentation of bleeding diathesis, and are also seldom reported in the literature. We present three cases of patients with development of spontaneous pectoral haematoma during therapy with warfarin alone or with heparin bridging in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and thromboembolism."

CD010019,0,28261848,0,"Impact of physical activity on patient self-reported outcomes of lifelong premature ejaculation patients: Results of a prospective, randomised, sham-controlled trial.","Previous studies have investigated whether physical activity increases serotonin hormone levels. Serotonin receptor dysfunction is one of the frequently accused factors of premature ejaculation (PE). Nevertheless, no studies up to date have demonstrated that the association between physical activity and premature ejaculation. We aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity and PE and determine whether moderate physical activity might delay ejaculation time or be an alternative treatment for PE. A total of 105 patients diagnosed with PE were enrolled in this study. Of the patients, 35 were treated with dapoxetine, (30 mg) on demand (Group 1), 35 performed moderate physical activities (Group 2), and 35 performed minimal physical activity (Group 3-sham). Demographic characteristics, metabolic equivalents (MET), premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) and intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) were recorded. There were no significant differences among three groups in terms of age, BMI, MET, PEDT or IELT before treatment. At the end of the study, there was significant decrease in PEDT scores, and increase in IELT in groups 1 and 2 as compared to Group 3. In conclusion, a moderate physical activity longer than 30 min at least 5 times a week leads to ejaculation delay, and appears as an alternative to dapoxetine on demand for the treatment of PE."

Up to 22% of primary patients may develop various autoimmune disorders. We report the case of 11-year-old male with SIOD, who presented ITP at 2 years after renal transplantation with decrease in platelet count (from normal) to 56 000/μL and then (gradually) to 2000/μL. There was no effect of iv. methylprednisolone/dexamethasone. As the presence of antibodies against GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb, and GPIaIIa platelet glycoproteins was confirmed, patient was given 50 g of IVIG and then was put on plasmapheresis; however, both showed poor direct effect. As we were afraid to give rituximab (due to expected overimmunosuppression), we prescribed the oral TPO-receptor agonist (eltrombopag). Patient responded after 17 days of therapy, to the final dose of 50 mg/d (approx. 2 mg/kg). The antiplatelet antibodies disappeared after four plasmapheresis. Overall, the therapy was continued for 7 weeks and was stopped at platelet count of 433 000/μL. Platelet count remained stable in 8-month follow-up. Combination of plasmapheresis and TPO-receptor agonist was effective in post-renal transplant acute ITP in patient with SIOD."

CD010019,0,28091482,0,[A study of the efficacy and safety of new cephalosporin in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis].,"Acute rhinosinusitis is leading in frequency of antibiotic prescribing all over the world. At the same time the problem of antibiotic resistance and safety of antimicrobial drugs becomes more relevant and international. The article describes the basic mechanisms of bacterial resistance and growth of side effects when using macrolides, respiratory fluoroquinilones and β-lactam antibiotics of different types. Formation of IgE-mediated cephalosporin allergy is associated with the side R1 chain. The R1 structure of cephalosporins I and II generations is similar to penicillins, thus creating conditions for cross-allergy progression. R1 of cephalosporins III and IV generations is represented by a qualitatively different chemical compound (aminothiazol-oxime group) that increases the level of tolerance to these antibiotic types. The data of surveillance study are given to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new drug Spectracef (active substance is cephalosporin of III generation Cefditoren) when treating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis on an outpatient basis."

However, sex differences in utilization and safety outcomes of CDT in these patients are unknown. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify all patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of proximal LE or caval DVT who underwent CDT between January 2005 and December 2011 in the United States. We evaluated the comparative safety outcomes of CDT among a propensity-matched group of 1731 men versus 1731 women. Among 108,243 patients with proximal LE or caval DVT, 4826 patients (4.5%) underwent CDT. Overall, women underwent CDT less often compared to men (4.1% vs 4.9%, p<0.01, respectively). The rates of CDT increased between 2005 and 2011 for both women (2.1% to 5.9%, p<0.01) and men (2.5% to 7.5%, p<0.01). There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (1.2% vs 1.3%, p=0.76). Women were noted to have higher rates of blood transfusions (11.7% vs 8.8%, p<0.01), but lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage (0.5% vs 1.2%, p=0.03) and gastrointestinal bleeding (0.9% vs 2.2%, p<0.01) compared with men. Women were more likely to undergo inferior vena cava filter placement (37.0% vs 32.1%, p<0.01). In this large nationwide cohort, women with proximal DVT were less likely to receive CDT compared to men. Although mortality rates were similar, women were noted to have higher blood transfusion rates while men had more episodes of intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding."

CD010019,0,27757790,0,Hospital length-of-stay and costs among pulmonary embolism patients treated with rivaroxaban versus parenteral bridging to warfarin.,"We sought to compare length-of-stay (LOS), total hospital costs, and readmissions among pulmonary embolism (PE) patients treated with rivaroxaban versus parenterally bridged warfarin. We identified adult PE (primary diagnostic code = 415.1x) patients in the Premier Database (11/2012-9/2015), and included those with ≥1 PE diagnostic test on days 0-2. Rivaroxaban users (allowing ≤2 days of prior parenteral therapy) were 1:1 propensity score matched to patients parenterally bridged to warfarin. LOS, total costs, and readmission for venous thromboembolism (VTE) or major bleeding within the same or subsequent 2 months were compared between cohorts. Separate analyses were performed in low-risk PE patients. Rivaroxaban use was associated with a 1.4-day [95 % confidence interval (CI) -1.47 to -1.28] shorter LOS, and $2322 (95 % CI -$2499 to -$2146) reduction in costs compared to parenterally bridged warfarin (p < 0.001 for both). There was no difference in readmission for VTE (1.5 versus 1.7 %) or major bleeding (0.3 versus 0.2 %) between the rivaroxaban and parenterally bridged warfarin cohorts (p ≥ 0.27 for both). Results were similar in low-risk patients (0.2-1.0 day and $251-$1751 reductions in LOS and costs, respectively, p ≤ 0.01 for all). In patients with PE, rivaroxaban was associated with reduced LOS and costs, without increased risk of readmission versus parenterally bridged warfarin. Similar results were observed in low-risk PE patients."
CD010019,0,28595862,0,Safety and Efficacy of Uninterrupted Apixaban Therapy Versus Warfarin During Atrial Fibrillation Ablation.,"Thromboembolic cerebrovascular accident remains a rare but potentially devastating complication of catheter-based atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Uninterrupted oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin has become the standard of care when performing catheter-based AF ablation. Compared with warfarin, apixaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and major bleeding in nonvalvular AF. With an increase in apixaban use for stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF, there is an increased interest in the safety and efficacy of uninterrupted apixaban therapy during AF ablation. We compared the safety and efficacy of uninterrupted OA therapy with either warfarin or apixaban in all patients who underwent catheter-based AF ablation at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and at Augusta University Medical Center from January 7, 2013, to February 25, 2016. All patients underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram on the day of their ablation to assess for the presence of intracardiac thrombi. All complications were identified and classified as bleeding, thromboembolic events, or other. A total of 627 patients were analyzed as described earlier. There were 310 patients in the warfarin group and 317 patients in the apixaban group. There were 8 complications in the warfarin group and 5 complications in the apixaban group (p = 0.38). There were no thromboembolic complications in either group. In conclusion, the use of apixaban is as safe and effective as warfarin for uninterrupted OA therapy during catheter-based ablation of AF."

CD010019,0,26520693,0,Rivaroxaban in preventing venous thromboembolism after arthroplastic surgery in Taiwan.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the severe complications of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The incidence of VTE could be reduced if preventive antithrombotic medicines are used; however, the incidence of bleeding may increase. Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor that prevents VTE after THA or TKA. This study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in Taiwan. This is a retrospective database study based on the data of 6996 patients provided by the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2008 to 2012. The data included the number of prescription, the cost of prescription, and case number for patients treated with antithrombotic agents for the prevention or treatment of joint arthroplasty complications (including THA, TKA, partial hip arthroplasty, revision THA and TKA), and the incidence of thrombosis and hemorrhage from year 2008 to 2012. The overall postoperative VTE rate was 0.49%. Compared with other antithrombotic drugs, rivaroxaban and heparin analogs can reduce the percentage of thrombosis. We also found that the expenditure and hospitalization was less in the rivaroxaban group than in the heparin analogs group. Because some benefits of rivaroxaban were found in our study, further cost-effective and drug safety studies are warranted. It is important to consider the cost-effective principle for the use of antithrombotic drugs in preventing thromboembolic complications after total joint arthroplasty."
CD010019,0,27978842,0,Fast-track surgery after gynaecological oncological surgery: study protocol for a prospective randomised controlled trial.,"Fast-track surgery (FTS), also known as enhanced recovery after surgery, is a multidisciplinary approach to accelerate recovery, reduce complications, minimise hospital stay without increasing readmission rates, and reduce health care costs, all without compromising patient safety. The advantages of FTS in abdominal surgery most likely extend to gynaecological surgery, but this is an assumption, as FTS in elective gynaecological surgery has not been well studied. No consensus guidelines have been developed for gynaecological oncological surgery although surgeons have attempted to introduce slightly modified FTS programmes for patients undergoing such surgery. To our knowledge, there are no published randomised controlled trials; however, some studies have shown that FTS in gynaecological oncological surgery leads to early hospital discharge with high levels of patient satisfaction. The aim of this study is whether FTS reduces the length of stay in hospital compared to traditional management. The secondary aim is whether FTS is associated with any increase in post-surgical complications compared to traditional management (for both open and laparoscopic surgery)."

CD010019,0,27376230,0,Bomb Blast and Its Consequences: Successful Intensive Care Management of Massive Pulmonary Embolsim.,"A suicide bomb blast in 2013 at a distant city of Pakistan killed 84 and wounded more than 150 people. Some patients were transferred to our tertiary care hospital because of extreme load on medical services there. This patient arrived at the Aga Khan Hospital, 2 days after the bomb blast injury and underwent an orthopedic procedure. Next day, he developed sudden tachypnea, desaturation, and circulatory collapse. After initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he was immediately transferred to surgical intensive care unit. Based on history, echocardiography findings and patient parameters, a clinical diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism was made and immediate thrombolytic therapy with alteplase was started. The immediate improvement in hemodynamic status was evident following 2 hours of alteplase infusion. This case also highlights the aggressiveness of resuscitation, decision making in initiating thrombolytic therapy on clinical grounds, importance of deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and exhaustion of health resources due to blast related mass destruction."
CD010019,0,28182804,0,Medical and Economic Burden of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia: A Retrospective Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) Study.,"In recent years, US hospitals have switched from use of unfractionated heparin to use of low-molecular-weight heparin, which is associated with lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In the study reported here, we retrospectively searched the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for patients who were at least 18 years old and received a diagnosis of HIT between 2009 and 2011. Our goal was to get an updated perspective on the incidence and economic impact of HIT. We calculated the incidence of HIT overall and in subgroups of patients who underwent cardiac, vascular, or orthopedic surgery. We compared characteristics of patients with and without HIT and compared characteristics of patients with HIT with thrombosis (HITT) and HIT patients without thrombosis. Of 98,636,364 hospitalizations, 72,515 (0.07%) involved HIT. Arterial and venous thromboses were identified in 24,880 (34.3%) of HIT cases. Men were slightly more likely to have a HIT diagnosis (50.1%), but women had higher rates of HIT after cardiac surgery (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.58) and vascular surgery (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.29-1.57). Rates of HIT were 0.53% (95% CI, 0.51%-0.54%) after cardiac surgery, 0.28% (95% CI, 0.28%-0.29%) after vascular surgery, and 0.05% (95% CI, 0.05%-0.06%) after orthopedic surgery. HIT and HITT cases were significantly (P ⟨ 0.001) more likely than non-HIT cases to be fatal (9.63% and 12.28% vs 2.19%), and they had significantly higher costs and longer inpatient stays. HIT and especially HITT are associated with increased mortality, costs, and length of stay. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2017;12:94-97."
CD010019,0,28794370,0,The Successful Prevention of Thromboembolism Using Rivaroxaban in a Patient with Antithrombin Deficiency during the Perioperative Period.,"Antithrombin (AT) deficiency, a rare disorder of the coagulation system, is a serious risk factor for thromboembolism. Approximately 50-90% of patients with AT deficiency develop thromboembolism during their lifetime. In addition, surgery is a major risk factor for thromboembolism in these patients. We herein report the case of a 90-year-old woman with AT deficiency who was safely and successfully managed using rivaroxaban (a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor) during the perioperative period of surgery for right femur fracture. The present case illustrates the effectiveness of rivaroxaban in preventing thromboembolisms due to surgery, even in very elderly patients with antithrombin deficiency. Further investigations are needed to determine the optimal dosage of rivaroxaban."

CD010019,0,28327887,0,Oral anticoagulation in primary care.,"Oral anticoagulant therapy is currently widespread in the population and primary care plays an important role in its control in Spain. Younger populations, such as those in prisons, often require this treatment for reasons other than atrial fibrillation, often in relation to valvular or congenital or acquired hypercoagulability situations. The possibility of obtaining the INR by portable coagulometers has allowed primary care physicians to tackle the indication of this therapy and the control of these patients in coordination with haematology services. The emergence of new therapeutic alternatives (Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and Edoxaban, the so called ""ACOD"") has permitted the expansion of options for oral anticoagulation in some cases, since they do not require systematic monitoring of their effect and interact with far fewer drugs than their predecessors, although there are still restrictions by the health authorities on their widespread use. This article reviews the different indications of oral anticoagulant therapy according to the new recommendations as well as the clinical scenarios in which it should be used."
CD010019,0,28480651,0,The Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapies Using Enoxaparin.,"Oral anticoagulant therapy is frequently and increasingly prescribed for patients at risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism (VTE). Although elective surgical or invasive procedures have necessitated temporary interruption of anticoagulants, managing these patients has been performed empirically and been poorly investigated. This study was designed to evaluate the adequacy of perioperative anticoagulation using enoxaparin. This was a retrospective, single-center study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of therapeutic-dose enoxaparin for bridging therapy in patients on long-term warfarin at Soonchunhyang University Hospital in Korea between August 2009 and July 2011. Warfarin was discontinued 5 days before surgery, and enoxaparin was administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 1 mg per kg from 3 days before the procedure to the last dose 24 hours before the procedure. Anticoagulation was restarted if proper hemostasis had been confirmed. There were 49 patients, of whom 25 (51%) were men, and the mean age was 63 years. Thirty-four (69%) received warfarin therapy for VTE, and 9 (18%) for atrial fibrillation. Twenty-nine patients (59%) underwent major surgery and 20 (41%) minor surgery. The mean postoperative duration of enoxaparin was 4 days. No patients had thromboembolic complications through 30 days after the procedure. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0%. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that bridging therapy with therapeutic-dose enoxaparin is feasible and associated with a low incidence of major bleeding and no thromboembolic complications. However, the optimal approach to managing patients perioperatively is uncertain and requires further evaluation."

However, the efficacy and safety of VTE prophylaxis in thermally injured patients continue to be elusive as it has never been studied in a prospective, randomized fashion. Selective use of VTE prophylaxis, for high risk patients, is practiced by some burn units even if objective evidence is lacking for majority of risk factors enunciated in burn patients. Differing demographics and wound management techniques are other confounding factors mandating more prospective studies to evaluate the need and role of chemoprophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention in burn patients. Ours is the first prospective, randomized, controlled study which seeks to identify risk factors for DVT in our patients, and evaluate the role of routine chemoprophylaxis and its complications."

CD010019,0,26980086,0,Effect of thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulant drugs on the incidence of arterial thrombotic events in medical inpatients: a systematic review.,"Pharmacological prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is recommended for medical inpatients. Since arterial thrombosis (AT) shares some risk factors with VTE, it would be reasonable to assess the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis by considering both VTE and AT as outcome events. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of phase III RCTs on thromboprophylaxis in medical inpatients, to evaluate the quality of reporting and the incidence of AT, and the effect of thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulants on AT incidence. Studies were identified by a combined search strategy until May 2015. Differences in outcomes among groups were expressed as pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by I (2) statistic. Twenty phase III RCTs, encompassing 54,742 patients, were included; of these, 3 (15 %) reported on AT as a pre-defined secondary outcome and 8 (40 %) on at least one AT outcome. Raw-unweighed incidence of fatal MI in the three RCTs is 0.37 % in patients receiving unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin, and 0.38 % in controls (OR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.62-1.52; I (2) = 0 %). A non-statistically significant increase in AT is reported in patients on enoxaparin compared to control (OR 1.95, 95 % CI 0.89-4.27; I (2) = 13 %). AT is underreported in RCTs on VTE prophylaxis in medical inpatients. Published data suggest that incidence of fatal MI in these patients may be clinically relevant. Insufficient data are available to draw firm conclusions on the effects of thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulants on AT incidence in this setting."
CD010019,0,27253153,0,Breast cancer-associated venous thromboembolism: A case-control study.,"Breast cancer is frequently associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE may result in significant morbidity, a substantial economic burden and even leads to patients' death. Risk factor identification and management of VTE in breast cancer patients remains poorly studied. We evaluated breast cancer patients' baseline and treatment characteristics in predicting VTE occurrence as well as its prognosis. We conducted a case-control study of all breast cancer patients with a VTE diagnosed between January 2007 and December 2011 at the Instituto Nacional de Câncer (INCA) in Brazil. Two hundred and twenty five patients developed VTE and were compared with 225 controls, in the 5-year study period. The bulk of the thrombotic events were unilateral (94.2%) VTEs of the lower extremity (78.7%), largely proximally located (78%). VTE occurred more often within the first 3 years after the diagnosis of cancer (66.2%), being more common in the first 6 months (21.8%). Significant predictors of developing VTE were age 50 years and over (OR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.16-2.95), PS equal to or above 3 (OR 2.01, 95% CI: 1.24-3.26), and the presence of a CVC (OR 2.56, 95% CI: 1.42-4.62). This large retrospective analysis of VTE in breast cancer patients confirms that most events occur early in the treatment course. The incidence of VTE was associated with patients' age, PS, and the presence of CVC. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate outpatient thromboprophylaxis for selected groups of patients."
CD010019,0,28546755,0,Pediatric ventricular assist devices: current challenges and future prospects.,"The field of mechanical circulatory support has made great strides in the preceding 2 decades. Although pediatric mechanical circulatory support has lagged behind that of adults, the gap between them is expected to close soon. The only device currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in children is the Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device (VAD). The prospective Berlin Heart Investigational Device Exemption Trial demonstrated good outcomes, such as bridge to transplantation or recovery, in ~90% of children supported with this device. However, a high incidence of hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications was also noted. As a result, pediatric centers have just started implanting adult intracorporeal continuous-flow devices in children. This paradigm shift has opened a new era in pediatric mechanical circulatory support. Whereas children on VAD were previously managed exclusively in hospital, therapeutic options such as outpatient management and even destination therapy have been becoming a reality. With continued miniaturization and technological refinements, devices currently in development will broaden the range of options available to children. The HeartMate 3 and HeartWare MVAD are two such compact VADs, which are anticipated to have great potential for pediatric use. Additionally, a pediatric-specific continuous-flow VAD, the newly redesigned Jarvik Infant 2015, is currently undergoing preclinical testing and is expected to undergo a randomized clinical trial in the near future. This review aims to discuss the challenges posed by the use of intracorporeal adult continuous-flow devices in children, as well as to provide our perspective on the future prospects of the field of pediatric VADs."

The study included 90 patients divided into three groups. Those of the first group underwent endoscopic septoplasty, the patients of the second group were managed by standard septoplastic surgery, and the patients of group 3 were given treatment with the use of modified septoplasty including the application of a fibrin sealant as an alternative to nasal tampons. It was shown that anterior nasal packing exerts the undesirable influence on the quality of life during the early postoperative period following septoplastic surgery whereas the use of the modified technique based on the application of a fibrin sealant as an alternative therapeutic modality significantly enhances the effectiveness of the treatment."

Although thrombosis rates have been described, the value of anticoagulation in preventing postrepair thrombosis is unknown. We hypothesize that postoperative anticoagulation reduces thrombosis rates. A total of 1524 consecutive patients with traumatic arterial injuries from January 2005 to June 2015 were identified, and 381 patients underwent the following repair types: direct suture of vessel wall, primary anastomosis, extra-anatomic reconstruction, tissue and synthetic interposition reconstruction. Twenty six patients received postoperative heparin at therapeutic levels, and 29 patients received postoperative aspirin for five consecutive days. The heparin and aspirin groups were matched with patients without postoperative anticoagulation by the following variables: anatomic arterial injury, type of vascular repair, and age. These groups were then compared using the following outcome measures: mortality, thrombosis of repaired vessel, amputation, hemorrhage, cerebral vascular accident, and extremity compartment syndrome. The demographics between the heparin, aspirin, and respectively matched groups were not statistically different. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of thrombosis, bleeding, compartment syndrome, cerebral vascular accident, limb amputation, or mortality. Although there was no increase in bleeding complications with the use of heparin or aspirin, there was also no impact on the rate of thrombosis."

In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and mild or moderate renal impairment, direct oral anticoagulants are associated with a better risk-benefit profile compared with warfarin. However, less is known regarding outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment. The efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment are primarily derived from prespecified subgroup analyses of the phase 3 clinical trials. We summarize the available data on direct oral anticoagulant use in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment. Clinicians are encouraged to follow study inclusion/exclusion criteria and perform renal dose adjustments based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation using actual body weight when indicated to avoid adverse events."

A progressive mobility protocol was started in the thoracic cardiovascular intensive care unit in a rural academic medical center. The purpose of the progressive mobility protocol was to increase mobilization of postoperative patients and decrease complications related to immobility in this unique patient population. A matched-pairs design was used to compare a randomly selected sample of the preintervention group (n = 30) to a matched postintervention group (n = 30). The analysis compared outcomes including intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, intensive care unit readmission occurrence, pressure ulcer prevalence, and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism prevalence between the 2 groups. Although this comparison does not achieve statistical significance (P < .05) for any of the outcomes measured, it does show clinical significance in a reduction in hospital length of stay, intensive care unit days, in intensive care unit readmission rate, and a decline in pressure ulcer prevalence, which is the overall goal of progressive mobility. This study has implications for nursing, hospital administration, and therapy services with regard to staffing and cost savings related to fewer complications of immobility. Future studies with a larger sample size and other populations are warranted."

At our institution, aminocaproic acid is sometimes prescribed to patients with hematological malignancy who experience refractory thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding. We performed a 5-year retrospective review of 54 adult patients with 13 types of hematological malignancy who received aminocaproic acid at our institution. Indications for use included 31 (57.4%) for refractory thrombocytopenia with bleeding, 16 (29.6%) for refractory thrombocytopenia without bleeding, and 7 (13%) for bleeding alone. Patients received both oral and intravenous formulations. Administered doses ranged broadly and median duration of use was 6 days. Three patients (5.7%) developed deep venous thrombosis but none of the thrombotic events were clearly related to administration of aminocaproic acid. We conclude that aminocaproic acid may be a relatively safe and cost-effective adjunct treatment in the setting of bleeding related to the diagnosis and treatment of hematological malignancy. Prospective trials as well as formalized protocols for the use of aminocaproic acid may be indicated. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

CD010019,0,28594808,0,[Risk factors for progression of atherosclerosis of the shunted coronary artery in the remote postoperative period].,"The study was aimed at revealing risk factors for progression of atherosclerosis in the shunted coronary artery in the remote period following coronary artery bypass grafting. Our prospective study included a total of 292 patients having endured coronary artery bypass grafting. All patients were divided in two groups depending on the type of the bypass grafts used: either autoarterial shunts (Group 1) or autovenous grafts (Group 2). We thus assessed a total of 516 autoarterial grafts and 257 autovenous grafts, as well as the coronary arteries shunted thereby. The long-term results were evaluated by means of coronaroshuntography performed not earlier than 12 months after surgery. The average duration of follow up amounted to 53.4±26.5 months. Analysing the cumulative risk for progression of atherosclerosis in the arteries shunted demonstrated that for autoarterial grafts the rate of the development of proximal stenosis of the coronary artery (CA) shunted was lower compared with autovenous grafts (p≤0.001). The Cox regression model showed that an autovein used as a graft increased the risk for the development of occlusion of the shunted CA by 43% from the baseline each postoperative month. The presence of proximal stenosis of the shunted coronary artery amounting to or exceeding 90% increases the risk of occlusion by 68% per month. Also, for the patients with the SYNTAX scoring ≥ 32 points the risk of coronary artery occlusion increases 2.2-fold each month after the operation. Such factors as the patient's gender, the diameter of the shunted artery, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, multifocal atherosclerosis by the findings of the study exerted no influence on the progression of proximal stenosis of the shunted coronary artery."
CD010019,0,27889688,0,Management of distal deep vein thrombosis.,"Isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), also known as calf DVT, represents up to 50% of all lower limb DVT in ultrasound series and is therefore a frequent medical condition. Unlike proximal DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), which have been extensively studied and for which management is well standardized, much less is known on the optimal management of isolated calf DVT. Recent data arising from registries and non-randomized studies suggest that most distal DVTs do not extend to the proximal veins and have an uneventful follow-up when left untreated. This data had some impact on the international recommendations which recently stated that ultrasound surveillance instead of systematic therapeutic anticoagulation might be an option for selected low-risk patients. However, robust data arising from randomized studies are scarce. Indeed, only five randomized trials assessing the need for anticoagulation for calf DVT have been published. Many of these trials had an open-label design and were affected by methodological limitations. The only randomized placebo-controlled trial included low-risk patients (outpatients without cancer or previous venous thromboembolic events (VTE)) and was hampered by a limited statistical power. Nevertheless, data from this trial tend to confirm that the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in low-risk patients with symptomatic calf DVT is not superior to placebo in reducing VTE, but is associated with a significantly higher risk of bleeding. Further randomized studies are needed to define the best therapy for high-risk patients (inpatients, patients with active cancer or previous VTE), and the optimal dose and duration of treatment."

We performed the retrospective analysis of the medical histories of 291 children presenting with this condition who had been admitted for the treatment to the ENT Department of the Morozovskzya City Children's Clinical Hospital during the period from January till December 2015. The study has demonstrated the following most common shortcomings of the outpatient treatment of the patients suffering from chronic tonsillitis at the stage preceding formation of paratonsillar abscess: inadequate antibacterial therapy of acute chronic tonsillitis or its exacerbation and limited indications for tonsillectomy at the level of the outpatient treatment. The leading role in the etiology of tonsillogenic pharyngeal abscesses in the children is played by beta-hemolytic Streptococcus of group A. It is concluded that the medical history suggesting past paratonsillar abscess is the absolute indication for the subsequent tonsillectomy in the children of any age.

Despite widespread use, no study has directly compared recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), the rFVIIa and 3-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) combination (""combination""), and 4-factor PCC on their effectiveness in improving patient outcomes. This study examined the medical records of 299 patients, 65.2% on warfarin prior to admission, who received these hemostatic agents and were admitted to an ICU or through the emergency department at Oregon Health & Science University. Mortality, length of stay, change in international normalized ratio (INR), plasma use, and number of thromboembolic complications were used to assess effectiveness. In patients receiving warfarin, the combination group had the greatest decrease in INR as well as lowest overall INR, but experienced a higher number of clotting complications, while the rFVIIa group used the most plasma. Non-warfarin patients in the combination group had the shortest length of stay among survivors, but the rFVIIa group had the lowest mortality. Based on this data, it may be prudent to further study the use of rFVIIa in treating extreme bleeding in the non-warfarin patient, while this study supports other data that 4-factor PCC may be the most prudent for the warfarin patient.

CASE REPORT We present the case of a 64-year-old white woman who was being treated for pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis with enoxaparin. In the course of her treatment, she was noted to be hypotensive, with a sudden drop in hematocrit. She had been previously ambulatory, but noted an inability to move her bilateral lower extremities. A diagnosis of bilateral femoral neuropathy as a result of psoas hematomas caused by enoxaparin was made. Anticoagulation was discontinued and she was treated conservatively, with an excellent outcome. At the time of discharge to a rehabilitation center, she had regained most of the motor strength in her lower extremities. CONCLUSIONS We believe this is the first reported case of bilateral femoral nerve neuropathy following use of enoxaparin. A full neurological examination should always be performed when there is sudden loss of function. The constellation of bilateral groin pain, loss of lower extremity mobility, and decreased hematocrit raised the suspicion of massive blood loss into the cavity/compartment. Thus, a high index of suspicion should be maintained by clinicians when presented with such symptoms and signs, as there can be significant morbidity and mortality when prompt diagnosis is not made."
CD010019,0,28802512,0,Cangrelor Versus Clopidogrel on a Background of Unfractionated Heparin (from CHAMPION PHOENIX).,"Cangrelor is approved for use during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is administered with different parenteral anticoagulants. We examined the efficacy and safety of cangrelor in the subgroup of patients who received unfractionated heparin (UFH) during PCI in the modified intention-to-treat population of the randomized CHAMPION PHOENIX trial (cangrelor vs clopidogrel; n = 10,939). The primary efficacy end point was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis (ST) at 48 hours. The key secondary efficacy end point was ST. UFH was used in 69.2% (7,569/10,939) of patients. In the UFH subgroup, cangrelor reduced the primary composite efficacy end point at 48 hours compared with clopidogrel (4.8% vs 5.9%; odds ratio [OR] 0.80 [0.65 to 0.98]; p = 0.03). Cangrelor consistently reduced ST at 2 hours (0.7% vs 1.3%; OR 0.56 [0.35 to 0.90]; p = 0.01) and 48 hours (0.9% vs 1.4%; OR 0.70 [0.45 to 1.07]; p = 0.10). There was no difference in GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries)-defined severe or life-threatening bleeding (0.1% vs 0.1%; OR 1.24 [0.33 to 4.61]; p = 0.75) or blood transfusion requirement at 48 hours (0.4% vs 0.2%; OR 1.87 [0.83 to 4.21]; p = 0.12).

ICU patients are characterized by a dynamic day-to-day variation both of thromboembolic that bleeding risk and DVT incidence in presence of thromboprophylaxis ranges between 5 and 15 %.Patient-centered methods for the assessment of both thrombotic and bleeding risk are recommended because pre-existent factors to ICU admission, diagnosis, emerging syndromes, invasive procedures and pharmacological treatments daily induce important changes in clinical condition.General consensus currently establishes use of heparin in pharmacological prophylaxis at the time of admission to the ICU and the temporary suspension of heparin in patients with active bleeding or severe (<50,000/cc) thrombocytopenia. Individualized thromboprophylaxis regimens were proposed but there is still no consensus based on evidence.DVT diagnosis is not clinical but imaging-based and in each ICU data on DVT incidence (DVT diagnosed 72 h after ICU admission) should be obtained by weekly ultrasound screening standardized for the anatomical sites of compression used, taking into account the persistence of DVT-risk throughout ICU stay. A role for mechanical thromboprophylaxis by elastic stockings or pneumatic compression was reported but no general consensus was reached about its use at the best.

Our study evaluated the safety and efficacy of topical TXA in revision TKA for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent removal of hardware with antibiotic spacer placement (stage 1) and/or revision TKA (stage 2) for PJI at our institution between September 2007 and July 2013. During that time, 49 patients underwent stage-1 procedures (20 knees with TXA, 29 without TXA) and 47 patients underwent stage-2 revisions (28 with TXA, 19 without TXA). We evaluated hemoglobin loss, need for transfusion, reinfection rate, length of stay (LOS), complications, and mortality with and without the use of TXA in these patients. All data sets were analyzed with a two-sample t-test. Average follow-up was 3.15 years (range, 1-7 years). TXA use led to a significantly lower percentage drop in the postoperative lowest hemoglobin compared with the preoperative hemoglobin in stage-1 surgeries (19.8 vs. 30.05%, p = 0.0004) and stage-2 revisions (24.5 vs 32.01%, p = 0.01). In both groups, TXA use was associated with a significant reduction in transfusion rates (stage-1, 25 vs 51.7%, p = 0.04; stage-2, 25 vs. 52.6%, p = 0.05). There was a nonstatistical decreased LOS in both groups in which TXA was used (stage 1, 5.15 vs. 6.72 days, p = 0.055; stage 2, 5.21 vs. 6.84 days, p = 0.09). There was no difference in the reinfection rate (4 vs. 4, p = 0.56) or mortality rate between groups (0 vs. 2 non-TXA group). A single upper extremity deep vein thrombosis occurred in a stage-1 patient who received TXA, and no pulmonary embolism occurred. We show that topical TXA is safe and effective for use in both stages of revision TKA for PJI. Previous studies have shown TXA to aggravate a staphylococcal infection in mice; however, topical TXA doesn't appear to negatively effect on the treatment of PJI in our patients and did not increase the reinfection, complication, or mortality rate."
CD010019,0,28594806,0,[A new method of endoscopic harvesting of the great saphenous vein in an open system].,"We examined a total of 246 patients subjected to coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of the great saphenous vein (GSV). The patients were subdivided into two groups. Group One (n=121) patients endured procurement of the great saphenous vein by a new endoscopic technique in an open system with the help of the equipment Karl Storz and electric dissector Ligasure. In Group Two (n=125) patients the vein was harvested by means of the traditional open method. In all patients we evaluated complications in the early postoperative period 13±2.5 days after the operation. The rate of relapsing angina pectoris in both Groups turned out to be low and did not differ (1.65% in Group One and 1.6% in Group Two). Patients of the both groups differed significantly by the incidence of postoperative complications on the lower limbs in the zone of procurement of the GSV (9.09% in Group One and 26.4% in Group Two, p=0.131). Group Two patients (open method of procurement of the GSV) were considerably more often found to have developed cases of lymphorrhoea, haematomas, disjunction of the sutures (21.6%) compared with Group One (endoscopic method) patients (3.3%) (p=0.167), which in 10.4% of cases required secondary surgical debridement of wounds in patients after the open harvest of the GSV. Eventually, the length of hospital stay for Group Two patients increased significantly (15 ± 4.5 days) compared with Group One patients (8±1.1 days) (p=0.361). Hence, the endoscopic method of harvesting the GSV in the open CO2 system makes it possible to obtain a good cosmetic effect on the lower limbs after the operation, to considerably decrease the complications rate, thus reducing the length of hospital stay."

A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 64-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes had been in her usual state of health until she developed symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and discomfort in the midepigastrium. Evaluation with a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a mass in the pancreatic body that was approximately 3.1 cm × 2 cm × 2.1 cm in size with abutment of the portal vein-superior mesenteric vein confluence for less than 180°. The confluence was narrowed but without thrombosis. No tumor-vessel interface was noted at the superior mesenteric artery, celiac artery, or common hepatic artery. Several peripancreatic lymph nodes were observed that measured up to 11 mm × 5 mm. No evidence for distant spread of disease was identified. An upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound was performed and fine-needle aspirates of the pancreas mass were positive for malignant cells that were consistent with adenocarcinoma. Chest CT scan without intravenous contrast demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease. The patient came to the clinic to discuss management of her newly diagnosed malignancy."
CD010019,0,28882336,0,Comparison of In-Hospital Outcomes and Readmission Rates in Acute Pulmonary Embolism Between Systemic and Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (from the National Readmission Database).,"There are sparse comparative data on in-hospital outcomes and readmission rates in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) who receive systemic thrombolytics versus catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT). The study cohort was derived from the National Readmission Database 2013 to 2014, subset of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Systemic and CDT were identified using appropriate International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. The co-primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmissions and secondary outcome was combined in-hospital mortality + gastrointestinal bleed + intracranial hemorrhage. We used propensity score match analysis without replacement using Greedy's algorithm to adjust for possible confounders. We identified a total of 4,426 patients (3,107: systemic thrombolysis and 1,319: CDT) with acute PE who were treated with thrombolysis. In our 2:1 propensity score algorithm, in-hospital mortality was lower in the CDT group (6.12%) versus systemic thrombolytics (14.94%) (odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.49, p <0.001). There was also a lower composite secondary outcome (in-hospital mortality + gastrointestinal bleed + intracranial hemorrhage) in patients who received CDT (8.42%) versus those who received systemic thrombolytics (18.13%) (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.53, p <0.001). Thirty-day readmission was lower in patients with CDT group (7.65%) compared with systemic thrombolytics (10.58%, p = 0.009). In conclusion, in-hospital mortality, as well as bleeding during primary admission was significantly lower with CDT compared with systemic thrombolytics for patients with acute PE. There was also significant decrease in rate of readmissions among patients receiving CDT compared with systemic thrombolytics."

CD010019,0,28574054,0,[First experience with total laparoscopic reconstructive operations in occlusive lesion of the aortoiliac arterial segment].,"According to the TASC II and the Russian National Guidelines on management of patients with lower limb arterial diseases, in patients with type C and D lesions of the arterial bed performing aortofemoral bifurcation bypass grafting is preferable. Laparoscopic technique makes it possible to combine advantages of minimally invasive surgery with well-known remote results of open reconstructive operations on the aortoiliac segment. The study included a total of 54 patients undergoing treatment at the Cardiosurgical Department of Clinic No 1 of the Volgograd State Medical University over the period from January 2012 to September 2015. The examined patients were subdivided into two groups. Group One was composed of the initial 26 patients operated on during the period from January 2012 to April 2014. Group Two comprised the remaining 28 patients operated on during the period from April 2014 to September 2015. Safety of performing the intervention was determined by prediction of the postoperative lethality and complications rates by means of the V-POSSUM scale. The predicted lethality and complications rates for both groups amounted to 2.3 and 23.5%, respectively. We carried out a comparative analysis of intraoperative data such as duration of the operative intervention, duration of mobilization of the aortoiliac segment, time of aortic cross-clamping, volume of intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative complications rate, conversion in the open access. In the early postoperative period we analysed the level of lethality, complications rate and indices of postoperative rehabilitation of the patient. For demonstrativeness of the dynamics of alterations of intraoperative indices, as well as for plotting the 'learning curve' the moving average method was used. Analysing the obtained findings revealed that implementation of total laparoscopic aortofemoral reconstructive operations was not accompanied by either high lethality or great number of complications, not exceeding the predicted indices by the V-POSSUM scale. The average duration of the operation in Group I amounted to 346±18.3 min, and in Group II to 316±13.3 min, with the time of aortic cross-clamping averaging 80±10.3 and 61±4.2 min and the volume of blood loss 898±23.5 ml, respectively. As experience was gained in performing laparoscopic reconstructive operations in Group Two patients the 'learning curve' demonstrated a statistically significant decrease of these intraoperative values, as well as a decrease in the complication rate and parameters of the patient's state in the postoperative period. Due to absence of extensive laparotomic or retroperitoneal accesses, the early postoperative period was characterised by rapid restoration of the passage along the intestine, early activation of patients, short length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital stay."
CD010019,0,27010343,0,Home treatment of patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism with the oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban. Rationale and design of the HoT-PE Trial.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening acute cardiovascular syndrome. However, more than 95 % of patients are haemodynamically stable at presentation, and among them are patients at truly low risk who may qualify for immediate or early discharge. The Home Treatment of Pulmonary Embolism (HoT-PE) study is a prospective international multicentre single-arm phase 4 management (cohort) trial aiming to determine whether home treatment of acute low-risk PE with the oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is feasible, effective, and safe. Patients with confirmed PE, who have no right ventricular dysfunction or free floating thrombi in the right atrium or ventricle, are eligible if they meet none of the exclusion criteria indicating haemodynamic instability, serious comorbidity or any condition mandating hospitalisation, or a familial/social environment unable to support home treatment. The first dose of rivaroxaban is given in hospital, and patients are discharged within 48 hours of presentation. Rivaroxaban is taken for at least three months. The primary outcome is symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or PE-related death within three months of enrolment. Secondary outcomes include quality of life and patient satisfaction, and health care resource utilisation compared to existing data on standard-duration hospital treatment. HoT-PE is planned to analyse 1,050 enrolled patients, providing 80 % power to reject the null hypothesis that the recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism is >3 % with α≤0.05. If the hypothesis of HoT-PE is confirmed, early discharge and out-of-hospital treatment may become an attractive, potentially cost-saving option for a significant proportion of patients with acute PE."
CD010019,0,28529266,0,Preoperative biliary drainage versus direct surgery for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma: A retrospective study at a single center.,"Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCC, also known as a Klatskin tumor) is the most common type of cholangiocarcinoma (CC). Preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) is indicated for pCC patients with acute cholangitis or patients who need portal vein embolization (PVE). However, the routine performance of PBD in other patients with pCC is still controversial. The current study retrospectively examined patients with pCC who did not undergo PVE and who did not have cholangitis who were seen at this Hospital to assess the advantages and disadvantages of PBD. This study also sought to find an optimal value of total bilirubin (TB) to indicate performing PBD. Between 2009 and 2014, after excluding patients with acute cholangitis and PVE, patients who had undergone hepatectomy for pCC were enrolled in this study. First, the surgical outcomes and postoperative outcomes were compared between PBD group and direct surgery group. Second, ROC curve analysis of a subgroup of patients was performed to find the best cut off value of TB for indicating the PBD. Third, the costs for patients, including the total charges and the charges per day were compared between the two groups. Subjects were 218 patients in total. Fifty-five patients underwent PBD. This group had a longer operative time [390 (210-700) vs. 360 (105-730) min, p = 0.013], and a longer hospital stay [20 (9-48) vs. 17 (6-93) days, p = 0.007], but underwent vascular resection and reconstruction less often [8 (14.5%) vs. 50 (30.7%), p = 0.019]. Mortality and morbidity were comparable between the two groups. ROC curve analysis of a subgroup of patients indicated that the cut-off value for total bilirubin was 218.75 μmol/L (12.4 mg/dL). The total hospital charges and the charges per day did not differ significantly for the two groups. Disadvantages of PBD were a longer operating time and a longer duration of hospitalization, but the short-term surgical outcomes and hospital charges of PBD group were comparable to the direct surgery group. PBD should be considered for patients when the diagnosis is still suspicious of pCC. Based on the current data, the optimal cut-off value for preoperative TB was 218.75 μmol/L (12.4 mg/dL) to indicate PBD for patients with pCC."

CD010019,0,26795933,0,Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation: conceptual evolution based on emerging evidence.,"The objective of this article is to review the contemporary literature on optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. Relevant studies were searched through MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, and the EMBASE database. Of the 6852 publications retrieved, 23 were considered relevant, including 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 12 meta-analyses. Initially prescribed for 3-6 months after first-generation DES, the recommended duration of DAPT was subsequently prolonged to at least 1 year, a response to reports of late stent thrombosis after DAPT discontinuation. Seven RCTs subsequently suggested that 1-year DAPT may not be necessary after DES implantation, and that a 6-month or even a 3-month course of DAPT may be as effective and safer. In contrast, four RCTs examining the benefit of DAPT beyond 1 year reached conflicting conclusions. In the DAPT trial, 30-month compared with 12-month DAPT after DES resulted in reduced rates of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular events, but greater rates of major bleeding with increased non-cardiac mortality. Several meta-analyses have subsequently been performed collectively demonstrating increased rates of all-cause mortality with prolonged DAPT compared with shorter DAPT after DES, due to greater non-cardiovascular mortality with prolonged DAPT not offset by a concomitant reduction in cardiac mortality. The benefit-risk ratio of prolonged DAPT appears to be better in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) than in those without prior MI. On the basis of these findings, a personalized approach is advisable when deciding upon the optimal duration of DAPT after DES, wherein the individualized risks of ischaemic vs. bleeding events are carefully considered for each patient."

Moreover, the safety of the use of postoperative anticoagulants in the aforementioned patients is a concern. This meta-analysis aims to explore the effectiveness and safety of the preventive anticoagulants to prevent PVT in patients undergoing splenectomy because of liver cirrhosis. Four English language databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) and four Chinese language databases (i.e., Wanfang, CNKI, Cqvip, and CBM) were searched for randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies on the use of preventive anticoagulants to prevent PVT in patients undergoing splenectomy because of liver cirrhosis from their inception to September 15, 2015. The primary outcome was postoperative PVT incidence. The secondary outcomes included postoperative complications and adverse reaction. Study-specific odds ratios were combined to calculate pooled value through a fixed effects model. A total of 17 original studies were included, involving 1,497 patients. This meta-analysis showed that the preventive anticoagulant group had a lower incidence of PVT than the no anticoagulant group (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.40; P < 0.05). According to the description of limited studies, the upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage mainly occurred in the no anticoagulant group. Meanwhile, the adverse reaction was trivial in the group using anticoagulants, which could easily be released with no special management. Postoperative anticoagulants can effectively decrease PVT incidence in subjects undergoing splenectomy because of liver cirrhosis. These published studies are more prone to show that no serious negative influence of anticoagulants exists in the aspect of safety. However, further studies are still needed."

CD010019,0,27537530,1,Multicenter Trial of Rivaroxaban for Early Discharge of Pulmonary Embolism From the Emergency Department (MERCURY PE): Rationale and Design.,"Traditionally, patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) are admitted from the emergency department and treated with low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin. Several studies now demonstrate that it is possible to identify low-risk PE patients that can safely be treated as outpatients. The advent of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban has made it easier than ever to manage patients outside of the hospital. This article describes the design of a randomized controlled trial aimed at testing the hypothesis that low-risk PE patients can be safely and effectively managed at home using rivaroxaban, resulting in fewer days of hospitalization than standard-of-care treatment."
CD010019,0,27092971,0,Fecal Carriage of Enterobacteriaceae Producing Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases in Hospitalized Patients and Healthy Community Volunteers in Burkina Faso.,"Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) have been described worldwide, but few reports focused on Burkina Faso. To assess the prevalence of digestive carriage of such bacteria in the community and in the hospital, 214 fecal samples, 101 from healthy volunteers and 113 from hospitalized patients without digestive pathology, were collected in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso economic capital, during July and August 2014. Stool samples were screened using ESBL agar plates. Strains were identified by mass spectrometry using the Biotyper MALDI-TOF. ESBL production was confirmed with the double-disc synergy test. Susceptibility was tested using the disk diffusion method on Müller-Hinton agar. The main ESBL genes were detected using multiplex PCR and bidirectional gene sequencing. Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups were identified using a PCR-based method. During the study period, prevalence of subjects with fecal ESBL-PE was 32% (69/214), 22% among healthy volunteers and 42% among inpatients. All but two ESBL, CTX-M-15 and ESBL-PE, were mostly E. coli (78%). Among the 60 ESBL-producing E. coli strains, 26% belonged to phylogenetic group D, 23.3% to group A, 20% to group B1, 6.6% to group B2, and 3.3% to the ST131 clone. Univariate analysis showed that history of hospitalization and previous antibiotic use were risk factors associated with ESBL-PE fecal carriage. In Burkina Faso, the prevalence of both healthy subjects from the community and hospitalized patients with fecal ESBL-PE is alarmingly high. This feature should be taken into consideration by both general practitioners and hospital doctors with regard to empirical treatments of infections, notably urinary tract infections."

We have developed a novel surgical approach for the treatment of patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension, selective decongestive devascularization, and shunt of the gastrosplenic region (SDDS-GSR). This aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of SDDS-GSR with splenectomy with pericardial devascularization (SPD). MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study was undertaken between 2006 and 2013 and included 110 patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension, 34 of whom underwent SDDS-GSR; 76 patients underwent SPD. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate clinical outcomes, mortality, the incidence of re-bleeding, encephalopathy, and portal venous system thrombosis (PVST). RESULTS Postoperatively portal venous pressure decreased by 20% in both groups. The long-term incidence of re-bleeding and PVST was significantly lower in the SDDS-GSR group compared with the SPD group (P=0.018 and P=0.039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This preliminary retrospective study has shown that SDDS-GSR was an effective treatment for patients with esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension that may be used as a first-line treatment to prevent variceal bleeding and lower the incidence of PVST."

A previously validated tool (Khorana Score, [KS]) identifies VTE risk in cancer outpatients with 5 easily available variables but has not been studied in the inpatient setting. We evaluated the validity of KS in predicting VTE risk in hospitalized cancer patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive oncology inpatients at the Cleveland Clinic from 11/2012 to 12/2014 (n = 3531). Patients were excluded for VTE on admission (n = 304), incomplete KS data (n = 439) or other reasons (n = 8). Data collected included demographics, cancer type, length of stay (LOS), anticoagulant use, and laboratory values. Multivariate risk factors were identified with stepwise logistic regression, confirmed with bootstrap analysis. Of 2780 patients included, 106 (3.8%) developed VTE during hospitalization. Median age was 62 (range, 19-98) years and 56% were male. Median LOS was 5 (range, 0-152) days. High risk KS (≥ 3) was significantly associated with VTE in uni- and multivariate analyses (OR 2.5, 95% [confidence interval] CI 1.3-4.9). Other significant variables included male gender (OR 1.67, 1.1-2.53), older age (OR 0.86, 0.75-0.99) and use of anticoagulants (OR 0.57, 0.39-0.85). Recursive partitioning analysis suggested optimal cut point for KS is 2 (OR 1.82, 1.23-2.69). This is the first report validating KS as a risk tool to predict VTE in hospitalized cancer patients. Using this tool could lead to more consistent and successful application of inpatient thromboprophylaxis."

CD010019,0,28379902,0,Cangrelor: A New Route for P2Y12 Inhibition.,"Antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor is a key component of treatment for patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Before the development of cangrelor (Kengreal, The Medicines Company, Parsippany, NJ), only oral P2Y12 inhibitors were available. Cangrelor is a reversible P2Y12 inhibitor that is administered as an intravenous infusion, and its quick onset and offset make it an appealing option for antiplatelet therapy, particularly for patients who are unable to take oral medications. Although cangrelor struggled to show benefit in early trials, the positive results of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial led to its approval for use as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention to reduce the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction, repeat coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis in patients who have not been treated with another P2Y12 inhibitor and are not being given a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Cangrelor has also been evaluated as an option for bridging therapy in patients who must discontinue their oral P2Y12 inhibitor before coronary artery bypass grafting. This review of cangrelor will discuss its mechanism of action, its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, the clinical trial experience, and its potential place in therapy."

For this purpose we surveyed 52 patients who underwent a first ischemic stroke (29 women and 23 men) aged 52-74 years. Patients were divided into 2 groups: primary (25 patients) received in addition to basic therapy cytoflavin: intravenously at 20 ml per 400 ml of 5% glucose solution, 1 time a day for 10 days, then into 2 tablets 2 times a day for half an hour before food for a month, and the comparison group (27 patients) who received standard treatment. The control group consisted of 12 healthy people. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory tests were carried out a comprehensive neuropsychological study and evaluation of the data on the scale NIHSS, Bartell, Beck, Spielberger-Hanin, test «frontal dysfunction of the battery» and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Furthermore, determination carried neurotrophic factors: nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor brain (BDNF). The study was conducted in the dynamics: before treatment and 2 months after treatment. Patients in the recovery period of the first ischemic stroke revealed moderate manifestations of neuropsychological disorders status and reduction of neurotrophic factors. Inclusion in cytoflavin scheme increased the efficiency of the treatment, which was manifested in a more pronounced when compared with the results of basic therapy, positive dynamics of neurological symptoms and improved cognitive function, accompanied by an increase in BDNF levels.

CD010019,0,27914131,0,The Role of Pharmacomechanical Endovascular Intervention for Iliofemoral Vein Thrombosis Compared to Conventional Anticoagulation Therapy.,"Although anticoagulation therapy is the primary treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), it has not been associated with the rapid recanalization of the venous occlusion. Moreover, it is associated with long-term disability due to post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). In contrast, pharmacomechanical endovascular intervention (PMI) results in more rapid clinical improvement in DVT patients, but there are few reports on its long-term outcomes. This retrospective study evaluated the clinical effectiveness of PMI compared to conventional anticoagulation therapy (ACA) for acute and subacute iliofemoral DVT. We reviewed the medical records of 102 patients with iliofemoral DVT. A total of 46 patients for ACA and 56 patients for PMI were enrolled. We analyzed the clinical differences between the PMI and ACA groups by comparing the clinical signs, residual DVT free-rate, and PTS-free rate. There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics and risk factors except age between the groups (age: ACA, 52.0 ± 18.0 years; PMI, 59.0 ± 17.0 years; P = 0.035). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year residual DVT-free rate (ACA = 84.7%, 71.6%, and 46.0%; PMI = 82.1%, 76.8%, and 76.8%, respectively; P = 0.235) was not significantly different. However, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year PTS-free rate was significantly different (ACA = 93.5%, 74.0%, and 55.7%; PMI = 92.9%, 90.0%, and 90.0%, respectively; P = 0.019). There was no significant difference in the rate of other complications. PMI showed a lower incidence of PTS during the follow-up period.

Retrospective cohort study of patients with PE, using an enhanced administrative database of approximately 20 % of hospitalizations in the United States, 2008-2011. We used hierarchical logistic regression to identify patient- and hospital-level factors associated with thrombolytic use and quantified between-hospital variation in thrombolysis. We calculated rates of hemorrhagic complications and mortality in patients receiving thrombolytics stratified by vasopressor use. We identified 91,860 hospitalizations for PE; thrombolytics were utilized in 13.2 % (578/4363) who received vasopressors and 1.6 % (1320/82,997) who did not receive vasopressors. Patients who received thrombolytics were younger, more likely white, with private insurance, fewer comorbidities and more acute organ failures. Hospitals varied widely in thrombolysis rates for PE (0-100 % of patients on vasopressors, 0-12.5 % not on vasopressors) with 17 % of variation unexplained by patient or hospital characteristics. Bleeding complication rates for patients receiving thrombolytics versus no thrombolytics, respectively, were: ICH (0.8 vs. 0.08 %, p < 0.01), major bleeding (13 vs. 3 %, p < 0.01), and major bleeding with transfusion (2.5 vs. 0.05 %, p < 0.01).

CD010019,0,28191610,0,Italian intersociety consensus on DOAC use in internal medicine.,"The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are drugs used in clinical practice since 2009 for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. The four DOACs, including the three factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and one direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) provide oral anticoagulation therapy alternatives to Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Despite their clear advantages, the DOACs require on the part of the internist a thorough knowledge of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics to ensure their correct use, laboratory monitoring and the appropriate management of adverse events. This document represents a consensus paper on the use of DOACs by representatives of three Italian scientific societies: the Italian Society of Internal Medicine (SIMI), the Federation of the Associations of Hospital Managers (FADOI), and the Society for the Study of Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET). This document formulates expert opinion guidance for pragmatic managing, monitoring and reversing the anticoagulant effect of DOACs in both chronic and emergency settings. This practical guidance may help the internist to create adequate protocols for patients hospitalized ion internal medicine wards, where patients are often elderly subjects affected by poly-morbidities and renal insufficiency, and, thus, require particular attention to drug-drug interactions and peri-procedural protocols."

Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of the practice of perioperative medicine, important new evidence is published in journals representing a variety of medical and surgical specialties. Keeping current with the evidence that drives best practice in perioperative medicine is therefore challenging. We set out to identify, critically review, and summarize key evidence which has the most potential for practice change. We integrated the new evidence into the existing body of medical knowledge and identified practical implications for real world patient care.

Treatment with these therapies in specialised pulmonary hypertension centres has resulted in reductions in patient symptoms, disease progression and mortality, and improved exercise capacity. Recognition of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is important, as this cause of pulmonary hypertension may be amenable to surgical treatment. Several new oral drugs, including macitentan, riociguat and selexipag, some of which have novel modes of action, and the use of combinations of PAH drugs have recently been shown to be beneficial in treating PAH and are likely to change treatment for this condition in the future."

It is challenging as inter-individual responses to antiplatelet medication vary significantly and common complications are bleeding and ischemic events. In this study, we aimed to analyze the incidence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) to antiplatelet medication in patients undergoing PFO/ASD closure as well as clinical complications and thrombus formation on the occluder during six-month follow-up. This hypothesis generating pilot study was observed, which included 140 patients undergoing PFO/ASD closure. The primary endpoint was pharmacodynamic response to antiplatelet medication. A composite of death, myocardial infarction, bleeding, stroke and thrombus formation on the occluder during six-month follow-up was the secondary endpoint. HTPR to clopidogrel was analyzed using the vasodilator-stimulated protein phosphorylation (VASP), HTPR to aspirin by light-transmission aggregometry (LTA). In 71% of patients HTPR to clopidogrel was detected, HTPR to aspirin in only 4%. We observed 12 complications, 9 bleeding events (including 3 major bleeding events) and 3 transient ischemic attacks. No stroke and no thrombus formation on the occluder occurred. The primary endpoint was not associated with the secondary endpoint. The incidence of HTPR to clopidogrel in PFO/ASD closure patients is very high. Despite this high incidence, no stroke or thrombus formation on the occluder occurred at all. This leads to the hypothesis, that the benefit of additional clopidogrel medication is questionable and has to be investigated in large-scale clinical trials."

CD010019,0,28745680,0,[The decreased level of plasma carnitine in patients with epilepsy].,"Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have long been known to affect carnitine metabolism, dropping the plasma free carnitine. Valproate (VPA) was considered to be the strongest carnitine-reducing agent. VPA-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy and hepatotoxicity are well known, and pre-existing carnitine deficiency can be a predisposing factor, especially in congenital metabolic disorders. Several studies have shown that carnitine supplementation in patients receiving VPA to result in subjective and objective improvements and to prevent VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and encephalopathy, in parallel with increases in carnitine serum concentrations. Level of free plasma carnitine <20 micromol/l (syn. carnitine deficiency) in patients with epilepsy (in 15-30% of cases) may occur not only with administration of VPA but with administration of other AEDs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) and low nutritional intake of carnitine. Some findings indicate that the number of AEDs used is a risk factor for carnitine deficiency. It was established that body weight, height and multidrug therapy are significantly associated with low level of free plasma in epileptic patients. Carnitine deficiency can have severe consequences; but most epileptic patients suffering from it are asymptomatic. Although carnitine deficiency is not uncommon among patients receiving AEDs, it seems not necessary to routinely monitor carnitine levels in epileptic ambulatory patients, this is reasonable only in groups of risk. L-carnitine supplementation is clearly indicated in case of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity (i.v. administration) VPA overdose (i.v. administration), primary carnitine-transporter defect and is strongly recommended in specific secondary carnitine deficiency syndromes, symptomatic VPA-associated hyperammonemia, infants and young children receiving VPA, especially those younger than 2 years, patients with a complex neurologic disorder, who are receiving multiple AEDs, patients who have risk factors for hepatotoxicity and carnitine insufficiency. In the absence of double blind trials, clinical practice is based on empiric observation, clinical experience, and theory. Well-designed studies of specific and general uses of L-carnitine replacement therapy in patients with epilepsy are needed."

CD010019,0,27378603,0,Protamine (heparin)-induced thrombocytopenia: a review of the serological and clinical features associated with anti-protamine/heparin antibodies.,"Protamine is widely used in medicine as a rapidly-acting antidote to heparin, particularly for reversing heparin anticoagulation after cardiac surgery. Protamine is also used as a stabilizing additive to certain preparations of insulin. Recent reports demonstrate that protamine and heparin form multimolecular complexes that result in high rates of immunization in post-cardiac surgery patients, particularly of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibodies; a subset of these anti-protamine/heparin IgG antibodies activates platelets through their FcγIIA (IgG) receptors. Although the clinical consequences of anti-protamine/heparin antibodies that are newly generated after cardiac surgery are unknown, there is evidence that platelet-activating anti-protamine/heparin antibodies already present at the time of cardiac surgery might occasionally explain more severe thrombocytopenia with delayed platelet count recovery, as well as thromboembolic complications, in the post-cardiac surgery setting. Triggers for such antibodies remain poorly-defined, but could include preoperative administration of heparin to diabetic patients receiving protamine-insulin as well as recent previous cardiac surgery. Anti-protamine/heparin antibodies have several features in common with anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) PF4/heparin antibodies implicated in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), including immunization by heparin-containing multimolecular complexes, predominant IgG class, pathological platelet-activating properties, relatively rapid IgG formation without IgM precedence, and antibody transience. Despite these similarities, the risk of anti-protamine/heparin antibody-mediated complications seems to affect the early post-cardiac surgery period, whereas HIT usually occurs at least 5 days following cardiac surgery. Clinicians need to become aware of this recently recognized immunohematological disorder, and research is needed to identify triggers of immunization, improve detection of pathological antibodies and identify patients at risk of this complication."

Acute physiological and performance responses to high-intensity resistance circuit training in hypoxic and normoxic conditions. J Strength Cond Res 31(4): 1040-1047, 2017-The aim of this study was to analyze physical performance and physiological variables during high-intensity resistance circuit training (HRC) with the addition of 2 levels (moderate and high) of systemic hypoxia. Twelve resistance-trained young male subjects participated in the study. After a 6 repetition maximum testing session, participants performed 3 randomized trials of HRC: normoxia (NORM: fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] = 0.21; ∼0 m altitude), moderate hypoxia (MH: FiO2 = 0.16; ∼2.100 m altitude), or high hypoxia (HH: FiO2 = 0.13; ∼3.800 m altitude), as controlled by a hypoxic generator. Bench press force, heart rate and heart rate variability, rating of perceived exertion, resting metabolic rate, energy cost, and countermovement jump were assessed in each session. Heart rate variability in HH was significantly lower (standard deviation of all normal NN intervals [intervals between two ""normal"" beats] = 111.9 vs. 86.7 milliseconds; standard deviation of the difference between consecutive NN intervals = 19.5 vs. 17.0 milliseconds; p ≤ 0.05) in comparison with NORM. There were significant differences in rating of perceived exertion between NORM and HH (11.6 vs. 13.8 points). Peak and mean force on the bench press were significantly lower (p ≤ 0.05) in HH when compared with MH (peak: 725 vs. 488 N; mean: 574 vs. 373 N). Energy cost was significantly higher (p ≤ 0.01) in both hypoxic conditions compared with NORM (NORM: 10.4; MH: 11.7; HH: 13.3 kJ·min). There were no differences between conditions in heart rate and countermovement jump variables. These results indicate that hypoxic stimuli during HRC exercise alter physical performance and physiological variables and affect how strenuous the exercise is perceived to be. High-intensity resistance circuit training in hypoxia increases the stress on the performance and physiological responses, and these differences must be taken into account to avoid an excessive overload."

Hospitalization is a major risk factor for developing VTE. Hospital-associated events account for more than 50% of all cases of VTE.

CD010019,0,27098835,0,The BRIDGE trial: What the hospitalist should know.,"Atrial fibrillation patients often require warfarin interruption for an invasive procedure or surgery. Heparin bridging therapy has been frequently used during warfarin interruption under the premise of providing a theoretical mitigation against thromboembolism that overweighs expected higher rates of bleeding. Up until recently, little definite clinical evidence was available to guide the hospitalist on optimal perioperative anticoagulant management. The landmark BRIDGE (Perioperative Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) trial provided high-quality evidence that a simple interruption of warfarin in the average atrial fibrillation patient undergoing an elective procedure or surgery is noninferior to bridging therapy for efficacy and superior to bridging therapy in preventing major bleeding. To guide the hospitalist, we propose a treatment algorithm based on these recent data. We review the literature that led to the trial and highlight its practice-changing implications as a proof of concept that calls to question the premise of heparin bridging therapy beyond the atrial fibrillation population.

CD010019,0,28640149,0,Analysis of risk factors for intraoperative hemorrhage of cesarean scar pregnancy.,"The current commonly used treatments for cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) include multiple treatments such as medication, uterine artery embolization, curettage and surgery, and their combinations. However, every treatment option has risks of excessive hemorrhage from uterus. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the risk factors for intraoperative hemorrhage of different treatments for CSP patients, with the hope to provide the guidance for CSP treatment.Fifty-eight cases of CSP patients who were treated with curettage after medication, curettage after uterine artery embolization, or surgery were retrospectively analyzed and compared for the clinical efficacy, length of hospital stay, and hemorrhage rate. Further, they were divided into the bleeding group (≥200 mL, 15 cases) and the control group (<200 mL, 43 cases). The hemorrhage-related risk factors were subjected to univariate analysis, including age, pregnant times, delivery times, abortion times or curettage times, the time from last cesarean section, menolipsis time, serum human chorionic gonadotropin level, ultrasound typing, maximum diameter of gestational sac or mass under ultrasound, peritrophoblastic blood flow around the mass, and the distance of gestational sac or mass from the uterine serosa layer. The significant indexes in univariate analysis were further analyzed using both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis.The success rate, length of hospital stay, and hemorrhage rate were not significantly different among the 3 treatment groups (P > .05). Univariate analysis found that patients in the bleeding group had significantly longer menolipsis time and greater maximum diameter than patients in the control group (P < .05). ROC analysis showed that the optimal cutoff for menolipsis time and maximum diameter were 51 days and 27 mm, respectively, and the areas under their corresponding ROC were 0.680 and 0.787, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that only the maximum diameter in the retrospective equation was of significance (P < .05, odds ratio: 1.067, 95% confidence interval: 1.014∼1.123].All treatments have high success rates and no significant effects on intraoperative bleeding. Both menolipsis time and maximum diameter can be used to predict the risk of intraoperative bleeding, and the latter have a greater predictive value."

An important aspect is the treatment of AF in terms of stroke prevention. In patients with absolute contraindication to long-term anticoagulation due to high bleeding risk, a valuable alternative exists in left atrial appendage (LAA) closure. Unfortunately, thrombus in the LAA is a contraindication to the procedure because of high risk of embolization.

The first population included patients who received an IVCF between January 2005 and August 2013 at our community hospital center. Demographic information, indications for placement, and retrieval rate was recorded among other variables. The second population comprised of patients receiving an IVCF from 2005 to 2012 according to the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) using ICD-9CM coding. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the year of admission for comparison, that is, first group from 2005 to 2008 and the second from 2009 to 2012. In addition, we analyzed annual trends in filter placement, acute venothromboembolic events (VTE) and several underlying comorbidities within this population.At our center, 802 IVCFs were placed (55.2% retrievable); 34% for absolute, 61% for relative, and 5% for prophylactic indications. Major bleeding (27.5%), minor self-limited bleeding (13.7%), and fall history (11.2%) were the commonest indications. Periprocedural complication rate was 0.7%, and filter retrieval rate was 7%. The NIS population (811,487 filters) saw a decline in IVCF placement after year 2009, following an initial uptrend (Ptrend < 0.01). IVCF use among patients with neither acute VTE nor bleeding among prior VTE saw a 3-fold absolute reduction from 2005 to 2012 (33,075-11,655; Ptrend < 0.01). Patients from 2009 to 2012 were more likely to be male and had higher rates of acute VTE, thrombolytic use, cancer, bleeding, hypotension, acute cardiorespiratory failure, shock, prior falls, blood product transfusion, hospital mortality including higher Charlson comorbidity scores. The patients were younger, had shorter length of stay, and were less likely to be associated with strokes including hemorrhagic or require ventilator support. Prior falls (adjusted odds ratio-aOR 2.8), thrombolytic use (aOR 1.76), and shock (aOR 1.45) were most predictive of IVCF placement between 2009 and 2012 on regression analysis.Recent trends suggest that a higher proportion of patients receive temporary IVCF, for predominantly relative indications. Nationally, the number of filters being placed is decreasing, especially among those who did not experience acute VTE or bleeding events. Prior falls, thrombolytic therapy, and shock were most predictive of IVCF placement in latter half of the study period."

A total of 413 patients undergoing fracture-related surgery from 9 Swiss orthopedic and trauma centers were enrolled. The authors selected the type of venous thromboembolic prophylaxis according to standardized medical practice at the participating centers before the inclusion of patients: 208 patients received rivaroxaban and 205 received the standard of care. Data on symptomatic thromboembolic and bleeding events, surgery-related complications, death, adverse events, time to mobilization, and hospital discharge were collected. Symptomatic thromboembolic events were reported in 1 patient (0.5%) and 2 patients (1.0%) and treatment-emergent major bleeding events were reported in 1 patient (0.5%) and 2 patients (1.0%) receiving rivaroxaban and the standard of care, respectively. The durations of hospital stay and venous thromboembolic prophylaxis were similar in the 2 groups. In both groups, adverse events related to venous thromboembolic prophylaxis were reported in 12 patients. The proportion of patients with minor and major fracture surgery was 74.3% and 25.7%, respectively. In patients undergoing minor fracture surgery receiving rivaroxaban (n=167) and the standard of care (n=140), no symptomatic thromboembolic events and no major bleeding events were reported. Outcomes of this study indicate that rivaroxaban might be an appropriate oral alternative for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis in routine medical care after fracture-related major and minor surgery.

Recent studies, however, have reported similar outcomes regardless of presentation time. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were queried from January 1990 through December 2016. Only studies comparing STEMI outcomes during off-hours versus on-hours with percutaneous coronary intervention were included. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool outcomes across the studies. Clinical end points included short- (<30 days of presentation), intermediate- (at 1 to 2 years), and long-term (at 3 to 4 years) stent thrombosis, mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). A total of 86,776 patients (62 years and 74.5% male) were identified from 39 studies. There was no significant difference between both groups with regard to mean DBT (odds ratio [OR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.73 to 4.22, p = 0.67) or median DBT (p = 0.19). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups for short-term end points including mortality (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.25, p = 0.08), MI (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.74, p = 0.18), MACE (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.20, p = 0.40), or stent thrombosis (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.82, p = 0.31). Similarly, intermediate-term end points were not statistically different for mortality (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.05, p = 0.46), MI (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.02, p = 0.08), or MACE (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08, p = 0.98). Long-term end points did not differ statistically between groups for mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09, p = 0.46), MI (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.84, p = 0.44), or MACE (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08, p = 0.67).

Between 2010 and 2014, we treated seven patients with renal cell carcinoma and IVC tumor thrombus presurgically with sunitinib. We retrospectively evaluated primitive tumor size, the level of tumor thrombus according to Novick's classification, its distance above the renal vein, thrombus diameter at its widest segment, and histopathological change after sunitinib treatment. Three patients were diagnosed histologically. Percutaneous biopsy of the renal mass before sunitinib treatment was performed in two patients. One patient was diagnosed after sunitinib treatment following nephrectomy. The primitive tumors shrank upon sunitinib therapy in four cases; however, although the caval thrombus was downstaged (from level II to I) in one patient, the level of caval thrombus did not change in five patients and increased in one patient (from level III to IV). We evaluated the histopathological effects in two patients. In one patient, the IVC tumor thrombus was mostly replaced with necrotic tissue, but its thrombus level was not downstaged. In the other patient, the IVC tumor thrombus was downstaged, but tumor thrombus was not replaced with necrotic tissue and viable tumor cells remained. Presurgical treatment with sunitinib for renal cell carcinoma with IVC tumor thrombus appears to have limited effect on IVC tumor thrombus, in contrast to its effects on primitive tumor shrinkage. In the absence of evidence of presurgical benefits from prospective studies, this treatment may not be systematically advisable."

This was a single-center prospective study. Patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention were anticoagulated with bivalirudin alone or unfractionated heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Propensity score matching was performed to control for baseline imbalances and yielded 1168 patients. There was lower incidence of the composite outcome of death from any cause or major bleeding at 30 days (P = 0.005), 6 months (P = 0.005), and 12 months (P = 0.001) of follow-up in the bivalirudin group, compared with the heparin plus glycoprotein inhibitor group. The administration of bivalirudin was associated with lower rate of all-cause mortality at 1 year of follow-up (P = 0.009). The incidence of major bleeding was lower in the bivalirudin group at 1, 6, and 12 months of follow-up (P = 0.002, P = 0.013 and P = 0.017, respectively). The incidence of stroke and reinfarction were similar between groups during follow-up.

We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the role of perioperative PGE1 infusion in LDLT. Patients in the study arm received PGE1 (alprostadil) at the rate of 0.25 μg/kg/hour, starting at 1 hour after portal venous reperfusion, and continued for 96 hours. The primary endpoint was early allograft dysfunction (EAD). We analyzed multiple secondary endpoints including postoperative liver function and renal function parameters, acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), postoperative bleeding, overall mortality, and posttransplant hospital stay. The incidence of EAD was lower in the PGE1 arm, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (22.4% versus 36%; P = 0.21). Among the secondary endpoints, the incidence of AKI was significantly lower in the PGE1 arm (8.2% versus 28%; P = 0.02), as were the peak and mean postoperative creatinine levels. The need for renal replacement therapy was similar between the 2 groups. Among the postoperative graft function parameters, postoperative alanine aminotransferase level was significantly lower in the PGE1 arm (P = 0.04), whereas the remaining parameters including serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and international normalized ratio were similar between the 2 arms. There was no difference in the incidence of HAT and postoperative bleeding, in-hospital mortality, and posttransplant hospital stay between the 2 arms.

CD010019,0,28646118,0,Direct oral anticoagulants for treatment of HIT: update of Hamilton experience and literature review.,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are attractive options for treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We report our continuing experience in Hamilton, ON, Canada, since January 1, 2015 (when we completed our prospective study of rivaroxaban for HIT), using rivaroxaban for serologically confirmed HIT (4Ts score ≥4 points; positive platelet factor 4 [PF4]/heparin immunoassay, positive serotonin-release assay). We also performed a literature review of HIT treatment using DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban). We focused on patients who received DOAC therapy for acute HIT as either primary therapy (group A) or secondary therapy (group B; initial treatment using a non-DOAC/non-heparin anticoagulant with transition to a DOAC during HIT-associated thrombocytopenia). Our primary end point was occurrence of objectively documented thrombosis during DOAC therapy for acute HIT. We found that recovery without new, progressive, or recurrent thrombosis occurred in all 10 Hamilton patients with acute HIT treated with rivaroxaban. Data from the literature review plus these new data identified a thrombosis rate of 1 of 46 patients (2.2%; 95% CI, 0.4%-11.3%) in patients treated with rivaroxaban during acute HIT (group A, n = 25; group B, n = 21); major hemorrhage was seen in 0 of 46 patients. Similar outcomes in smaller numbers of patients were observed with apixaban (n = 12) and dabigatran (n = 11). DOACs offer simplified management of selected patients, as illustrated by a case of persisting (autoimmune) HIT (>2-month platelet recovery with inversely parallel waning of serum-induced heparin-independent serotonin release) with successful outpatient rivaroxaban management of HIT-associated thrombosis. Evidence supporting efficacy and safety of DOACs for acute HIT is increasing, with the most experience reported for rivaroxaban."
CD010019,0,28219663,0,Relation of Stroke and Major Bleeding to Creatinine Clearance in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (from the Fushimi AF Registry).,"Creatinine clearance (CrCl) has been widely used to adjust the dosage of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and exclude contraindicated patients. However, there are few available real-world data on the relation between CrCl and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with AF. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical characteristics and adverse events in Japanese patients with AF stratified by CrCl. We categorized patients in the Fushimi AF Registry, a large prospective community-based Japanese cohort of patients with AF, into 3 groups as follows: (1) CrCl <30 ml/min, (2) CrCl 30 to 49 ml/min, and (3) CrCl ≥50 ml/min. We evaluated 3,080 patients after a median follow-up of 1,076 days. Comparing with patients with CrCl ≥50 ml/min, patients with AF with CrCl <30 ml/min showed increased risks of stroke/systemic embolism (SE) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 2.65; p = 0.04) and major bleeding (HR, 2.08; 95% CI 1.23 to 3.39; p = 0.008) after adjustment for prespecified factors. Patients with AF with CrCl <30 ml/min were also associated with higher risks of all-cause death, hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, or the composite of all-cause death and stroke/SE. However, no excess risk of stroke/SE (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.58; p = 0.6) or major bleeding (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.48; p = 0.9) was noted for patients with CrCl 30 to 49 ml/min. In conclusion, Japanese patients with AF with CrCl <30 ml/min were closely associated with adverse clinical events including stroke/SE and major bleeding."

CD010019,0,27927817,0,Perioperative management of adult patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery.,"It is increasingly common for physicians and anaesthetists to be asked for advice in the medical management of surgical patients who have an incidental history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Advising clinicians requires an understanding of the common predictors, outcomes and management of perioperative stroke. The most important predictor of perioperative stroke is a previous history of stroke, and outcomes associated with such an event are extremely poor. The perioperative management of this patient group needs careful consideration to minimise the thrombotic risk and a comprehensive, individualised approach is crucial. Although there is literature supporting the management of such patients undergoing cardiac surgery, evidence is lacking in the setting of non-cardiac surgical intervention. This article reviews the current evidence and provides a pragmatic interpretation to inform the perioperative management of patients with a history of stroke and/or TIA presenting for elective non-cardiac surgery."

CD010019,0,26598101,0,Possible Rivaroxaban Failure during the Postpartum Period.,"Rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and for reducing the risk of DVT and PE recurrence. To our knowledge, no data are presently available to guide DOAC dosing in the postpartum period when pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes induced by pregnancy have an impact on drug clearance and increase hypercoagulability for a period of 6-8 weeks after delivery. We describe the case of a 35-year-old postpartum woman who presented to the emergency department with a diagnosis of a new multiple segmental PE 5 days after starting rivaroxaban therapy for a diagnosis of DVT. No precipitating cause, including noncompliance, was identified as a source of thrombosis embolization or extension. The patient was admitted, a heparin infusion was started for the management of PE, and rivaroxaban was discontinued. She was transitioned to enoxaparin 1 mg/kg (90 mg) subcutaneously every 12 hours the next day, bridged to warfarin, and discharged home on the overlapping regimen with close follow-up by the pharmacist-managed outpatient Anticoagulation Management Service. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of potential failure associated with rivaroxaban therapy in the postpartum period, possibly due to pharmacokinetic alterations seen in the postpartum period contributing to decreased drug exposure, yielding reduced anticoagulant efficacy. Clinicians should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of DOAC therapy in postpartum patients or other special populations requiring anticoagulation therapy.

Perioperative and periprocedural management of anticoagulated patients has become routine for anesthesiologists, who frequently mediate communication between the prescribing physician and the surgeon and assess the risks of both thromboembolic complications and hemorrhage. Data from randomized clinical trials on perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy are lacking. Therefore, clinical judgment is typically needed regarding decisions to continue, discontinue, bridge, or resume anticoagulation and regarding the time points when these events should occur in the perioperative period. In this review, we will discuss the most commonly used anticoagulants used in outpatient settings and discuss their management in the perioperative period. Special considerations for regional anesthesia and interventional pain procedures will also be reviewed."

Concomitant severe thrombocytopenia makes anticoagulation for catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in patients with acute leukemia (AL) a challenge. Incidence of CRT has been reported to be increased in those with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) vs. those with centrally inserted ones (CICC). Our objective is to compare the incidence rate of CRT in leukemia inpatients who received either a PICC vs. CICC. We retrospectively reviewed adult inpatients admitted to hematology wards with a new diagnosis of AL and who received either a PICC or a CICC. Baseline patient and catheter characteristics were recorded. Our primary outcome was the incidence rate of CRT in each group. The secondary outcomes included rates of infectious and mechanical complications. Six hundred sixty-three patients received at least one PICC (338) or CICC (325) insertion. A total of 1331 insertions were recorded, with 82 (11.7 %) and 41 (6.5 %) CRT in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively. The incidence rates were 1.89 and 0.52 per 1000 catheter day in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively. A PICC, when compared to CICC, was a significant risk factor for CRT (sHR 2.5, p < 0.0001). The prevalence and incidence rates of CRT in our AL patients were higher than predicted for a general cancer patient population. These rates were higher in the PICC group compared to the CICC group.

Long-term intravenous prostacyclin is the usual treatment in severe patients with PAH, but it may increase the risk of hemorrhage due to its antiplatelet aggregation effect or thrombocytopenia. We investigated the impact of length of intravenous prostacyclin therapy on acute adverse cardiovascular events including hemorrhagic complication after LT. We retrospectively compared the incidence of adverse events (death, intrathoracic hematoma and bleeding, cardiac congestion or shock, cerebral infarction and pulmonary embolism) within 30 days after LT between no/short-term (median 0.6 years, n = 13) and long-term (median 3.7 years, n = 15) intravenous prostacyclin groups. There were no differences in the dose of intravenous prostacyclin and pulmonary artery pressure between the two groups. Among 22 adverse events (0.8 ± 1.1 events/patient), 4 events occurred in the no/short-term intravenous prostacyclin group and 18 occurred in the long-term intravenous prostacyclin group. The event rate per patient in the long-term intravenous prostacyclin group (1.2 ± 1.3 events/patient) was significantly higher than that in the no/short-term intravenous prostacyclin group (0.3 ± 0.5 events/patient) (P < 0.05).

CD010019,0,28290648,0,Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism: Current Therapy.,"Pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis are the two most important manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is the third most common life-threatening cardiovascular disease in the United States. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of VTE treatment. Most patients with deep venous thrombosis or low-risk pulmonary embolism can be treated in the outpatient setting with low-molecular-weight heparin and a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or direct-acting oral anticoagulants. Inpatient treatment of VTE begins with parenteral agents, preferably low-molecular-weight heparin. Unfractionated heparin is used if a patient is hemodynamically unstable or has severe renal insufficiency, high bleeding risk, hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are an alternative; however, concerns include cost and use of reversing agents (currently available only for dabigatran, although others are in development). If warfarin, dabigatran, or edoxaban is used, low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin must be administered concomitantly for at least five days and, in the case of warfarin, until the international normalized ratio becomes therapeutic for 24 hours. Hemodynamically unstable patients with a low bleeding risk may benefit from thrombolytic therapy. An inferior vena cava filter is not indicated for patients treated with anticoagulation. Current guidelines recommend anticoagulation for a minimum of three months. Special situations, such as active cancer and pregnancy, require long-term use of low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin. Anticoagulation beyond three months should be individualized based on a risk/benefit analysis. Symptomatic distal deep venous thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulation, but asymptomatic patients may be monitored with serial imaging for two weeks and treated only if there is extension."

Although mainly neuraxial vs general anesthesia has been addressed, population-level data on the impact of peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) are still lacking. Therefore, we investigated the association between PNB use and outcomes using retrospective data on 1,062,152 recipients of hip and knee arthroplasties (total hip arthroplasty [THA]/total knee arthroplasty [TKA]) from the national Premier Perspective database (2006-2013). Multilevel multivariable logistic regression models measured associations between PNB use and outcomes. Complications included cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal and renal complications, cerebrovascular events, infections, wound complications, thromboembolic complications, inpatient falls, and mortality. Resource utilization variables included blood transfusions, intensive care unit admissions, opioid consumption, cost, and length of stay. Overall, 12.5% of patients received a PNB, with an increase over time particularly among TKAs. Peripheral nerve block use was associated with lower odds for most adverse outcomes mainly among patients with THA. Notable beneficial effects were seen for wound complications (odds ratio 0.60 [95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.74]) among THA recipients and pulmonary complications (odds ratio 0.83 [95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.94]) in patients with TKA. Peripheral nerve block use was significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with a -16.2% and -12.7% reduction in opioid consumption for patients with THA and TKA, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that PNBs might be associated with superior perioperative population-level outcomes. In light of the inability to establish a causal relationship and the presence of residual confounding, we strongly advocate for further prospective investigation, ideally in multicenter, randomized trials, to establish the potential impact of PNBs on outcomes on a population level."

The results were analysed by comparing 52 patients admitted in the first decade (1991-2000; Group 1) with 58 patients admitted between 2001-2014 (Group 2). Patients in both groups were comparable with respect to age and sex, and had a similar incidence and range of ICU complications. They received a comparable range of immunomodulatory treatments including IVIG and PE. However, the delay from presentation to referral to the tertiary ICU was longer in patients in Group 2. They also required mechanical ventilation for a longer duration, and had longer ICU and hospital stays. In Group 2, there was a higher incidence of axonal neuropathy (51%, compared to 24% in Group 1). Despite the longer delay to referral, the prevalence of axonal neuropathy and the duration of ventilation, overall mortality showed a downward trend (Group 1: 13.5%; Group 2: 5.2%). There was no late mortality in either group after step-down to neuro-rehabilitation or following discharge home or to the referring hospital. The rehabilitation outcomes were similar.

CD010019,0,27900627,0,Extended-duration versus short-duration pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in acutely Ill hospitalized medical patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Extended-duration pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, for at least 28 days, is effective for the prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients but is of uncertain benefit in hospitalized medical patients. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients. We conducted a systematic PubMed, Medline and EMBASE literature search until June 2016 and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials which compared extended-duration with short-duration thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients. Four randomized controlled trials comparing extended-duration prophylaxis (24-47 days) with short-duration prophylaxis (6-14 days) in a total of 34,068 acutely ill hospitalized medical patients were included. When compared with short-duration prophylaxis, extended-duration prophylaxis was associated with a decrease in symptomatic proximal or distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [relative risk (RR) = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.35-0.77: p = 0.001; absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 0.32%, number needed to treat (NNT) = 313], and symptomatic non-fatal pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.61; 95% Cl 0.38-0.99: p = 0.04; ARR = 0.16%; NNT = 625), an increase in major bleeding (RR = 2.08; 95% Cl 1.50-2.90: p < 0.0001, absolute risk increase = 0.41%, number needed to harm = 244), and no significant reduction in VTE-related mortality (RR = 0.69; 95% Cl 0.45-1.06: p = 0.09) or all-cause mortality (RR = 1.00; 95% CI 0.89-1.12; p = 0.95). There was heterogeneity for major bleeding due to results from the APEX trial (no difference between betrixaban and enoxaparin). Compared with short-duration thromboprophylaxis, extended-duration treatment reduces the risk for symptomatic DVT and non-fatal pulmonary embolism. Extended treatment with apixaban, enoxaparin and rivaroxaban but not betrixaban increases the risk for major bleeding."
CD010019,0,27697071,0,An Evaluation of the Efficacy of Local Hemostatic Measures in Dental Patients Taking Oral Anticoagulants: A Critical Review of the Literature Over the Past Two Decades.,"The increased risk of bleeding observed in patients on oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) undergoing outpatient oral surgical procedures has been reported in the literature and remains a major concern in the care of these patients. This is still of great concern to dental surgeons that discontinuing OAT medication increases the risk of thromboembolism, while maintaining the therapeutic dose increases the risk of hemorrhage. Several local hemostatic measures have been used to control bleeding in patients on OAT. However, the effectiveness of these measures has not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of local hemostatic measures in patients taking oral anticoagulants. Various databases were searched using the key terms. Selection criteria included publications in English, Spanish, or Portuguese within the last 20 years. The titles and abstracts of papers were initially screened, and reports of 18 clinical trials were selected for a critical review and scored according to CONSORT 2010 guidelines. The data extracted from these trials represented 1821 patients receiving OAT, 4116 tooth extractions, and 144 cases of postoperative bleeding. In most studies, there were no differences in the effectiveness of various local hemostatic measures, and only tranexamic acid was proven effective as compared with a placebo group. The reported INR values varied widely among studies; the lowest INR value was 0.9 and the highest was 5.0. All local hemostatic methods showed low rates of bleeding; and when bleeding occurred, the use of these methods was essential for controlling postoperative bleeding. While local hemostatic measures appear to be effective in controlling postoperative bleeding, additional controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the true effectiveness of these measures in patients taking OAT."

This study compares the results of EG before and after implementation of a perioperative clinical care process including a health provider education program (EP) and institutional uncomplicated postoperative clinical pathway (POP) for purpose quality improvement. This is a single institution retrospective cohort study. The EP was provided to critical care and telemetry unit nurses and the POP was imbedded in the electronic health record. Patients undergoing elective EG with reconstruction with the stomach for benign disease or cancer were included from 2005 to 2011. Cohorts were pre- and postimplementation (PreI and PostI) of an EP and 8-day POP (August 2008). Patient, tumor and peri/postoperative-specific variables were compared between cohorts, as well as resource utilization and hospital costs. We identified 33 PreI and 41 PostI patients. Both cohorts had similar patient demographics, preoperative comorbidities, majority cancer diagnosis, and for cancer patients, majority adenocarcinoma and IIB/III pathologic stage. Both groups had one death and similar rate of discharge to home. The PostI cohort demonstrated reduced 30-day readmission rate (2.4% vs 24.2%); P < 0.05. In regard to clinical outcomes, the PostI group exhibited reduced deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary emboli (2.4% vs 18.2%); P < 0.05. The PostI group demonstrated significantly reduced radiographic test utilization and costs, as well as total overall 30-day readmission costs. A defined perioperative clinical process involving educating the patient care team and implementing a widely disseminated POP can reduce complications, 30-day readmission rates, and hospital costs after EG."

CD010019,0,29171502,0,[Memantine: from the original brand to generics].,"Memantine is the first clinically available glutamate antagonist, with an antagonist action at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the brain, for correction of cognitive and behavioral functions in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate mediated excitotoxic neuronal damage has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other parkinsonism-related dementias and, therefore, memantine represents a novel mode of action to counteract the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. In moderate to severe AD, 20 mg of memantine shows a positive effect on cognition, mood, behavior and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Long-term studies show good tolerability of memantine with an acceptable side-effect profile. In recent years, there have been a proliferation of a number of companies producing generic memantine with different trade names. In Russia, the first memantine generic drug noojerone was approved in 2010 and its use has since been supported by a growing evidence base of efficacy in real-life clinical practice. Postmarketing studies show that noojerone provides long-term and effective therapy in patients with moderate and severe Alzheimer's dementia. This observation is supported by the clinically significant therapeutic effect of noojerone on cognitive and daily functioning, behavioral and psychotic symptoms of dementia and a reduction of the burden on caregivers.

We present a case where an 83-year female patient, on Warfarin for Pulmonary Embolism, had worsening of coagulopathy after she was started on Oseltamivir. The INR was monitored daily in our patient and Warfarin was stopped when the INR became supra-therapeutic. Our patient did not have any minor or major bleeding complication. This is the first reported case of Oseltamivir related worsening coagulopathy in patient on Warfarin to the best of our knowledge. Keeping in mind the possible interaction between the two as it was evident in our case and few other published reports, we recommend monitoring the INR closely in patients using Warfarin after they are started on Oseltamivir therapy."

CD010019,0,27378481,0,Successful Use of Four Factor-Prothrombin Complex Concentrate for Congenital Factor X Deficiency in the Setting of Neurosurgery.,"Congenital factor X deficiency is an extremely rare coagulation disorder that can place patients at risk for spontaneous hemorrhage or excessive bleeding in the setting of trauma or invasive procedures. Given the rarity of this disorder, there is little published guidance on how best to prevent or treat bleeding. Herein, we report a case of a 56-year-old white man with congenital factor X deficiency who was scheduled for major neurosurgery and who was treated perioperatively with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC). Doses of 4F-PCC at 15 U per kg, administered immediately preoperatively and once at 24 hours postoperatively, allowed for successful completion of an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion without excessive bleeding. Moreover, no thromboembolic complications were observed. As such, given the wide availability of 4F-PCC, it may be considered as a first-line therapy and an alternative to fresh frozen plasma for factor X deficiencies, particularly in high-risk operative cases."
CD010019,0,28025931,0,A Review of Clinical Trial Endpoints of Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension and How They Relate to Patient Outcomes in the United States.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are subgroups of pulmonary hypertension and are considered rare diseases. Understanding how endpoints of clinical trials (and patient registry studies) of patients with PAH and CTEPH are associated with patient outcomes is important in order to address the concerns of patients, health care providers, decision makers, and payers. The purpose of this review was to examine how endpoints used in clinical trials and patient registry studies are associated with outcomes of patients with PAH and CTEPH. A PubMed literature search was conducted to retrieve published studies, including randomized phase III clinical trials and observational studies, from years 2000 to May 2015 that evaluated the associations between change in 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), 6MWD thresholds, change in World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC), and time to clinical worsening with outcomes of patients with PAH and CTEPH. Based on this review of published literature, a reduction in 6MWD as a criterion for PAH worsening, a deterioration in WHO-FC, and delay in the time to clinical worsening are clinically meaningful trial endpoints and are associated with outcomes of patients with PAH and CTEPH. Utilization and standardization of these endpoints will be useful for comparing interventions of clinical trials and therapies. Hospitalizations are frequent among patients with PAH and CTEPH, and total health care costs are high. From a U.S. payer perspective, clinical worsening is an important composite endpoint in that it includes hospitalization, which can be transformed into a preventative cost value associated with efficacious treatment of patients with PAH and CTEPH. In view of the greater number of medications available to treat PAH, the introduction of the first approved therapy to treat CTEPH, and the increasing use of combination pharmacotherapy, reliable prognostic markers of treatment responsiveness are important to help guide appropriate management. As new clinical trials and observational studies are conducted, it will be important to maintain universal endpoints so that health care providers, decision makers, and payers can better understand the value of targeted pharmacotherapies and combination therapies for the treatment of patients with PAH and CTEPH."

Efficacy outcomes of the treatment were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT). Safety outcomes were intraocular pressure and cornea endothelial cell density. The study was conducted by the prospective analysis on 36 patients (17 women and 19 men) aged 28-77 years (the average age was 58±15 years) treated with the injection of dexamethasone implant because of the persistent ME at the Department of Ophthalmology and Ophthalmology Outpatient Clinic of the University Centre of Ophthalmology and Oncology in Katowice. The studied group included 16 patients with central retinal vein occlusion (16 eyes), and 20 patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (20 eyes). We found a significant increase of BCVA after first, second, and third month of treatment. Six months after the treatment, BCVA decreased, although not significantly compared with the value obtained in the third month. Two months after the intravitreal implantation of dexamethasone delivery system, CRT was 338±163 μm and was significantly lower compared with pretreatment value. Between third and sixth month after the treatment, we found insignificant increase of CRT compared with thickness observed in second month. Two months after the treatment, we found an increase in intraocular pressure in 36% of cases and a further decrease during the final visit 6 months after the treatment. During the treatment, there were no significant differences in endothelial cell density in branch retinal vein occlusion and central retinal vein occlusion. We found the intravitreal dexamethasone implant to be safe, well tolerated, and likely to lead to fast morphological and functional improvement of the macula and visual rehabilitation in patients with ME due to retinal vein occlusion."

We examined the short-term operative outcomes in patients according to their body mass index following robotic-assisted Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy at a high-volume tertiary-care referral cancer center and evaluated the safety of robotic surgery in patients with an elevated body mass index. A retrospective review of all patients who underwent robotic-assisted Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy between April 2010 and June 2013 for pathologically confirmed distal esophageal cancer was conducted. Patient demographics, clinicopathologic data, and operative outcomes were collected. We stratified body mass index at admission for surgery according to World Health Organization criteria; normal range is defined as a body mass index range of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2. Overweight is defined as a body mass index range of 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 and obesity is defined as a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 and above. Statistics were calculated using Pearson's Chi-square and Pearson's correlation coefficient tests with a P-value of 0.05 or less for significance. One hundred and twenty-nine patients (103 men, 26 women) with median age of 67 (30-84) years were included. The majority of patients, 76% (N = 98) received neoadjuvant therapy. When stratified by body mass index, 28 (22%) were normal weight, 56 (43%) were overweight, and 45 (35%) were obese. All patients had R0 resection. Median operating room time was 407 (239-694) minutes. When stratified by body mass index, medians of operating room time across the normal weight, overweight and obese groups were 387 (254-660) minutes, 395 (310-645) minutes and 445 (239-694), respectively. Median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 150 (25-600) cc. When stratified by body mass index, medians of EBL across the normal weight, overweight and obese groups were 100 (50-500) cc, 150 (25-600) cc and 150 (25-600), respectively. Obesity significantly correlated with longer operating room time (P = 0.05) but without significant increased EBL (P = 0.348). Among the three body mass index groups there was no difference in postoperative complications including thrombotic events (pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis) (P = 0.266), pneumonia (P = 0.189), anastomotic leak (P = 0.090), wound infection (P = 0.390), any cardiac events (P = 0.793) or 30 days mortality (P = 0.414). Our data study demonstrates that patients with esophageal cancer and an elevated body mass index undergoing robotic-assisted Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy have increased operative times but no significantly increased EBL during the procedure. Other potential morbidities did not differ with the robotic approach."

We performed a retrospective review of all PICCs placed in the inpatient setting at our institution during a 1-year period from January 2013 to December 2013. These were divided into two groups: those placed at the bedside in the ICU and those placed by interventional radiology in non-ICU patients. Data regarding infectious and thrombotic complications were collected and evaluated. During the study period, 1209 PICC line placements met inclusion criteria and were evaluated; 1038 were placed by interventional radiology in non-ICU patients, and 171 were placed at the bedside in ICU patients. The combined thrombotic and central line associated blood stream infection rate was 6.17 per cent in the non-ICU group and 10.53 per cent in the ICU group (P = 0.035). The thrombotic complication rate was 5.88 per cent in the non-ICU group and 7.60 per cent in the ICU group (P = 0.38), whereas the central line associated blood stream infection rate was 0.29 per cent in the non-ICU group and 2.92 per cent in the ICU group (P = 0.002). This study seems to suggest that PICC lines placed at the bedside in the ICU setting are associated with higher complication rates, in particular infectious complications, than those placed by interventional radiology in non-ICU patients. The routine placement of PICC lines in the ICU settings needs to be reevaluated given these findings."

CD010019,0,29016692,0,Benefit of early discharge among patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism.,"Clinical guidelines recommend early discharge of patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism (LRPE). This study measured the overall impact of early discharge of LRPE patients on clinical outcomes and costs in the Veterans Health Administration population. Adult patients with ≥1 inpatient diagnosis for pulmonary embolism (PE) (index date) between 10/2011-06/2015, continuous enrollment for ≥12 months pre- and 3 months post-index date were included. PE risk stratification was performed using the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Stratification Index. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare 90-day adverse PE events (APEs) [recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleed and death], hospital-acquired complications (HACs), healthcare utilization, and costs among short (≤2 days) versus long length of stay (LOS). Net clinical benefit was defined as 1 minus the combined rate of APE and HAC. Among 6,746 PE patients, 95.4% were men, 22.0% were African American, and 1,918 had LRPE. Among LRPE patients, only 688 had a short LOS. After 1:1 PSM, there were no differences in APE, but short LOS had fewer HAC (1.5% vs 13.3%, 95% CI: 3.77-19.94) and bacterial pneumonias (5.9% vs 11.7%, 95% CI: 1.24-3.23), resulting in better net clinical benefit (86.9% vs 78.3%, 95% CI: 0.84-0.96). Among long LOS patients, HACs (52) exceeded APEs (14 recurrent DVT, 5 bleeds). Short LOS incurred lower inpatient ($2,164 vs $5,100, 95% CI: $646.8-$5225.0) and total costs ($9,056 vs $12,544, 95% CI: $636.6-$6337.7). LRPE patients with short LOS had better net clinical outcomes at lower costs than matched LRPE patients with long LOS."

CD010019,0,26846295,0,Effect of various pneumoperitoneum pressures on femoral vein hemodynamics during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"High intra-abdominal pressure and reverse Trendelenburg position during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) are risk factors for venous stasis in lower extremity. Lower limb venous stasis is one of the major pathophysiological elements involved in the development of peri-operative deep vein thrombosis. Low pressure pneumoperitoneum (7-10 mmHg) has been recommended in patients with limited cardiac, pulmonary or renal reserve. The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of various pneumoperitoneum pressures on femoral vein (FV) hemodynamics during LC. A total of 50 patients undergoing elective LC were enrolled and they were prospectively randomized into two groups containing 25 patients each. In group A high pressure pneumoperitoneum (14 mmHg) and in group B low pressure pneumoperitoneum (8 mmHg) was maintained. Comparison of pre-operative and post-operative coagulation profile was done. Preoperative and intraoperative change in femoral vein diameter (FVD) (AP and LAT), cross-sectional area (CSA) and peak systolic flow (PSF) during varying pneumoperitoneum pressure was recorded in FV by ultrasound Doppler. First measurement (pre-operative) was carried out just after the induction of anesthesia before creation of pneumoperitoneum and second measurement (intra-operative) was taken just before completion of surgery with pneumoperitoneum maintained. Changes in coagulation parameters were less significant at low pressure pneumoperitoneum. There was statistical significant difference in the pre-operative and intra-operative values of FVD, CSA and PSF in both groups when analyzed independently (P = 0.00). There was no significant difference in pre-operative values of FVD, CSA and PSF (P > 0.05) among two groups but when the comparison was made between the intra-operative values, there was significant increase in FVD (AP) (P = 0.016), CSA (P = 0.00) and decrease in PSF (P = 0.00) at high pressure pneumoperitoneum. This study provides evidence of using low pressure pneumoperitoneum during LC as changes in FV hemodynamics and coagulation parameters were less pronounced at low pressure pneumoperitoneum."

This study aims to evaluate the real world prescribing practices of all oral anticoagulants for VTE at a single center. A retrospective cohort analysis of all adult patients diagnosed with acute onset VTE was conducted. Of the 105 patients included in the analysis, 45 (43 %) patients received warfarin and 60 (57 %) patients received a DOAC. Rivaroxaban and apixaban were the most common DOACs initiated. There were significantly more patients in the warfarin group with an eCrCl of <60 ml/min compared to patients who received a DOAC (77.8 % vs. 15 %; P < 0.05). There were significantly less patients in the warfarin group with serum aminotranferase concentrations three times the upper limit of normal compared to those who received a DOAC (15.6 % vs. 55 %; P < 0.05). Patients who received a DOAC had less days on parenteral anticoagulation compared to patients who received warfarin (median 2.5 days [IQR 0-4] vs. 6 days [IQR 5-7], p < 0.05). Patients who received a DOAC had a shorter hospital length of stay compared to patients who received warfarin (median 3 days [IQR 2-4] vs. 8 days [IQR 6-10], p < 0.05). This analysis showed that DOACs are being prescribed more than warfarin for treatment of new onset VTE. Renal and liver function may influence the agent prescribed.

CD010019,0,26951166,0,Intravenous heparin dosing strategy in hospitalized patients with atrial dysrhythmias.,"Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) have an elevated stroke risk that is 2-7 times greater than in those without AF. Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is commonly used for hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (AFL) to prevent stroke. Dosing strategies exist for intravenous anticoagulation in patients with acute coronary syndromes and venous thromboembolic diseases, but there are no data to guide providers on a dosing strategy for intravenous anticoagulation in patients with AF/AFL. 996 hospitalized patients with AF/AFL on UFH were evaluated. Bolus dosing and initial infusion rates of UFH were recorded along with rates of stroke, thromboemobolic events, and bleeding events as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Among 226 patients included in the analysis, 76 bleeding events occurred. Using linear regression analysis, initial rates of heparin infusion ranging from 9.7 to 11.8 units/kilogram/hour (U/kg/h) resulted in activated partial thromboplastin times that were within therapeutic range. The median initial infusion rate in patients with bleeding was 13.3 U/kg/h, while in those without bleeding it was 11.4 U/kg/h; p = 0.012. An initial infusion rate >11.0 U/kg/h yielded an OR 1.95 (1.06-3.59); p = 0.03 for any bleeding event. Using IV heparin boluses neither increased the probability of attaining a therapeutic aPTT (56.1 vs 56.3 %; p = 0.99) nor did it significantly increase bleeding events in the study (35.7 vs 31.3 %; p = 0.48). The results suggest that higher initial rates of heparin are associated with increased bleeding risk. From this dataset, initial heparin infusion rates of 9.7-11.0 U/kg/h without a bolus can result in therapeutic levels of anticoagulation in hospitalized patients with AF/AFL without increasing the risk of bleeding."
CD010019,0,27038805,0,Nuances in the Management of Older People With Multiple Myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma is a disease of the elderly, with about a third of patients at diagnosis older than 75 years of age. Yet, the population of elderly patients is heterogeneous: older patients are more likely to have comorbidities and frailties complicating both their initial diagnosis and subsequent management, but these are not consistent across the group. Furthermore, patients with comorbidities and frailty are generally underrepresented in clinical trials. Despite the survival of myeloma patients increasing following the introduction of novel agents, older patients continue to have worse outcomes with increased treatment-related toxicity. Treatment tolerability is not defined by age alone, rather a combination of age, physical function, cognitive function, and comorbidities. These factors all influence patients' tolerability of treatment and therefore treatment efficacy and should also be considered when reviewing the results of clinical trials. It is the nuances of determining how these factors interact that should influence initial treatment and ongoing management decisions and these will be discussed here."

Periorbital oedema (PO) and periorbital ecchymose (PE) are normal occurrences, but are undesirable for patients undergoing the procedure for aesthetic purposes. The present study examined 65 patients who underwent open technique septorhinoplasty for aesthetic and functional complaints. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 patients underwent lateral osteotomy following tip plasty, at the end of the surgical operation; Group 2 patients underwent lateral osteotomy before tip plasty, at the beginning of the surgical operation. Patients were followed on the postoperative first, third and seventh days. PO and PE values of patients were scored from 0 to 4. The plastering time (Pt) was significantly shorter for Group I than Group II (p < 0.05). The total surgical time (T) showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). The PO value at the first, third and seventh days was significantly smaller for Group I than Group II (p < 0.05). The PE value at the first, third and seventh days was also significantly smaller for Group I than Group II (p < 0.05).

CD010019,0,26501990,0,Role of Antiplatelet Therapy and Anticoagulation in Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy.,"Heart failure continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the United States. The pathophysiology of heart failure involves the activation of complex neurohormonal pathways, many of which mediate not only hypertrophy and fibrosis within ventricular myocardium and interstitium, but also activation of platelets and alteration of vascular endothelium. Platelet activation and vascular endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the observed increased risk of thromboembolic events in patients with chronic heart failure. However, current data from clinical trials do not support the routine use of chronic antiplatelet or oral anticoagulation therapy for ambulatory heart failure patients without other indications (atrial fibrillation and/or coronary artery disease) as the risk of bleeding seems to outweigh the potential benefit related to reduction in thromboembolic events. In this review, we consider the potential clinical utility of targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms of platelet and vascular endothelial activation to guide clinical decision making in heart failure patients."

CD010019,0,27206420,0,Effects of heparin bridging anticoagulation on perioperative bleeding and thromboembolic risks in patients undergoing abdominal malignancy surgery.,"Recent publications provided controversial results indicating that perioperative heparin bridging anticoagulation (HBA) increased the bleeding risk without decreasing the thromboembolic risk in patients undergoing minor surgery. To investigate if this is also the case in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal malignancy surgery, we retrospectively collected data of 3268 patients over a 10-year period. After the interruption of preoperative antithrombotic agents, HBA was initiated with a prophylactic-dose of unfractionated heparin in 133 patients (HBA group), and 62 patients did not receive HBA (non-HBA group). The incidence of exogenous blood transfusion (EBT) and thromboembolic events (TEEs) within 30 days after surgery were compared between the HBA and non-HBA groups. The results showed that the incidence of EBT and TEEs was similar between the two groups (23.3 vs 19.4 %; P = 0.535) and (4.1 vs 3.2 %; P = 0.821), respectively. The amount of intraoperative bleeding and the length of postoperative hospital stay were also similar [median (quantile 1-3); 192 (71-498) vs 228 ml (100-685); P = 0.422] and [12 (9-19) vs 14.5 days (10-21); P = 0.052], respectively.

Presently, there is no level one evidence that other TACE techniques are superior to Lipiodol TACE for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which includes patients with preserved liver function and nonsurgical large or multinodular HCC without distant metastases. In addition, TACE is part of the treatment for progressive or symptomatic liver metastases from gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. When injected into the hepatic artery, Lipiodol has the unique property of selective uptake and retention in hyperarterialyzed liver tumors. Lipiodol/drug emulsion followed by particle embolization has been demonstrated to improve the pharmacokinetic of the drug and tumor response. Radio opacity of Lipiodol helps to monitor treatment delivery, with retention of Lipiodol serving as an imaging biomarker for tumor response. For 30 years, Lipiodol TACE has been inconsistently referenced in many publications with various levels of details for the method of preparation and administration, with reported progressive outcomes following improvements in the technique and the devices used to deliver the treatment and better patient selection. Consequently, there is no consensus on the standard method of TACE regarding the use of anticancer agents, embolic material, technical details, and the treatment schedule.

The objective of the study was to determine whether the association between underuse of OAC and APT prescription was explained by the presence of an atheromatous disease.
CD010019,0,27696720,0,Association of prenatal lipid-based nutritional supplementation with fetal growth in rural Gambia.,"Prenatal supplementation with protein-energy (PE) and/or multiple-micronutrients (MMNs) may improve fetal growth, but trials of lipid-based nutritional supplements (LNSs) have reported inconsistent results. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of non-primary outcomes in a trial in Gambia, with the aim to test the associations of LNS with fetal growth and explore how efficacy varies depending on nutritional status. The sample comprised 620 pregnant women in an individually randomized, partially blinded trial with four arms: (a) iron and folic acid (FeFol) tablet (usual care, referent group), (b) MMN tablet, (c) PE LNS, and (d) PE + MMN LNS. Analysis of variance examined unadjusted differences in fetal biometry z-scores at 20 and 30 weeks and neonatal anthropometry z-scores, while regression tested for modification of intervention-outcome associations by season and maternal height, body mass index, and weight gain. Despite evidence of between-arm differences in some fetal biometry, z-scores at birth were not greater in the intervention arms than the FeFol arm (e.g., birth weight z-scores: FeFol -0.71, MMN -0.63, PE -0.64, PE + MMN -0.62; group-wise p = .796). In regression analyses, intervention associations with birth weight and head circumference were modified by maternal weight gain between booking and 30 weeks gestation (e.g., PE + MMN associations with birth weight were +0.462 z-scores (95% CI [0.097, 0.826]) in the highest quartile of weight gain but -0.099 z-scores (-0.459, 0.260) in the lowest). In conclusion, we found no strong evidence that a prenatal LNS intervention was associated with better fetal growth in the whole sample."

Evidence-based guidelines recommend that anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis be given to hospitalised medical patients at risk of VTE, but suggest against routine use of thromboprophylaxis beyond the hospital stay. The MARINER study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis using rivaroxaban, begun at hospital discharge and continued for 45 days, for preventing symptomatic VTE in high-risk medical patients. Eligible patients are identified using the International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism (IMPROVE VTE) risk score, combined with a laboratory test, D-dimer. The rivaroxaban regimen is 10 mg once daily for patients with CrCl ≥ 50 ml/min, or 7.5 mg once daily for patients with CrCl ≥ 30 ml/min and < 50 ml/min. The primary efficacy outcome is the composite of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity deep-vein thrombosis and non-fatal pulmonary embolism) and VTE-related death. The principal safety outcome is major bleeding. A blinded clinical events committee adjudicates all suspected outcome events. The sample size is event-driven with an estimated total of 8,000 patients to acquire 161 primary outcome events. Study design features that distinguish MARINER from previous and ongoing thromboprophylaxis trials in medically ill patients are: (i) use of a validated risk assessment model (IMPROVE VTE) and D-dimer determination for identifying eligible patients at high risk of VTE, (ii) randomisation at the time of hospital discharge, (iii) a 45-day treatment period and (iv) restriction of the primary efficacy outcome to symptomatic VTE events."

CD010019,0,27885960,0,High-dose tranexamic acid reduces intraoperative and postoperative blood loss in posterior lumbar interbody fusion.,"OBJECTIVE Tranexamic acid (TXA), a synthetic antifibrinolytic drug, has been reported to reduce blood loss in orthopedic surgery, but there have been few reports of its use in spine surgery. Previous studies included limitations in terms of different TXA dose regimens, different levels and numbers of fused segments, and different surgical techniques. Therefore, the authors decided to strictly limit TXA dose regimens, surgical techniques, and fused segments in this study. There have been no reports of using TXA for prevention of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss in posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose TXA in reducing blood loss and its safety during single-level PLIF. METHODS The study was a nonrandomized, case-controlled trial. Sixty consecutive patients underwent single-level PLIF at a single institution. The first 30 patients did not receive TXA. The next 30 patients received 2000 mg of intravenous TXA 15 minutes before the skin incision was performed and received the same dose again 16 hours after the surgery. Intra- and postoperative blood loss was compared between the groups. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in preoperative parameters of age, sex, body mass index, preoperative diagnosis, or operating time. The TXA group experienced significantly less intraoperative blood loss (mean 253 ml) compared with the control group (mean 415 ml; p < 0.01). The TXA group also had significantly less postoperative blood loss over 40 hours (mean 321 ml) compared with the control group (mean 668 ml; p < 0.01). Total blood loss in the TXA group (mean 574 ml) was significantly lower than in the control group (mean 1080 ml; p < 0.01). From 2 hours to 40 hours, postoperative blood loss in the TXA group was consistently significantly lower. There were no perioperative complications, including thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS High-dose TXA significantly reduced both intra- and postoperative blood loss without causing any complications during or after single-level PLIF."

Our study consisted of 236 aged diabetics with femoral neck fractures, which were divided into the rivaroxaban and control groups. Reaction time (R time), clot formation time (K time), α angle (α), maximum amplitude (MA), clot elasticity (G) and coagulation index (CI), prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were measured. DVT was diagnosed by color duplex Doppler ultrasound (CDDU). The risk factors of DVT were analysed by logistic regression analysis. Compared with the control group, in the rivaroxaban group, R time and K time were extended and α, MA and G decreased 1 day before operation. One day after operation, the rivaroxaban group had less PT and APPT and lower incidence of DVT than the control group. In the two groups, preoperative and postoperative PT and APPT significantly differed. Body mass index (BMI) ≥25, abnormal coagulation indicators, use of cemented femoral hip prosthesis, high haemoglobin content and non-ankle pump exercise after operation were the risk factors for DVT. Rivaroxaban could prevent DVT in aged diabetics with femoral neck fractures after hip replacement."

This study aimed to determine the impact of HF on clinical outcomes in patients with AF. We analyzed data from Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation, a national registry of 10,135 patients with AF to determine associations between HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and outcomes, including stroke, mortality, and hospitalization using Cox multivariable modeling. Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (AFEQT) scores between groups were also compared. Overall, 33% (n = 3,203) of patients had HF; of these 33% (n = 985) had LVEF ≤40%. Oral anticoagulation was prescribed more commonly in patients with HF (81% vs 74%). Compared with patients without HF, those with HF had similar rate of stroke (1.28 vs 0.88 per 100-patient years, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.48, p = 0.47) but higher mortality (HR 1.69, CI 1.49 to 1.92, p <0.001) and hospitalization (HR 1.31, CI 1.23 to 1.39, p <0.0001). Patients with LVEF ≤40% had similar stroke risk (HR 1.06, CI 0.67 to 1.67) but higher mortality (HR 2.06, CI 1.74 to 2.44) and hospitalization (HR 1.38, CI 1.25 to 1.51). AFEQT overall score was significantly lower (76.9 vs 83.3, p <0.0001) in patients with HF. In conclusion, HF was associated with increased risk of death and hospitalization and worse quality of life, but similar rates of thromboembolism regardless of LVEF among patients with AF. These findings highlight the need to develop therapeutic strategies targeting functional status and survival for patients with HF and AF."

The patients with an age < 60 years were randomly assigned to three groups (rivaroxaban, enoxaparin, and placebo) and the patients with an age ≥ 60 years were assigned to two groups (rivaroxaban and enoxaparin). All drug regimens started at 12 hours postoperatively and continued for two weeks after surgery. Primary measure outcome was major surgical wound complications defined as haematoma requiring any intervention, superficial wound infection, deep periprosthetic infection, and increased wound bleeding. Secondary measured outcome included minor surgical complications (swelling, drainage, erythema, and oozing), organ bleeding, and venous thromboembolic (VTE) events. A total of 184 patients aged < 60 years and 167 patients aged ≥ 60 years were included as the analysis population per group. Up to 14 days after surgery, the overall incidence of major surgical complications associated with thromboprophylaxis was 6.5 % (58/886).

CD010019,0,28079428,0,The first 6 weeks of recovery after primary total hip arthroplasty with fast track.,"Background and purpose - Fast-track protocols have been introduced worldwide to improve the recovery after total hip arthroplasty (THA). These protocols have reduced the length of hospital stay (LOS), and THA in an outpatient setting is also feasible. However, less is known regarding the first weeks after THA with fast track. We examined patients' experiences of the first 6 weeks after hospital discharge following inpatient and outpatient THA with fast track. Patients and methods - In a prospective cohort study, 100 consecutive patients who underwent THA surgery in a fast-track setting between February 2015 and October 2015 received a diary for 6 weeks. This diary contained various internationally validated questionnaires including HOOS-PS, OHS, EQ-5D, SF-12, and ICOAP. In addition, there were general questions regarding pain, the wound, physiotherapy, and thrombosis prophylaxis injections. Results - 94 patients completed the diary, 42 of whom were operated in an outpatient setting. Pain and use of pain medication had gradually decreased during the 6 weeks. Function and quality of life gradually improved. After 6 weeks, 91% of all patients reported better functioning and less pain than preoperatively. Interpretation - Fast track improves early functional outcome, and the PROMs reported during the first 6 weeks in this study showed continued improvement. They can be used as a baseline for future studies. The PROMs reported could also serve as a guide for staff and patients alike to modify expectations and therefore possibly improve patient satisfaction."

CD010019,0,28574333,0,Depression as an independent predictor of postoperative delirium in spine deformity patients undergoing elective spine surgery.,"OBJECTIVE Depression is the most prevalent affective disorder in the US, and patients with spinal deformity are at increased risk. Postoperative delirium has been associated with inferior surgical outcomes, including morbidity and mortality. The relationship between depression and postoperative delirium in patients undergoing spine surgery is relatively unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if depression is an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing decompression and fusion for deformity. METHODS The medical records of 923 adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) undergoing elective spine surgery at a single major academic institution from 2005 through 2015 were reviewed. Of these patients, 255 (27.6%) patients had been diagnosed with depression by a board-certified psychiatrist and constituted the Depression group; the remaining 668 patients constituted the No-Depression group. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and intra- and postoperative complication rates were collected for each patient and compared between groups. The primary outcome investigated in this study was rate of postoperative delirium, according to DSM-V criteria, during initial hospital stay after surgery. The association between depression and postoperative delirium rate was assessed via multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Patient demographics and comorbidities other than depression were similar in the 2 groups. In the Depression group, 85.1% of the patients were taking an antidepressant prior to surgery. There were no significant between-group differences in intraoperative variables and rates of complications other than delirium. Postoperative complication rates were also similar between the cohorts, including rates of urinary tract infection, fever, deep and superficial surgical site infection, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, urinary retention, and proportion of patients transferred to the intensive care unit. In total, 66 patients (7.15%) had an episode of postoperative delirium, with depressed patients experiencing approximately a 2-fold higher rate of delirium (10.59% vs 5.84%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, depression was an independent predictor of postoperative delirium after spine surgery in spinal deformity patients (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that depression is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium after elective spine surgery. Further studies are necessary to understand the effects of affective disorders on postoperative delirium, in hopes to better identify patients at risk."

CD010019,0,27229333,0,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: reducing misdiagnosis via collaboration between an inpatient anticoagulation pharmacy service and hospital reference laboratory.,"Misdiagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is common and exposes patients to high-risk therapies and potentially serious adverse events. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of collaboration between an inpatient pharmacy-driven anticoagulation management service (AMS) and hospital reference laboratory to reduce inappropriate HIT antibody testing via pharmacist intervention and use of the 4T pre-test probability score. Secondary objectives included clinical outcomes and cost-savings realized through reduced laboratory testing and decreased unnecessary treatment of HIT. This was a single center, pre-post, observational study. The hospital reference laboratory contacted the AMS when they received a blood sample for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent HIT antibody (HIT Ab). Trained pharmacists prospectively scored each HIT Ab ordered by using the 4T score with subsequent communication to physicians recommending for or against processing and reporting of lab results. Utilizing retrospective chart review and a database for all patients with a HIT Ab ordered during the study period, we compared the incidence of HIT Ab testing before and after implementation of the pharmacy-driven 4T score intervention. Our intervention significantly reduced the number of inappropriate HIT Ab tests processed (176 vs. 63, p < 0.0001), with no increase in thrombotic or hemorrhagic events. Overall incidence of suspected and confirmed HIT was <3 and <0.005 %, respectively. Overall cost savings were $75,754 (US) or 62 % per patient exposed to heparin between the pre and post intervention groups. Collaboration between inpatient pharmacy AMS and hospital reference laboratories can result in reduction of misdiagnosis of HIT and significant cost savings with similar safety."

CD010019,0,27477728,0,[Roles of Cardiology Pharmacists].,"Inpatients with heart failure take a number of high-risk drugs such as anti-thrombotic and anti-arrhythmic drugs, in addition to other drug types, including diuretics and cardioprotective agents. Pharmacists should support the pharmacological management of these patients by evaluating their clinical condition and laboratory data, due to the frequency of renal failure. Furthermore, it is known that poor adherence to a drug regimen is one of the aggravating factors for heart failure. It is necessary to conduct regular patient education to facilitate early hospital discharge and to prevent the recurrence of heart failure. In Chiba University Hospital, a single pharmacist is in charge of both the cardiac care unit (CCU) and the cardiovascular ward. In the course of a patient's hospital stay, from admission to discharge, the pharmacist performs various duties such as evaluating and proposing a medication plan after checking the patient's regular medications, conducting patient education, promoting appropriate prescriptions, overseeing the preparation of injection drugs, and providing drug information to medical staff. There are many cases in which avoidance of drug interactions or overdose, in order to prevent renal failure, is needed.

CD010019,0,28385315,0,Use of Antiplatelet Therapy/DAPT for Post-PCI Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery.,"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is prescribed to millions of patients worldwide following coronary stenting. DAPT is indicated to lower the risk of ischemic events, such as myocardial infarction, including stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. A significant number of these patients undergo noncardiac surgery and may require DAPT interruption. This poses a significant clinical dilemma because DAPT interruption exposes patients to the potential risk of stent thrombosis, perioperative myocardial infarction, or both. Conversely, continuing DAPT may be associated with excess bleeding complications. Observational data in this area are conflicting, and there are no randomized clinical trials to guide practitioner decision making. On the basis of predominantly consensus recommendations, various strategies for managing DAPT during the perioperative period have been proposed. This review presents 3 commonly encountered clinical scenarios that lead into an evidence-based discussion of practical strategies for managing perioperative antiplatelet therapy in patients following percutaneous coronary intervention."
CD010019,0,27530880,0,Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus after ovarian hyperstimulation.,"A healthy female presented with upper extremity (UE) swelling of several days duration. Admission laboratories were normal except for an elevated D-dimer. An UE ultrasound with Doppler revealed a thrombus in the right subclavian vein. A subsequent chest CT angiogram further characterised the subclavian vein thrombus and also identified a pulmonary embolus. A thorough history and laboratory evaluation showed that her only risk factors were long-time contraceptive pills and a recent cycle of ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) 7 weeks prior to presentation. Anticoagulation treatment was started and the patient's remaining outpatient work-up was negative for all other hereditary causes. A complete anatomic work-up showed bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). A review of the literature on the occurrence of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis suggests that these usually occur in the presence of a predisposing factor, including catheters, indwelling devices and active malignancies. OH has been shown to precipitate venous thromboembolism events; however, the diagnosis of bilateral TOS as a predisposing risk factor has not been described in a patient who had recently undergone recent OH and in one who was not actively pregnant."
CD010019,0,27568795,0,A Bridge to Nowhere? Benefits and Risks for Periprocedural Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation.,"In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), oral anticoagulation is used to prevent stroke and systemic embolism. In a common clinical scenario, AF patients frequently undergo invasive procedures requiring temporary interruption of oral anticoagulation, thereby potentially exposing such patients to increased risk of thromboembolism. Bridging anticoagulation has been used clinically to mitigate this perceived thromboembolic risk, though this practice may also increase risk of periprocedural bleeding. High-quality data has not previously existed to inform decision-making in this clinical situation of bridging anticoagulation. We discuss recent results from the BRIDGE trial and secondary analyses from recent phase 3 randomized clinical trials of direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use in non-valvular AF, that inform periprocedural anticoagulation with bridging strategies in AF patients. Updated data from these current trials favor against a strategy of bridging anticoagulation for elective procedures in the majority of AF patients, low or moderate in thromboembolic risk. Bridging anticoagulation is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and no decreased risk of thromboembolism."

CD010019,0,26923163,0,Can physical exercise have a protective effect in an animal model of sleep-related movement disorder?,"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether physical exercise (PE) has a protective effect in an experimental animal model of sleep-related movement disorder (A11 dopaminergic nuclei lesions with 6-OHDA). Rats were divided into four groups (Control PE-CTRL/PE, SHAM/PE, A11 lesion/NPE, A11 lesion/PE). Two experiments were performed: (1) the rats underwent PE before (2 weeks) and after (4 weeks) the A11 lesion; and (2) the rats underwent PE only after (4 weeks) the A11 lesion. Electrode insertion surgery was performed and sleep analyses were conducted over a period of 24h (baseline and after PE) and analyzed in 6 blocks of 4h. The results demonstrated that the A11 lesion produced an increased percentage of wakefulness in the final block of the dark period (3-7am) and a significant enhancement of the number of limb movements (LM) throughout the day. Four weeks of PE was important for reducing the number of LMs in the A11 lesion group in the rats that performed PE before and after the A11 lesion. However, in the analysis of the protective effect of PE on LM, the results showed that the number of LMs was lower at baseline in the group that had performed 2 weeks of PE prior to the A11 lesion than in the group that had not previously performed PE. In conclusion, these findings consistently demonstrate that non-pharmacological manipulations had a beneficial effect on the symptoms of sleep-related movement disorder."
CD010019,0,27419141,0,Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy in Patients with Large Uteri: Comparison of Uterine Removal by Transvaginal and Uterine Morcellation Approaches.,"The aim of this study was to compare the clinical results of total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) for large uterus with uterus size of 12 gestational weeks (g.w.) or greater through transvaginal or uterine morcellation approaches. We retrospectively collected the clinical data of those undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomies between January 2004 and June 2012. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared between patients whose large uterus was removed through transvaginal or morcellation approaches. The morcellation group has significantly shorter mean operation time and uterus removal time and smaller incidence of intraoperative complications than the transvaginal group (all P < 0.05). No statistical significant difference regarding the mean blood loss, uterine weight, and length of hospital stay was noted in the morcellation and transvaginal groups (all P > 0.05). In two groups, there was one patient in each group who underwent conversion to laparotomy due to huge uterus size. With regard to postoperative complications, there was no statistical significant difference regarding the frequencies of pelvic hematoma, vaginal stump infection, and lower limb venous thrombosis in two groups (all P > 0.05). TLH through uterine morcellation can reduce the operation time, uterus removal time, and the intraoperative complications and provide comparable postoperative outcomes compared to that through the transvaginal approaches."
CD010019,0,27581678,0,Current Practices in the Management of Antithrombotic Therapy During the Periendoscopic Period for Patients With Cardiovascular Disease.,"The management of antithrombotics during the periendoscopic period is traditionally represented as a doubleedged sword for cardiologists and endoscopists. Appropriate administration prevents thromboembolic events, whereas excessive administration provokes bleeding events. Therefore, cardiologists and endoscopists must consider the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism in individual cases, before deciding whether to continue antithrombotic use. Several guidelines exist concerning antithrombotic management in Asian and Western countries. These guidelines generally classify procedural bleeding risk and thromboembolic risk into high risk and low risk groups and recommend that the two risks be weighed when managing a given patient. Moreover, they generally do not recommend interrupting antithrombotics during the periendoscopic period unless absolutely necessary; however, the details surrounding this point differ among the guidelines after several revisions. In this review, we describe the present state, problems, and future perspectives concerning the management of antithrombotics in patients with cardiovascular disease undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy."

Our study analysed the possible relationship between the pre-operative middle cerebral artery Gosling Index, calculated after transcranial Doppler (TCD), and intra-operative stump pressure (SP), in order to identify patients with higher risk of ischemic accidents. Moreover, we studied pre- and post- operative Gosling Index values in association with possible events during follow-up. In a one-year time lapse 47 patients underwent either carotid endoarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) with proximal embolic protection system. All patients were subject to pre- and post-operative TCD with calculation of the Gosling Index and intra-operative SP. We observed that higher pre-operative Gosling Index values are associated with lower intra-operative SP values, elements that represent a higher risk for cerebro-vascular ischemic accidents; this result is particularly evident when observing the diabetic sub-population. An increase in ischemic events did not present statistically significant differences when observing the populations treated with CEA or CAS. TCD and SP are valid and simple exams that can help identify precociously patients with a higher risk of cerebro-vascular accidents related to surgical or endovascular treatment."

Type II diabetes is also on the rise with out-of-control numbers. To address these pandemics, we need to treat patients using an individualized patient care approach, but simultaneously gather data to support the precision medicine initiative. Last year the NIH announced the precision medicine initiative to generate novel knowledge regarding diseases, with a near-term focus on cancers, followed by a longer-term aim, applicable to a whole range of health applications and diseases. The focus of this paper is to suggest a combined effort between the latest precision medicine initiative, researchers and clinicians; whereby novel techniques could immediately make a difference in patient care, but long-term add to knowledge for use in precision medicine. We discuss the intricate relationship between individualized patient care and precision medicine and the current thoughts regarding which data is actually suitable for the precision medicine data gathering. The uses of viscoelastic techniques in precision medicine are discussed and how these techniques might give novel perspectives on the success of treatment regimes of cardiovascular patients are explored. Thrombo-embolic stroke, rheumathoid arthritis and type II diabetes are used as examples of diseases where precision medicine and a patient-orientated approach can possibly be implemented. In conclusion it is suggested that if all role players work together by embracing a new way of thought in treating and managing cardiovascular disease and diabetes will we be able to adequately address these out-ofcontrol conditions."

Clinical outcomes compared Veterans who had a warfarin dose reduction and those who did not within 120 h (5 days) of antibiotic initiation. The primary outcome compared the pre-and post-antibiotic International Normalized Ratio (INR) of patients in the intervention group (warfarin dose reduction) with those in the control group (no intervention). Secondary outcomes assessed incidence of thromboembolic and major bleeding events within 30 days of antibiotic completion. Fifty patients were assessed. Forty-nine patients had at least one follow-up appointment; 126 follow-up visits were evaluated. There was a statistically significant difference for the change in therapeutic INR at the first follow-up appointment (p = 0.029) for those patients in the control group. On average, the patients in the intervention group required fewer follow-up visits (p = 0.019). There were no statistically significant differences for the overall rate of therapeutic INR values between groups, as well as no instances of a thromboembolic or major bleeding events during the follow-up period. Clinically significant differences were observed for patients who received a preemptive warfarin dose reduction upon initiation of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim or metronidazole.

CD010019,0,26988871,0,Periprocedural management of patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant requiring an elective procedure or surgery.,"The periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs), including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), is a common clinical problem. The optimal perioperative management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy is anchored on four key principles: (i) risk stratification of patient-related and procedure-related risks of thrombosis and bleeding; (ii) the clinical consequences of a thrombotic or bleeding event; (iii) discontinuation and reinitiation of OAC therapy on the basis of the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent; and (iv) whether aggressive management such as the use of periprocedural heparin bridging has advantages for the prevention of postoperative thromboembolism at the cost of a possible increase in bleeding risk. Recent data from randomized trials in patients receiving VKAs undergoing pacemaker/defibrillator implantation or using heparin bridging therapy for elective procedures or surgeries can now inform best practice. There are also emerging data on periprocedural outcomes in the DOAC trials for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes the evidence for the periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy, focusing on recent randomized trials and large outcome studies, to address three key clinical scenarios: (i) can OAC therapy be safely continued for minor procedures or surgeries; (ii) if therapy with VKAs (especially warfarin) needs to be temporarily interrupted for an elective procedure/surgery, is heparin bridging necessary; and (iii) what is the optimal periprocedural management of the DOACs? In answering these questions, we aim to provide updated clinical guidance for the periprocedural management of patients receiving VKA or DOAC therapy, including the use of heparin bridging."

In Japan, three factor Xa inhibitors are used for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE): edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Despite problems, such as the inability to monitor their effect and the lack of an antidote, these inhibitors have the same efficacy as conventional treatment with warfarin, and they are associated with a significantly high degree of safety in relation to hemorrhagic complications. East Asians, including Japanese, suffer from hemorrhage more frequently; therefore, DOACs are considered to be highly effective. Although there is no evidence to date, DOACs may be effective in a wide variety of ways, including the possibility that they prevent recurrence over the long term, reduce the length of hospitalization, allow treatment to be started on an outpatient basis, and be effective in cancer patients."

CD010019,0,27657798,0,Effectiveness of PTSD telehealth treatment in a VA clinical sample.,"Over the past decade, the Veterans Health Administration has supported multiple national rollouts of evidence-based treatments for mental health disorders. Recent studies have shown, however, that the majority of veterans with mental health diagnoses are not utilizing psychotherapy services. In this article, we attempt to address one of the more commonly known barriers to treatment, distance to care. We do this by comparing the effectiveness of outpatient and telehealth cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) Therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a Veteran clinical sample. Multilevel modeling analyses revealed statistically significant differences between the outpatient and telehealth treatments once baseline demographic and symptom severity differences were taken into account. Given that a number of randomized control studies have not found similar outcome differences, future research would benefit from examining whether the outcomes differences in the present study are because of treatment delivery method or sample differences. Veterans completing treatment via outpatient and telehealth delivery methods achieved clinically significant change in PTSD from pre- to posttreatment. These results suggest that delivering evidence-based treatment for PTSD via telehealth may be a viable treatment option for veterans who cannot easily access care because of geographic distance.

CD010019,0,27175028,0,Antiplatelet therapy versus observation in low-risk essential thrombocythemia with a CALR mutation.,"The role of antiplatelet therapy as primary prophylaxis of thrombosis in low-risk essential thrombocythemia has not been studied in randomized clinical trials. We assessed the benefit/risk of low-dose aspirin in 433 patients with low-risk essential thrombocythemia (271 with a CALR mutation, 162 with a JAK2(V617F) mutation) who were on antiplatelet therapy or observation only. After a follow up of 2215 person-years free from cytoreduction, 25 thrombotic and 17 bleeding episodes were recorded. In CALR-mutated patients, antiplatelet therapy did not affect the risk of thrombosis but was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding (12.9 versus 1.8 episodes per 1000 patient-years, P=0.03). In JAK2(V617F)-mutated patients, low-dose aspirin was associated with a reduced incidence of venous thrombosis with no effect on the risk of bleeding. Coexistence of JAK2(V617F)-mutation and cardiovascular risk factors increased the risk of thrombosis, even after adjusting for treatment with low-dose aspirin (incidence rate ratio: 9.8; 95% confidence interval: 2.3-42.3; P=0.02). Time free from cytoreduction was significantly shorter in CALR-mutated patients with essential thrombocythemia than in JAK2(V617F)-mutated ones (median time 5 years and 9.8 years, respectively; P=0.0002) and cytoreduction was usually necessary to control extreme thrombocytosis. In conclusion, in patients with low-risk, CALR-mutated essential thrombocythemia, low-dose aspirin does not reduce the risk of thrombosis and may increase the risk of bleeding."

CD010019,0,26676676,0,Does an Early and Aggressive Combined Wrapping and Dangling Procedure Affect the Clinical Outcome of Lower Extremity Free Flaps?-A Randomized Controlled Prospective Study Using Microdialysis Monitoring.,"Background The ideal starting point for flap training (FT) with the combined wrapping and dangling procedure is still a question of debate. Most units follow their own established protocols and currently evidence of flap compromise due to FT is still lacking. The aim of this study was to prove if an early and ""aggressive"" wrapping and dangling protocol could lead to metabolic changes, measured by microdialysis, indicating ischemia resulting in compromised flap perfusion. Methods Between 2010 and 2014, 49 patients with microvascular free flap reconstruction of the lower limb were included in this study. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group I started FT on the 7th postoperative day, and group II started on day 3. FT consisted of a combined wrapping and dangling procedure doubling its duration daily and ending at day 5. Flaps were monitored clinically and by microdialysis for ischemia-induced changes and metabolic parameters in the flap tissue in respect to different starting points of FT. Results All 49 patients in both groups were able to complete the postoperative FT without complications. Noninferiority of the early group could be proven and microdialysis results showed no differences between both groups. Conclusion We could prove by microdialysis that an early start of FT does not lead to compromised flap perfusion. Moreover, an early start of FT can lead to a reduced length of hospital stay. Furthermore, a reduced risk for deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia due to earlier mobilization might be an appreciated side effect."

Venography was performed on the operated leg 3 days postoperatively. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether they had DVT. A correlation analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with DVT.Of all the 128 patients, 28 patients (21.9%) developed DVT, with 4 (3.1%) in a proximal location. Significant differences were found in the mean age, time of application of tourniquet, mean VAS scores, mean D-dimer level, mean cholesterol level, and various surgical procedures in patients with DVT compared with those without DVT. DVT is difficult to diagnose solely based on clinical symptoms.The incidence of DVT was 21.9% in patients who underwent arthroscopic PCL reconstruction. The rate of asymptomatic clots in the calf region was rather high after PCL reconstruction, and the rate of proximal clots was 4%. Older age, longer durations of tourniquet application, higher VAS scores and D-dimer levels, and complex surgical procedures were all substantial risk factors for DVT after PCL reconstruction.

Effects of pre-exhaustion on the patterns of muscular activity in the flat bench press. J Strength Cond Res 31(7): 1919-1924, 2017-Pre-exhaustion (PE) has been applied in resistance training (RT) to manipulate the order of performing 2 resistance exercises, a single-joint exercise to momentary exhaustion, followed by a multi-joint movement that includes the same muscle group. This method ensures greater recruitment of muscles or muscle groups in the multi-joint exercise to further increase muscle strength and overcome strength plateaus. The purpose of the present study was to investigate muscle activity by electromyography during high-intensity (95% of 1 repetition maximum [RM]) bench press (BP), before and after PE of the pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD), and triceps brachii (TB) muscles to determine the effects of PE of the prime movers. Eight healthy athletes, experienced in RT, participated in the study. There were 4 sessions in the experiment. Session 1 was aimed at determination of 1RM during a flat BP. Sessions 2, 3, and 4 consisted of performing a BP after PE of the muscles studied by the incline dumbbell fly, front deltoid raise, and lying triceps extension exercise. Peak concentric TB activation after TB PE (mean ± SD, 147.76 ± 18.6%) was significantly greater by analysis of variance (η = 0.82, F = 5.45, p = 0.004) compared with peak TB activation (114.77 ± 19.4%) before TB PE. The statistical analysis for PM and AD did not show any significant differences. Coaches should not expect the usefulness of PE protocol to elicit higher PM or AD activity or fatigue, but they can use it to increase TB activity before high-intensity BP exercise."

These potential benefits are counterbalanced by the risk of bleeding complications, the most devastating of which is intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). We retrospectively evaluated 9703 patients from the 2003-2012 nationwide in-patient sample database (NIS) who received thrombolytics for PE. All patients with ICH during the PE hospitalisation were identified and a clinical risk score model was developed utilizing demographics and comorbidities. The dataset was divided 1:1 into derivation and validation cohorts. During 2003-2012, 176/9705 (1.8 %) patients with PE experienced ICH after thrombolytic use. Four independent prognostic factors were identified in a backward logistic regression model, and each was assigned a number of points proportional to its regression coefficient: pre-existing Peripheral vascular disease (1 point), age greater than 65 years (Elderly) (1 point), prior Cerebrovascular accident with residual deficit (5 points), and prior myocardial infarction (Heart attack) (1 point). In the derivation cohort, scores of 0, 1, 2 and ≥ 5 points were associated with ICH risks of 1.2 %, 1.9 %, 2.4 % and 17.8 %, respectively. Rates of ICH were similar in the validation cohort. The C-statistic for the risk score was 0.65 (0.61-0.70) in the derivation cohort and 0.66 (0.60-0.72) in the validation cohort. A novel risk score, derived from simple clinical historical elements was developed to predict ICH in PE patients treated with thrombolytics."

CABG has been shown to be superior to percutaneous coronary intervention for patients with complex three vessel disease and left main coronary artery disease. All patients undergoing CABG should receive aspirin preoperatively; they also should receive a beta blocker preoperatively to reduce the likelihood of postsurgical atrial fibrillation. All patients should receive aspirin within 6 hours postsurgery to prevent graft thrombosis and should continue taking aspirin indefinitely, be started or continued on a high-intensity statin, be enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program, and be screened and treated if necessary for depression."

A systematic electronic literature review of all relevant studies through to June 2015 was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases. Pooled risk ratios (RR) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random or fixed effects models. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality, and Stata 11.0 was used to analyse data (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Significant differences between obese and non-obese patients were found for operation time (SMD, -0.273; 95%CI, -0.424 to -0.121), blood loss (SMD, -0.265; 95%CI, -0.424 to -0.107), surgical site infections (RR, 0.610; 95%CI, 0.446 to 0.834), and nerve injury (RR, 0.188; 95%CI, 0.042 to 0.841). Deep vein thrombosis, dural tear, revision surgery, and mortality were not significantly differences between the two groups (P<0.05). Obesity appears to be associated with longer operative times, greater blood loss, and higher risk of surgical site infections and nerve injuries. However, the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity amongst the included studies."

In a retrospective data analysis, we compared clinical outcomes in 50 patients with HeartWare (HW) or HeartMate II implants undergoing device exchange (DEx; n = 21) or systemic thrombolysis (STL; n = 29) for pump thrombosis. Primary end-point was survival up to 90 days postintervention. Secondary end-points were the need for blood products postintervention, duration of intensive care unit stay, in-hospital stay, 90 day and 2 year therapy failure (the need for additional surgical or nonsurgical intervention because of pump thrombosis), and 2 year survival. Ninety-day survival was 89.3% in the STL group and 91.0% in the DEx group (p = 0.901). Compared with the DEx group, the average use of different blood products was lower (p < 0.001), and duration of intensive care unit stay and in-hospital stay tended to be shorter in the STL group (p values = 0.086 and 0.048, respectively). However, 90 day freedom from therapy failure was significantly lower in the STL group than in the DEx exchange group (p = 0.027) and so was 2 year freedom from therapy failure (p = 0.006).

It was shown that the definition of the «initial point» depends on the understanding of early auditory ontogenesis, success of implantation surgery, accurate connection of the speech-processor and its correct initial adjustment. However, the analysis of the practical experience demonstrated that the majority of the children are unable to benefit from the new opportunities on their own. They need a special support by the teacher of the deaf and the family members for «launching» the new auditory abilities. Both the content and the effectiveness of this work depend on the understanding of early auditory ontogenesis and the skills of the teacher of the deaf. A new approach to the rehabilitation of the children with cochlear implants is proposed based on the interpretation of early auditory ontogenesis in the context of the formation and complication of the emotional communication of a child with the adult relatives. In the frame of the proposed approach to the rehabilitation of the children with cochlear implants, the «initial point» of new auditory abilities is the initiation of an emotional dialogue with the adult relatives on a new sensory basis. This «initial point» is common for different groups of children with an exclusion of deaf children with cochlear implants retaining the ability for the emotional communication with the relatives. In such children, the «initial point» is the point of ontogenesis at which the communication with the environment on the comprehensive sensory foundation was interrupted."

CD010019,0,28640782,0,Perioperative Venous Thromboembolism: A Review.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant problem in the perioperative period, increasing patient morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It is also considered the most preventable of the major postoperative complications. Despite widespread adoption of prophylaxis guidelines, it appears that morbidity from the disease has not substantially changed within the past 2 decades. It is becoming clear that current prophylaxis efforts are not sufficient. Using more potent anticoagulants may decrease the incidence of VTE, but increase the risk for bleeding and infection. Much has been learned about the pathophysiology of venous thrombogenesis in recent years. Beyond the ""traditional coagulation cascade,"" which anticoagulants modulate, there is a growing appreciation for the roles of tissue factor, monocytes, neutrophils, neutrophil extracellular traps, microvesicles, and platelets in thrombus initiation and propagation. These recent studies explain to some degree why aspirin appears to be remarkably effective in preventing thrombus propagation. Endothelial dysfunction, traditionally thought of as a risk factor for arterial thrombosis, plays an important role within the cusps of venous valves, a unique environment where the majority of venous thrombi originate. This suggests a role for newer treatment modalities such as statins. Not all patients have an equal likelihood of experiencing a VTE, even when undergoing high-risk procedures, and better tools are required to accurately predict VTE risk. Only then will we be able to effectively individualize prophylaxis by balancing the risks for VTE against the risks associated with treatment. Given the different cell types and pathways involved in thrombogenesis, it is likely that multimodal treatment regimens will be more effective, enabling the use of lower and safer doses of hemostatic modulating therapies such as anticoagulants, antithrombotics, and antiplatelet medications."

Here, we present a contemporary review on the efficacy and safety of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in hospitalized medically ill patients. A search of publication and trial databases of controlled trials conducted from 2010 to 2016 using the key terms apixaban, rivaroxaban, and betrixaban showed three phase III trials that met our search criteria. In the ""ADOPT"" trial, apixaban was not inferior to enoxaparin in preventing VTE events (relative risk [RR] of 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-1.23; P = 0.44); however, major bleeding rate was significantly higher with apixaban (RR of 2.58; 95% CI 1.02-7.24; P = 0.04). In the ""MAGELLAN"" trial, rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin in preventing VTE events (RR of 0.77; 95% CI 0.62-0.96; P = 0.02) but with higher clinically relevant bleeding rate (RR of 2.5; 95% CI 1.85-3.25; P < 0.001).

We compared this 'age-adjusted' strategy with other ways of interpreting D-dimer results. A non-age adjusted increase, and using higher thresholds in younger patients, was just as accurate. Age-adjustment of D-dimer thresholds does not appear to be appropriate. Click to hear Prof. le Gal's presentation on controversies in venous thromboembolism diagnosis SUMMARY: Background Using a progressively higher D-dimer level to exclude venous thromboembolism (VTE) with increasing age has been proposed but is not well validated. Objective To determine whether it is appropriate to use a progressively higher D-dimer level to exclude VTE with increasing age. Patients/methods We analyzed clinical data and blood samples from 1649 patients with a first suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. We compared the negative predictive values (NPVs) for VTE, and the proportions of patients with a negative D-dimer result, by using three D-dimer interpretation strategies: a progressively higher D-dimer threshold with increasing age (age-adjusted strategy); the same higher D-dimer threshold in all patients (mean D-dimer strategy); and a progressively higher D-dimer threshold with decreasing age (inverse age-adjusted strategy). Results The NPV with the age-adjusted strategy (99.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 99.0-99.9%) was not different from that with the mean D-dimer strategy (99.7%; 95% CI 99.0-99.9%) or that with the inverse age-adjusted strategy (99.8%; 95% CI 99.1-99.9%). The proportion of patients with a negative result with the age-adjusted strategy (50.9%; 95% CI 48.5-53.4%) was not different from the proportion of patients with a negative result with the mean D-dimer strategy (51.7%; 95% CI 49.3-54.1%) or with the inverse age-adjusted strategy (49.5%; 95% CI 47.1-51.9%).

Acute VTE is usually managed with parenteral unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, followed by an oral vitamin K antagonist. Data are lacking for optimal treatment of less common occurrences, such as upper extremity DVT, and for approaches such as thrombolysis for PE associated with early signs of hemodynamic compromise or inferior vena cava filters when anticoagulation is contraindicated. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are now added to the armamentarium of agents available for acute management of VTE and/or reducing the risk of recurrence. This review outlines an algorithmic approach to acute VTE treatment: from aggressive therapies when anticoagulation may be inadequate, to alternative choices when anticoagulation is contraindicated, to anticoagulant options in the majority of patients in whom anticoagulation is appropriate. Evidence-based guidelines and the most recent DOAC clinical trial data are discussed in the context of the standard of care. Situations and treatment approaches for which data are unavailable or insufficient are identified. VTE therapy in care transitions is discussed, as are choices for secondary prevention."
