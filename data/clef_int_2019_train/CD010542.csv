CD010542,0,17585186,0,[Clinical application of non-invasive diagnosis for hepatic fibrosis].,"Progressive hepatic fibrosis with development of cirrhosis is a feature of chronic liver disease. Assessing fibrosis is important for predicting disease progression and patient management. Liver biopsy is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure. Alternative non-invasive methods have been developed. Serum markers are useful in predicting liver cirrhosis, but accuracy of serum markers is not satisfactory in the assessment of fibrosis. Newly developed transient elastography (Fibroscan) is a non-invasive method of measuring liver stiffness. Fibroscan has been reported to be superior in early detection of cirrhosis to serum markers. Factors influencing it's performance are not fully investigated. The evaluation of new tests should be continued to perform."

CD010542,0,17438875,0,Transient elastography--an alternative to liver biopsy in patients with chronic hepatitis C?,"Liver fibrosis is the main determinant of clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis C. Liver biopsy is still considered the gold-standard for assessing liver fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure associated with morbidity and mortality and has several limitations. Moreover, liver biopsy is not well accepted by the patients, especially when repeated examinations are needed, and its accuracy in assessing fibrosis is questionable due to sampling errors, intraobserver and interobserver discrepancies. Therefore, over the last years there has been an increasing interest and desire for non-invasive tests to assess the stage of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. There are three main groups of non-invasive methodologies for the assessment of liver fibrosis: serum markers, imaging techniques, and transient elastrography. This review summarizes current information on transient elastography used for non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C."
CD010542,0,18221303,0,Liver fibrosis on account of chronic hepatitis C is more severe in HIV-positive than HIV-negative patients despite antiretroviral therapy.,"The recent availability of non-invasive tools to measure liver fibrosis has allowed examination of its extent and determination of predictors in all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. On the other hand, most information on hepatic fibrosis in HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients has been derived from liver biopsies taken before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was widely available. All consecutive HCV patients with elevated aminotransferases seen during the last 3 years were evaluated and liver fibrosis measured using transient elastography (FibroScan) and biochemical indexes. Patients were split according to their HIV serostatus. A total of 656 (69.6%) HCV-monoinfected and 287 (30.4%) HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were assessed. Mean CD4 count of coinfected patients was 493 cells/muL and 88% were under HAART (mean time, 4.2 +/- 2.4 years). Advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis was recognized in 39% of the coinfected and 18% of the monoinfected patients (P < 0.005). A good correlation was found between FibroScan) and biochemical indexes [AST to platelet ratio index (r = 0.405, P < 0.0001), FIB-4 (r = 0.393, P < 0.0001) and Forns (r = 0.407, P < 0.0001)], regardless of the HIV status. In the multivariate analysis, age >45 years, body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2), and HIV infection were independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients have more advanced liver fibrosis than HCV-monoinfected patients despite the immunologic benefit of HAART."

CD010542,0,20458851,0,Hepatic amyloidosis increases liver stiffness measured by transient elastography.,"Liver stiffness values in transient elastography (TE) have to be interpreted with caution. Steatosis, congestion, acute inflammation and extrahepatic cholestasis can indeed influence measurements. Obtained stiffness values in the cirrhotic range can also be present in the absence of fibrosis as in hepatic amyloidosis. Here we report two cases of systemic amyloidosis with hepatic involvement where high stiffness values were measured at TE. In fact, deposits of amyloid may increase the rigidity of the liver parenchyma resulting in higher liver stiffness values. Therefore, results of TE should always be interpreted in their clinical context and if inconsistent, the performance of a liver biopsy might be necessary."

CD010542,0,20002560,0,Prevalence and factors associated with significant liver fibrosis assessed by transient elastometry in HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients.,"Transient elastometry (TE) could provide a more accurate evaluation of the frequency and risk factors of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection than that based on biopsy. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with significant liver fibrosis in a large population of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, who had participated in a cross-sectional, multicenter, retrospective study of liver fibrosis using noninvasive markers and in whom a determination of liver stiffness (LS) by TE was available, were included in this analysis. Factors potentially associated with significant fibrosis (LS ≥ 9 kPa) were analyzed. One thousand three hundred and ten patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 526 (40%) of them showed LS ≥ 9 kPa and 316 (24%) cirrhosis (LS ≥ 14 kPa). The factors independently associated with significant fibrosis [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval, P value) were the following: older age [1.04 (1.01-1.07), 0.002], daily alcohol intake > 50 g/day [1.58 (1.10-2.27), 0.013] and the length of HCV infection [1.03 (1.00-1.06), 0.023]]. A CD4 cell count lower than < 200 per mm(3) [1.67 (0.99-2.81), 0.053] and HCV genotype 4 [0.66 (0.42-1.02), 0.066] were marginally associated with LS ≥ 9 kPa. In conclusion, the prevalence of cirrhosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients seems to be higher than previously reported in studies based on liver biopsy. Older age, alcohol consumption and lower CD4 cell counts are related with significant fibrosis. The latter association supports an earlier starting of antiretroviral therapy in this setting."

The histological evaluation of a liver biopsy cylinder is still the gold standard in assessing the stage of liver fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure and carries the risk of complications. This has to be balanced against the information benefit of liver histology. To overcome this, non-invasive tests were developed assessing liver fibrosis based on combinations of laboratory markers or techniques measuring liver elasticity. In this review the current impact of the non invasive methods is discussed and weighted against liver biopsy."

CD010542,0,19215579,0,Noninvasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis in patients with HIV infection and HCV/HBV co-infection.,"The measurement of fibrosis stage critically affects the identification of the progression of liver disease, the establishment of a prognosis and therapeutic decision making. Liver biopsy has been the single, most useful method to determine the degree of liver fibrosis (LF), but with recognized limitations, mainly associated with its invasiveness. In recent years, alternative noninvasive methods have been developed, including imaging methods, such as transient elastometry, and assays based on serum biomarkers. This article reviews the available studies evaluating the value of various noninvasive methods for the assessment of LF in patients with HIV-infection and HBV/HCV co-infection, and makes recommendations on how to best use and combine them in clinical practice."
CD010542,0,20198894,0,[Assessment of hepatic injury in patients with chronic viral hepatitis].,"The management and prognosis of chronic viral hepatitis greatly depend on the extent and progression of liver fibrosis. Although liver biopsy is still considered as the gold standard to evaluate hepatic fibrosis, it is an invasive procedure with rare but potentially severe complications. It is also prone to sampling errors. These limitations have stimulated the search for new noninvasive approaches. A number of noninvasive techniques such as indirect or direct markers and measurement of liver stiffness using transient elastography have been proposed for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis. The performance of simple tests derived from routine laboratory parameters appears to be similar to that of more complex and expensive fibrosis panels. Transient elastography seems to be more accurate than blood tests for diagnosing cirrhosis. The goal of disease specific, accurate and sensitive markers of fibrosis is worth the effort. The true success in such an attempt can be characterized as hopeful; however, these noninvasive methods can be anticipated to become an important tool in clinical practice."

CD010542,0,17415348,0,Assessment of liver fibrosis in the clinical setting: something is changing?,"Clinical management of compensated chronic liver diseases (CLD) requires precise definition of the stage of liver fibrosis which is the key histologic predictor of progression to cirrhosis. Several methods are used to assess liver fibrosis. Among those, percutaneous liver biopsy is still the gold standard. However, the recent introduction of liver imaging techniques, the rising of statistical tests able to classify CLD noninvasively, and a reconsideration of its potential complications, have contributed to an audit of the evolving role of liver biopsy. At present, there is an increasing interest for noninvasive approaches to evaluate the stage of liver fibrosis in the clinical work-up of patients with CLD. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is a new, noninvasive method to assess liver stiffness and, consequently, the degree of liver fibrosis. Since its use in the clinical setting is of great interest, further studies should define the exact role of this procedure."

CD010542,0,19804501,0,Optimal combinations of ultrasound-based and serum markers of disease severity in patients with chronic hepatitis C.,"Combinations of noninvasive markers may improve discrimination of chronic liver disease severity. The aims of this study were to compare four validated serum and ultrasound-based markers of hepatic disease severity head-to-head with liver biopsy and to assess optimal combinations with consideration of cost. A total of 67 patients with biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis C underwent all four techniques on the same visit [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI); Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel; transient elastography (TE) and ultrasound microbubble hepatic transit times (HTT)]. Markers were combined according to increasing financial cost and ordinal regression used to determine contributions. APRI, ELF, TE and HTT predicted cirrhosis with diagnostic accuracy of 86%, 91%, 90% and 83% respectively. ELF and TE were the most reliable tests with an intra-class correlation of 0.94 each. Either ELF or TE significantly enhanced the prediction of fibrosis stage when combined with APRI, but when combined together, did not improve the model further. Addition of third or fourth markers did not significantly improve prediction of fibrosis. Combination of APRI with either ELF or TE effectively predicts fibrosis stage, but combinations of three or more tests lead to redundancy of information and increased cost."
CD010542,0,20850886,0,Diagnostic accuracy of FibroScan and comparison to liver fibrosis biomarkers in chronic viral hepatitis: a multicenter prospective study (the FIBROSTIC study).,The diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive liver fibrosis tests that may replace liver biopsy in patients with chronic hepatitis remains controversial. We assessed and compared the accuracy of FibroScan® and that of the main biomarkers used for predicting cirrhosis and significant fibrosis (METAVIR ≥ F2) in patients with chronic viral hepatitis.
CD010542,0,18166342,0,Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis and portal hypertension with transient elastography.,"Hepatic fibrogenesis, the ""final"" common result of injury to the liver, is believed to be a critical factor leading to hepatic dysfunction and may be important in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension. Thus, accurate assessment of the degree of fibrosis is important clinically. For many years, examination of hepatic histopathology has been considered to be the ""gold standard"" tool used to assess fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is invasive, and in many instances not favored by patients or physicians. Thus, alternative approaches to measure liver fibrosis would be extremely attractive. To the extent that transient elastography is able to measure ""liver stiffness,"" which is proportional to the degree of liver fibrosis, this technique holds great promise."
CD010542,0,20331759,0,Correlation of transient elastography with APRI and FIB-4 in a cohort of patients with congenital bleeding disorders and HCV or HIV/HCV coinfection.,"Patients with inherited bleeding disorders frequently suffer from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono- or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection. Non-invasive markers for liver fibrosis are warranted for these patients. We tested a large cohort of haemophilic patients with HCV mono- or HIV/HCV coinfection for correlation of transient elastography (TE) with two simple surrogate markers of liver fibrosis and for differences in fibrosis stages according to these markers. We prospectively enrolled HCV-positive patients with congenital bleeding disorders with or without HIV coinfection. Liver function tests and platelet counts were determined and TE was performed. Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and a simple index called FIB-4 were calculated and results were correlated with TE. A total number of 174 patients were included (23% HCV, 36% HIV/HCV coinfected, 33% with cleared HCV and 8% with ongoing HIV but cleared HCV). TE correlated significantly with APRI and FIB-4 (r = 0.60; P < 0.001 and r = 0.54; P < 0.001 respectively). This correlation was pronounced in patients with ongoing HCV infection (r = 0.67; P < 0.001 and r = 0.60; P < 0.001). Prediction of advanced fibrosis resulted in concordance rates >80% with combinations of TE plus APRI and APRI plus FIB-4. HIV/HCV coinfected patients did not present with advanced fibrosis stages when compared with HCV-monoinfected patients. Combinations of two non-invasive markers may significantly reduce the number of liver biopsies in patients with bleeding disorders and advanced liver fibrosis. Furthermore, our data support previous studies that observed a favourable outcome in patients with HIV/HCV and a preserved immune function in times of highly active antiretroviral therapy."

CD010542,0,16538113,0,Prevalence and factors associated with failure of liver stiffness measurement using FibroScan in a prospective study of 2114 examinations.,"Liver stiffness measurement using FibroScan is a novel rapid and non-invasive technique that evaluates liver fibrosis. In some cases, however, no elasticity measurement is obtained. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with failure (no value obtained after 10 measurements) of liver stiffness measurement in patients with chronic liver disease. Two thousand one hundred and fourteen liver stiffness measurements were analyzed. Failure was observed in 96 cases (4.5%). Failure was not associated with operator, gender, or transaminase level. By multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with failure was body mass index greater than 28 (odds ratio, 10.0 degrees; 95% confidence interval, 5.7-17.9, P=0.001). In conclusion, liver stiffness is a good method for the evaluation of liver fibrosis that is feasible in more than 95% of patients. Other non-invasive methods such as biochemical methods or liver biopsy could therefore be used only in patients with failure of FibroScan examination."

CD010542,0,19965159,0,Liver elasticity and viscosity quantification using shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (SDUV).,"Noninvasive quantification of liver elasticity is a promising alternative to liver biopsy to stage liver fibrosis, a condition afflicting hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Quantitative measurement of elasticity (in unit of Pascal) is required in this application because liver fibrosis is a diffuse disease where abnormality is not confined to a local region and there is no normal background tissue to provide contrast. SDUV uses an ultrasound ""push"" beam to stimulate formation of propagating harmonic shear waves in the studied tissue. The propagation speed of induced shear waves is frequency dependent (dispersive) and relates to the tissue's mechanical properties. Shear wave speeds at multiple frequencies (typically hundreds of Hertz) are measured by a separate ultrasound ""detect"" beam in pulse echo mode and fit with a theoretical dispersion model to inversely solve for tissue elasticity and viscosity. A special pulse sequence has been developed to facilitate a single ultrasound array transducer for both push and detect function, which makes SDUV compatible with current ultrasound scanners. Feasibility of this pulse sequence is demonstrated by in vivo SDUV measurements in porcine liver using a dual transducer prototype."
CD010542,0,20006397,0,Prospective comparison of two algorithms combining non-invasive methods for staging liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.,Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis is a challenging area. Several methods have been proposed in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) but their performance may be improved when they are combined as suggested by recently proposed algorithms using either transient elastography (TE) and Fibrotest (FT) (Castera) or AST-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and FT (SAFE biopsy). The aim of this prospective study was to compare the performance of these two algorithms for diagnosing significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in 302 CHC patients.
CD010542,0,22138940,0,Editorial: staging liver fibrosis in hepatitis C: a challenge for this decade.,"The limitations of and the invasive nature of liver biopsy has spurred extensive interest in the development of non-invasive tests to measure liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Clinically applicable non-invasive tests, including radiological studies, elastography, and serum markers, all of which perform extremely well in excluding significant disease and diagnosing cirrhosis. FibroScan and acoustic radiation force impulse elastography are two elastography-based tests that show promise. In this new era of increased cure rates with newly Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and the availability of multiple non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis, we anticipate a decreasing need for liver biopsies in the management of chronic hepatitis C."
CD010542,0,19715940,0,"Correlation between fibroscan, liver biopsy, and clinical liver function in patients with hepatitis C virus infection after renal transplantation.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most important liver disease (LD) after renal transplantation. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and follow-up of LD. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the correlation between values of Fibroscan (EchoSens, Paris, France), a new noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis, liver biopsy, and clinical data among HCV-positive renal transplant patients. Twenty-four HCV/RNA-positive patients with a previous liver biopsy were selected to undergo Fibroscan (transient elastography) and a clinical evaluation of liver function. Fibroscan values were expressed in kilopascals (kPa). As 2 patients were eliminated due to obesity or ascites, we analyzed 22 patients. Thirteen patients (59%) with fibrosis F0-F1 (METAVIR score) by biopsy and normal liver function showed a mean Fibroscan score of 5.2 kPa (range, 2.3-6.8 kPa). Three patients (13.6%) exhibited F2 by biopsy and normal liver function with a mean Fibroscan score of 8.2 kPa (range, 7.3-8.9 kPa). Three patients (13.6%) with F3 by biopsy and abnormal liver function showed a high mean Fibroscan score of 10.9 kPa (range, 10.5-11.6 kPa). The last 3 patients (13.6%) with F4 (cirrhosis) by biopsy and abnormal clinical data showed the highest mean Fibroscan value of 14.2 kPa (range, 8.9-18 kPa). In conclusion, among renal transplant patients with HCV the values of Fibroscan seem to correlate with the degree of fibrosis by biopsy and with clinical liver function. Therefore, Fibroscan may be useful to follow patients with LD. However, these results should be analyzed with caution due to the small number of cases and retrospective nature of the study."
CD010542,0,16969327,0,[Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis virus C].,"Development of liver fibrosis, which leads to cirrhosis, is the principal complication of all chronic liver diseases, regardless of their cause. Knowledge of the existence and severity of fibrosis is important from diagnostic and prognostic viewpoints. Its assessment plays an essential role in the treatment decision and makes it possible to assess the risk of progression to cirrhosis and the onset of its complications. Histologic examination of the liver remains the reference examination for assessing the extent of fibrosis during chronic liver disease. Nonetheless, the number of patients needing assessment, the risks of the punch-biopsy and the cost of this invasive examination have led many to propose other tools to assess fibrosis. Some standard indicators (transaminases, platelets, prothrombin time) have long been recognized as indirect markers of extensive fibrosis. More recently, progress in our knowledge of the mechanisms of liver fibrogenesis have made it possible to identify different peripheral blood components that may be of clinical interest. Thus serum assays of elements of the extracellular matrix, their decay products, or enzymes involved in their metabolism have been proposed as noninvasive indicators. Among these, hyaluronic acid appears the most interesting.

The Fibrotest is the best validated and most widely used of these.

CD010542,0,19921111,0,"[Liver fibrosis : clinics, diagnostics and management].","Liver fibrosis results from chronic liver damage and is characterized by scarring of the liver parenchyma. Liver fibrosis can occur in all chronic liver diseases and shows progression towards liver cirrhosis in 20-40% of cases. The clinical presentation of liver fibrosis is usually unspecific. Therefore, most patients with liver fibrosis are identified by elevated liver enzymes during other medical examinations. The gold standard for quantification of liver fibrosis is percutaneous liver biopsy, but non-invasive markers (e. g. serum markers, transient elastography) have recently been evaluated to identify individuals with significant fibrosis. In case of fibrosis detection, medical therapies aim at stabilizing liver scarring or even at inducing the regression of fibrosis. Primarily this is achieved by etiology specific therapies of chronic liver diseases (e. g. antiviral therapy, immunosuppressive therapy etc.). However, in cases of failure of these specific therapies, non-specific interventions for fibrosis regression are actively being investigated. These treatment options are based on the growing molecular knowledge of fibrogenesis but are not yet available for routine clinical use."

In recent years it became clear that the fibrotic process is reversible. Therefore early detection of liver fibrosis is critical. At present, liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for the detection of fibrosis. Nevertheless liver biopsy is an invasive procedure limiting both its acceptance by patients, and their compliance for repeated procedures. More over it is a questionable gold standard due to significant sample error and intra and inter observer variability. These limitations have led to the development of noninvasive techniques for assessing the presence and the degree of liver fibrosis, such as biomarkers and transient elastography. The accuracy of these methods as compared to liver biopsy, as well as their use and limitations are reviewed in the article."

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate changes in liver fibrosis, as measured with non-invasive methods, in a large cohort of HCV-infected patients with and without treatment. From May 2003 through March 2006, all previously untreated HCV-infected patients were enrolled in this study. Liver fibrosis was staged with FibroScan and Fibrotest at inclusion, then every year in untreated patients, and at the end of treatment and 6 months later in treated patients. The study population consisted of 416 patients, of whom 112 started treatment after enrolment. In the treatment group, FibroScan and Fibrotest values were significantly higher before and after treatment than in untreated patients at baseline and after 1 year. However, there was no significant difference between treated and untreated patients at the end of follow-up. FibroScan and Fibrotest values fell in all treated patients, whatever their virological response. In multivariate analysis, treatment was the only factor independently associated with a fall in the FibroScan value. In conclusion, whatever the virological response, treatment for HCV infection is associated with an improvement of FibroScan and Fibrotest values. Further studies are needed to compare these non-invasive methods with liver biopsy. These non-invasive methods, and especially FibroScan, should be useful for assessing treatment efficacy in clinical trials of new drugs."

Subjects positive for hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus infection and consuming any amount of alcohol were excluded. Diagnosis of NAFL was by dual radiological screening protocol consisting of ultrasonographic and computed tomographic examination of the liver. Transient elastographic examination and liver biopsy were performed in a subset to identify significant liver disease. The risk factors of having NAFL were analyzed. A total of 1,911 individuals were analyzed, 7% of whom were overweight and 11% of whom had abdominal obesity. The prevalence of NAFL, NAFL with elevated alanine aminotransferase, and cryptogenic cirrhosis was 8.7%, 2.3%, and 0.2%, respectively. Seventy-five percent of NAFL subjects had a body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m(2), and 54% were neither overweight nor had abdominal obesity. The subjects with the highest risk of having NAFL were those with a BMI >25 kg/m(2) (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.6-11.5). Abdominal obesity, dysglycemia (fasting plasma glucose >100 mg/dL or elevated homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance), and higher income were the other risk factors.

CD010542,0,20544947,0,Magnetic resonance elastography: a review.,"Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a rapidly developing technology for quantitatively assessing the mechanical properties of tissue. The technology can be considered to be an imaging-based counterpart to palpation, commonly used by physicians to diagnose and characterize diseases. The success of palpation as a diagnostic method is based on the fact that the mechanical properties of tissues are often dramatically affected by the presence of disease processes, such as cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis. MRE obtains information about the stiffness of tissue by assessing the propagation of mechanical waves through the tissue with a special magnetic resonance imaging technique. The technique essentially involves three steps: (1) generating shear waves in the tissue, (2) acquiring MR images depicting the propagation of the induced shear waves, and (3) processing the images of the shear waves to generate quantitative maps of tissue stiffness, called elastograms. MRE is already being used clinically for the assessment of patients with chronic liver diseases and is emerging as a safe, reliable, and noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for staging hepatic fibrosis. MRE is also being investigated for application to pathologies of other organs including the brain, breast, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, lungs, and skeletal muscle.

Whether FS is useful in the detection of preexisting liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients presenting with acute liver damage is unclear. Patients with acute liver damage of different etiologies were analyzed. Liver stiffness was measured during the acute phase of the liver damage and followed up to the end of the acute phase. A total of 20 patients were included in the study. In 15 of the 20 patients, initial liver stiffness values measured by FS during the acute phase of the liver damage were suggestive of liver cirrhosis. However, none of these 15 patients showed any signs of liver cirrhosis in the physical examination, ultrasound examination, or liver histology [performed in 11 of 15 (73%) patients]. A significant difference was observed in the initial bilirubin levels (5.8 +/- 6.5 mg/dL versus 15.7 +/- 11.8 mg/dL; P = 0.042) and age (32.4 +/- 17.5 years versus 49.7 +/- 15.8 years; P = 0.042) between patients with liver stiffness below or above 12.5 kPa.

Although their diagnostic accuracy in liver fibrosis is promising, around 20% of patients are likely to be misclassified if these tests or LB are used alone. However, using a combination of several biochemical scores (Fibropaca algorithm, Leroy algorithm) or one biochemical score with TE (Bordeaux algorithm) will increase diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis and reduce the need for LB. Stepwise combination algorithms of non-invasive scores (SAFE biopsy) also improve the diagnostic performance in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) compared with the use of a single non-invasive score. Other sequential stepwise algorithms have been developed in CHC with similar performance results. Comparisons of different combinations of non-invasive methods indicate that the SAFE biopsy, Fibropaca algorithm and Bordeaux algorithm are excellent and comparable in the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis in HCV patients, and will markedly reduce the need for LB.

The histologic spectrum of NAFLD includes simple steatosis, which has a benign prognosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a more aggressive form of liver injury that may progress to cirrhosis and its complications. At present, the only widely accepted means of differentiating these lesions, including the severity of hepatic fibrosis, is liver biopsy. However, due to the invasiveness of this procedure, the rising prevalence of NAFLD, and the expected availability of effective therapies for this condition, the identification of noninvasive tools for the diagnosis and staging of NAFLD has emerged as a major clinical and research priority. This review summarizes important advances in this field during the past decade, including the development of biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation; novel imaging techniques such as transient elastography; and high-throughput technologies including proteomics and genomics. Future studies must focus on the development of accurate, inexpensive, and reliable tools that can differentiate the major histologic determinants of NAFLD; are responsive to changes in NAFLD severity due to therapeutic intervention and time; and have prognostic significance. Until such tools are developed, liver biopsy remains an important tool in the assessment of patients with NAFLD."

Mean reduction in LSMs in patients along with ALT or bilirubin normalization was significantly greater than those without ALT or bilirubin normalization(P = 0.001, P = 0.038, respectively). In 23 patients with initial LSMs in the range usually defined as indicating cirrhosis (i.e.>18.2 kPa), only 5 were diagnosed with cirrhosis by histopathology or ultrasonography. As ALT normalized, LSMs remained over 12.0 kPa in all these 5 patients. However, in 18 other patients without cirrhosis at baseline, LSMs still remained above 12.0kPa in 10 patients and decreased to below 12.0 kPa in the other 8 patients.

CD010542,0,18544943,0,New diagnostic method for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.,"Liver fibrosis, i.e. excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases. The prognosis and management of chronic liver diseases depend on the degree of liver fibrosis. Therefore, the assessment of liver fibrosis provides useful information not only for diagnosis but also for treatment planning. Although liver biopsy is still the gold standard for assessing hepatic fibrosis, it has some technical limitations and risks. Furthermore, the dynamic process of liver fibrosis resulting from progression and regression cannot be quantified by liver biopsy. Therefore, alternative, simple, reliable and noninvasive tests are needed to assess the stage of fibrosis. Several noninvasive direct and indirect serum markers able to predict the presence of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease with considerable accuracy have been reported. However, since most of these markers require complicated calculations, clinical application is difficult. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is a new method for the evaluation of liver stiffness. The technique is based on changes in tissue elasticity induced by hepatic fibrosis. Liver stiffness measured by transient elastography is a noninvasive, reproducible and reliable method to assess hepatic fibrosis as well as to diagnose liver cirrhosis.

Twenty-four patients who had liver biopsy for suspicion of chronic liver disease had MR elastography performed with both spin-echo and echo-planar sequences. At histology, the fibrosis stage was assessed according to METAVIR. The data acquisition time was about 20 min using spin-echo, and only 2 min using echo-planar imaging. The hepatic signal-to-noise ratios were similar on both images (22.51 +/- 5.37 for spin-echo versus 21.02 +/- 4.76 for echo-planar, p = 0.33). The elasticity measurements and the fibrosis stages were strongly correlated. The Spearman correlation coefficients were r = 0.91 (p < 0.01) with spin-echo and r = 0.84 (p < 0.01) with echo-planar sequences. These correlation coefficients did not differ significantly (p = 0.17). A strong correlation was also observed between spin-echo and echo-planar elasticity (r = 0.83, p < 0.001), without systematic bias. The results of our study showed that echo-planar imaging substantially decreased the data acquisition time of MR elastography, while maintaining the image quality and diagnostic performance for staging of liver fibrosis. This suggests that echo-planar MR elastography could replace spin-echo MR elastography in clinical practice."

The fibrosis stage (METAVIR Score), TE, the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, the Forns fibrosis index, FIB-4 and HGM-2 indexes were assessed in 100 patients between January 2007 and January 2008. The diagnostic values were compared by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs). Using TE, the AUROC (95% CI) of liver stiffness was 0.80 (0.72-0.89) when discriminating between F <or= 1 and F > 2, 0.93 (0.85-1.00) when discriminating between F <or= 2 and F > 3 and 0.99 (0.97-1.00) when discriminating between F <or= 3 and F4. For the diagnosis of F >or= 3, the AUROCs of TE were significantly higher than those obtained with the other four noninvasive indexes. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, three cutoff values were chosen to identify F <or= 1 (<7 kPa), F >or= 3 (>or=11 kPa) and F4 (>or=14 kPa). Using these best cutoff scores, the negative predictive value and positive predictive value were 81.1% and 70.2% for the diagnosis of F <or= 1, 96.3% and 60% for the diagnosis of F >or= 3 and 100% and 57.1% for the diagnosis of F4. Thus, Transient elastography accurately predicted liver fibrosis and outperformed other simple noninvasive indexes in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.

The first clinical application of MRE to be well documented is the detection and characterization of hepatic fibrosis, which systematically increases the stiffness of liver tissue. In this diagnostic role, it offers a safer, less expensive, and potentially more accurate alternative to invasive liver biopsy. Emerging results suggest that measurements of liver and spleen stiffness may provide an indirect way to assess portal hypertension. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that it is possible to use MRE to evaluate the mechanical properties of other abdominal structures, such as the pancreas and kidneys. Steady technical progress in developing practical protocols for applying MRE in the abdomen and the pelvis provides opportunities to explore many other potential applications of this emerging technology."

CD010542,0,21535322,0,Liver stiffness measurements to assess progression of fibrosis in HCV-infected patients with inherited bleeding disorders.,"Hepatitis C is a major co-morbidity in patients with inherited bleeding disorders, leading to progressive liver fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is a non-invasive way of assessing the extent of liver fibrosis. This article describes our experience with serial LSM to assess prospectively progression of fibrosis in a cohort of patients with inherited bleeding disorders and chronic hepatitis C. A total of 84 patients underwent serial LSMs, with a median interval of 3.7 years. The change in LSM results over time was assessed. Overall, there was no significant difference between the median results of LSM 1 and LSM 2. The median result of LSM 2 was low (6.6 kPa), after a median duration of infection of 37 years. On the individual level, deterioration of LSM results of more than 2 kPa was seen in 13 patients (16%), 44 patients (52%) remained stable and 27 patients (32%) showed improvement of LSM results of more than 2 kPa. These results are comparable with those of paired liver biopsy studies. LSM appears to be a good alternative for liver biopsies in patients with hepatitis C and inherited bleeding disorders, although the interpretation of the unexpected improvement we found in some of our patients is not straightforward. LSMs will be repeated in our patient population in a few years to be able to better assess the value of serial LSM."

CD010542,0,18528937,0,"Why, who and how should perform liver biopsy in chronic liver diseases.","Chronic viral hepatitis is a common disease in the general population. During chronic hepatitis, the prognosis and clinical management are highly dependent on the extent of liver fibrosis. The fibrosis evaluation can be performed by FibroTest (using serological markers), by Elastography or FibroScan (a noninvasive percutaneous technique using the elastic properties of the hepatic tissue) and by liver biopsy (LB), considered to be the ""gold standard"". Currently, there are three techniques for performing LB: percutaneous, transjugular and laparoscopic. The percutaneous LB can be performed blind, ultrasound (US) guided or US assisted. There are two main categories of specialists who perform LB: gastroenterologists (hepatologists) and radiologists, and the specialty of the individual who performs the LB determines if the LB is performed under ultrasound guidance or not. There are two types of biopsy needles used for LB: cutting needles (Tru-Cut, Vim-Silverman) and suction needles (Menghini, Klatzkin, Jamshidi). The rate of major complications after percutaneous LB ranges from 0.09% to 2.3%, but the echo-guided percutaneous liver biopsy is a safe method for the diagnosis of chronic diffuse hepatitis (cost-effective as compared to blind biopsy) and the rate of complications seems to be related to the experience of the physician and the type of the needle used (Menghini type needle seems to be safer). Maybe, in a few years we will use non-invasive markers of fibrosis, but at this time, most authorities in the field consider that the LB is useful and necessary for the evaluation of chronic hepatopathies, despite the fact that it is not a perfect test."
CD010542,0,19925459,0,Chances and limitations of non-invasive tests in the assessment of liver fibrosis in liver transplant patients.,"Because fibrosis progression resulting in liver cirrhosis represents the main reason for graft lost in patients after liver transplantation, an early detection of liver fibrosis is crucial. In recent years, several non-invasive tests for the assessment of liver fibrosis have been developed. We prospectively assessed the stage of liver fibrosis of 135 liver transplant patients (94 hepatitis C virus [HCV], 41 alcoholic cirrhosis) using liver biopsy, transient elastography, and serum markers. In the HCV group, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) and cirrhosis (F = 4) was 0.81 (negative predictive value [NPV] = 0.58, positive predictive value [PPV] = 0.9) and 0.87 (NPV = 0.94, PPV = 0.56), respectively. In the alcoholic cirrhosis group, significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) was diagnosed with an AUROC of 0.83 (NPV = 1.00, PPV = 0.23). In both groups, higher AUROC values were reached in patients with a body mass index of <25 kg/m(2) , and both serum markers showed no significant correlation to liver fibrosis. The transient elastography is a reliable test for exclusion of liver cirrhosis in HCV transplant and significant liver fibrosis in alcoholic transplant patients. For the diagnosis of significant liver fibrosis in HCV transplant patients, the transient elastography reaches good results but cannot replace liver biopsy. Both serum markers AST-to-platelet ratio index and FIB-4 are not feasible to assess liver fibrosis in liver transplant patients."

We evaluated whether repeated liver stiffness measurements (LSM) following LT can discriminate between slow and rapid ""fibrosers"" (fibrosis stage F2-F4 at 1 year after LT). Eighty-four patients who had undergone LT and who were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 19 LT controls who were not infected with HCV underwent LSM at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after LT. All HCV-infected patients underwent liver biopsy 12 months after LT (paired HVPG measurements in 74); 31 (37%) were rapid fibrosers. Median LSM (in kilopascal) at months 6, 9, and 12 were significantly higher in rapid fibrosers (9.9, 9.5, 12.1) than in slow fibrosers (6.9, 7.5, 6.6) (P < 0.01 all time points). The slope of liver stiffness progression (kPa x month) in rapid fibrosers (0.42) was significantly greater than in slow fibrosers (0.05) (P < 0.001), suggesting two different speeds of liver fibrosis progression. Figures were almost identical for patients with HVPG >or= 6 mmHg or HVPG < 6 mmHg at 1 year after LT. Multivariate analysis identified donor age, bilirubin level, and LSM as independent predictors of fibrosis progression and portal hypertension in the estimation group (n = 50) and were validated in a second group of 34 patients. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve that could identify rapid fibrosers and patients with portal hypertension as early as 6 months after LT were 0.83 and 0.87, respectively, in the estimation group and 0.75 and 0.80, respectively, in the validation group."

In this study, we assessed the value of TE for the prediction of fibrosis stage in a cohort of pediatric patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Furthermore, TE interobserver agreement was evaluated. TE was performed in 52 consecutive biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients (32 males, 20 females, age 13.6 +/- 2.44 years). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the prediction of ""any"" (>or=1), significant (>or=2), or advanced fibrosis (>or=3) were 0.977, 0.992, and 1, respectively. Calculation of multilevel likelihood ratios showed that TE values <5, <7, and <9 kPa, suggest the presence of ""any"" fibrosis, significant fibrosis, and advanced fibrosis, respectively. TE values between 5 and 7 kPa predict a fibrosis stage of 1, but with some degree of uncertainty. TE values between 7 and 9 kPa predict fibrosis stages 1 or 2, but cannot discriminate between these two stages. TE values of at least 9 kPa are associated with the presence of advanced fibrosis.

Although liver biopsy is still considered as the gold standard to evaluate fibrosis in the liver, it is an invasive procedure, with rare but potentially life-threatening complications, and is prone to sampling errors. These limitations have stimulated the search for new noninvasive approaches. A number of methods, including serum indices and the measurement of liver stiffness using transient elastography, have been proposed for the noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis, mainly in patients with chronic hepatitis C. It can be anticipated that these noninvasive methods will become an important tool in clinical practice in the near future. This review is aimed at discussing the advantages and limits of these methods and the perspectives for their rationale for use in clinical practice."
CD010542,0,16121354,0,Value of two noninvasive methods to detect progression of fibrosis among HCV carriers with normal aminotransferases.,"The course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection carriers with normal/near-normal aminotransferases (NALT) is usually mild; however, in a few, fibrosis progression occurs. We aimed to verify whether monitoring by liver biopsy might be replaced by noninvasive methods and to identify factors associated with fibrosis progression in patients with persistently normal alanine aminotransferases. We studied 40 untreated HCV-RNA-positive subjects (22 male; median age, 44 years), who underwent two liver biopsies, with a median interval of 78.5 months, during which alanine aminotransferase concentrations (median number of determinations: 12) never exceeded 1.2 times the upper normal limit. Within 9 months from the second biopsy, they were tested by the shear elasticity probe (Fibroscan) and the artificial intelligence algorithm FibroTest. METAVIR fibrosis scores were analyzed in relationship to demographic, clinical, and viral parameters. Weighted kappa analysis was used to verify whether the results of noninvasive methods agreed with histology. Significant fibrosis (> or = F2), present at the first biopsy in only one patient (2.5%), was observed at the second biopsy in 14 patients (35%). At multivariate analysis, excess alcohol consumption in the past (>20 g/d; P = .017) and viral load (>8.0 x 10(6) copies/mL; P = .021) were independent predictors of progression. In identifying patients with significant fibrosis, inter-rater agreement was excellent for Fibroscan (weighted kappa = 1.0), and poor for FibroTest (weighted kappa = -0.041). In conclusion, among HCV carriers with NALT, Fibroscan is superior to the FibroTest in the noninvasive identification of fibrosis, for which excess alcohol consumption in the past and high viral load represent risk factors."

CD010542,0,19524169,0,Transient elastography for liver fibrosis diagnosis.,"Liver biopsy is considered the ""golden standard"" for assessment of hepatic fibrosis. However, the procedure has limitations because of inconvenience and rare but serious complications as bleeding. Furthermore, sampling errors are frequent, and interobserver variability often poses problems. Recently, a modified ultrasound scanner (transient elastography) has been developed to assess fibrosis. The device measures liver elasticity, which correlates well with the degree of fibrosis. Studies have shown that transient elastography is more accurate in diagnosing cirrhosis than minor to moderate fibrosis. Most of the studies have been conducted on patients with chronic hepatitis but a few studies have also covered fibrosis and cirrhosis due to other etiologies, and they also demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity. Transient elastography for assessment of fibrosis may turn out to be a valuable diagnostic procedure and follow-up of patients with chronic liver diseases."

CD010542,0,22432836,0,Assessment of inflammation and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by imaging-based techniques.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD) is a burgeoning global health problem, and the assessment of disease severity remains a clinical challenge. Conventional imaging and clinical blood tests are frequently unable to determine disease activity (the degree of inflammatory change) and fibrotic severity, while the applicability of histological examination of liver biopsy is limited. Imaging platforms provide liver-specific structural information, while newer applications of these technologies non-invasively exploit the physical and chemical characteristics of liver tissue in health and disease. In this review, conventional and newer imaging-based techniques for the assessment of inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD are discussed in terms of diagnostic accuracy, radio-pathological correlations, and practical considerations. In particular, recent clinical studies of ultrasound (US)-based and magnetic resonance elastography techniques are evaluated, while the potential of contrast-enhanced US and magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques is discussed. The development and application of these techniques is starting to reduce the clinical need for liver biopsy, to produce surrogate end-points for interventional and observational clinical studies, and through this, to provide new insights into the natural history of NAFLD."

We prospectively studied consecutive CHB patients undergoing liver biopsy and transient elastography examinations. Diagnostic performance of LSM for different degrees of liver fibrosis was evaluated. One hundred and sixty-one CHB patients with adequate liver biopsy sample size were studied. Area under receiver operating characteristics curves of LSM for no fibrosis (F0 vs F1-4), bridging fibrosis (F0-2 vs F3-4) and liver cirrhosis (F0-3 vs F4) was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68-0.92), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82-0.93) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89-0.97) respectively. For liver cirrhosis, these optimal cutoff values were 8.4 kPa (98% sensitivity), 9.0 kPa (maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity), 13.4 kPa (94% specificity) and 13.4 kPa (maximum diagnostic accuracy, 85%) respectively. Patients with the same fibrosis staging but higher ALT levels tend to have higher LSM, and the diagnostic performance for low stage fibrosis was most seriously affected when ALT was elevated. Different LSM cutoff values and algorithms were derived for normal and elevated ALT levels. Based on these algorithms, liver biopsy can be avoided in 62% and 58% of patients with normal and elevated ALT respectively. In conclusion, transient elastography is a reasonable noninvasive tool to substitute liver biopsy among the lowest and highest risk patients for the assessment of liver fibrosis."

Transient Elastography (TE) had good discrimination for significant fibrosis (median AUROC: 0.88). Among the serum NIT, APRI had good performance (median AUROC: 0.75). TE performed better than serum (direct and indirect) NIT for significant fibrosis with median AUROC 0.88 (vs. 0.66, P < 0.001), median sensitivity 0.86 (vs. 0.56, P = 0.002), median NPV 0.90 (vs. 0.74, P = 0.05) and median PPV 0.80 (vs. 0.63, P = 0.02). TE compared to indirect serum NIT, had better performance, but was not superior to APRI score. Finally, direct, compared to indirect NIT, were not significantly different except for specificity: median: 0.83 vs. 0.69, respectively, P = 0.04. In conclusion, NIT could become an important tool in clinical management of liver transplant recipients, but whether they can improve clinical practice needs further evidence. Their optimal combination with liver biopsy and assessment of collagen content requires investigation."

The development of clinically significant portal hypertension (defined as a hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥ 10 mmHg) is associated with the development of varices and decompensation and it is something that it is worth testing for. Transient elastography has some value for the prediction of clinically significant portal hypertension, but a large proportion of patients have non-diagnostic values.

Patients with elevated ALT tended to have higher LSM than those with normal ALT. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.85 for significant fibrosis (≥ F2), 0.92 for advanced fibrosis (≥ F3) and 0.96 for cirrhosis.

CD010542,0,19780940,0,Fibrosis staging in chronic hepatitis C: analysis of discordance between transient elastography and liver biopsy.,"In chronic hepatitis C, transient elastography (TE) accurately identifies cirrhosis, but its ability to assess significant fibrosis (Metavir > or = F2) is variable. Constitutional and liver disease-related factors may influence TE and here we examined the variables associated with differences. Three hundred consecutive hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA positive patients had biochemical tests, TE and a biopsy performed on the same day. The Dale model was used to identify the variables associated with discordance between biopsy and elastography results. In 97 patients (34.2%), TE and histological assessment were discordant. Seventy-six of 286 (26.6%) had stage > or =F2 and TE < 7.1 kPa (false negative); 21 of 286 (7.3%) had stage <F2 and TE > or = 7.1 kPa (false positive). No patient with discordant results had cirrhosis. By Dale model, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was found to be the unique variable significantly related (P = 0.046) with discordance between biopsy and TE. Discordance rate was 43.4% (82 patients) with AST < 1.5 x UNL vs 25.8% (25 patients) with AST > or = 1.5 x UNL (P = 0.004). False negative rate was 43.4 (82 patients) with AST < 1.5 x UNL vs 17.1% (13 patients) with AST > or = 1.5 x UNL (P < 0.001). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for F > or = 2, according to AST < 1.5 x UNL vs > or = 1.5 x UNL were 0.738 (95% CI: 0.683-0.812) and 0.854(95% CI: 0.754-0.907). Transient elastography is not adequate on its own to rule out or to rule in significant fibrosis, as it is influenced by major variations in biochemical activity of liver disease. Liver stiffness, at low levels of AST, can underestimate fibrosis."

The availability of reliable noninvasive tools to measure liver fibrosis has permitted the screening of large patient populations. Cross-sectional study of all consecutive HIV outpatients who underwent examination by transient elastometry (FibroScan) at one HIV reference clinic during 2007. Advanced liver fibrosis (ALF) was defined as hepatic stiffness >9.5 kilopascals, which corresponds to Metavir stages F3-F4 in the liver biopsy. A total of 681 consecutive HIV-infected patients (64% injecting drug users; mean age 43; 78% male; 98% on antiretroviral therapy) had at least one valid FibroScan evaluation. ALF was diagnosed in 215 (32%) of them. In the univariate analysis, ALF was significantly associated with older age, low CD4 counts, chronic hepatitis C, past alcohol abuse, elevated ALT, high triglycerides, low cholesterol, high homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index and exposure to didanosine and/or stavudine. In a multivariate model (OR, 95% CI), chronic hepatitis C (2.83, 1.57-5.08), past alcohol abuse (2.26, 1.37-3.74), exposure to didanosine and/or stavudine (1.85, 1.14-3.01), high HOMA index (1.25, 1.04-1.51), older age (1.09, 1.05-1.14) and elevated ALT (1.04, 1.03-1.06) remained as independently associated with ALF.

We also compared the correlation strength of ARFI and TE measurements with liver fibrosis. We included 53 patients with hepatitis B and 107 with hepatitis C in which liver biopsy, ARFI and TE measurements were performed in the same session. The mean LS values measured with ARFI were similar in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C and depended on the stage of fibrosis. The correlation strength of LS measurements by ARFI and by TE with fibrosis was similar in chronic hepatitis B and C patients. In conclusion, for the same stage of fibrosis, the mean LS values by ARFI were similar in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. ARFI had similar predictive value with TE in both chronic viral hepatitis."
CD010542,0,16628644,0,Assessment of biliary fibrosis by transient elastography in patients with PBC and PSC.,"Noninvasive measurement of liver stiffness with transient elastography has been recently validated for the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C. The current study assessed the diagnostic performance of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for the determination of fibrosis stage in chronic cholestatic diseases. One hundred one patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n=73) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC, n=28) were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study. All patients underwent liver biopsy (LB) and LSM. Histological and fibrosis stages were assessed on LB by two pathologists. LSM was performed by transient elastography. Efficiency of LSM for the determination of histological and fibrosis stages were determined by a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Analysis failed in six patients (5.9%) because of unsuitable LB (n=4) or LSM (n=2). Stiffness values ranged from 2.8 to 69.1 kPa (median, 7.8 kPa). LSM was correlated to both fibrosis (Spearman's rho= 0.84, P < .0001) and histological (0.79, P < .0001) stages. These correlations were still found when PBC and PSC patients were analyzed separately. Areas under ROC curves were 0.92 for fibrosis stage (F) > or =2, 0.95 for F > or =3 and 0.96 for F=4. Optimal stiffness cutoff values of 7.3, 9.8, and 17.3 kPa showed F > or =2, F > or =3 and F=4, respectively. LSM and serum hyaluronic acid level were independent parameters associated with extensive fibrosis on LB. In conclusion, transient elastography is a simple and reliable noninvasive means for assessing biliary fibrosis. It should be a promising tool to assess antifibrotic therapies in PBC or PSC."

CD010542,0,17763808,0,[Diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis].,"Liver biopsy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of liver diseases, despite its limitations, such as sampling error and its invasive nature. Given the increasing prevalence ofhepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, new non-invasive methods are being developed as a substitute for liver biopsy. Transient elastography (Fibroscan), which measures the stiffness of the liver by means of ultrasound as a measure of fibrosis and cirrhosis, is simple to perform and the inter- and intra-observer variability is small. The accuracy, in relation to liver biopsy, is high in discriminating between cirrhosis and fibrosis, but lower for discriminating between the different stages offibrosis. The Fibrotest is the most investigated combination of serum markers for fibrosis. Its accuracy is lower than that ofa liver biopsy. In the years to come, more research by various independent research groups is needed with the Fibroscan method and the combination of serum markers in different groups of patients and with standardised cut-off points; these must be compared with liver biopsies of sufficient length. In this way, the value of these non-invasive methods can be evaluated. A possible future role for serum markers is to combine them with the Fibroscan, whereby a discrepancy between the different tests could be an indication for a liver biopsy."
CD010542,0,21517974,0,Non-invasive assessment of fibrosis in liver grafts due to hepatitis C virus recurrence.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become the most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States and Europe. Recurrence of HCV is universal in all liver graft recipients, but the natural history of the disease is variable with some patients displaying slowly progressive liver injury, while approximately 30% become cirrhotic within five yr of surgery. Currently, liver biopsy is the reference standard to assess liver injury in the post-transplant setting. But biopsy is associated with complications such as bleeding and pain, as well as the risk of sampling error and discordance in reporting between histopathologists. Thus, as in the pre-transplant setting, there is increasing attention being drawn to the use of non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis. This review examines the role of non-invasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis in the post-transplant setting including simple tests such as aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, the Benlloch formula, London Transplant Centre score, and finally transient elastography. The authors assess the respective advantages and disadvantages of the tests and consider how non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis can be utilized in the future management of post-transplant HCV infection."

However, there is limited previous in vivo research on the correlation between spleen stiffness and stages of liver fibrosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of spleen stiffness measurement (SSM), using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) technology, for liver fibrosis assessment. Eligible patients with chronic hepatitis B or C (n = 163) underwent concurrent liver stiffness measurement (LSM), SSM and percutaneous liver biopsy. Receiver operating characteristic curves estimated the diagnostic performance of SSM, with multiple linear regression models for LSM and SSM determining the significance of explanatory factors. Results indicated significant correlation between LSM and SSM (R(2) = 0.574, P < 0.0001). Using SSM to classify METAVIR fibrosis (METAVIR F) scores, the areas under curves were 0.839 (95% CI: 0.780-0.898) for METAVIR F1 vs F2-4, 0.936 (95% CI: 0.898-0.975) for F1-2 vs F3-4 and 0.932 (95% CI: 0.893-0.971) for F1-3 vs F4, all P < 0.001.

Various techniques are already in routine use, such as grey-scale imaging, Doppler US, and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), while newer techniques such as elastography and hepatic vein transit time (HVTT) have the potential to exclude patients without significant fibrosis or cirrhosis; however, they are operator dependent and require specific software. Grey-scale imaging may demonstrate changes, such as volume redistribution, capsule nodularity, parenchymal nodularity, and echotexture changes. The Doppler findings in the hepatic and portal veins, hepatic artery, and varices allow assessment of liver cirrhosis. However, the operator needs to be aware of limitations of these techniques. Low mechanical index CEUS plays an important role in the assessment of complications of cirrhosis, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein thrombus.

The device evaluates LF by measurement of liver stiffness (LS). 525 patients with chronic HCV infection and 105 patients with chronic HBV infection were included in the study. These patients were investigated at the Georgian-French joint hepatology clinic ""Hepa"" from November 2007, till November 2008. Among investigated HBV infected 105 patients 65 (61.9%) had no fibrosis (LS<5.5 kpa), 23 (21.9%) had mild fibrosis (LS-5.5-8.0 kpa), 9 (8.6%) had severe fibrosis (LS-8.0-14.0 kpa) and 8 (7.6%) had liver cirrhosis (LS>14.0 kpa). Among investigated HCV infected 525 patients 200 (38.1%) had no fibrosis (LS<5.5 kpa), 139 (26.5%) patients had mild fibrosis (LS-5.5-8.0 kpa), 87 (16.5%) patients had severe fibrosis (LS-8.0-14.0 kpa) and 99 (18.9%) patients had liver cirrhosis. It is concluded that transient elastography (TE) using Fibroscan is simple, non-invasive, reliable and easily reproducible method for assessing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection. TE is characterized with an excellent accuracy. TE results are well correlated with the clinical signs as well as with the results of laboratory and instrumental investigations. Fibrosis stages by Metavir measured using Fibroscan well corresponds with the liver biopsy results. Considering the high prevalence of fibrosis and cirrhosis among patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection, TE is a very valuable method for detecting early stages of fibrosis allowing to avoid the progression of liver damage, as well as end-stage liver disease.

The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate the long-term effect of successful antiviral treatment, using LSM, in HCV-infected patients with inherited bleeding disorders. The LSM were performed in 2005 (LSM 1) and 2009 (LSM 2) in 39 patients who were successfully treated for HCV. The change in liver fibrosis between LSM 1 and 2 was assessed.

Although progression to cirrhosis is accelerated and occurs more frequently in patients who acquire the infection in old age, this outcome is often not seen because most elderly infected patients acquired HCV when they were young. Data on progression of HCV infection to cirrhosis and eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma are often derived from studies of HCV-infected individuals who present or are referred to hospitals, and which are therefore likely to overestimate the seriousness of the disease; indeed, population-based studies indicate that in many elderly individuals the disease is asymptomatic and runs a fairly benign course. Treatment is based on use of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin, and is overall less effective and more toxic in the elderly. Therefore, treatment should be carefully considered on an individual basis and proposed only in patients up to the age of 75 years with a significant risk of progression of liver disease, no serious co-morbidities and good life expectancy. All treated patients should be followed long term in order to assess the influence of therapy on the evolution of liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) and survival. It is hoped that liver biopsy, which is still required in order to assess prognosis appropriately, will be replaced in the future by less invasive methods based on combinations of biochemical markers of fibrosis and/or transient elastography, and that newer and less toxic orally administered drugs for HCV infection will become available."

The resulting increase in the number of patients with NAFLD is expected to translate into increased numbers of patients with liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this context, it is particularly important to identify patients at risk for progressive chronic liver disease. Currently, liver biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to establish the presence and stage of fibrosis. Due to the remarkable increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and the concomitant efforts in developing novel therapies for patients with NASH, non-invasive, simple, reproducible, and reliable non-invasive methodologies are needed.

The current gold standard, liver biopsy, cannot be used for population-based screening, and has well known drawbacks if used for monitoring of disease progression or treatment success. Our objective was to assess performance and promise of radiologic modalities and techniques as alternative, noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis. A systematic review was conducted. Six hundred twenty-eight studies were identified via electronic search. One hundred fifty-three papers were reviewed. Most described techniques that could differentiate between cirrhosis or severe fibrosis and normal liver. Accurate staging of fibrosis or diagnosis of mild fibrosis was often not achievable. Ultrasonography is the most common modality used in the diagnosis and staging of hepatic fibrosis. Elastographic measurements, either ultrasonography-based or magnetic resonance-based, and magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging, show the most promise for accurate staging of hepatic fibrosis.

CD010542,0,19254351,0,Transient elastography and other noninvasive tests to assess hepatic fibrosis in patients with viral hepatitis.,"The limitations of liver biopsy (invasive procedure, sampling errors, inter-observer variability and nondynamic fibrosis evaluation) have stimulated the search for noninvasive approaches for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with viral hepatitis. A variety of methods including the measurement of liver stiffness, using transient elastography, and serum markers, ranging from routine laboratory tests to more complex algorithms or indices combining the results of panels of markers, have been proposed. Among serum indices, Fibrotest has been the most extensively studied and validated. Transient elastography appears as a promising method but has been mostly validated in chronic hepatitis C with performance equivalent to that of serum markers for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis. The combination of both approaches as first-line assessment of liver fibrosis could avoid the performance of liver biopsy in the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis C, a strategy that deserves further evaluation in patients with hepatitis B or HIV-HCV coinfection. Transient elastography also appears to be an excellent tool for early detection of cirrhosis and may have prognostic value in this setting. Guidelines are now awaited for the use of noninvasive methods in clinical practice."

Pretransplantation work-up revealed protein S deficiency. Results of liver function tests were normal. Upper endoscopy showed grade II to III EV in the upper and middle segments of the esophagus. Computed tomography demonstrated thrombosis of the jugular, subclavian, and SVC veins and marked collateral vessels in the chest. Transient elastography yielded normal findings. A liver biopsy specimen showed a normal aspect of the liver, without fibrosis or liver cirrhosis. Presence of EV in a patient with chronic intestinal insufficiency may be related to collateral venous circulation associated with SVC thrombosis in the absence of portal hypertension. In this situation, an isolated intestinal graft is indicated."

CD010542,0,20455345,0,Diagnosis of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Liver biopsy is not always necessary.,"Needle biopsy of the liver is considered the ""gold-standard"" for diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, it is not risk-free, lacks accuracy, and is poorly accepted by some patients. This review examines available literature on the use and diagnostic performance of non-invasive methods for assessment of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in adults, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. Transient elastography (FibroScan) measures liver stiffness in kilopascals. The results are less reliable in patients with a thick chest wall, hepatic congestion of cardiac origin, and acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Transient elastography has been evaluated in more than 8000 patients, most of whom had chronic hepatitis C. With a cutoff value of about 7-8 kPa, elastography identified about 70% of patients with histological signs of moderate to severe fibrosis. With a cutoff of 14-15 kPa, it identified about 85% of patients with histological signs of cirrhosis. Transient elastography is reliable in detecting moderate to severe fibrosis and cirrhosis and in ruling out cirrhosis, but is less reliable in ruling out moderate fibrosis. Composite scores based on blood assay values and complex calculations are unreliable when at least one of the score components is influenced by intercurrent conditions. FibroTest, FibroMeter and Hepascore have been tested in several thousand patients with chronic hepatitis C. With the manufacturers' recommended cutoff values, FibroTest identifies about 70% of patients with histological signs of moderate to severe fibrosis and about 90% of patients with histological signs of cirrhosis. It can reliably diagnose or rule out moderate fibrosis, and diagnose cirrhosis. It is also very reliable in ruling out cirrhosis. Hepascore has similar diagnostic performance. FibroMeter has been less extensively evaluated but also seems to have diagnostic performance similar to that of FibroTest. Some studies suggest that FibroTest has similar accuracy in forms of liver fibrosis other than chronic hepatitis C. In practice, the main issue involved in making therapeutic decisions in patients with chronic hepatitis C is the risk-benefit balance of available treatments rather than precise diagnosis of fibrosis."
CD010542,0,21497746,0,Invasive and non-invasive methods for the assessment of fibrosis and disease progression in chronic liver disease.,"Chronic liver diseases represent a major public health problem, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Their prognosis and management greatly depend on the amount and progression of liver fibrosis with the risk of developing cirrhosis. Liver biopsy, traditionally considered as the reference standard for staging of fibrosis, has been challenged over the past decade by the development of novel non invasive methodologies. These methods rely on two distinct but complementary approaches: i) a 'biological' approach based on the dosage of serum biomarkers of fibrosis; ii) a 'physical' approach based on the measurement of liver stiffness using transient elastography (TE). Non invasive methods have been initially studied and validated in chronic hepatitis C but are now increasingly used in other chronic liver diseases, resulting in a significant decrease in the need for liver biopsy. However, they will likely not completely abolish the need for liver biopsy and they should rather be employed as an integrated system with liver biopsy. This review is aimed at discussing the advantages and inconveniences of non invasive methods in comparison with liver biopsy for the management of patients with chronic liver diseases."

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) as a predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development among patients with chronic hepatitis C. Between December 2004 and June 2005, a total of 984 HCV-RNA positive patients, without HCC or a past history of it, visited the University of Tokyo Hospital. LSM was performed successfully in 866 patients, who gave informed consent. During the follow-up period (mean, 3.0 years), HCC developed in 77 patients (2.9% per 1 person-year). The cumulative incidence rates of HCC at 1, 2, and 3 years were 2.4%, 6.0%, and 8.9%, respectively. Adjusting for other significant factors for HCC development, patients with higher LSM were revealed to be at a significantly higher risk, with a hazard ratio, as compared to LSM < or =10 kPa, of 16.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.71-75.2; P < 0.001) when LSM 10.1-15 kPa, 20.9 (95% CI, 4.43-98.8; P < 0.001) when LSM 15.1-20 kPa, 25.6 (95%CI, 5.21-126.1; P < 0.001) when LSM 20.1-25 kPa, and 45.5 (95% CI, 9.75-212.3; P < 0.001) when LSM >25 kPa."
CD010542,0,20206870,0,HCV carriers with normal alanine aminotransferase levels: healthy persons or severely ill patients? Dealing with an everyday clinical problem.,"Approximately 30% of patients with chronic HCV infection show persistently normal ALT levels. Although formerly referred to as 'healthy' or 'asymptomatic' HCV carriers, and thus historically excluded from antiviral treatment, it has now become clear that the majority of these patients have some degree of histological liver damage that may be significant in up to 20% of patients and might progress toward a more severe degree of liver fibrosis. A significant proportion of patients (> or =20%) experience periods of increased serum ALT (flare) associated with enhanced disease progression. However, controversies still exist in clinical practice regarding the definition of 'persistent' ALT normality, the virological and histological features of these subjects, the need for liver biopsy, the role of non invasive tools for the assessment of liver fibrosis (transient hepatic elastography, fibroscan), and the natural history and optimal management of chronic hepatitis C with normal ALT. The advent of new therapeutic options (pegylated interferons plus ribavirin) has shifted treatment targets toward eradication of underlying infection, with therapy decision based on age, severity of disease and likelihood of response rather than on aminotransferase levels. This review does approach the main unresolved issues on this topic in the form of a dialog between a hepatologist and a patient with HCV infection but normal alanine aminotransferase levels, trying to give evidence-based answers to the more frequently asked questions from patients and their physicians."
CD010542,0,14698338,0,Transient elastography: a new noninvasive method for assessment of hepatic fibrosis.,"Chronic hepatitis is accompanied by progressive deposit of hepatic fibrosis, which may lead to cirrhosis. Evaluation of liver fibrosis is, thus, of great clinical interest and, up to now, has been assessed with liver biopsy. This work aims to evaluate a new noninvasive device to quantify liver fibrosis: the shear elasticity probe or fibroscan. This device is based on one-dimensional (1-D) transient elastography, a technique that uses both ultrasound (US) (5 MHz) and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic waves, whose propagation velocity is directly related to elasticity. The intra- and interoperator reproducibility of the technique, as well as its ability to quantify liver fibrosis, were evaluated in 106 patients with chronic hepatitis C. Liver elasticity measurements were reproducible (standardized coefficient of variation: 3%), operator-independent and well correlated (partial correlation coefficient = 0.71, p < < 0.0001) to fibrosis grade (METAVIR). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.88 and 0.99 for the diagnosis of patients with significant fibrosis (>/= F2) and with cirrhosis ( = F4), respectively. The Fibroscan is a noninvasive, painless, rapid and objective method to quantify liver fibrosis."

Unfortunately, liver biopsy, an invasive and painful technique with several limitations, continues to be the gold standard for the staging and grading of fibrosis. Therefore, accurate noninvasive tests for liver injury are urgently needed. During the last years, transient elastography (Fibroscan®) has been proposed for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, by measuring liver stiffness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness, objectivity and safety of this technique. We included 68 patients who underwent a liver biopsy in the last 18 months with a wide spectrum of chronic liver diseases. All procedures as well as the liver biopsies according to the METAVIR scoring system were analyzed by the same sonographer and the same specialist in pathology, respectively. Median value of stiffness with none or mild fibrosis (F0 and FI), and severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3 and F4) was 6.8 ± 3.0 kPa and 21.0 ± 15.1 kPa, respectively, with a significant difference between them (p < 0.01). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed the optimal liver stiffness cut-off values for each group. We found also a positive correlation between liver stiffness found by transient elastography and fibrosis stage on biopsy in all patients, independently of the liver disease etiology. Fibroscan® is an easy, quick to perform and safe non-invasive method, reliable for assessing liver fibrosis."

CD010542,0,22140010,0,Ultrasound-based transient elastography for the detection of hepatic fibrosis in patients with recurrent hepatitis C virus after liver transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Ultrasound-based transient elastography (TE) is a promising noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for the detection of hepatic fibrosis due to recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) after liver transplantation (LT). However, its overall test performance in various settings remains unknown. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis of studies comparing ultrasound-based TE to liver biopsy for the detection of hepatic fibrosis due to a recurrent HCV infection after LT. Electronic and manual bibliographic searches (including scientific abstracts) were performed to identify potential studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to generate pooled estimates of the sensitivity values, specificity values, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios of individual studies. The extent of the heterogeneity and the reasons for it were assessed. Six fully published studies were identified for analysis. Five studies that evaluated significant fibrosis were identified. Among these studies, the pooled estimates were 83% for sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI) = 77%-88%], 83% for specificity (95% CI = 77%-88%), 4.95 for the positive likelihood ratio (95% CI = 3.4-7.2), 0.17 for the negative likelihood ratio (95% CI = 0.09-0.35), and 30.5 for the diagnostic odds ratio (95% CI = 12.8-72.4). For the 5 studies that assessed cirrhosis, the pooled estimates were 98% for sensitivity (95% CI = 90%-100%), 84% for specificity (95% CI = 80%-88%), 7 for the positive likelihood ratio (95% CI = 2.8-17.3), 0.06 for the negative likelihood ratio (95% CI = 0.02-0.19), and 130 for the diagnostic odds ratio (95% CI = 36.5-462.1). A diagnostic threshold (or cutoff value) bias was identified as an important cause of heterogeneity for the pooled results of both patient groups. In conclusion, ultrasound-based TE has excellent diagnostic accuracy for identifying cirrhosis due to a recurrent HCV infection after LT. The detection of significant fibrosis is more accurate for these patients versus patients whose native liver is chronically infected with HCV."

Frequent liver biopsies are essential to follow-up hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced liver damage. However, liver biopsy is an invasive and expensive procedure. We evaluated prospectively the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive measurement of liver stiffness (by transient elastography) to assess the severity of hepatitis C recurrence after LT. For this purpose, we included 124 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who underwent 169 liver biopsies and 129 hepatic hemodynamic studies with determination of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). Simultaneously, patients underwent measurement of liver stiffness. Liver fibrosis was mild (F0-F1) in 96 cases (57%) and significant (F2-F4) in 73 (43%). HVPG was normal (<6 mm Hg) in 69 cases (54%) and elevated (>or=6 mm Hg) in 60 (46%). Using a liver stiffness cutoff value of 8.5 kilopascals, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for diagnosis of fibrosis >or=F2 were 90%, 81%, 79%, and 92%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosis of fibrosis >or=F2, >or=F3 and F4 were 0.90, 0.93, and 0.98, respectively. There was a close direct correlation between liver stiffness and HVPG (Pearson coefficient, 0.84; P < 0.001) and the AUC for diagnosis of portal hypertension (HVPG >or=6 mm Hg) was 0.93. Importantly, none of the individuals with liver stiffness below the cutoff value had either bridging fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) or significant portal hypertension (HVPG >or=10 mm Hg).

Liver biopsy was performed in 125 patients. The range of normal values for LSM, defined by 5th and 95th percentile values in healthy subjects, was 3.2 and 8.5 kPa, respectively. Healthy subjects with a lower body mass index (BMI; < <18.5 kg/m(2)) had a higher LSM compared with subjects who had a normal BMI; this LSM value was comparable to that of obese subjects (6.05 ± 1.78 versus 5.51 ± 1.59 and 6.60 ± 1.21, P = 0.016 and 0.349, respectively). Liver disease patients without histologic fibrosis had significantly higher LSM values compared with healthy subjects (7.52 ± 5.49 versus 5.63 ± 1.64, P < 0.001). Among the histologic variables, stage of fibrosis was the only predictor for LSM. LSM did not correlate with inflammatory activity and ALT in both NAFLD and chronic hepatitis groups."
CD010542,0,22271046,0,Noninvasive elastography-based assessment of liver fibrosis progression and prognosis in primary biliary cirrhosis.,"The development of liver fibrosis markers in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is needed to facilitate the assessment of its progression and the effectiveness of new therapies. Here, we investigated the potential usefulness of transient elastography (TE) in the noninvasive evaluation of liver fibrosis stage and disease progression in PBC. We performed, first, a prospective performance analysis of TE for the diagnosis of METAVIR fibrosis stages in a diagnostic cohort of 103 patients and, second, a retrospective longitudinal analysis of repeated examinations in a monitoring cohort of 150 patients followed-up for up to 5 years. All patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. Diagnostic thresholds of liver stiffness in discriminating fibrosis stages ≥ F1, ≥ F2, ≥ F3, and =F4 were 7.1, 8.8, 10.7, and 16.9 kPa, respectively. TE showed high performance and was significantly superior to biochemical markers (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/platelet ratio, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and Mayo score) in diagnosing significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, or cirrhosis. Analysis of the monitoring cohort data set using generalized linear models showed the following: (1) an overall progression rate of 0.48 ± 0.21 kPa/year (P = 0.02) and (2) no significant progression in patients with F0-F1, F2, or F3 stages, but a significant increase (4.06 ± 0.72 kPa/year; P < 0.0001) in cirrhotic patients. A cut-off value of 2.1 kPa/year was associated with an 8.4-fold increased risk of liver decompensations, liver transplantations, or deaths (P < 0.0001, Cox regression analysis)."

CD010542,0,21670074,0,Diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography (FibroScan) versus the aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index in assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B: the role in primary care setting.,A non-invasive method to assess liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness with transient elastography (TE) has been recently introduced. The role of TE among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in starting antiviral therapy in the primary care setting is still controversial because of its high cost. The AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) could be a much cheaper alternative.
CD010542,0,19709363,0,An evaluation of transient elastography in the discrimination of HBeAg-negative disease from inactive hepatitis B carriers.,"Liver biopsy is frequently required in HBeAg-negative disease to determine the stage of fibrosis. It can be difficult to distinguish cohorts with undetectable HBeAg who may have varying degrees of fibrosis due to different stages of disease. We have assessed the utility of transient elastography (TE) to evaluate differences in HBeAg-negative patients. A total of 220 HBsAg-positive individuals were studied: 125 (group 1) had an inactive HBsAg carrier state and 95 (group 2) were HBeAg-negative, anti-HBe-positive patients with persistently or intermittent elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or HBV DNA >10(5) copies/mL. Mean stiffness was 4.83 +/- 1.2 kPa in group 1 vs 8.53 +/- 6 kPa in group 2 (P < 0.001); statistically significant differences were also found between AST/ULN ALT/ULN ratios, HBV DNA in group 1 vs group 2, respectively (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the only variable independently associated with the stage of fibrosis was the stiffness. This study shows that mean hepatic stiffness by elastography is significantly lower in patients with inactive hepatitis B compared to those with HBeAg-negative disease. The procedure is a useful adjunct to diagnosis to confirm a clinical pattern of disease, and for more selective use of liver biopsy before considering antiviral therapy."

Peripheral blood fibrocytes (PBF) are considered to be involved in systemic fibrogenic processes. We measured the level of PBF in patients with chronic hepatitis C by enrolling 70 patients affected with chronic hepatitis C, 20 patients with HCV-positive decompensated cirrhosis and 30 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent liver biopsy and Fibroscan for fibrosis assessment. Patients with chronic hepatitis C had significantly higher levels of PBF in comparison with healthy individuals and decompensated cirrhotics. Patients in the F0-F1 stage had a percentage of PBF of 23.3+/-4%, significantly lower (p<0.001) than in F2 and F3 stages. Patients in the F4 stage had a PBF rate of 50.6+/-2% (p<0.001 versus the F0, F1 and F2 stages). The percentage of PBF correlated positively with the Metavir score and the liver stiffness as measured by Fibroscan. PBF are increased in patients with HCV infection and correlate with the histological stage of liver fibrosis."
CD010542,0,21039302,0,Meta-analysis: natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests for liver disease severity.,"BACKGROUND. NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis (SS) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The natural history of NAFLD and the optimal strategy to identify subjects with progressive liver disease are unclear. Objectives. To assess the evidence in: (1) natural history of NAFLD; and (2) non-invasive methods to differentiate NAFLD histological subtypes. DESIGN AND SETTING. Among 4185 articles published on MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Pubmed, national and International meeting abstracts through July 2010, 40 articles assessing the natural history of NAFLD and 32 articles evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests against liver biopsy (LB) were included. MEASUREMENTS. Two reviewers retrieved articles and evaluated study quality by appropriate scores. Main outcomes were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models. RESULTS. NAFLD has an increased overall mortality (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.18-2.10), deriving from liver-related and cardiovascular disease, and a 2-fold risk of diabetes. Compared to SS, NASH has a higher liver-related (OR for NASH: 5.71, 2.31-14.13; OR for NASH with advanced fibrosis: 10.06, 4.35-23.25), but not cardiovascular mortality (OR: 0.91, 0.42-1.98). Three non-invasive methods received independent validation: pooled AUROC, sensitivity and specificity of cytokeratin-18 for NASH are 0.82 (0.78-0.88), 0.78 (0.64-0.92), 0.87 (0.77-0.98). For NASH with advanced fibrosis, pooled AUROC, sensitivity and specificity of NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibroscan are 0.85 (0.80-0.93), 0.90 (0.82-0.99), 0.97 (0.94-0.99) and 0.94 (0.90-0.99), 0.94 (0.88-0.99) and 0.95 (0.89-0.99). CONCLUSIONS. NAFLD warrants screening for cardio-metabolic risk and for progressive liver disease. The combination of three noninvasive tests with LB may optimally individuate patients with NASH, with or without advanced fibrosis."

CD010542,0,22893866,0,Clinical applications of transient elastography.,"Chronic liver disease represents a major public health problem, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. As prognosis and management depend mainly on the amount and progression of liver fibrosis, accurate quantification of liver fibrosis is essential for therapeutic decision-making and follow-up of chronic liver diseases. Even though liver biopsy is the gold standard for evaluation of liver fibrosis, non-invasive methods that could substitute for invasive procedures have been investigated during past decades. Transient elastography (TE, FibroScan®) is a novel non-invasive method for assessment of liver fibrosis with chronic liver disease. TE can be performed in the outpatient clinic with immediate results and excellent reproducibility. Its diagnostic accuracy for assessment of liver fibrosis has been demonstrated in patients with chronic viral hepatitis; as a result, unnecessary liver biopsy could be avoided in some patients. Moreover, due to its excellent patient acceptance, TE could be used for monitoring disease progression or predicting development of liver-related complications. This review aims at discussing the usefulness of TE in clinical practice."

CD010542,0,19959511,0,MR imaging of liver fibrosis: current state of the art.,"Chronic liver disease is a major public health problem worldwide. Liver fibrosis, a common feature of almost all causes of chronic liver disease, involves the accumulation of collagen, proteoglycans, and other macromolecules within the extracellular matrix. Fibrosis tends to progress, leading to hepatic dysfunction, portal hypertension, and ultimately cirrhosis. Liver biopsy, the standard of reference for diagnosing liver fibrosis, is invasive, costly, and subject to complications and sampling variability. These limitations make it unsuitable for diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring in the general population. Thus, development of a noninvasive, accurate, and reproducible test for diagnosis and monitoring of liver fibrosis would be of great value. Conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques have limited capability to demonstrate liver fibrosis. In clinical practice, imaging studies are usually reserved for evaluation of the presence of portal hypertension or hepatocellular carcinoma in cases that have progressed to cirrhosis. In response to the rising prevalence of chronic liver diseases in Western nations, a number of imaging-based methods including ultrasonography-based transient elastography, computed tomography-based texture analysis, and diverse magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based techniques have been proposed for noninvasive diagnosis and grading of hepatic fibrosis across its entire spectrum of severity. State-of-the-art MR imaging-based techniques in current practice and in development for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis include conventional contrast material-enhanced MR imaging, double contrast-enhanced MR imaging, MR elastography, diffusion-weighted imaging, and MR perfusion imaging."

In recent years, many studies and great interest have been dedicated to the development of non-invasive tests to substitute a liver biopsy for fibrosis assessment and follow up. Advances in serological and radiological tests such as serum marker panels, transient elastography and their combinations can assess fibrosis accurately and reduce the need for a liver biopsy. But at present, all have failed to completely replace a liver biopsy because of their respective limitations and an imperfect gold standard used in current researches. The searching for an ideal surrogate is still in progress."
CD010542,0,21129129,0,Impact of liver steatosis on the correlation between liver stiffness and fibrosis measured by transient elastography in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus.,"We assessed the effect of different hepatic conditions such as fibrosis, steatosis and necroinflammatory activity on liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. We studied all consecutive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who underwent liver biopsy and elastography between January 2007 and December 2008. Liver fibrosis was staged following METAVIR Cooperative Study Group criteria. Steatosis was categorized according to the percentage of affected hepatocytes as low (≤10%), moderate (<25%) and severe (≥25%). A total of 110 patients were included. Fibrosis was distributed by stage as follows: F0, n = 13; F1, n = 47; F2, n = 29; F3, n = 18; and F4, n = 3. Liver biopsy revealed the presence of hepatic steatosis in 68 patients (low to moderate, n = 53; and severe n = 15). By univariate regression analysis, fibrosis, necroinflammatory activity, and the degree of steatosis were correlated with liver stiffness. However, in a multiple regression analysis, steatosis and fibrosis were the only independent variables significantly associated with liver stiffness. With a cut-off of 9.5 kPa to distinguish patients with F ≤ 2 from F ≥ 3, elastography led to a significantly higher number of misclassification errors (25%vs 5%; P = 0.014), most of which were false positives for F ≥ 3. Our study suggests that the correlation between liver stiffness and fibrosis as estimated by transient elastography may be affected by the presence of hepatic steatosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."

Cumulative antiretroviral therapy (ART) use was calculated and a statistical analysis performed to compare exposure to the rest of the clinic cohort for the same time period. Where available, data was collated on FibroScan®, echocardiography and coagulation profile. Seventeen patients were identified. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common presenting feature. Liver biopsy showed mild portal or periportal fibrosis in 13 (81%) and four with features of nodular regenerative hyperplasia. There was significantly greater exposure to ddl in this group (59.5 months) compared to the rest of the HIV cohort (21.1 months) P = <0.001. Eleven subjects has a liver elastography performed, six (55%) had a result greater than 9.6 kPa (consistent with greater than F2 disease by Metavir scoring). Echocardiography was performed in seven patients: four met criteria for pulmonary hypertension. This is consistent with other cohorts demonstrating an association between the didanosine exposure and NCPH. Our data also suggest an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension."

Two-hundred fifty-four consecutive patients had liver stiffness measurements and liver biopsy of at least 15 mm. Discordances of at least two stages between transient elastography and histological assessment were observed in 28 cases (11%). Factors of discordance were assessed by comparing the 28 misclassified cases with the 226 others. In multivariate analysis, fibrosis stage (F0-F2 versus F3-F4) and the ratio interquartile range/median value of liver stiffness measurement (IQR/M) were associated with discordances (P <or= 0.05). The most significantly discriminant cutoff value was 0.21. For IQR/M < 0.21 versus IQR/M >or= 0.21, discordances of at least two stages of fibrosis were respectively observed in 10 of 135 cases (7.4%) versus 18 of 119 cases (15.1%) (P <or= 0.05). In patients with IQR/M >or= 0.21 versus IQR/M < 0.21, for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis F >or= 2, F >or= 3, F = 4, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) were 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.89) versus 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-0.90), (P = NS); 0.80 (95% CI, 0.72-0.88) versus 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.95) (P = 0.04); and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77-0.94) versus 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99) (P = NS).

CD010542,0,20969464,0,Noncirrhotic portal hypertension in HIV-infected patients: a case control evaluation and review of the literature.,"Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) is an infrequent but possibly underestimated cryptogenetic liver disease recently described in small series of HIV-infected patients. The exposure to antiretroviral drugs, a direct role of HIV itself, microbial translocation from the gut, or a thrombophilic propensity have been suggested as possible pathogenic mechanisms. In this case control study, we describe 11 HIV-infected patients with idiopathic NCPH and compare the activity of protein C and S, and soluble CD14 levels (a surrogate marker of the translocation of intestinal bacterial products) with 10 age- and gender-matched HIV-infected controls with no liver disease. The clinical presentation of the 11 patients with NCPH was characterised by acute variceal bleeding (2/11), ascites (2/11), portal thrombosis (2/11), and ultrasonographic and endoscopic signs of portal hypertension (11/11), with slightly high alanine transaminase (ALT) and γglutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) levels. The FibroScan median liver stiffness was 8.1 kPa, which is inconsistent with significant fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia was diagnosed in the 5 patients who underwent liver biopsy. The NCPH patients showed no impairment of hepatic synthesis, but had lower serum albumin levels and a higher international normalized ratio (INR) than the controls (p = 0.01), and lower protein C and S activity, although within the normal range (p = 0.02 and 0.3, respectively). No significant difference in soluble CD14 was seen between the two groups. In conclusion, the etiology of NCHP is not still established, but in order to prevent the dramatic complications of portal hypertension, all HIV-infected patients with unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities or thrombocytopenia should be considered for further investigations by means of thrombophilic screening, Doppler ultrasound evaluation, and in the presence of portal hypertension, endoscopy and liver biopsy."

The role of TE in patients with beta-thalassemia has not been extensively investigated. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of TE in the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in 115 adult patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) (#59) or intermedia (TI) (#56). TE was performed according to current practice. Histologic data were obtained in 14 cases. Liver iron concentration was assessed by atomic absorption spectrometry and T2 magnetic resonance. In patients with TM, the proportion of anti-HCV positive viremic patients, median serum ferritin levels, and TE values were significantly higher than in TI. In the group of 14 patients who underwent liver biopsy, a significant positive correlation was observed between liver stiffness and fibrosis stage (r = 0.73, P = 0.003). Severe fibrosis is diagnosed with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 89%, whereas cirrhosis is detected with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92%. At multivariate analysis, the variables independently associated with TE were ALT, GGT, and bilirubin levels in both groups and, in patients with TM, HCV RNA positivity. In beta-thalassemia patients, TE is a reliable tool for assessing liver fibrosis even if the influence of iron overload has to be clarified."
CD010542,0,19195629,0,Non-invasive diagnosis of steatosis and fibrosis.,"The prognosis and management of liver disease greatly depends on the amount of liver fibrosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is emerging as a major cause of liver disease in Western countries because of the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. A key issue in patients with NAFLD is the differentiation of NASH from simple steatosis. It is particularly important to identify NASH patients as they are at greatest risk of developing complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The limitations of liver biopsy (invasive procedure, sampling errors, interobserver variability and non-dynamic fibrosis evaluation) have stimulated the search for non-invasive approaches for the assessment of steatosis and liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A variety of methods, including serum markers, imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT, MRI and measurement of liver stiffness by transient elastography, have been proposed for the non-invasive assessment of steatosis and hepatic fibrosis. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of these different methods in clinical practice."

CD010542,0,21344353,0,Assessment of fibrosis and cirrhosis in liver biopsies: an update.,"The liver biopsy specimen represents valuable material for the assessment of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Despite limitations related to sampling and interpretation, histologic examination remains the gold standard for staging chronic liver diseases. Hepatic fibrosis is currently viewed as a dynamic process that may often regress after successful treatment of chronic liver diseases. Even the excess fibrous tissue of cirrhotic livers may sometimes regress over time. Distinguishing between the amount of hepatic fibrosis and the disease stage is important for the assessment of the effects of antifibrotic treatments. Recent studies suggest that the proportion of the liver biopsy specimen occupied by collagen is correlated with the hepatic venous pressure gradient in liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C virus infection, with or without cirrhosis, and represents a predictor of clinical decompensation. This parameter has also been found to correlate with liver stiffness measurements of patients with chronic viral hepatitis obtained by transient elastography. Therefore, quantitative assessment of hepatic fibrosis in liver biopsy specimens holds promise as a prognostic marker, and as a means to validate noninvasive markers of fibrosis."

The tendency to substitute histopathological analysis of liver biopsies with complex, surrogate 'noninvasive' measures of disease progression has grown to such a level that clarification and guidance on their use is needed. This Review provides an overview of the proposed noninvasive diagnostic methodologies and their possible integration with the standard invasive procedures used for the evaluation of disease progression (i.e. liver biopsy and the measurement of portal pressure). A concise analysis of what has been proposed for the differentiation of simple fatty liver from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and its possible fibrogenic evolution is also included. In particular, the Review focuses on the methods easily available as part of daily clinical practice in hepatology--biochemical markers and transient elastography (i.e. liver stiffness measurement)."
CD010542,0,18818788,0,Comparison of liver biopsy and transient elastography based on clinical relevance.,Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography has recently been validated for the evaluation of liver fibrosis in chronic liver diseases.

CD010542,0,18494155,0,[The liver and methotrexate].,"Methotrexate is proposed for the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. The liver toxicity of methotrexate has been investigated and prolonged treatment can induce liver fibrosis. Moreover, alcohol consumption, diabetes and obesity are associated with liver fibrosis in patients treated with this drug. Therefore, liver fibrosis associated with methotrexate could be due to associated factors instead of methotrexate itself. Recommendations to monitor and diagnose methotrexate induced liver damage vary depending on the disease. Frequent evaluation of liver fibrosis with liver biopsy is recommended during therapy, especially in patients treated for psoriasis. Noninvasive methods, such as the FibroScan, could be useful for the assessment of liver fibrosis associated with methotrexate and hence, need further evaluation."

CD010542,0,21435119,0,Previously unrecognized advanced liver disease unveiled by transient elastography in patients with Haemophilia and chronic hepatitis C.,"Before the introduction of viral inactivation procedures and viral screening of plasma-products, haemophiliacs were at high risk of infection with HCV. Those who acquired HCV infection in the 1980s, and are still alive today, may have developed significant liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, liver biopsy has not routinely been utilized in the evaluation of haemophiliacs with HCV in Denmark. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of significant fibrosis/cirrhosis among haemophiliacs as evaluated by transient elastography (TE). Cross-sectional investigation of adult patients with haemophilia A or B. TE with liver stiffness measurements (LSM) ≥ 8 kPa were repeated after 4-6 weeks. Significant fibrosis and cirrhosis was defined as measurements ≥ 8 kPa or ≥ 12 kPa respectively. Among 307 patients with haemophilia A or B registered at the two Haemophilia centres, 141(46%) participate in this study. Forty (28.4%) had chronic hepatitis C, 33 (23.4%) past hepatitis C and 68 (48.2%) had never been infected, at screening LSM ≥ 8 kPa were found in 45.7%, 24.7% and 4.6% respectively. Among patients with chronic hepatitis C significant fibrosis was confirmed in 17.1% and cirrhosis in 2.9% by repeated LSM ≥ 8 and ≥ 12 kPa respectively. The median TE-value in never HCV-infected haemophiliacs was comparable with what has been found in healthy non-haemophiliacs. In Danish haemophiliacs where liver biopsy has not routinely been used for assessing severity of liver fibrosis, LSM identified advanced liver disease in one-fifth of cases that had not been recognized during clinical follow-up."

The risk allele confers an increased risk for fatty liver disease and elevated serum aminotransferase activities reflecting liver injury. In the current elastography-based study, we investigate variant adiponutrin as genetic determinant of liver fibrosis, the hallmark of all chronic liver diseases."
CD010542,0,22864589,0,Noninvasive acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography for assessing the severity of fibrosis in the post-operative patients with biliary atresia.,"Liver biopsy (LB) is still considered the ""gold standard"" for hepatological evaluation, but recently noninvasive methods have attempted to replace this invasive procedure. Recently, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging has been developed as a noninvasive modality to evaluate the stiffness of tissues. ARFI imaging theoretically measures liver stiffness of all the segments independently. The aim of this study was to determine whether ARFI elastography is a reliable method for predicting the severity of fibrosis in the post-operative patients with biliary atresia."
CD010542,0,21565752,0,[New non-invasive tool for assessment of liver fibrosis: transient elastography].,"Formation of connective tissue causing liver fibrosis is the common trait of chronic liver diseases. The ""gold-standard"" of the evaluation of liver fibrosis is liver biopsy, but it is an invasive, painful procedure, and carries a significant, although small risk of life-threatening complications. It may have contraindications, and it is certainly not the ideal procedure for serially repeated assessment of disease progression. A new, non-invasive method for the assessment of liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness is the transient elastography. The velocity of the propagation of a shear wave is measured by ultrasound. The procedure is painless, rapid, and does not need any preparation. So far, transient elastography has been mostly validated in chronic hepatitis C, but it is applicable in liver diseases with other etiologies. The diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography increases with stage of fibrosis, and is more accurate in advanced fibrosis (F≥2, Metavir score) and in cirrhosis. Indication of antiviral therapy for chronic viral hepatitis B and C are the main field of the application of the transient elastography, and it is also a useful tool for follow-up the disease progression. It is applicable for early, non-invasive detection of graft damage after liver transplantation. Evaluation of liver damage, the stage of liver fibrosis by transient elastography may have an important role in the decision before surgery, or application of potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Histological examination of the liver tissue is not substituted in every case by transient elastography, but liver biopsy is supplanted by measuring liver stiffness for evaluation of liver fibrosis in many cases."

CD010542,0,21157442,0,Mild-to-moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase increases liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography in patients with chronic hepatitis B.,Liver stiffness measurement has been shown to be increased in severe acute flares of hepatitis. Whether lesser degree of hepatitis can also increase liver stiffness is not known. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of mild-to-moderate elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on liver stiffness in chronic hepatitis B.
CD010542,0,19578234,0,A review of the natural history of chronic hepatitis B in the era of transient elastography.,"Understanding the natural history of chronic hepatitis B is important in order to predict the prognosis, to stratify the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and to select appropriate candidates for antiviral treatment. Liver fibrosis is the pathogenic process that leads to liver cirrhosis. The study of liver fibrosis in the past has largely been hampered by the invasive nature of a liver biopsy. Most liver biopsy series represent biased populations with more active disease. Transient elastography is a reliable and non-invasive measurement of liver fibrosis that allows the study of liver fibrosis among patients without clinical indication for liver biopsy. Large studies using transient elastography in patients with predominantly normal alanine aminotransferase levels have been reported recently. The different roles of patient age, hepatitis B virus DNA and alanine aminotransferase levels in the risk stratification for advanced liver fibrosis have been defined in hepatitis B e antigen-positive and hepatitis B e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. The relationship between metabolic syndrome and chronic hepatitis B is also explored. In this review, new insights from studies using transient elastography on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B with special focus on liver fibrosis will be summarized and discussed."
CD010542,0,22671952,0,CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are elevated and display an active phenotype in patients with chronic HCV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection.,"The aim of this study was to examine regulatory T cells (Tregs) in peripheral blood and liver tissue in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infection and in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. In a cross-sectional study were included 51 patients with chronic HCV infection, 24 patients with HIV/HCV co-infection and 24 healthy individuals. CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ Tregs were determined using flow cytometry. Fibrosis was examined by transient elastography. Inflammation, fibrosis and Tregs were determined in liver biopsies from 12 patients. Increased frequency of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ Tregs was found in HIV/HCV co-infected patients [median: 6.4% (IQR: 5.7-6.9) and 1.0% (0.7-1.2), respectively] compared to HCV mono-infected patients [5.6% (4.2-6.3), P = 0.01 and 0.5% (0.3-0.7), P < 0.001, respectively]. Furthermore, HCV mono-infected patients had increased frequencies of Tregs compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05). However, no associations between the frequency of Tregs and fibrosis were found. Furthermore, characterization of CD4⁺ Tregs using CD45RA demonstrated a higher frequency of activated Tregs in both HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients compared with healthy controls. Finally, number of intrahepatic Tregs was associated with both peripheral CD8⁺ Tregs and intrahepatic inflammation. In conclusion, HCV mono-infected patients and particularly HIV/HCV co-infected patients have increased the frequency of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ Tregs compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, CD4⁺ Tregs in infected patients displayed an active phenotype. Tregs were not associated with fibrosis, but a positive correlation between intrahepatic Tregs and inflammation was found. Taken together, these results suggest a role for Tregs in the pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection."
CD010542,0,22700624,0, Noninvasive markers of fibrosis: key concepts for improving accuracy in daily clinical practice.,"Noninvasive markers of fibrosis have emerged as an alternative to the staging of fibrosis by means of liver biopsy. Apart from being noninvasive and thus lacking the adverse effects of liver biopsy, they offer some advantages such as reduced risk of sampling error, objectiveness in the interpretation of the result, appropriateness for repeated measurements and lower cost. Many studies have validated different panels of blood markers and imaging/transient elastography for the estimation of fibrosis with acceptable accuracy. Clinical scenarios leading to inacurate or failed estimation must be acknowledged, as well as the fact that performance of blood markers and transient elastography, and their diagnostic cut-off values vary among specific liver diseases. The combination of two blood markers or of a blood marker and transient elastography has been shown to increase accuracy of the estimation. Further, unlike liver biopsy the noninvasive markers of fibrosis are not associated with a ceiling effect after cirrhosis is identified, but can discriminate early from advanced stages of cirrhosis. Longitudinal studies have shown their utility as predictors of complications from portal hypertension and mortality, outperforming liver biopsy. In conclusion, noninvasive markers of fibrosis provide major advantages over liver biopsy. The reported performance of some of the available tests particularly when used in combination make them a reliable tool, very attractive for daily clinical practice."

CD010542,0,18334275,0,Non-invasive evaluation of liver fibrosis using transient elastography.,"Transient elastography (TE, FibroScan) is a novel non-invasive method that has been proposed for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases, by measuring liver stiffness. TE is a rapid and user-friendly technique that can be easily performed at the bedside or in the outpatient clinic with immediate results and good reproducibility. Limitations include failure in around 5% of cases, mainly in obese patients. So far, TE has been mostly validated in chronic hepatitis C, with diagnostic performance equivalent to that of serum markers for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis. Combining TE with serum markers increases diagnostic accuracy and as a result, liver biopsy could be avoided for initial assessment in most patients with chronic hepatitis C. This strategy warrants further evaluation in other aetiological types of chronic liver diseases. TE appears to be an excellent tool for early detection of cirrhosis and may have prognostic value in this setting. As TE has excellent patient acceptance it could be useful for monitoring fibrosis progression and regression in the individual case, but more data are awaited for this application. Guidelines are needed for the use of TE in clinical practice."

CD010542,0,16314817,0,[Management of cirrhosis complications in HIV patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C virus].,"Cirrhosis is a serious complication of viral hepatitis, and its incidence is increasing in HIV patients coinfected with HCV or HBV as they live longer, thanks to effective antiretroviral treatment (Haart). HIV coinfection accelerates the progression of fibrosis in hepatitis. To implement preventive measures, prompt diagnosis of cirrhosis is important, either by liver biopsy or the noninvasive tests for fibrosis now under wide study (FibroTest, FibroScan, etc.). Afterwards, assessment of the severity of cirrhosis and screening for complications are both necessary: testing for liver failure (Child-Pugh and MELD scores), portal hypertension (upper gastrointestinal endoscopy), and hepatocellular carcinoma (ultrasound and alpha fetoprotein assay). Careful consideration of drug prescriptions and possible interactions is essential. Specific treatment for hepatitis B or C virus is possible at this stage of cirrhosis, although more difficult, especially for HCV (results influenced by genotype, additional risk of complications by lactic acidosis or hepatic decompensation). Management of the complications of portal hypertension must be planned, as for those without HIV infection. Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is still disappointing, and liver transplantation, although possible in these patients, must be evaluated."

Consequently, liver fibrosis assessment plays an important role in hepatology. Besides its importance for prognosis, determining the level of fibrosis reveals the natural history of the disease and the risk factors associated with its progression, to guide the antifibrotic action of different treatments. Currently, in clinical practice, there are three available methods for the evaluation of liver fibrosis: liver biopsy, which is still considered to be the 'gold standard'; serological markers of fibrosis and their mathematical combination - suggested in recent years to be an alternative to liver biopsy - and, more recently, transient elastography (TE). TE is a new, simple and noninvasive method used to measure liver stiffness. This technique is based on the progressing speed of an elastic shear wave within the liver. Currently, there are only a few studies that have evaluated TE effectiveness in chronic liver diseases, mostly in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus.

Several conditions intrinsic to the pathology of the liver compromise the positive predictive value of HE for fibrosis alone including acute hepatitis, obstructive cholestasis, and passive congestion. Technical considerations that hinder the performance of elastography include an advanced body mass index, the presence of ascites and narrow intercostal spaces. Despite these limitations, elastography has a role in staging fibrosis, prognosis of disease outcome, surveillance, and treatment decisions.

CD010542,0,19291784,0,SAFE biopsy: a validated method for large-scale staging of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.,"The staging of liver fibrosis is pivotal for defining the prognosis and indications for therapy in hepatitis C. Although liver biopsy remains the gold standard, several noninvasive methods are under evaluation for clinical use. The aim of this study was to validate the recently described sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation (SAFE) biopsy, which detects significant fibrosis (> or =F2 by METAVIR) and cirrhosis (F4) by combining the AST-to-platelet ratio index and Fibrotest-Fibrosure, thereby limiting liver biopsy to cases not adequately classifiable by noninvasive markers. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients (2035) were enrolled in nine locations in Europe and the United States. The diagnostic accuracy of SAFE biopsy versus histology, which is the gold standard, was investigated. The reduction in the need for liver biopsies achieved with SAFE biopsy was also assessed. SAFE biopsy identified significant fibrosis with 90.1% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.90) and reduced by 46.5% the number of liver biopsies needed. SAFE biopsy had 92.5% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.94) for the detection of cirrhosis, obviating 81.5% of liver biopsies. A third algorithm identified significant fibrosis and cirrhosis simultaneously with high accuracy and a 36% reduction in the need for liver biopsy. The patient's age and body mass index influenced the performance of SAFE biopsy, which was improved with adjusted Fibrotest-Fibrosure cutoffs. Two hundred two cases (9.9%) had discordant results for significant fibrosis with SAFE biopsy versus histology, whereas 153 cases (7.5%) were discordant for cirrhosis detection; 71 of the former cases and 56 of the latter cases had a Fibroscan measurement within 2 months of histological evaluation.

CD010542,0,19399815,0,Evaluation of the patient with hepatitis B.,"The initial evaluation of a patient with hepatitis B virus infection should attempt to assess the disease activity and stage in the context of the known natural history of this infection and to properly assess the needs for treatment and surveillance. In addition to a medical history and focused physical examination, the initial evaluation usually requires serological, biochemical, and virological tests to confirm the diagnosis as well as an imaging study to establish a baseline for future monitoring. A liver biopsy is generally not needed but can provide useful information on prognosis, need for surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and whether to recommend therapy. Follow-up monitoring is aimed at determining disease progression, development of complications, and reassessing the need for treatment. Monitoring frequency should be determined based on the activity and stage of disease. Initiation of screening for HCC should be based on age, race, sex, family history, and stage and duration of disease. The current recommended method of screening and surveillance for HCC is by ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein measurements every 6-12 months. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the role of longitudinal application of noninvasive assays of fibrosis, such as serum fibrosis markers and transient elastography.

Steatosis was categorized by visual assessment as S(0) : steatosis in <10% of hepatocytes, S(1) : 11-33%, S(2) : 34-66% and S(3) : 67-100%. Performances of CAP and liver stiffness were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and cross-validated using the bootstrap method. The Obuchowski measure was used to assess overall accuracy of CAP and to differentiate between steatosis grades. In multivariate analysis, CAP was related to steatosis (P < 10(-15) ) independently of fibrosis stage (which was related to LSM). The areas under ROC curves using CAP to detect steatosis were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.84) for S ≥ S(1) , 0.86 (0.81-0.92) for S ≥ S(2) and 0.88 (0.73-1) S = S(3) . CAP exhibited a good ability to differentiate steatosis grades (Obuchowski measure = 0.92). Performance of LSM for fibrosis assessment confirmed results from previous studies. CAP is a novel tool to assess the degree of steatosis and both fibrosis and steatosis can be evaluated noninvasively during the same procedure using Fibroscan(®) , in patients with CHC."

CD010542,0,19482565,0,Transient elastography for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis: the missing tool?,"The fibrogenic evolution of chronic viral hepatitis B and C towards cirrhosis represents a key issue in clinical Hepatology whose monitoring still relies on liver biopsy and consequent histopathological staging. In the last decade, non-invasive methodologies have been proposed to predict the presence of fibrosis in chronic liver disease. Most of these methods are based on algorithms, including biochemical parameters, which have demonstrated an acceptable diagnostic accuracy towards the two extremities of the fibrogenetic process. The introduction of transient elastography has represented a further advancement in clinical Hepatology and it seems that the combination of different non-invasive methodologies will provide an improvement in the clinical management of disease progression in viral chronic hepatitis. Studies, conducted especially in chronic viral hepatitis C, suggest that transient elastography is a useful technique for the detection of severe fibrosis-cirrhosis and for the exclusion of significant fibrosis (>or=F2), that could be employed as ""diagnostic discriminator"" for establishing clinical priorities and reducing the number of liver biopsies. This review article will focus on the clinical utility of this novel methodology for the assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis and will highlight potential further advantages."
CD010542,0,20135110,0,Transient elastography in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Hepatic involvement is frequent in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), with focal biliary cirrhosis being the pathognomonic hepatic manifestation.

This occurs as a relatively early complication with the majority of patients presenting in childhood or their early teens. However, a normal US does not preclude significant liver fibrosis and liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that is hampered by potential sampling errors. Transient elastography (TE) (Fibroscan) is a non-invasive, user-friendly and quick technique that provides an objective and reproducible measure of liver stiffness. This is accomplished with a device using an US probe mounted in the axis of a vibrator. Vibrations are transmitted by the transducer, inducing an electronic shear wave that propagates through the underlying tissue."
CD010542,0,20171943,0,Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A decalogue from the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) Expert Committee.,"We report the evidence-based Italian Association for the Study of Liver guidelines for the appropriate diagnosis and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in clinical practice and its related research agenda. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease varies according to age, gender and ethnicity. In the general population, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is about 25% and the incidence is of two new cases/100 people/year. 2-3% of individuals in the general population will suffer from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Uncomplicated steatosis will usually follow a benign course. Individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, however, have a reduced life expectancy, mainly owing to vascular diseases and liver-related causes. Moreover, steatosis has deleterious effects on the natural history of HCV infection. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is usually diagnosed in asymptomatic patients prompted by the occasional discovery of increased liver enzymes and/or of ultrasonographic steatosis. Medical history, complete physical examination, etiologic screening of liver injury, liver biochemistry tests, serum lipids and insulin sensitivity tests should be performed in every patient. Occult alcohol abuse should be ruled out. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging technique. Liver biopsy, the gold standard in diagnosis and prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is an invasive procedure and its results will not influence treatment in most cases but will provide prognostic information. Assessment of fibrosis by composite scores, specific laboratory parameters and transient elastography might reduce the number of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients requiring liver biopsy. Dieting and physical training reinforced by behavioural therapy are associated with improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome should be ruled out at timed intervals in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients should undergo periodic evaluation of cardiovascular risk and of advancement of their liver disease; those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-cirrhosis should be evaluated for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma."

CD010542,0,21039833,0,Transient elastography.,"In clinical practice, it is important to assess the severity of liver fibrosis in patients with various liver diseases to determine the prognosis, decide treatment, and monitor disease progression and response to treatment. Liver biopsy is limited by its invasiveness and patient acceptability. The development of transient elastography provides clinicians with a non-invasive, accurate, and reproducible tool to estimate liver fibrosis. The technique has been validated among many liver diseases and requires only simple training. Due to its non-invasive nature and ease of use, transient elastography can be used repeatedly on patients, and is optimal for large-scale epidemiological studies, in which stable patients with no indication for liver biopsy can also be included. However, falsely-high liver stiffness measurements might occur during acute hepatitis, extrahepatic cholestasis, congestive heart failure, and amyloidosis. Failed acquisition is also common in obese patients. The development of S and XL probes might cater for different population groups, but calibration in patients with liver biopsy is essential."

In this multicenter study, we evaluated the feasibility and performance of the novel FibroScan XL probe in 276 patients with chronic liver disease (42% viral hepatitis, 46% nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]) and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m(2) . Patients underwent liver biopsy and TE with the standard M and XL probes. TE failure was defined as no valid LSMs and unreliable examinations as <10 valid LSMs or an interquartile range (IQR)/LSM >30% or success rate <60%. Probe performance for diagnosing ≥ F2 fibrosis and cirrhosis (F4) versus biopsy were examined using areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). FibroScan failure was less frequent with the XL probe than the M probe (1.1% versus 16%) and the XL probe was more often reliable (73% versus 50%; both P < 0.00005). Reliable results with the XL probe were obtained in 61% of patients in whom the M probe was unreliable. Among 178 patients with ≥ 10 valid LSMs using both probes, liver stiffness was highly correlated between probes (ρ = 0.86; P < 0.0005); however, median liver stiffness was lower using the XL probe (6.8 versus 7.8 kPa; P < 0.00005). The AUROC of the XL and M probes were similar for ≥ F2 fibrosis (0.83 versus 0.86; P = 0.19) and cirrhosis (0.94 versus 0.91; P = 0.28)."

CD010542,0,17503318,0,[Transient elastography (FibroScan) for the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis: current status and perspectives].,"A precise staging of the degree of liver fibrosis is important for the estimation of prognosis, surveillance and treatment decision in patients with chronic liver diseases. At present, liver biopsy is still the reference standard for the assessment of liver fibrosis. However, it is an invasive method associated with patient discomfort and in rare cases with serious complications. In addition, the accuracy of liver biopsy is limited due to intra- and interobserver variability and sampling errors. Non-invasive markers and methods for the assessment of liver fibrosis have been intensively evaluated in many studies. The FibroScan (Echosens, France) uses the transient elastography principle for the measurement of liver stiffness. At present (January 2007), studies evaluating the FibroScan in a wide range of liver diseases have been published in 20 full papers and 76 abstracts. The present review gives an overview of the current literature. The best results are reported for the differentiation between cirrhosis and no cirrhosis. With the combination of FibroScan and non-invasive serum fibrosis markers, the accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (Metavir F > or = 2) can be further improved. According to recent data the FibroScan can also be useful for the evaluation of treatment response in patients receiving antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis C. In addition, several studies have shown, that the FibroScan can be applied to estimate the risk of complications associated with liver cirrhosis."
CD010542,0,22278746,0,Liver stiffness predicts clinical outcome in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis.,"Our aim was to assess the predictive value of liver stiffness (LS), measured by transient elastography (TE), for clinical outcome in human immunodeficiency virus / hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV)-coinfected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis. This was a prospective cohort study of 239 consecutive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with a new diagnosis of cirrhosis, done by TE, and no previous decompensation of liver disease. The time from diagnosis to the first liver decompensation and death from liver disease, as well as the predictors of these outcomes, were evaluated. After a median (Q1-Q3) follow-up of 20 (9-34) months, 31 (13%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9%-17%) patients developed a decompensation. The incidence of decompensation was 6.7 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI, 4.7-9-6). Fourteen (8%) out of 181 patients with a baseline LS < 40 kPa developed a decompensation versus 17 (29%) out of 58 with LS ≥ 40 kPa (P = 0.001). Factors independently associated with decompensation were Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class B versus A (hazard ratio [HR] 7.7; 95% CI 3.3-18.5; P < 0.0001), log-plasma HCV RNA load (HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.6; P = 0.01), hepatitis B virus coinfection (HR, 10.3; 95% CI, 2.1-50.4; P = 0.004) and baseline LS (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.05; P = 0.02).

CD010542,0,21205132,0,How to assess liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C: serum markers or transient elastography vs. liver biopsy?,"The assessment of liver fibrosis is a major issue in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Liver biopsy has traditionally been considered the gold standard for the evaluation of tissue damage, including fibrosis. In addition, it detects associated lesions such as steatosis, steatohepatitis or iron overload, which provide useful information for patient management and prognosis. Liver biopsy is, however, an invasive procedure, with a risk of rare but potentially life-threatening complications and it is prone to sampling errors. These limitations have led to the development of non-invasive methods. Currently available tests rely on two different but complementary approaches: (i) a 'biological' approach based on the dosage of serum biomarkers of fibrosis; (ii) a 'physical' approach based on the measurement of liver stiffness, using transient elastography. Although significant progress has been made in the non-invasive diagnosis of fibrosis, it is increasingly clear that these methods will not completely replace liver biopsy. Instead, non-invasive methods and liver biopsy should be used in an integrated approach for more efficient and convenient management of patients with chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this review is to discuss the advantages and limitations of liver biopsy and non-invasive methods and the perspectives for their use in clinical practice."

CD010542,0,22370225,0,"[Hungarian consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of B, C, and D viral hepatitis].","More than 1% of the Hungarian population is infected with hepatitis B, C, or D viruses. Since 2006 the diagnostics and therapy of these infections are carried out in treatment centers according to national guidelines - since 2010 according to financial protocols. The consensus-based guidelines for 2012 are published in this paper. The guidelines stress the importance of quick and detailed virologic evaluations, the applicability of transient elastography as an acceptable alternative of liver biopsy in this regard, as well as the relevance of appropriate consistent follow up schedule for viral response during therapy. The first choice of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infection is pegylated interferon for 48 weeks or continuous entecavir therapy. The later must be continued for at least 6 months after hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarat is not yet reimbursed by the National Health Insurance Fund. Adefovir dipivoxil is recommended mainly in combination therapy. Lamivudine is no longer a first choice; patients currently taking lamivudine must switch if response is inadequate. Appropriate treatment of patients taking immunosuppressive medications is highly recommended. Pegylated interferon based therapy is recommended for the treatment of concomitant hepatitis D infection. Treatment naive chronic hepatitis C patients should initially receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin dual combination therapy. In genotype 1 infection if response is insufficient at 4 or 12 weeks one of the two new direct acting antivirals (boceprevir or telaprevir) should be added. The length of treatment is usually 48 weeks; in cases of extended early viral response shorter courses are recommended. Previous treatment failure patients with genotype 1 infection should receive a protease inhibitor backed triple combination therapy, mostly for 48 weeks. However, relapsers without cirrhosis and with extended rapid viral response, shorter telaprevir based combination therapy is sufficient. Drug-drug interactions as well as emergence of viral resistance are of particular importance. For genotype 2 or 3 HCV infections 24 weeks, for genotype 4 infections 24, 48 or 72 weeks of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy is recommended in general. The guidelines published here become protocols when published as official publications of the Hungarian Health Authority."

Accurate noninvasive tests for liver injury are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of transient elastography for the diagnosis of fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD and to study factors associated with discordance between transient elastography and histology. Two hundred forty-six consecutive patients from two ethnic groups had successful liver stiffness measurement and satisfactory liver biopsy specimens. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of transient elastography for F3 or higher and F4 disease was 0.93 and 0.95, respectively, and was significantly higher than that of the aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, FIB-4, BARD, and NAFLD fibrosis scores (AUROC ranged from 0.62 to 0.81, P < 0.05 for all comparisons). At a cutoff value of 7.9 kPa, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for F3 or greater disease were 91%, 75%, 52%, and 97%, respectively.

Information on the presence and degree of liver fibrosis is useful before making therapeutic decisions or predicting disease outcomes. The need to stage liver fibrosis, however, should decrease as treatment options become more successful (as has occurred with viral hepatitis). In recent years, noninvasive tests have demonstrated a reasonable ability to identify significant fibrosis, cirrhosis in particular, nor is it surprising that liver disease specialists and patients favor a noninvasive approach. However, only those tests with the highest diagnostic accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and availability should be implemented. Apart from their diagnostic accuracy, the potential ability of these tests to predict disease outcomes (a more relevant endpoint) should be compared with that of liver biopsy. Indeed, the use of a standardized system to evaluate the utility of biomarkers would facilitate their implementation in clinical practice."

Liver biopsy, traditionally considered to be the reference standard for staging of fibrosis, has been challenged over the past decade by the development of noninvasive methodologies. These methods rely on distinct but complementary approaches: a biologic approach, which quantifies serum levels of biomarkers of fibrosis, and a physical approach, which measures liver stiffness by ultrasound or magnetic resonance elastography. Noninvasive methods were initially studied and validated in patients with chronic hepatitis C but are now used increasingly for patients with hepatitis B, reducing the need for liver biopsy analysis. We review the advantages and limitations of the noninvasive methods used to manage patients with chronic viral hepatitis B or C infection."
CD010542,0,22233410,0,How far is noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis from replacing liver biopsy in hepatitis C?,"Chronic hepatitis C represents a major cause of progressive liver disease that can eventually evolve into cirrhosis and its end-stage complications. Formation and accumulation of fibrosis in the liver is the common pathway that leads to evolutive liver disease. Precise staging of liver fibrosis is essential for patient management in clinical practice because the presence of bridging fibrosis represents a strong indication for antiviral therapy, while cirrhosis requires a specific follow-up. Liver biopsy has always represented the standard of reference for assessment of hepatic fibrosis, but it has limitations: it is invasive, costly and prone to sampling errors. Recently, blood markers and instrumental methods have been proposed for the noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C. However, international guidelines do not recommend the widespread use of noninvasive methods for liver fibrosis in clinical practice. This is because of, in some cases, unsatisfactory accuracy and incomplete validation of others. Some studies suggest that the effectiveness of noninvasive methods for assessing liver fibrosis may increase when they are combined, and a number of sequential and synchronous algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, with the aim of reducing rather than substituting liver biopsies. This may represent a rational and reliable approach for implementing noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in clinical practice. It could allow more comprehensive first-line screening of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C than would be feasible with liver biopsy alone."

CD010542,0,22239518,1,Transient elastography for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease.,"There is increasing interest in developing noninvasive means to evaluate liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease to determine disease severity, prognosis and optimal treatment. Transient elastography (TE) has previously been demonstrated to predict the presence or absence of advanced fibrosis. The current study was conducted to determine whether TE can identify patients with chronic liver disease at risk of clinical decompensation. A total of 667 patients underwent TE and were followed for a median of 861 days and 57 patients achieved the primary outcome, a composite of clinical endpoints including death, ascites, encephalopathy, increased Child Score ≥ 2, variceal bleed, hepatocellular carcinoma or listing for transplant. Overall, TE had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 for predicting clinical outcome. Using a cut-off of 10.5 kPa, TE has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.7%, 63.0%, 19.3% and 99.2%, respectively. A predictive model for clinical events was developed using generalized cross-validation for clinical endpoints considering TE, liver biopsy results and multiple other predictors. Individually, TE performed better than biopsy, or any other variable, for predicting clinical outcome [Harrell's C Statistic 0.86 for TE, 0.78 for stage]. Patients with a TE score of >12.5 kPa were found to have a relative hazard for clinical event of 18.99 compared with patients with TE score <10.5. A combined variable model including TE, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) yielded the highest predictive accuracy with Harrell's C value of 0.93. In the subset of patients with cirrhosis, TE was not found to be independently associated with clinical outcomes in univariate or multivariate analysis although it retained a high sensitivity and NPV of 97.5% and 92.3%, respectively, at a kPa cut-off of 10.5. TE can successfully identify patients with chronic liver disease who are at low risk of clinical decompensation over a time period of 2 years."

Key in the decision making process is an assessment of liver injury. Traditionally, liver biopsy has provided this information; however, this is an invasive procedure and not completely reliable. Liver transient elastography (Fibroscan) is exciting new technology that allows estimation of hepatic fibrosis through measurement of liver stiffness. It is acceptably accurate, safe, cheap, quick and widely applicable, and can reduce the need for liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis. In chronic hepatitis C, it can identify those most likely to benefit from treatment, as well as those with cirrhosis who require more specific care. In chronic hepatitis B, it could screen groups previously excluded from treatment (normal alanine aminotransferase and low DNA) to identify the subgroup that would benefit from therapy. It cannot replace biopsy in all settings, but it will narrow the group who do require biopsy, and provide information on liver damage in patients for whom biopsy would probably not have been considered."

CD010542,0,19346784,1,[The usefulness of transient elastography to diagnose cirrhosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease].,"It is not easy to differentiate between patients with cirrhosis and those with alcoholic liver disease. Liver biopsy is generally considered the gold standard for assessing hepatic fibrosis; however, this protocol frequently carries a risk of severe complications and false-negative results. Transient elastography (Fibroscan, Echosens, Paris, France), which is a noninvasive method of measuring liver stiffness, has become available for assessing liver fibrosis. Liver stiffness reportedly differs markedly with the cirrhosis etiology. The aim of this study was thus to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the Fibroscan in the detection of cirrhosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease."

CD010542,0,21040236,0,The optimal cut-off for predicting large oesophageal varices using transient elastography is disease specific.,"The diagnosis of cirrhosis requires screening for oesophageal varices by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In many countries, serological tests and elastography are replacing liver biopsy for diagnosing cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to see whether there was an optimal cut-off of liver stiffness that could predict the presence of large (>F2) oesophageal varices and whether this was disease specific. A total of two hundred and twenty-two patients with all cause cirrhosis (Child class A) were screened, and 211 had successful elastography and are included in the analysis. Of the patients studied, one hundred and thirty-two patients had no or small F1 varices and 79 had large varices. Liver stiffness of 19.8 kPa had a negative predictive value of 91% and a positive predictive value of 55% with an area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of 0.73 in differentiating between small and large varices. Seven patients with large varices would have been incorrectly classified. In the 157 patients with hepatitis C as the aetiology of cirrhosis, the negative predictive value was 98% and only one patient was misclassified. Liver stiffness was superior in diagnostic accuracy to platelet count in all patients. A liver stiffness of >19.8 kPa could be utilized as a cut-off for endoscopy and beta blocker utilization, particularly in patients with hepatitis C."
CD010542,0,18956295,0,Diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: invasive versus noninvasive.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States and many other parts of the world. Its prevalence continues to rise-currently affecting approximately 20 to 30% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. NAFLD represents a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from fatty liver, which in general follows a benign nonprogressive clinical course, to steatohepatitis or NASH, a more serious form of NAFLD that may progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Although currently a combination of noninvasive clinically available laboratory and imaging tests may help in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected NAFLD, a liver biopsy remains the only reliable way to precisely diagnose NASH and establish the severity of liver injury and presence of fibrosis. It also provides important information regarding prognosis as well as response to therapeutic interventions. However, a liver biopsy is an invasive and costly procedure, which is poorly suited as a diagnostic test for a condition that may affect about one-third of the U.S. population. This review provides a concise overview of the role of liver biopsy versus noninvasive diagnostic tools for the differentiation of fatty liver from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as well as for the determination of presence and extent of fibrosis. In particular, this review focuses on the methods currently available in daily clinical practice in hepatology and touches briefly on potential future markers under investigation."
CD010542,0,21898504,0,Comparison of eight diagnostic algorithms for liver fibrosis in hepatitis C: new algorithms are more precise and entirely noninvasive.,"The sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation (SAFE) and the Bordeaux algorithm (BA), which cross-check FibroTest with the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) or FibroScan, are very accurate but provide only a binary diagnosis of significant fibrosis (SAFE or BA for Metavir F ≥ 2) or cirrhosis (SAFE or BA for F4). Therefore, in clinical practice, physicians have to apply the algorithm for F ≥ 2, and then, when needed, the algorithm for F4 (""successive algorithms""). We aimed to evaluate successive SAFE, successive BA, and a new, noninvasive, detailed classification of fibrosis. The study included 1785 patients with chronic hepatitis C, liver biopsy, blood fibrosis tests, and FibroScan (the latter in 729 patients). The most accurate synchronous combination of FibroScan with a blood test (FibroMeter) provided a new detailed (six classes) classification (FM+FS). Successive SAFE had a significantly (P < 10(-3) ) lower diagnostic accuracy (87.3%) than individual SAFE for F ≥ 2 (94.6%) or SAFE for F4 (89.5%), and required significantly more biopsies (70.8% versus 64.0% or 6.4%, respectively, P < 10(-3) ). Similarly, successive BA had significantly (P ≤ 10(-3) ) lower diagnostic accuracy (84.7%) than individual BA for F ≥ 2 (88.3%) or BA for F4 (94.2%), and required significantly more biopsies (49.8% versus 34.6% or 24.6%, respectively, P < 10(-3) ). The diagnostic accuracy of the FM+FS classification (86.7%) was not significantly different from those of successive SAFE or BA. However, this new classification required no biopsy."

CD010542,0,17438875,0,Transient elastography--an alternative to liver biopsy in patients with chronic hepatitis C?,"Liver fibrosis is the main determinant of clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis C. Liver biopsy is still considered the gold-standard for assessing liver fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure associated with morbidity and mortality and has several limitations. Moreover, liver biopsy is not well accepted by the patients, especially when repeated examinations are needed, and its accuracy in assessing fibrosis is questionable due to sampling errors, intraobserver and interobserver discrepancies. Therefore, over the last years there has been an increasing interest and desire for non-invasive tests to assess the stage of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. There are three main groups of non-invasive methodologies for the assessment of liver fibrosis: serum markers, imaging techniques, and transient elastrography. This review summarizes current information on transient elastography used for non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C."
CD010542,0,18221303,0,Liver fibrosis on account of chronic hepatitis C is more severe in HIV-positive than HIV-negative patients despite antiretroviral therapy.,"The recent availability of non-invasive tools to measure liver fibrosis has allowed examination of its extent and determination of predictors in all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. On the other hand, most information on hepatic fibrosis in HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients has been derived from liver biopsies taken before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was widely available. All consecutive HCV patients with elevated aminotransferases seen during the last 3 years were evaluated and liver fibrosis measured using transient elastography (FibroScan) and biochemical indexes. Patients were split according to their HIV serostatus. A total of 656 (69.6%) HCV-monoinfected and 287 (30.4%) HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were assessed. Mean CD4 count of coinfected patients was 493 cells/muL and 88% were under HAART (mean time, 4.2 +/- 2.4 years). Advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis was recognized in 39% of the coinfected and 18% of the monoinfected patients (P < 0.005). A good correlation was found between FibroScan) and biochemical indexes [AST to platelet ratio index (r = 0.405, P < 0.0001), FIB-4 (r = 0.393, P < 0.0001) and Forns (r = 0.407, P < 0.0001)], regardless of the HIV status. In the multivariate analysis, age >45 years, body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2), and HIV infection were independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients have more advanced liver fibrosis than HCV-monoinfected patients despite the immunologic benefit of HAART."

CD010542,0,20458851,0,Hepatic amyloidosis increases liver stiffness measured by transient elastography.,"Liver stiffness values in transient elastography (TE) have to be interpreted with caution. Steatosis, congestion, acute inflammation and extrahepatic cholestasis can indeed influence measurements. Obtained stiffness values in the cirrhotic range can also be present in the absence of fibrosis as in hepatic amyloidosis. Here we report two cases of systemic amyloidosis with hepatic involvement where high stiffness values were measured at TE. In fact, deposits of amyloid may increase the rigidity of the liver parenchyma resulting in higher liver stiffness values. Therefore, results of TE should always be interpreted in their clinical context and if inconsistent, the performance of a liver biopsy might be necessary."

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with significant liver fibrosis in a large population of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, who had participated in a cross-sectional, multicenter, retrospective study of liver fibrosis using noninvasive markers and in whom a determination of liver stiffness (LS) by TE was available, were included in this analysis. Factors potentially associated with significant fibrosis (LS ≥ 9 kPa) were analyzed. One thousand three hundred and ten patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 526 (40%) of them showed LS ≥ 9 kPa and 316 (24%) cirrhosis (LS ≥ 14 kPa). The factors independently associated with significant fibrosis [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval, P value) were the following: older age [1.04 (1.01-1.07), 0.002], daily alcohol intake > 50 g/day [1.58 (1.10-2.27), 0.013] and the length of HCV infection [1.03 (1.00-1.06), 0.023]]. A CD4 cell count lower than < 200 per mm(3) [1.67 (0.99-2.81), 0.053] and HCV genotype 4 [0.66 (0.42-1.02), 0.066] were marginally associated with LS ≥ 9 kPa. In conclusion, the prevalence of cirrhosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients seems to be higher than previously reported in studies based on liver biopsy. Older age, alcohol consumption and lower CD4 cell counts are related with significant fibrosis. The latter association supports an earlier starting of antiretroviral therapy in this setting."

CD010542,0,20198894,0,[Assessment of hepatic injury in patients with chronic viral hepatitis].,"The management and prognosis of chronic viral hepatitis greatly depend on the extent and progression of liver fibrosis. Although liver biopsy is still considered as the gold standard to evaluate hepatic fibrosis, it is an invasive procedure with rare but potentially severe complications. It is also prone to sampling errors. These limitations have stimulated the search for new noninvasive approaches. A number of noninvasive techniques such as indirect or direct markers and measurement of liver stiffness using transient elastography have been proposed for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis. The performance of simple tests derived from routine laboratory parameters appears to be similar to that of more complex and expensive fibrosis panels. Transient elastography seems to be more accurate than blood tests for diagnosing cirrhosis. The goal of disease specific, accurate and sensitive markers of fibrosis is worth the effort.

The aims of this study were to compare four validated serum and ultrasound-based markers of hepatic disease severity head-to-head with liver biopsy and to assess optimal combinations with consideration of cost. A total of 67 patients with biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis C underwent all four techniques on the same visit [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI); Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel; transient elastography (TE) and ultrasound microbubble hepatic transit times (HTT)]. Markers were combined according to increasing financial cost and ordinal regression used to determine contributions. APRI, ELF, TE and HTT predicted cirrhosis with diagnostic accuracy of 86%, 91%, 90% and 83% respectively. ELF and TE were the most reliable tests with an intra-class correlation of 0.94 each. Either ELF or TE significantly enhanced the prediction of fibrosis stage when combined with APRI, but when combined together, did not improve the model further. Addition of third or fourth markers did not significantly improve prediction of fibrosis.

This correlation was pronounced in patients with ongoing HCV infection (r = 0.67; P < 0.001 and r = 0.60; P < 0.001). Prediction of advanced fibrosis resulted in concordance rates >80% with combinations of TE plus APRI and APRI plus FIB-4. HIV/HCV coinfected patients did not present with advanced fibrosis stages when compared with HCV-monoinfected patients. Combinations of two non-invasive markers may significantly reduce the number of liver biopsies in patients with bleeding disorders and advanced liver fibrosis. Furthermore, our data support previous studies that observed a favourable outcome in patients with HIV/HCV and a preserved immune function in times of highly active antiretroviral therapy."

In some cases, however, no elasticity measurement is obtained. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with failure (no value obtained after 10 measurements) of liver stiffness measurement in patients with chronic liver disease. Two thousand one hundred and fourteen liver stiffness measurements were analyzed. Failure was observed in 96 cases (4.5%). Failure was not associated with operator, gender, or transaminase level. By multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with failure was body mass index greater than 28 (odds ratio, 10.0 degrees; 95% confidence interval, 5.7-17.9, P=0.001). In conclusion, liver stiffness is a good method for the evaluation of liver fibrosis that is feasible in more than 95% of patients. Other non-invasive methods such as biochemical methods or liver biopsy could therefore be used only in patients with failure of FibroScan examination."

Quantitative measurement of elasticity (in unit of Pascal) is required in this application because liver fibrosis is a diffuse disease where abnormality is not confined to a local region and there is no normal background tissue to provide contrast. SDUV uses an ultrasound ""push"" beam to stimulate formation of propagating harmonic shear waves in the studied tissue. The propagation speed of induced shear waves is frequency dependent (dispersive) and relates to the tissue's mechanical properties. Shear wave speeds at multiple frequencies (typically hundreds of Hertz) are measured by a separate ultrasound ""detect"" beam in pulse echo mode and fit with a theoretical dispersion model to inversely solve for tissue elasticity and viscosity. A special pulse sequence has been developed to facilitate a single ultrasound array transducer for both push and detect function, which makes SDUV compatible with current ultrasound scanners. Feasibility of this pulse sequence is demonstrated by in vivo SDUV measurements in porcine liver using a dual transducer prototype."

Liver biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and follow-up of LD. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the correlation between values of Fibroscan (EchoSens, Paris, France), a new noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis, liver biopsy, and clinical data among HCV-positive renal transplant patients. Twenty-four HCV/RNA-positive patients with a previous liver biopsy were selected to undergo Fibroscan (transient elastography) and a clinical evaluation of liver function. Fibroscan values were expressed in kilopascals (kPa). As 2 patients were eliminated due to obesity or ascites, we analyzed 22 patients. Thirteen patients (59%) with fibrosis F0-F1 (METAVIR score) by biopsy and normal liver function showed a mean Fibroscan score of 5.2 kPa (range, 2.3-6.8 kPa). Three patients (13.6%) exhibited F2 by biopsy and normal liver function with a mean Fibroscan score of 8.2 kPa (range, 7.3-8.9 kPa). Three patients (13.6%) with F3 by biopsy and abnormal liver function showed a high mean Fibroscan score of 10.9 kPa (range, 10.5-11.6 kPa). The last 3 patients (13.6%) with F4 (cirrhosis) by biopsy and abnormal clinical data showed the highest mean Fibroscan value of 14.2 kPa (range, 8.9-18 kPa). In conclusion, among renal transplant patients with HCV the values of Fibroscan seem to correlate with the degree of fibrosis by biopsy and with clinical liver function. Therefore, Fibroscan may be useful to follow patients with LD. However, these results should be analyzed with caution due to the small number of cases and retrospective nature of the study."
CD010542,0,16969327,0,[Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis virus C].,"Development of liver fibrosis, which leads to cirrhosis, is the principal complication of all chronic liver diseases, regardless of their cause. Knowledge of the existence and severity of fibrosis is important from diagnostic and prognostic viewpoints. Its assessment plays an essential role in the treatment decision and makes it possible to assess the risk of progression to cirrhosis and the onset of its complications. Histologic examination of the liver remains the reference examination for assessing the extent of fibrosis during chronic liver disease. Nonetheless, the number of patients needing assessment, the risks of the punch-biopsy and the cost of this invasive examination have led many to propose other tools to assess fibrosis. Some standard indicators (transaminases, platelets, prothrombin time) have long been recognized as indirect markers of extensive fibrosis. More recently, progress in our knowledge of the mechanisms of liver fibrogenesis have made it possible to identify different peripheral blood components that may be of clinical interest. Thus serum assays of elements of the extracellular matrix, their decay products, or enzymes involved in their metabolism have been proposed as noninvasive indicators. Among these, hyaluronic acid appears the most interesting. For several years, scores have been calculated with algorithms that combine several indicators determined simultaneously to assess fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C and sometimes other chronic liver diseases. The Fibrotest is the best validated and most widely used of these. Finally, Fibroscan is a device for the diagnosis and quantification of hepatic fibrosis, based on the technique of transient elastography. The relative roles of these noninvasive markers and the value of their combinations must still be determined."

Liver fibrosis can occur in all chronic liver diseases and shows progression towards liver cirrhosis in 20-40% of cases. The clinical presentation of liver fibrosis is usually unspecific. Therefore, most patients with liver fibrosis are identified by elevated liver enzymes during other medical examinations. The gold standard for quantification of liver fibrosis is percutaneous liver biopsy, but non-invasive markers (e. g. serum markers, transient elastography) have recently been evaluated to identify individuals with significant fibrosis. In case of fibrosis detection, medical therapies aim at stabilizing liver scarring or even at inducing the regression of fibrosis. Primarily this is achieved by etiology specific therapies of chronic liver diseases (e. g. antiviral therapy, immunosuppressive therapy etc.). However, in cases of failure of these specific therapies, non-specific interventions for fibrosis regression are actively being investigated.

Subjects positive for hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus infection and consuming any amount of alcohol were excluded. Diagnosis of NAFL was by dual radiological screening protocol consisting of ultrasonographic and computed tomographic examination of the liver. Transient elastographic examination and liver biopsy were performed in a subset to identify significant liver disease. The risk factors of having NAFL were analyzed. A total of 1,911 individuals were analyzed, 7% of whom were overweight and 11% of whom had abdominal obesity.

CD010542,0,20544947,0,Magnetic resonance elastography: a review.,"Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a rapidly developing technology for quantitatively assessing the mechanical properties of tissue. The technology can be considered to be an imaging-based counterpart to palpation, commonly used by physicians to diagnose and characterize diseases. The success of palpation as a diagnostic method is based on the fact that the mechanical properties of tissues are often dramatically affected by the presence of disease processes, such as cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis. MRE obtains information about the stiffness of tissue by assessing the propagation of mechanical waves through the tissue with a special magnetic resonance imaging technique. The technique essentially involves three steps: (1) generating shear waves in the tissue, (2) acquiring MR images depicting the propagation of the induced shear waves, and (3) processing the images of the shear waves to generate quantitative maps of tissue stiffness, called elastograms. MRE is already being used clinically for the assessment of patients with chronic liver diseases and is emerging as a safe, reliable, and noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for staging hepatic fibrosis. MRE is also being investigated for application to pathologies of other organs including the brain, breast, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, lungs, and skeletal muscle.

Although their diagnostic accuracy in liver fibrosis is promising, around 20% of patients are likely to be misclassified if these tests or LB are used alone. However, using a combination of several biochemical scores (Fibropaca algorithm, Leroy algorithm) or one biochemical score with TE (Bordeaux algorithm) will increase diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis and reduce the need for LB. Stepwise combination algorithms of non-invasive scores (SAFE biopsy) also improve the diagnostic performance in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) compared with the use of a single non-invasive score. Other sequential stepwise algorithms have been developed in CHC with similar performance results. Comparisons of different combinations of non-invasive methods indicate that the SAFE biopsy, Fibropaca algorithm and Bordeaux algorithm are excellent and comparable in the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis in HCV patients, and will markedly reduce the need for LB.

CD010542,0,22957328,0,Liver elastography for the diagnosis of portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis.,"Progressive hepatic fibrosis is a feature of almost all chronic liver diseases. In their final stage, advanced cirrhosis, the clinical signs are diagnostic, but compensated liver cirrhosis is not always easy to diagnose. Apart from liver biopsy, serologic and elastographic non invasive methods for the evaluation of fibrosis severity were developed in the last few years. Studies have been made in order to assess their value for predicting the occurrence of cirrhosis complications, particularly portal hypertension. Both Transient Elastography and ARFI elastography are valuable methods for the early diagnosis of cirrhosis. While TE is a promising method for predicting the presence of portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients, the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI in the liver seems to be poor. Probably the accuracy of ARFI elastography can be significantly increased if spleen stiffness is assessed, alone or in combination with liver stiffness and other parameters."
CD010542,0,18544943,0,New diagnostic method for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.,"Liver fibrosis, i.e. excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases. The prognosis and management of chronic liver diseases depend on the degree of liver fibrosis. Therefore, the assessment of liver fibrosis provides useful information not only for diagnosis but also for treatment planning. Although liver biopsy is still the gold standard for assessing hepatic fibrosis, it has some technical limitations and risks. Furthermore, the dynamic process of liver fibrosis resulting from progression and regression cannot be quantified by liver biopsy. Therefore, alternative, simple, reliable and noninvasive tests are needed to assess the stage of fibrosis. Several noninvasive direct and indirect serum markers able to predict the presence of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease with considerable accuracy have been reported. However, since most of these markers require complicated calculations, clinical application is difficult. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is a new method for the evaluation of liver stiffness. The technique is based on changes in tissue elasticity induced by hepatic fibrosis. Liver stiffness measured by transient elastography is a noninvasive, reproducible and reliable method to assess hepatic fibrosis as well as to diagnose liver cirrhosis. Based on accumulating clinical data, clinical applications of elastography will increase in the near future."

CD010542,0,18504591,0,MR elastography of liver fibrosis: preliminary results comparing spin-echo and echo-planar imaging.,"The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the performance of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography using echo-planar and spin-echo imaging for staging of hepatic fibrosis. Twenty-four patients who had liver biopsy for suspicion of chronic liver disease had MR elastography performed with both spin-echo and echo-planar sequences. At histology, the fibrosis stage was assessed according to METAVIR. The data acquisition time was about 20 min using spin-echo, and only 2 min using echo-planar imaging. The hepatic signal-to-noise ratios were similar on both images (22.51 +/- 5.37 for spin-echo versus 21.02 +/- 4.76 for echo-planar, p = 0.33). The elasticity measurements and the fibrosis stages were strongly correlated. The Spearman correlation coefficients were r = 0.91 (p < 0.01) with spin-echo and r = 0.84 (p < 0.01) with echo-planar sequences. These correlation coefficients did not differ significantly (p = 0.17). A strong correlation was also observed between spin-echo and echo-planar elasticity (r = 0.83, p < 0.001), without systematic bias. The results of our study showed that echo-planar imaging substantially decreased the data acquisition time of MR elastography, while maintaining the image quality and diagnostic performance for staging of liver fibrosis. This suggests that echo-planar MR elastography could replace spin-echo MR elastography in clinical practice."
CD010542,0,15690481,0,Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis by measurement of stiffness in patients with chronic hepatitis C.,"Liver fibrosis is the main predictor of the progression of chronic hepatitis C, and its assessment by liver biopsy (LB) can help determine therapy. However, biopsy is an invasive procedure with several limitations. A new, noninvasive medical device based on transient elastography has been designed to measure liver stiffness. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in the evaluation of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. We prospectively enrolled 327 patients with chronic hepatitis C in a multicenter study. Patients underwent LB and LSM. METAVIR liver fibrosis stages were assessed on biopsy specimens by 2 pathologists. LSM was performed by transient elastography. Efficiency of LSM and optimal cutoff values for fibrosis stage assessment were determined by a receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and cross-validated by the jack-knife method. LSM was well correlated with fibrosis stage (Kendall correlation coefficient: 0.55; P < .0001). The areas under ROC curves were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84) for F > or =2, 0.91 (0.87-0.96) for F > or =3, and 0.97 (0.93-1) for F=4; for larger biopsies, these values were, respectively, 0.81, 0.95, and 0.99. Optimal stiffness cutoff values of 8.7 and 14.5 kPa showed F > or =2 and F=4, respectively. In conclusion, noninvasive assessment of liver stiffness with transient elastography appears as a reliable tool to detect significant fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C."

CD010542,0,19732322,0,Comparison of transient elastography and liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis in HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients and correlation with noninvasive serum markers.,"Transient elastography (FibroScan) is a novel, rapid and noninvasive technique to assess liver fibrosis. Our objective was to compare transient elastography (TE) and other noninvasive serum indexes as alternatives to liver biopsy in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. The fibrosis stage (METAVIR Score), TE, the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, the Forns fibrosis index, FIB-4 and HGM-2 indexes were assessed in 100 patients between January 2007 and January 2008. The diagnostic values were compared by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs). Using TE, the AUROC (95% CI) of liver stiffness was 0.80 (0.72-0.89) when discriminating between F <or= 1 and F > 2, 0.93 (0.85-1.00) when discriminating between F <or= 2 and F > 3 and 0.99 (0.97-1.00) when discriminating between F <or= 3 and F4. For the diagnosis of F >or= 3, the AUROCs of TE were significantly higher than those obtained with the other four noninvasive indexes. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, three cutoff values were chosen to identify F <or= 1 (<7 kPa), F >or= 3 (>or=11 kPa) and F4 (>or=14 kPa). Using these best cutoff scores, the negative predictive value and positive predictive value were 81.1% and 70.2% for the diagnosis of F <or= 1, 96.3% and 60% for the diagnosis of F >or= 3 and 100% and 57.1% for the diagnosis of F4. Thus, Transient elastography accurately predicted liver fibrosis and outperformed other simple noninvasive indexes in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Our data suggest that TE is a helpful tool for guiding therapeutic decisions in clinical practice."
CD010542,0,20010062,0,Abdominal magnetic resonance elastography.,"Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a magnetic resonance imaging-based technique for quantitatively assessing the mechanical properties of tissues based on the propagation of shear waves. Multiple studies have described many potential applications of MRE, from characterizing tumors to detecting diffuse disease processes. Studies have shown that MRE can be successfully implemented to assess abdominal organs. The first clinical application of MRE to be well documented is the detection and characterization of hepatic fibrosis, which systematically increases the stiffness of liver tissue. In this diagnostic role, it offers a safer, less expensive, and potentially more accurate alternative to invasive liver biopsy. Emerging results suggest that measurements of liver and spleen stiffness may provide an indirect way to assess portal hypertension. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that it is possible to use MRE to evaluate the mechanical properties of other abdominal structures, such as the pancreas and kidneys. Steady technical progress in developing practical protocols for applying MRE in the abdomen and the pelvis provides opportunities to explore many other potential applications of this emerging technology."

Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is a non-invasive way of assessing the extent of liver fibrosis. This article describes our experience with serial LSM to assess prospectively progression of fibrosis in a cohort of patients with inherited bleeding disorders and chronic hepatitis C. A total of 84 patients underwent serial LSMs, with a median interval of 3.7 years. The change in LSM results over time was assessed. Overall, there was no significant difference between the median results of LSM 1 and LSM 2. The median result of LSM 2 was low (6.6 kPa), after a median duration of infection of 37 years. On the individual level, deterioration of LSM results of more than 2 kPa was seen in 13 patients (16%), 44 patients (52%) remained stable and 27 patients (32%) showed improvement of LSM results of more than 2 kPa. These results are comparable with those of paired liver biopsy studies. LSM appears to be a good alternative for liver biopsies in patients with hepatitis C and inherited bleeding disorders, although the interpretation of the unexpected improvement we found in some of our patients is not straightforward. LSMs will be repeated in our patient population in a few years to be able to better assess the value of serial LSM."

CD010542,0,18528937,0,"Why, who and how should perform liver biopsy in chronic liver diseases.","Chronic viral hepatitis is a common disease in the general population. During chronic hepatitis, the prognosis and clinical management are highly dependent on the extent of liver fibrosis. The fibrosis evaluation can be performed by FibroTest (using serological markers), by Elastography or FibroScan (a noninvasive percutaneous technique using the elastic properties of the hepatic tissue) and by liver biopsy (LB), considered to be the ""gold standard"". Currently, there are three techniques for performing LB: percutaneous, transjugular and laparoscopic. The percutaneous LB can be performed blind, ultrasound (US) guided or US assisted. There are two main categories of specialists who perform LB: gastroenterologists (hepatologists) and radiologists, and the specialty of the individual who performs the LB determines if the LB is performed under ultrasound guidance or not. There are two types of biopsy needles used for LB: cutting needles (Tru-Cut, Vim-Silverman) and suction needles (Menghini, Klatzkin, Jamshidi). The rate of major complications after percutaneous LB ranges from 0.09% to 2.3%, but the echo-guided percutaneous liver biopsy is a safe method for the diagnosis of chronic diffuse hepatitis (cost-effective as compared to blind biopsy) and the rate of complications seems to be related to the experience of the physician and the type of the needle used (Menghini type needle seems to be safer). Maybe, in a few years we will use non-invasive markers of fibrosis, but at this time, most authorities in the field consider that the LB is useful and necessary for the evaluation of chronic hepatopathies, despite the fact that it is not a perfect test."
CD010542,0,19925459,0,Chances and limitations of non-invasive tests in the assessment of liver fibrosis in liver transplant patients.,"Because fibrosis progression resulting in liver cirrhosis represents the main reason for graft lost in patients after liver transplantation, an early detection of liver fibrosis is crucial. In recent years, several non-invasive tests for the assessment of liver fibrosis have been developed. We prospectively assessed the stage of liver fibrosis of 135 liver transplant patients (94 hepatitis C virus [HCV], 41 alcoholic cirrhosis) using liver biopsy, transient elastography, and serum markers. In the HCV group, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) and cirrhosis (F = 4) was 0.81 (negative predictive value [NPV] = 0.58, positive predictive value [PPV] = 0.9) and 0.87 (NPV = 0.94, PPV = 0.56), respectively. In the alcoholic cirrhosis group, significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) was diagnosed with an AUROC of 0.83 (NPV = 1.00, PPV = 0.23). In both groups, higher AUROC values were reached in patients with a body mass index of <25 kg/m(2) , and both serum markers showed no significant correlation to liver fibrosis. The transient elastography is a reliable test for exclusion of liver cirrhosis in HCV transplant and significant liver fibrosis in alcoholic transplant patients. For the diagnosis of significant liver fibrosis in HCV transplant patients, the transient elastography reaches good results but cannot replace liver biopsy. Both serum markers AST-to-platelet ratio index and FIB-4 are not feasible to assess liver fibrosis in liver transplant patients."

We evaluated whether repeated liver stiffness measurements (LSM) following LT can discriminate between slow and rapid ""fibrosers"" (fibrosis stage F2-F4 at 1 year after LT). Eighty-four patients who had undergone LT and who were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 19 LT controls who were not infected with HCV underwent LSM at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after LT. All HCV-infected patients underwent liver biopsy 12 months after LT (paired HVPG measurements in 74); 31 (37%) were rapid fibrosers. Median LSM (in kilopascal) at months 6, 9, and 12 were significantly higher in rapid fibrosers (9.9, 9.5, 12.1) than in slow fibrosers (6.9, 7.5, 6.6) (P < 0.01 all time points). The slope of liver stiffness progression (kPa x month) in rapid fibrosers (0.42) was significantly greater than in slow fibrosers (0.05) (P < 0.001), suggesting two different speeds of liver fibrosis progression. Figures were almost identical for patients with HVPG >or= 6 mmHg or HVPG < 6 mmHg at 1 year after LT. Multivariate analysis identified donor age, bilirubin level, and LSM as independent predictors of fibrosis progression and portal hypertension in the estimation group (n = 50) and were validated in a second group of 34 patients. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve that could identify rapid fibrosers and patients with portal hypertension as early as 6 months after LT were 0.83 and 0.87, respectively, in the estimation group and 0.75 and 0.80, respectively, in the validation group."

We aimed to verify whether monitoring by liver biopsy might be replaced by noninvasive methods and to identify factors associated with fibrosis progression in patients with persistently normal alanine aminotransferases. We studied 40 untreated HCV-RNA-positive subjects (22 male; median age, 44 years), who underwent two liver biopsies, with a median interval of 78.5 months, during which alanine aminotransferase concentrations (median number of determinations: 12) never exceeded 1.2 times the upper normal limit. Within 9 months from the second biopsy, they were tested by the shear elasticity probe (Fibroscan) and the artificial intelligence algorithm FibroTest. METAVIR fibrosis scores were analyzed in relationship to demographic, clinical, and viral parameters. Weighted kappa analysis was used to verify whether the results of noninvasive methods agreed with histology. Significant fibrosis (> or = F2), present at the first biopsy in only one patient (2.5%), was observed at the second biopsy in 14 patients (35%). At multivariate analysis, excess alcohol consumption in the past (>20 g/d; P = .017) and viral load (>8.0 x 10(6) copies/mL; P = .021) were independent predictors of progression. In identifying patients with significant fibrosis, inter-rater agreement was excellent for Fibroscan (weighted kappa = 1.0), and poor for FibroTest (weighted kappa = -0.041). In conclusion, among HCV carriers with NALT, Fibroscan is superior to the FibroTest in the noninvasive identification of fibrosis, for which excess alcohol consumption in the past and high viral load represent risk factors."

CD010542,0,19524169,0,Transient elastography for liver fibrosis diagnosis.,"Liver biopsy is considered the ""golden standard"" for assessment of hepatic fibrosis. However, the procedure has limitations because of inconvenience and rare but serious complications as bleeding. Furthermore, sampling errors are frequent, and interobserver variability often poses problems. Recently, a modified ultrasound scanner (transient elastography) has been developed to assess fibrosis. The device measures liver elasticity, which correlates well with the degree of fibrosis. Studies have shown that transient elastography is more accurate in diagnosing cirrhosis than minor to moderate fibrosis. Most of the studies have been conducted on patients with chronic hepatitis but a few studies have also covered fibrosis and cirrhosis due to other etiologies, and they also demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity.

CD010542,0,22432836,0,Assessment of inflammation and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by imaging-based techniques.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD) is a burgeoning global health problem, and the assessment of disease severity remains a clinical challenge. Conventional imaging and clinical blood tests are frequently unable to determine disease activity (the degree of inflammatory change) and fibrotic severity, while the applicability of histological examination of liver biopsy is limited. Imaging platforms provide liver-specific structural information, while newer applications of these technologies non-invasively exploit the physical and chemical characteristics of liver tissue in health and disease. In this review, conventional and newer imaging-based techniques for the assessment of inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD are discussed in terms of diagnostic accuracy, radio-pathological correlations, and practical considerations. In particular, recent clinical studies of ultrasound (US)-based and magnetic resonance elastography techniques are evaluated, while the potential of contrast-enhanced US and magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques is discussed. The development and application of these techniques is starting to reduce the clinical need for liver biopsy, to produce surrogate end-points for interventional and observational clinical studies, and through this, to provide new insights into the natural history of NAFLD."

We prospectively studied consecutive CHB patients undergoing liver biopsy and transient elastography examinations. Diagnostic performance of LSM for different degrees of liver fibrosis was evaluated. One hundred and sixty-one CHB patients with adequate liver biopsy sample size were studied. Area under receiver operating characteristics curves of LSM for no fibrosis (F0 vs F1-4), bridging fibrosis (F0-2 vs F3-4) and liver cirrhosis (F0-3 vs F4) was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68-0.92), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82-0.93) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89-0.97) respectively. For liver cirrhosis, these optimal cutoff values were 8.4 kPa (98% sensitivity), 9.0 kPa (maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity), 13.4 kPa (94% specificity) and 13.4 kPa (maximum diagnostic accuracy, 85%) respectively. Patients with the same fibrosis staging but higher ALT levels tend to have higher LSM, and the diagnostic performance for low stage fibrosis was most seriously affected when ALT was elevated. Different LSM cutoff values and algorithms were derived for normal and elevated ALT levels. Based on these algorithms, liver biopsy can be avoided in 62% and 58% of patients with normal and elevated ALT respectively. In conclusion, transient elastography is a reasonable noninvasive tool to substitute liver biopsy among the lowest and highest risk patients for the assessment of liver fibrosis."

Transient Elastography (TE) had good discrimination for significant fibrosis (median AUROC: 0.88). Among the serum NIT, APRI had good performance (median AUROC: 0.75). TE performed better than serum (direct and indirect) NIT for significant fibrosis with median AUROC 0.88 (vs. 0.66, P < 0.001), median sensitivity 0.86 (vs. 0.56, P = 0.002), median NPV 0.90 (vs. 0.74, P = 0.05) and median PPV 0.80 (vs. 0.63, P = 0.02). TE compared to indirect serum NIT, had better performance, but was not superior to APRI score. Finally, direct, compared to indirect NIT, were not significantly different except for specificity: median: 0.83 vs. 0.69, respectively, P = 0.04. In conclusion, NIT could become an important tool in clinical management of liver transplant recipients, but whether they can improve clinical practice needs further evidence. Their optimal combination with liver biopsy and assessment of collagen content requires investigation."

The development of clinically significant portal hypertension (defined as a hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥ 10 mmHg) is associated with the development of varices and decompensation and it is something that it is worth testing for. Transient elastography has some value for the prediction of clinically significant portal hypertension, but a large proportion of patients have non-diagnostic values. It has also some value for the diagnosis of varices, but non-invasive markers cannot substitute endoscopic screening in cirrhosis. Better dynamic, easily repeatable non-invasive tools are needed to monitor compensated cirrhosis."

Liver biopsy has a potential sampling error, it is invasive and prone to complications, so it is no longer considered as mandatory as first line screening tools for chronic liver disease. The development of non-invasive biomarkers, FibroTest-ActiTest in 2001 and more recently FibroMax, as well as transient elastography (TE) has changed the management of chronic liver disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the advantages and limits of the available non-invasive biomarkers of liver fibrosis, in comparison with liver biopsy in NAFLD patients."

Unfortunately, liver biopsy continues to be the gold standard for the staging and grading of fibrosis. Liver biopsy is an invasive and painful technique with several limitations. These limitations have led to the development of alternative noninvasive methods for the accurate assessment of fibrosis and for the maintenance of an acceptable risk/benefit ratio. In the last decades, transient elastography (TE) has received increasing consideration as a means of evaluating disease progression in paediatric chronic liver disease. TE is an accurate and reproducible methodology for identifying subjects without fibrosis or significant fibrosis, or with advanced fibrosis. In this review, we provide an outline of liver fibrosis in paediatric liver diseases, including fibrogenesis, and noninvasive techniques for the diagnosis and follow-up of fibrosis, and then focus on the characteristics of TE and on its strength in the assessment of liver fibrosis, paying particular attention to studies conducted in children."

CD010542,0,20196798,0,Proficiency of transient elastography compared to liver biopsy for the assessment of fibrosis in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients.,"Transient elastography (TE) is a noninvasive technique to evaluate liver fibrosis. We compared the performance of TE with liver biopsy (LB) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection. Patients prospectively underwent TE and LB. The diagnosis accuracy of TE was calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for different stages of fibrosis, and optimal cut-off values were defined. A sequential algorithm combining TE with biochemical score (Fibrotest) is proposed. Fifty-seven patients had both TE and LB (median time: 3 days) and two with proven cirrhosis, only TE. Forty-six (78%) were under antiretroviral therapy with anti-HBV drugs in 98%, and 19 (32%) had elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). A significant correlation was observed between liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and METAVIR fibrosis stages (P < 0.0001). Patients with elevated ALT tended to have higher LSM than those with normal ALT. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.85 for significant fibrosis (≥ F2), 0.92 for advanced fibrosis (≥ F3) and 0.96 for cirrhosis. Using a cut-off of 5.9 kPa for F ≥ 2 and 7.6 kPa for F ≥ 3, the diagnosis accuracy was 83% and 86%, respectively. With an algorithm combining TE and Fibrotest, 97% of patients were well classified for significant fibrosis. Using this algorithm, the need for LB can be reduced by 67%. In HIV/HBV-coinfected patients, most of them with normal ALT under antiretroviral treatment including HBV active drugs, TE was proficient in discriminating moderate to severe fibrosis from minimal liver disease."

CD010542,0,19780940,0,Fibrosis staging in chronic hepatitis C: analysis of discordance between transient elastography and liver biopsy.,"In chronic hepatitis C, transient elastography (TE) accurately identifies cirrhosis, but its ability to assess significant fibrosis (Metavir > or = F2) is variable. Constitutional and liver disease-related factors may influence TE and here we examined the variables associated with differences. Three hundred consecutive hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA positive patients had biochemical tests, TE and a biopsy performed on the same day. The Dale model was used to identify the variables associated with discordance between biopsy and elastography results. In 97 patients (34.2%), TE and histological assessment were discordant. Seventy-six of 286 (26.6%) had stage > or =F2 and TE < 7.1 kPa (false negative); 21 of 286 (7.3%) had stage <F2 and TE > or = 7.1 kPa (false positive). No patient with discordant results had cirrhosis. By Dale model, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was found to be the unique variable significantly related (P = 0.046) with discordance between biopsy and TE. Discordance rate was 43.4% (82 patients) with AST < 1.5 x UNL vs 25.8% (25 patients) with AST > or = 1.5 x UNL (P = 0.004). False negative rate was 43.4 (82 patients) with AST < 1.5 x UNL vs 17.1% (13 patients) with AST > or = 1.5 x UNL (P < 0.001). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for F > or = 2, according to AST < 1.5 x UNL vs > or = 1.5 x UNL were 0.738 (95% CI: 0.683-0.812) and 0.854(95% CI: 0.754-0.907). Transient elastography is not adequate on its own to rule out or to rule in significant fibrosis, as it is influenced by major variations in biochemical activity of liver disease. Liver stiffness, at low levels of AST, can underestimate fibrosis."

CD010542,0,20088890,0,Risk factors for advanced liver fibrosis in HIV-infected individuals: role of antiretroviral drugs and insulin resistance.,"Liver damage may result from multiple factors in HIV-infected patients. The availability of reliable noninvasive tools to measure liver fibrosis has permitted the screening of large patient populations. Cross-sectional study of all consecutive HIV outpatients who underwent examination by transient elastometry (FibroScan) at one HIV reference clinic during 2007. Advanced liver fibrosis (ALF) was defined as hepatic stiffness >9.5 kilopascals, which corresponds to Metavir stages F3-F4 in the liver biopsy. A total of 681 consecutive HIV-infected patients (64% injecting drug users; mean age 43; 78% male; 98% on antiretroviral therapy) had at least one valid FibroScan evaluation. ALF was diagnosed in 215 (32%) of them. In the univariate analysis, ALF was significantly associated with older age, low CD4 counts, chronic hepatitis C, past alcohol abuse, elevated ALT, high triglycerides, low cholesterol, high homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index and exposure to didanosine and/or stavudine. In a multivariate model (OR, 95% CI), chronic hepatitis C (2.83, 1.57-5.08), past alcohol abuse (2.26, 1.37-3.74), exposure to didanosine and/or stavudine (1.85, 1.14-3.01), high HOMA index (1.25, 1.04-1.51), older age (1.09, 1.05-1.14) and elevated ALT (1.04, 1.03-1.06) remained as independently associated with ALF.

We also compared the correlation strength of ARFI and TE measurements with liver fibrosis. We included 53 patients with hepatitis B and 107 with hepatitis C in which liver biopsy, ARFI and TE measurements were performed in the same session. The mean LS values measured with ARFI were similar in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C and depended on the stage of fibrosis. The correlation strength of LS measurements by ARFI and by TE with fibrosis was similar in chronic hepatitis B and C patients. In conclusion, for the same stage of fibrosis, the mean LS values by ARFI were similar in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. ARFI had similar predictive value with TE in both chronic viral hepatitis."
CD010542,0,16628644,0,Assessment of biliary fibrosis by transient elastography in patients with PBC and PSC.,"Noninvasive measurement of liver stiffness with transient elastography has been recently validated for the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C. The current study assessed the diagnostic performance of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for the determination of fibrosis stage in chronic cholestatic diseases. One hundred one patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n=73) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC, n=28) were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study. All patients underwent liver biopsy (LB) and LSM. Histological and fibrosis stages were assessed on LB by two pathologists. LSM was performed by transient elastography. Efficiency of LSM for the determination of histological and fibrosis stages were determined by a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Analysis failed in six patients (5.9%) because of unsuitable LB (n=4) or LSM (n=2). Stiffness values ranged from 2.8 to 69.1 kPa (median, 7.8 kPa). LSM was correlated to both fibrosis (Spearman's rho= 0.84, P < .0001) and histological (0.79, P < .0001) stages. These correlations were still found when PBC and PSC patients were analyzed separately. Areas under ROC curves were 0.92 for fibrosis stage (F) > or =2, 0.95 for F > or =3 and 0.96 for F=4. Optimal stiffness cutoff values of 7.3, 9.8, and 17.3 kPa showed F > or =2, F > or =3 and F=4, respectively. LSM and serum hyaluronic acid level were independent parameters associated with extensive fibrosis on LB. In conclusion, transient elastography is a simple and reliable noninvasive means for assessing biliary fibrosis. It should be a promising tool to assess antifibrotic therapies in PBC or PSC."

CD010542,0,17763808,0,[Diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis].,"Liver biopsy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of liver diseases, despite its limitations, such as sampling error and its invasive nature. Given the increasing prevalence ofhepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, new non-invasive methods are being developed as a substitute for liver biopsy. Transient elastography (Fibroscan), which measures the stiffness of the liver by means of ultrasound as a measure of fibrosis and cirrhosis, is simple to perform and the inter- and intra-observer variability is small. The accuracy, in relation to liver biopsy, is high in discriminating between cirrhosis and fibrosis, but lower for discriminating between the different stages offibrosis. The Fibrotest is the most investigated combination of serum markers for fibrosis. Its accuracy is lower than that ofa liver biopsy. In the years to come, more research by various independent research groups is needed with the Fibroscan method and the combination of serum markers in different groups of patients and with standardised cut-off points; these must be compared with liver biopsies of sufficient length. In this way, the value of these non-invasive methods can be evaluated. A possible future role for serum markers is to combine them with the Fibroscan, whereby a discrepancy between the different tests could be an indication for a liver biopsy."
CD010542,0,21517974,0,Non-invasive assessment of fibrosis in liver grafts due to hepatitis C virus recurrence.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become the most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States and Europe. Recurrence of HCV is universal in all liver graft recipients, but the natural history of the disease is variable with some patients displaying slowly progressive liver injury, while approximately 30% become cirrhotic within five yr of surgery. Currently, liver biopsy is the reference standard to assess liver injury in the post-transplant setting. But biopsy is associated with complications such as bleeding and pain, as well as the risk of sampling error and discordance in reporting between histopathologists. Thus, as in the pre-transplant setting, there is increasing attention being drawn to the use of non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis. This review examines the role of non-invasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis in the post-transplant setting including simple tests such as aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, the Benlloch formula, London Transplant Centre score, and finally transient elastography. The authors assess the respective advantages and disadvantages of the tests and consider how non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis can be utilized in the future management of post-transplant HCV infection."

However, there is limited previous in vivo research on the correlation between spleen stiffness and stages of liver fibrosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of spleen stiffness measurement (SSM), using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) technology, for liver fibrosis assessment. Eligible patients with chronic hepatitis B or C (n = 163) underwent concurrent liver stiffness measurement (LSM), SSM and percutaneous liver biopsy. Receiver operating characteristic curves estimated the diagnostic performance of SSM, with multiple linear regression models for LSM and SSM determining the significance of explanatory factors. Results indicated significant correlation between LSM and SSM (R(2) = 0.574, P < 0.0001). Using SSM to classify METAVIR fibrosis (METAVIR F) scores, the areas under curves were 0.839 (95% CI: 0.780-0.898) for METAVIR F1 vs F2-4, 0.936 (95% CI: 0.898-0.975) for F1-2 vs F3-4 and 0.932 (95% CI: 0.893-0.971) for F1-3 vs F4, all P < 0.001.

Various techniques are already in routine use, such as grey-scale imaging, Doppler US, and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), while newer techniques such as elastography and hepatic vein transit time (HVTT) have the potential to exclude patients without significant fibrosis or cirrhosis; however, they are operator dependent and require specific software. Grey-scale imaging may demonstrate changes, such as volume redistribution, capsule nodularity, parenchymal nodularity, and echotexture changes. The Doppler findings in the hepatic and portal veins, hepatic artery, and varices allow assessment of liver cirrhosis. However, the operator needs to be aware of limitations of these techniques. Low mechanical index CEUS plays an important role in the assessment of complications of cirrhosis, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein thrombus.

These patients were investigated at the Georgian-French joint hepatology clinic ""Hepa"" from November 2007, till November 2008. Among investigated HBV infected 105 patients 65 (61.9%) had no fibrosis (LS<5.5 kpa), 23 (21.9%) had mild fibrosis (LS-5.5-8.0 kpa), 9 (8.6%) had severe fibrosis (LS-8.0-14.0 kpa) and 8 (7.6%) had liver cirrhosis (LS>14.0 kpa). Among investigated HCV infected 525 patients 200 (38.1%) had no fibrosis (LS<5.5 kpa), 139 (26.5%) patients had mild fibrosis (LS-5.5-8.0 kpa), 87 (16.5%) patients had severe fibrosis (LS-8.0-14.0 kpa) and 99 (18.9%) patients had liver cirrhosis. It is concluded that transient elastography (TE) using Fibroscan is simple, non-invasive, reliable and easily reproducible method for assessing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection. TE is characterized with an excellent accuracy. TE results are well correlated with the clinical signs as well as with the results of laboratory and instrumental investigations. Fibrosis stages by Metavir measured using Fibroscan well corresponds with the liver biopsy results. Considering the high prevalence of fibrosis and cirrhosis among patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection, TE is a very valuable method for detecting early stages of fibrosis allowing to avoid the progression of liver damage, as well as end-stage liver disease.

The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate the long-term effect of successful antiviral treatment, using LSM, in HCV-infected patients with inherited bleeding disorders. The LSM were performed in 2005 (LSM 1) and 2009 (LSM 2) in 39 patients who were successfully treated for HCV. The change in liver fibrosis between LSM 1 and 2 was assessed. The median duration of HCV infection was 28.8 years. A total of 22 patients (56%) underwent successful antiviral treatment before LSM 1 (group 1), and 17 patients between LSM 1 and LSM 2 (group 2). The median time since antiviral treatment was 8.8 years in group 1 and 2.5 years in group 2. In group 1, the median results of LSM 1 and 2 were similar (6.0 vs. 5.6 kPa, P-value 0.36), so overall, patients remained stable. In three patients in this group, all treated more than 15 years ago, an increase of liver stiffness was shown. Group 2 showed a significant improvement in median LSM results (10.3 vs. 6.1 kPa, P-value <0.01), with decrease of liver stiffness in 82%. Even after a long HCV infection duration, successful antiviral treatment led to a significant improvement of fibrosis, measured by LSM, mainly in the first few years after completing treatment."

Although progression to cirrhosis is accelerated and occurs more frequently in patients who acquire the infection in old age, this outcome is often not seen because most elderly infected patients acquired HCV when they were young. Data on progression of HCV infection to cirrhosis and eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma are often derived from studies of HCV-infected individuals who present or are referred to hospitals, and which are therefore likely to overestimate the seriousness of the disease; indeed, population-based studies indicate that in many elderly individuals the disease is asymptomatic and runs a fairly benign course. Treatment is based on use of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin, and is overall less effective and more toxic in the elderly. Therefore, treatment should be carefully considered on an individual basis and proposed only in patients up to the age of 75 years with a significant risk of progression of liver disease, no serious co-morbidities and good life expectancy. All treated patients should be followed long term in order to assess the influence of therapy on the evolution of liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) and survival. It is hoped that liver biopsy, which is still required in order to assess prognosis appropriately, will be replaced in the future by less invasive methods based on combinations of biochemical markers of fibrosis and/or transient elastography, and that newer and less toxic orally administered drugs for HCV infection will become available."

Scores must be used only in the circumstances for which they have been validated. Scores for the Fibrotest-Actitest have been studied and validated most widely. Fibroscan, an imaging technique that uses transient elastrography to measures liver stiffness, has been validated acceptably for management of hepatitis C (HCV). General practitioners can order Fibroscan testing to assess the extent of hepatic lesions in patients with chronic HCV. Fibrotest and/or Fibroscan testing may replace liver biopsy in patients who can then receive first-or second-line treatment for HCV, regardless of genotype or transaminase levels. In the future, treatment decisions will probably rely on a combination (after validation) of these scores and on the development of genetic markers for fibrogenesis, to differentiate between patients highly likely and unlikely to develop serious fibrosis."
CD010542,0,19502649,0,Non-invasive assessment of fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. It currently affects approximately 30% of adults and 10% of children and adolescents. The resulting increase in the number of patients with NAFLD is expected to translate into increased numbers of patients with liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this context, it is particularly important to identify patients at risk for progressive chronic liver disease. Currently, liver biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to establish the presence and stage of fibrosis. Due to the remarkable increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and the concomitant efforts in developing novel therapies for patients with NASH, non-invasive, simple, reproducible, and reliable non-invasive methodologies are needed. This paper provides a concise overview of the role of non-invasive diagnostic tools for the determination of presence and extent of fibrosis in NAFLD patients, with particular emphasis on the methods currently available in clinical practice."

Various methods have been investigated in the recent years, including imaging methods like ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, different forms of liver stiffness measurement, various biomarkers of necroinflammatory processes (acute phase reactants, cytokines, markers of apoptosis), hyaluronic acid and other biomarkers of liver fibrosis. Multicomponent tests, scoring systems and diagnostic panels were also developed with the purposes of differentiating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis from simple steatosis or discriminating between various fibrosis stages. In all of the cases, performance of noninvasive methods was compared with liver biopsy, which is still considered to be a gold standard in diagnosis, but is by itself far from a perfect comparative measure.

CD010542,0,19022517,0,Can imaging modalities diagnose and stage hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis accurately?,"The accurate diagnosis and staging of hepatic fibrosis is crucial for prognosis and treatment of liver disease. The current gold standard, liver biopsy, cannot be used for population-based screening, and has well known drawbacks if used for monitoring of disease progression or treatment success. Our objective was to assess performance and promise of radiologic modalities and techniques as alternative, noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis. A systematic review was conducted. Six hundred twenty-eight studies were identified via electronic search. One hundred fifty-three papers were reviewed. Most described techniques that could differentiate between cirrhosis or severe fibrosis and normal liver. Accurate staging of fibrosis or diagnosis of mild fibrosis was often not achievable. Ultrasonography is the most common modality used in the diagnosis and staging of hepatic fibrosis. Elastographic measurements, either ultrasonography-based or magnetic resonance-based, and magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging, show the most promise for accurate staging of hepatic fibrosis. Most currently available imaging techniques can detect cirrhosis or significant fibrosis reasonably accurately. However, to date only magnetic resonance elastography has been able to stage fibrosis or diagnose mild disease. Utrasonographic elastography and magnetic resonance diffusion weighted appear next most promising."

A variety of methods including the measurement of liver stiffness, using transient elastography, and serum markers, ranging from routine laboratory tests to more complex algorithms or indices combining the results of panels of markers, have been proposed. Among serum indices, Fibrotest has been the most extensively studied and validated. Transient elastography appears as a promising method but has been mostly validated in chronic hepatitis C with performance equivalent to that of serum markers for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis. The combination of both approaches as first-line assessment of liver fibrosis could avoid the performance of liver biopsy in the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis C, a strategy that deserves further evaluation in patients with hepatitis B or HIV-HCV coinfection. Transient elastography also appears to be an excellent tool for early detection of cirrhosis and may have prognostic value in this setting. Guidelines are now awaited for the use of noninvasive methods in clinical practice."

Liver biopsy is not always necessary.,"Needle biopsy of the liver is considered the ""gold-standard"" for diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, it is not risk-free, lacks accuracy, and is poorly accepted by some patients. This review examines available literature on the use and diagnostic performance of non-invasive methods for assessment of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in adults, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. Transient elastography (FibroScan) measures liver stiffness in kilopascals. The results are less reliable in patients with a thick chest wall, hepatic congestion of cardiac origin, and acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Transient elastography has been evaluated in more than 8000 patients, most of whom had chronic hepatitis C. With a cutoff value of about 7-8 kPa, elastography identified about 70% of patients with histological signs of moderate to severe fibrosis. With a cutoff of 14-15 kPa, it identified about 85% of patients with histological signs of cirrhosis. Transient elastography is reliable in detecting moderate to severe fibrosis and cirrhosis and in ruling out cirrhosis, but is less reliable in ruling out moderate fibrosis. Composite scores based on blood assay values and complex calculations are unreliable when at least one of the score components is influenced by intercurrent conditions. FibroTest, FibroMeter and Hepascore have been tested in several thousand patients with chronic hepatitis C. With the manufacturers' recommended cutoff values, FibroTest identifies about 70% of patients with histological signs of moderate to severe fibrosis and about 90% of patients with histological signs of cirrhosis. It can reliably diagnose or rule out moderate fibrosis, and diagnose cirrhosis. It is also very reliable in ruling out cirrhosis. Hepascore has similar diagnostic performance. FibroMeter has been less extensively evaluated but also seems to have diagnostic performance similar to that of FibroTest. Some studies suggest that FibroTest has similar accuracy in forms of liver fibrosis other than chronic hepatitis C. In practice, the main issue involved in making therapeutic decisions in patients with chronic hepatitis C is the risk-benefit balance of available treatments rather than precise diagnosis of fibrosis."
CD010542,0,21497746,0,Invasive and non-invasive methods for the assessment of fibrosis and disease progression in chronic liver disease.,"Chronic liver diseases represent a major public health problem, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Their prognosis and management greatly depend on the amount and progression of liver fibrosis with the risk of developing cirrhosis. Liver biopsy, traditionally considered as the reference standard for staging of fibrosis, has been challenged over the past decade by the development of novel non invasive methodologies. These methods rely on two distinct but complementary approaches: i) a 'biological' approach based on the dosage of serum biomarkers of fibrosis; ii) a 'physical' approach based on the measurement of liver stiffness using transient elastography (TE). Non invasive methods have been initially studied and validated in chronic hepatitis C but are now increasingly used in other chronic liver diseases, resulting in a significant decrease in the need for liver biopsy. However, they will likely not completely abolish the need for liver biopsy and they should rather be employed as an integrated system with liver biopsy. This review is aimed at discussing the advantages and inconveniences of non invasive methods in comparison with liver biopsy for the management of patients with chronic liver diseases."

CD010542,0,20206870,0,HCV carriers with normal alanine aminotransferase levels: healthy persons or severely ill patients? Dealing with an everyday clinical problem.,"Approximately 30% of patients with chronic HCV infection show persistently normal ALT levels. Although formerly referred to as 'healthy' or 'asymptomatic' HCV carriers, and thus historically excluded from antiviral treatment, it has now become clear that the majority of these patients have some degree of histological liver damage that may be significant in up to 20% of patients and might progress toward a more severe degree of liver fibrosis. A significant proportion of patients (> or =20%) experience periods of increased serum ALT (flare) associated with enhanced disease progression. However, controversies still exist in clinical practice regarding the definition of 'persistent' ALT normality, the virological and histological features of these subjects, the need for liver biopsy, the role of non invasive tools for the assessment of liver fibrosis (transient hepatic elastography, fibroscan), and the natural history and optimal management of chronic hepatitis C with normal ALT. The advent of new therapeutic options (pegylated interferons plus ribavirin) has shifted treatment targets toward eradication of underlying infection, with therapy decision based on age, severity of disease and likelihood of response rather than on aminotransferase levels. This review does approach the main unresolved issues on this topic in the form of a dialog between a hepatologist and a patient with HCV infection but normal alanine aminotransferase levels, trying to give evidence-based answers to the more frequently asked questions from patients and their physicians."

This work aims to evaluate a new noninvasive device to quantify liver fibrosis: the shear elasticity probe or fibroscan. This device is based on one-dimensional (1-D) transient elastography, a technique that uses both ultrasound (US) (5 MHz) and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic waves, whose propagation velocity is directly related to elasticity. The intra- and interoperator reproducibility of the technique, as well as its ability to quantify liver fibrosis, were evaluated in 106 patients with chronic hepatitis C. Liver elasticity measurements were reproducible (standardized coefficient of variation: 3%), operator-independent and well correlated (partial correlation coefficient = 0.71, p < < 0.0001) to fibrosis grade (METAVIR). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.88 and 0.99 for the diagnosis of patients with significant fibrosis (>/= F2) and with cirrhosis ( = F4), respectively.

Therefore, accurate noninvasive tests for liver injury are urgently needed. During the last years, transient elastography (Fibroscan®) has been proposed for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, by measuring liver stiffness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness, objectivity and safety of this technique. We included 68 patients who underwent a liver biopsy in the last 18 months with a wide spectrum of chronic liver diseases. All procedures as well as the liver biopsies according to the METAVIR scoring system were analyzed by the same sonographer and the same specialist in pathology, respectively.

However, its overall test performance in various settings remains unknown. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis of studies comparing ultrasound-based TE to liver biopsy for the detection of hepatic fibrosis due to a recurrent HCV infection after LT. Electronic and manual bibliographic searches (including scientific abstracts) were performed to identify potential studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to generate pooled estimates of the sensitivity values, specificity values, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios of individual studies. The extent of the heterogeneity and the reasons for it were assessed. Six fully published studies were identified for analysis. Five studies that evaluated significant fibrosis were identified. Among these studies, the pooled estimates were 83% for sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI) = 77%-88%], 83% for specificity (95% CI = 77%-88%), 4.95 for the positive likelihood ratio (95% CI = 3.4-7.2), 0.17 for the negative likelihood ratio (95% CI = 0.09-0.35), and 30.5 for the diagnostic odds ratio (95% CI = 12.8-72.4). For the 5 studies that assessed cirrhosis, the pooled estimates were 98% for sensitivity (95% CI = 90%-100%), 84% for specificity (95% CI = 80%-88%), 7 for the positive likelihood ratio (95% CI = 2.8-17.3), 0.06 for the negative likelihood ratio (95% CI = 0.02-0.19), and 130 for the diagnostic odds ratio (95% CI = 36.5-462.1). A diagnostic threshold (or cutoff value) bias was identified as an important cause of heterogeneity for the pooled results of both patient groups. In conclusion, ultrasound-based TE has excellent diagnostic accuracy for identifying cirrhosis due to a recurrent HCV infection after LT. The detection of significant fibrosis is more accurate for these patients versus patients whose native liver is chronically infected with HCV."

CD010542,0,22345333,0,Transient elastography in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a relevant issue in public health owing to its epidemiological burden. It represents the most common chronic liver disease in the general population and is expected to increase in future as a result of an ageing population. Liver biopsy is still considered the ""gold standard"" for distinguishing the broad range of NAFLD. However, liver biopsy is often not recommended in the NAFLD patients, because of its cost, the potential risk of bleeding and the absence of consensus regarding the histopathological criteria that firmly differentiate between the NAFLD entities. Due to the remarkable increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and the concomitant efforts in developing novel therapies, a non-invasive, simple and reproducible technique is needed in the clinical practice. Transient elastography is a non-invasive technique for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) as a function of the extent of hepatic fibrosis. This review focuses on practical issues in the use of LSM in the NAFLD patients and suggests areas for further research and development."

For this reason, assessment of liver damage using non-invasive methods is currently an important topic in hepatology. The aim of the study was to evaluate liver fibrosis/cirrhosis using Transient Elastography and FibroTest/FibroMax in patients with chronic HCV and HBV infection in Georgia and to compare Fibroscan and FibroTest/FibroMax results. 252 patients were included in the study, among them 185 with chronic HCV infection and 67 with chronic HBV infection. These patients were investigated at the Georgian-French Joint Hepatology Clinic ""Hepa"", from December 2007 to November 2008. In patients with chronic HCV or HBV infection Fibroscan and Fibrotest/FibroMax results were correlated in 127 (68.6%) and 45 (67.2%) cases, respectively. Discordance in one degree of fibrosis stage was found in 36 (19.5%) patients with chronic HCV infection and in 14 (20.9%) patients with chronic HBV infection. Discordance in more then one degree of fibrosis stage was found in 22 (11.9%) and 8 (11.9%) cases. In patients with Fibroscan and Fibrotest/FibroMax concordant results liver biopsy might be avoided. Fibroscan and Fibrotest/Max appear to be very valuable methods for detecting early stages of fibrosis among patients with chronic HCV and HBV infection, allowing to avoid the progression of liver damage, as well as end-stage liver disease. These methods are easy to perform and therefore allows regular follow-up of the course of LF."
CD010542,0,19477552,0,[Utility of Fibroscan in the evaluation of liver fibrosis].,"Chronic liver diseases produce a progressive accumulation of collagenous fiber in the liver parenchyma. For years, liver biopsy has been the gold standard to quantify liver fibrosis. Currently, non-invasive alternatives are available to quantify fibrosis. Transient elastography (TE) or Fibroscan quantifies liver rigidity, which is proportional to the grade of liver fibrosis. Studies are available that have evaluated the reliability and limitations of TE in healthy individuals, in patients with acute hepatitis, in distinct chronic liver diseases and in liver transplant recipients. TE is reliable for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (F4) and significant fibrosis (F2) but its values may vary according to the patient's characteristics and the etiology of the disease. TE can avoid liver biopsy in 90% of patients with cirrhosis and in up to 70% of those with significant fibrosis when combined with other non-invasive methods."

CD010542,0,16823833,0,Transient elastography for diagnosis of advanced fibrosis and portal hypertension in patients with hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation.,"Recurrence of hepatitis C after liver transplantation (LT) is the main cause of graft loss and retransplantation. Frequent liver biopsies are essential to follow-up hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced liver damage. However, liver biopsy is an invasive and expensive procedure. We evaluated prospectively the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive measurement of liver stiffness (by transient elastography) to assess the severity of hepatitis C recurrence after LT. For this purpose, we included 124 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who underwent 169 liver biopsies and 129 hepatic hemodynamic studies with determination of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). Simultaneously, patients underwent measurement of liver stiffness. Liver fibrosis was mild (F0-F1) in 96 cases (57%) and significant (F2-F4) in 73 (43%). HVPG was normal (<6 mm Hg) in 69 cases (54%) and elevated (>or=6 mm Hg) in 60 (46%). Using a liver stiffness cutoff value of 8.5 kilopascals, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for diagnosis of fibrosis >or=F2 were 90%, 81%, 79%, and 92%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosis of fibrosis >or=F2, >or=F3 and F4 were 0.90, 0.93, and 0.98, respectively. There was a close direct correlation between liver stiffness and HVPG (Pearson coefficient, 0.84; P < 0.001) and the AUC for diagnosis of portal hypertension (HVPG >or=6 mm Hg) was 0.93. Importantly, none of the individuals with liver stiffness below the cutoff value had either bridging fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) or significant portal hypertension (HVPG >or=10 mm Hg). In conclusion, determination of liver stiffness is an extremely valuable tool to assess the severity of HCV recurrence after LT and in reducing the need of follow-up liver biopsies."

In view of this objective, LSM was performed by transient elastography (TE) using FibroScan in 437 healthy subjects with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, recruited from a free-living population of the Birbhum Population Project (BIRPOP; www.shds.in), a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), and from 274 patients with liver disease attending the Hepatology Clinic of the School of Digestive and Liver Diseases (SDLD; Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education & Research [IPGME&R], Kolkata, India) including 188 with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 86 with chronic hepatitis of viral and other etiologies. Liver biopsy was performed in 125 patients. The range of normal values for LSM, defined by 5th and 95th percentile values in healthy subjects, was 3.2 and 8.5 kPa, respectively. Healthy subjects with a lower body mass index (BMI; < <18.5 kg/m(2)) had a higher LSM compared with subjects who had a normal BMI; this LSM value was comparable to that of obese subjects (6.05 ± 1.78 versus 5.51 ± 1.59 and 6.60 ± 1.21, P = 0.016 and 0.349, respectively). Liver disease patients without histologic fibrosis had significantly higher LSM values compared with healthy subjects (7.52 ± 5.49 versus 5.63 ± 1.64, P < 0.001). Among the histologic variables, stage of fibrosis was the only predictor for LSM. LSM did not correlate with inflammatory activity and ALT in both NAFLD and chronic hepatitis groups."

Here, we investigated the potential usefulness of transient elastography (TE) in the noninvasive evaluation of liver fibrosis stage and disease progression in PBC. We performed, first, a prospective performance analysis of TE for the diagnosis of METAVIR fibrosis stages in a diagnostic cohort of 103 patients and, second, a retrospective longitudinal analysis of repeated examinations in a monitoring cohort of 150 patients followed-up for up to 5 years. All patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. Diagnostic thresholds of liver stiffness in discriminating fibrosis stages ≥ F1, ≥ F2, ≥ F3, and =F4 were 7.1, 8.8, 10.7, and 16.9 kPa, respectively. TE showed high performance and was significantly superior to biochemical markers (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/platelet ratio, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and Mayo score) in diagnosing significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, or cirrhosis. Analysis of the monitoring cohort data set using generalized linear models showed the following: (1) an overall progression rate of 0.48 ± 0.21 kPa/year (P = 0.02) and (2) no significant progression in patients with F0-F1, F2, or F3 stages, but a significant increase (4.06 ± 0.72 kPa/year; P < 0.0001) in cirrhotic patients.

CD010542,0,19709363,0,An evaluation of transient elastography in the discrimination of HBeAg-negative disease from inactive hepatitis B carriers.,"Liver biopsy is frequently required in HBeAg-negative disease to determine the stage of fibrosis. It can be difficult to distinguish cohorts with undetectable HBeAg who may have varying degrees of fibrosis due to different stages of disease. We have assessed the utility of transient elastography (TE) to evaluate differences in HBeAg-negative patients. A total of 220 HBsAg-positive individuals were studied: 125 (group 1) had an inactive HBsAg carrier state and 95 (group 2) were HBeAg-negative, anti-HBe-positive patients with persistently or intermittent elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or HBV DNA >10(5) copies/mL. Mean stiffness was 4.83 +/- 1.2 kPa in group 1 vs 8.53 +/- 6 kPa in group 2 (P < 0.001); statistically significant differences were also found between AST/ULN ALT/ULN ratios, HBV DNA in group 1 vs group 2, respectively (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the only variable independently associated with the stage of fibrosis was the stiffness. This study shows that mean hepatic stiffness by elastography is significantly lower in patients with inactive hepatitis B compared to those with HBeAg-negative disease. The procedure is a useful adjunct to diagnosis to confirm a clinical pattern of disease, and for more selective use of liver biopsy before considering antiviral therapy."

We measured the level of PBF in patients with chronic hepatitis C by enrolling 70 patients affected with chronic hepatitis C, 20 patients with HCV-positive decompensated cirrhosis and 30 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent liver biopsy and Fibroscan for fibrosis assessment. Patients with chronic hepatitis C had significantly higher levels of PBF in comparison with healthy individuals and decompensated cirrhotics. Patients in the F0-F1 stage had a percentage of PBF of 23.3+/-4%, significantly lower (p<0.001) than in F2 and F3 stages. Patients in the F4 stage had a PBF rate of 50.6+/-2% (p<0.001 versus the F0, F1 and F2 stages). The percentage of PBF correlated positively with the Metavir score and the liver stiffness as measured by Fibroscan.

CD010542,0,21039302,0,Meta-analysis: natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests for liver disease severity.,"BACKGROUND. NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis (SS) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The natural history of NAFLD and the optimal strategy to identify subjects with progressive liver disease are unclear. Objectives. To assess the evidence in: (1) natural history of NAFLD; and (2) non-invasive methods to differentiate NAFLD histological subtypes. DESIGN AND SETTING. Among 4185 articles published on MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Pubmed, national and International meeting abstracts through July 2010, 40 articles assessing the natural history of NAFLD and 32 articles evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests against liver biopsy (LB) were included. MEASUREMENTS. Two reviewers retrieved articles and evaluated study quality by appropriate scores. Main outcomes were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models. RESULTS. NAFLD has an increased overall mortality (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.18-2.10), deriving from liver-related and cardiovascular disease, and a 2-fold risk of diabetes. Compared to SS, NASH has a higher liver-related (OR for NASH: 5.71, 2.31-14.13; OR for NASH with advanced fibrosis: 10.06, 4.35-23.25), but not cardiovascular mortality (OR: 0.91, 0.42-1.98). Three non-invasive methods received independent validation: pooled AUROC, sensitivity and specificity of cytokeratin-18 for NASH are 0.82 (0.78-0.88), 0.78 (0.64-0.92), 0.87 (0.77-0.98). For NASH with advanced fibrosis, pooled AUROC, sensitivity and specificity of NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibroscan are 0.85 (0.80-0.93), 0.90 (0.82-0.99), 0.97 (0.94-0.99) and 0.94 (0.90-0.99), 0.94 (0.88-0.99) and 0.95 (0.89-0.99). CONCLUSIONS. NAFLD warrants screening for cardio-metabolic risk and for progressive liver disease. The combination of three noninvasive tests with LB may optimally individuate patients with NASH, with or without advanced fibrosis."

CD010542,0,19959511,0,MR imaging of liver fibrosis: current state of the art.,"Chronic liver disease is a major public health problem worldwide. Liver fibrosis, a common feature of almost all causes of chronic liver disease, involves the accumulation of collagen, proteoglycans, and other macromolecules within the extracellular matrix. Fibrosis tends to progress, leading to hepatic dysfunction, portal hypertension, and ultimately cirrhosis. Liver biopsy, the standard of reference for diagnosing liver fibrosis, is invasive, costly, and subject to complications and sampling variability. These limitations make it unsuitable for diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring in the general population. Thus, development of a noninvasive, accurate, and reproducible test for diagnosis and monitoring of liver fibrosis would be of great value. Conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques have limited capability to demonstrate liver fibrosis. In clinical practice, imaging studies are usually reserved for evaluation of the presence of portal hypertension or hepatocellular carcinoma in cases that have progressed to cirrhosis. In response to the rising prevalence of chronic liver diseases in Western nations, a number of imaging-based methods including ultrasonography-based transient elastography, computed tomography-based texture analysis, and diverse magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based techniques have been proposed for noninvasive diagnosis and grading of hepatic fibrosis across its entire spectrum of severity. State-of-the-art MR imaging-based techniques in current practice and in development for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis include conventional contrast material-enhanced MR imaging, double contrast-enhanced MR imaging, MR elastography, diffusion-weighted imaging, and MR perfusion imaging."

CD010542,0,21129129,0,Impact of liver steatosis on the correlation between liver stiffness and fibrosis measured by transient elastography in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus.,"We assessed the effect of different hepatic conditions such as fibrosis, steatosis and necroinflammatory activity on liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. We studied all consecutive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who underwent liver biopsy and elastography between January 2007 and December 2008. Liver fibrosis was staged following METAVIR Cooperative Study Group criteria. Steatosis was categorized according to the percentage of affected hepatocytes as low (≤10%), moderate (<25%) and severe (≥25%). A total of 110 patients were included. Fibrosis was distributed by stage as follows: F0, n = 13; F1, n = 47; F2, n = 29; F3, n = 18; and F4, n = 3. Liver biopsy revealed the presence of hepatic steatosis in 68 patients (low to moderate, n = 53; and severe n = 15). By univariate regression analysis, fibrosis, necroinflammatory activity, and the degree of steatosis were correlated with liver stiffness. However, in a multiple regression analysis, steatosis and fibrosis were the only independent variables significantly associated with liver stiffness. With a cut-off of 9.5 kPa to distinguish patients with F ≤ 2 from F ≥ 3, elastography led to a significantly higher number of misclassification errors (25%vs 5%; P = 0.014), most of which were false positives for F ≥ 3.

Antiviral treatment is only effective in 50% of these patients and is often accompanied by serious side effects. Consequently, careful selection of patients for treatment is warranted. Liver biopsies are generally not performed in these patients because of increased bleeding risk and high costs. We therefore assessed liver fibrosis and cirrhosis non-invasively using liver stiffness measurement (LSM)."

CD010542,0,20969464,0,Noncirrhotic portal hypertension in HIV-infected patients: a case control evaluation and review of the literature.,"Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) is an infrequent but possibly underestimated cryptogenetic liver disease recently described in small series of HIV-infected patients. The exposure to antiretroviral drugs, a direct role of HIV itself, microbial translocation from the gut, or a thrombophilic propensity have been suggested as possible pathogenic mechanisms. In this case control study, we describe 11 HIV-infected patients with idiopathic NCPH and compare the activity of protein C and S, and soluble CD14 levels (a surrogate marker of the translocation of intestinal bacterial products) with 10 age- and gender-matched HIV-infected controls with no liver disease. The clinical presentation of the 11 patients with NCPH was characterised by acute variceal bleeding (2/11), ascites (2/11), portal thrombosis (2/11), and ultrasonographic and endoscopic signs of portal hypertension (11/11), with slightly high alanine transaminase (ALT) and γglutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) levels. The FibroScan median liver stiffness was 8.1 kPa, which is inconsistent with significant fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia was diagnosed in the 5 patients who underwent liver biopsy. The NCPH patients showed no impairment of hepatic synthesis, but had lower serum albumin levels and a higher international normalized ratio (INR) than the controls (p = 0.01), and lower protein C and S activity, although within the normal range (p = 0.02 and 0.3, respectively). No significant difference in soluble CD14 was seen between the two groups. In conclusion, the etiology of NCHP is not still established, but in order to prevent the dramatic complications of portal hypertension, all HIV-infected patients with unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities or thrombocytopenia should be considered for further investigations by means of thrombophilic screening, Doppler ultrasound evaluation, and in the presence of portal hypertension, endoscopy and liver biopsy."

The role of TE in patients with beta-thalassemia has not been extensively investigated. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of TE in the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in 115 adult patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) (#59) or intermedia (TI) (#56). TE was performed according to current practice. Histologic data were obtained in 14 cases. Liver iron concentration was assessed by atomic absorption spectrometry and T2 magnetic resonance. In patients with TM, the proportion of anti-HCV positive viremic patients, median serum ferritin levels, and TE values were significantly higher than in TI. In the group of 14 patients who underwent liver biopsy, a significant positive correlation was observed between liver stiffness and fibrosis stage (r = 0.73, P = 0.003). Severe fibrosis is diagnosed with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 89%, whereas cirrhosis is detected with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92%. At multivariate analysis, the variables independently associated with TE were ALT, GGT, and bilirubin levels in both groups and, in patients with TM, HCV RNA positivity. In beta-thalassemia patients, TE is a reliable tool for assessing liver fibrosis even if the influence of iron overload has to be clarified."
CD010542,0,19195629,0,Non-invasive diagnosis of steatosis and fibrosis.,"The prognosis and management of liver disease greatly depends on the amount of liver fibrosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is emerging as a major cause of liver disease in Western countries because of the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. A key issue in patients with NAFLD is the differentiation of NASH from simple steatosis. It is particularly important to identify NASH patients as they are at greatest risk of developing complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The limitations of liver biopsy (invasive procedure, sampling errors, interobserver variability and non-dynamic fibrosis evaluation) have stimulated the search for non-invasive approaches for the assessment of steatosis and liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A variety of methods, including serum markers, imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT, MRI and measurement of liver stiffness by transient elastography, have been proposed for the non-invasive assessment of steatosis and hepatic fibrosis. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of these different methods in clinical practice."

CD010542,0,21344353,0,Assessment of fibrosis and cirrhosis in liver biopsies: an update.,"The liver biopsy specimen represents valuable material for the assessment of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Despite limitations related to sampling and interpretation, histologic examination remains the gold standard for staging chronic liver diseases. Hepatic fibrosis is currently viewed as a dynamic process that may often regress after successful treatment of chronic liver diseases. Even the excess fibrous tissue of cirrhotic livers may sometimes regress over time. Distinguishing between the amount of hepatic fibrosis and the disease stage is important for the assessment of the effects of antifibrotic treatments. Recent studies suggest that the proportion of the liver biopsy specimen occupied by collagen is correlated with the hepatic venous pressure gradient in liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C virus infection, with or without cirrhosis, and represents a predictor of clinical decompensation. This parameter has also been found to correlate with liver stiffness measurements of patients with chronic viral hepatitis obtained by transient elastography. Therefore, quantitative assessment of hepatic fibrosis in liver biopsy specimens holds promise as a prognostic marker, and as a means to validate noninvasive markers of fibrosis."

The tendency to substitute histopathological analysis of liver biopsies with complex, surrogate 'noninvasive' measures of disease progression has grown to such a level that clarification and guidance on their use is needed. This Review provides an overview of the proposed noninvasive diagnostic methodologies and their possible integration with the standard invasive procedures used for the evaluation of disease progression (i.e. liver biopsy and the measurement of portal pressure). A concise analysis of what has been proposed for the differentiation of simple fatty liver from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and its possible fibrogenic evolution is also included. In particular, the Review focuses on the methods easily available as part of daily clinical practice in hepatology--biochemical markers and transient elastography (i.e. liver stiffness measurement)."

CD010542,0,18494155,0,[The liver and methotrexate].,"Methotrexate is proposed for the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. The liver toxicity of methotrexate has been investigated and prolonged treatment can induce liver fibrosis. Moreover, alcohol consumption, diabetes and obesity are associated with liver fibrosis in patients treated with this drug. Therefore, liver fibrosis associated with methotrexate could be due to associated factors instead of methotrexate itself. Recommendations to monitor and diagnose methotrexate induced liver damage vary depending on the disease. Frequent evaluation of liver fibrosis with liver biopsy is recommended during therapy, especially in patients treated for psoriasis. Noninvasive methods, such as the FibroScan, could be useful for the assessment of liver fibrosis associated with methotrexate and hence, need further evaluation."

CD010542,0,21435119,0,Previously unrecognized advanced liver disease unveiled by transient elastography in patients with Haemophilia and chronic hepatitis C.,"Before the introduction of viral inactivation procedures and viral screening of plasma-products, haemophiliacs were at high risk of infection with HCV. Those who acquired HCV infection in the 1980s, and are still alive today, may have developed significant liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, liver biopsy has not routinely been utilized in the evaluation of haemophiliacs with HCV in Denmark. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of significant fibrosis/cirrhosis among haemophiliacs as evaluated by transient elastography (TE). Cross-sectional investigation of adult patients with haemophilia A or B. TE with liver stiffness measurements (LSM) ≥ 8 kPa were repeated after 4-6 weeks. Significant fibrosis and cirrhosis was defined as measurements ≥ 8 kPa or ≥ 12 kPa respectively. Among 307 patients with haemophilia A or B registered at the two Haemophilia centres, 141(46%) participate in this study. Forty (28.4%) had chronic hepatitis C, 33 (23.4%) past hepatitis C and 68 (48.2%) had never been infected, at screening LSM ≥ 8 kPa were found in 45.7%, 24.7% and 4.6% respectively. Among patients with chronic hepatitis C significant fibrosis was confirmed in 17.1% and cirrhosis in 2.9% by repeated LSM ≥ 8 and ≥ 12 kPa respectively. The median TE-value in never HCV-infected haemophiliacs was comparable with what has been found in healthy non-haemophiliacs. In Danish haemophiliacs where liver biopsy has not routinely been used for assessing severity of liver fibrosis, LSM identified advanced liver disease in one-fifth of cases that had not been recognized during clinical follow-up."

Recently, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging has been developed as a noninvasive modality to evaluate the stiffness of tissues. ARFI imaging theoretically measures liver stiffness of all the segments independently. The aim of this study was to determine whether ARFI elastography is a reliable method for predicting the severity of fibrosis in the post-operative patients with biliary atresia."
CD010542,0,21565752,0,[New non-invasive tool for assessment of liver fibrosis: transient elastography].,"Formation of connective tissue causing liver fibrosis is the common trait of chronic liver diseases. The ""gold-standard"" of the evaluation of liver fibrosis is liver biopsy, but it is an invasive, painful procedure, and carries a significant, although small risk of life-threatening complications. It may have contraindications, and it is certainly not the ideal procedure for serially repeated assessment of disease progression. A new, non-invasive method for the assessment of liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness is the transient elastography. The velocity of the propagation of a shear wave is measured by ultrasound. The procedure is painless, rapid, and does not need any preparation. So far, transient elastography has been mostly validated in chronic hepatitis C, but it is applicable in liver diseases with other etiologies. The diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography increases with stage of fibrosis, and is more accurate in advanced fibrosis (F≥2, Metavir score) and in cirrhosis. Indication of antiviral therapy for chronic viral hepatitis B and C are the main field of the application of the transient elastography, and it is also a useful tool for follow-up the disease progression. It is applicable for early, non-invasive detection of graft damage after liver transplantation. Evaluation of liver damage, the stage of liver fibrosis by transient elastography may have an important role in the decision before surgery, or application of potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Histological examination of the liver tissue is not substituted in every case by transient elastography, but liver biopsy is supplanted by measuring liver stiffness for evaluation of liver fibrosis in many cases."

CD010542,0,19578234,0,A review of the natural history of chronic hepatitis B in the era of transient elastography.,"Understanding the natural history of chronic hepatitis B is important in order to predict the prognosis, to stratify the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and to select appropriate candidates for antiviral treatment. Liver fibrosis is the pathogenic process that leads to liver cirrhosis. The study of liver fibrosis in the past has largely been hampered by the invasive nature of a liver biopsy. Most liver biopsy series represent biased populations with more active disease. Transient elastography is a reliable and non-invasive measurement of liver fibrosis that allows the study of liver fibrosis among patients without clinical indication for liver biopsy. Large studies using transient elastography in patients with predominantly normal alanine aminotransferase levels have been reported recently. The different roles of patient age, hepatitis B virus DNA and alanine aminotransferase levels in the risk stratification for advanced liver fibrosis have been defined in hepatitis B e antigen-positive and hepatitis B e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. The relationship between metabolic syndrome and chronic hepatitis B is also explored. In this review, new insights from studies using transient elastography on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B with special focus on liver fibrosis will be summarized and discussed."
CD010542,0,22671952,0,CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are elevated and display an active phenotype in patients with chronic HCV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection.,"The aim of this study was to examine regulatory T cells (Tregs) in peripheral blood and liver tissue in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infection and in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. In a cross-sectional study were included 51 patients with chronic HCV infection, 24 patients with HIV/HCV co-infection and 24 healthy individuals. CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ Tregs were determined using flow cytometry. Fibrosis was examined by transient elastography. Inflammation, fibrosis and Tregs were determined in liver biopsies from 12 patients. Increased frequency of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ Tregs was found in HIV/HCV co-infected patients [median: 6.4% (IQR: 5.7-6.9) and 1.0% (0.7-1.2), respectively] compared to HCV mono-infected patients [5.6% (4.2-6.3), P = 0.01 and 0.5% (0.3-0.7), P < 0.001, respectively]. Furthermore, HCV mono-infected patients had increased frequencies of Tregs compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05). However, no associations between the frequency of Tregs and fibrosis were found. Furthermore, characterization of CD4⁺ Tregs using CD45RA demonstrated a higher frequency of activated Tregs in both HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients compared with healthy controls. Finally, number of intrahepatic Tregs was associated with both peripheral CD8⁺ Tregs and intrahepatic inflammation. In conclusion, HCV mono-infected patients and particularly HIV/HCV co-infected patients have increased the frequency of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ Tregs compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, CD4⁺ Tregs in infected patients displayed an active phenotype. Tregs were not associated with fibrosis, but a positive correlation between intrahepatic Tregs and inflammation was found. Taken together, these results suggest a role for Tregs in the pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection."
CD010542,0,22700624,0, Noninvasive markers of fibrosis: key concepts for improving accuracy in daily clinical practice.,"Noninvasive markers of fibrosis have emerged as an alternative to the staging of fibrosis by means of liver biopsy. Apart from being noninvasive and thus lacking the adverse effects of liver biopsy, they offer some advantages such as reduced risk of sampling error, objectiveness in the interpretation of the result, appropriateness for repeated measurements and lower cost. Many studies have validated different panels of blood markers and imaging/transient elastography for the estimation of fibrosis with acceptable accuracy. Clinical scenarios leading to inacurate or failed estimation must be acknowledged, as well as the fact that performance of blood markers and transient elastography, and their diagnostic cut-off values vary among specific liver diseases. The combination of two blood markers or of a blood marker and transient elastography has been shown to increase accuracy of the estimation. Further, unlike liver biopsy the noninvasive markers of fibrosis are not associated with a ceiling effect after cirrhosis is identified, but can discriminate early from advanced stages of cirrhosis. Longitudinal studies have shown their utility as predictors of complications from portal hypertension and mortality, outperforming liver biopsy. In conclusion, noninvasive markers of fibrosis provide major advantages over liver biopsy. The reported performance of some of the available tests particularly when used in combination make them a reliable tool, very attractive for daily clinical practice."

CD010542,0,18334275,0,Non-invasive evaluation of liver fibrosis using transient elastography.,"Transient elastography (TE, FibroScan) is a novel non-invasive method that has been proposed for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases, by measuring liver stiffness. TE is a rapid and user-friendly technique that can be easily performed at the bedside or in the outpatient clinic with immediate results and good reproducibility. Limitations include failure in around 5% of cases, mainly in obese patients. So far, TE has been mostly validated in chronic hepatitis C, with diagnostic performance equivalent to that of serum markers for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis. Combining TE with serum markers increases diagnostic accuracy and as a result, liver biopsy could be avoided for initial assessment in most patients with chronic hepatitis C. This strategy warrants further evaluation in other aetiological types of chronic liver diseases. TE appears to be an excellent tool for early detection of cirrhosis and may have prognostic value in this setting. As TE has excellent patient acceptance it could be useful for monitoring fibrosis progression and regression in the individual case, but more data are awaited for this application. Guidelines are needed for the use of TE in clinical practice."

HIV coinfection accelerates the progression of fibrosis in hepatitis. To implement preventive measures, prompt diagnosis of cirrhosis is important, either by liver biopsy or the noninvasive tests for fibrosis now under wide study (FibroTest, FibroScan, etc.). Afterwards, assessment of the severity of cirrhosis and screening for complications are both necessary: testing for liver failure (Child-Pugh and MELD scores), portal hypertension (upper gastrointestinal endoscopy), and hepatocellular carcinoma (ultrasound and alpha fetoprotein assay). Careful consideration of drug prescriptions and possible interactions is essential. Specific treatment for hepatitis B or C virus is possible at this stage of cirrhosis, although more difficult, especially for HCV (results influenced by genotype, additional risk of complications by lactic acidosis or hepatic decompensation).

Consequently, liver fibrosis assessment plays an important role in hepatology. Besides its importance for prognosis, determining the level of fibrosis reveals the natural history of the disease and the risk factors associated with its progression, to guide the antifibrotic action of different treatments. Currently, in clinical practice, there are three available methods for the evaluation of liver fibrosis: liver biopsy, which is still considered to be the 'gold standard'; serological markers of fibrosis and their mathematical combination - suggested in recent years to be an alternative to liver biopsy - and, more recently, transient elastography (TE). TE is a new, simple and noninvasive method used to measure liver stiffness. This technique is based on the progressing speed of an elastic shear wave within the liver. Currently, there are only a few studies that have evaluated TE effectiveness in chronic liver diseases, mostly in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus. Further studies are needed in patients with chronic liver disease, to assess the effectiveness of the fibrosis treatment."
CD010542,0,20844365,0,"Ultrasound-based hepatic elastography: origins, limitations, and applications.","A reliable, noninvasive marker to help clinicians evaluate hepatic fibrosis is urgently needed. The liver biopsy, an imperfect gold standard, has recognized limitations including sampling error and interobserver variability. Hepatic elastography (HE) is a novel sonographic method for assessing liver stiffness and has excellent accuracy in making the diagnosis of minimal fibrosis and cirrhosis. Several conditions intrinsic to the pathology of the liver compromise the positive predictive value of HE for fibrosis alone including acute hepatitis, obstructive cholestasis, and passive congestion. Technical considerations that hinder the performance of elastography include an advanced body mass index, the presence of ascites and narrow intercostal spaces. Despite these limitations, elastography has a role in staging fibrosis, prognosis of disease outcome, surveillance, and treatment decisions. HE is now being used in lieu of liver biopsy to investigate the natural history of chronic liver diseases. Additional studies are required to better define the appropriate role of HE in clinical practice."
CD010542,0,22239521,0,Performance of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse imaging for the staging of liver fibrosis: a pooled meta-analysis.,"Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging is a novel ultrasound-based elastography method that is integrated in a conventional ultrasound machine enabling the exact localization of measurement site. It might present an alternative method to transient elastography for the noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis. At present, studies with small patient population have shown promising results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of pooled patient data were performed to evaluate the overall performance of ARFI for the staging of liver fibrosis. Literature databases were searched up to 10/2010. The authors of the original publication were contacted, and the original patient data were requested. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effect meta-analytic method for diagnostic tests. In addition, available data comparing ARFI with FibroScan with the DeLong test were evaluated. Literature search yielded nine full-paper publications evaluating ARFI while using liver biopsy as reference method. Original patient data were available from eight studies including 518 patients. The mean diagnostic accuracy of ARFI expressed as areas under ROC curves (AUROC) was 0.87 for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2), 0.91 for the diagnosis of severe fibrosis (F ≥ 3), and 0.93 for the diagnosis of cirrhosis.

CD010542,0,19291784,0,SAFE biopsy: a validated method for large-scale staging of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.,"The staging of liver fibrosis is pivotal for defining the prognosis and indications for therapy in hepatitis C. Although liver biopsy remains the gold standard, several noninvasive methods are under evaluation for clinical use. The aim of this study was to validate the recently described sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation (SAFE) biopsy, which detects significant fibrosis (> or =F2 by METAVIR) and cirrhosis (F4) by combining the AST-to-platelet ratio index and Fibrotest-Fibrosure, thereby limiting liver biopsy to cases not adequately classifiable by noninvasive markers. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients (2035) were enrolled in nine locations in Europe and the United States. The diagnostic accuracy of SAFE biopsy versus histology, which is the gold standard, was investigated. The reduction in the need for liver biopsies achieved with SAFE biopsy was also assessed. SAFE biopsy identified significant fibrosis with 90.1% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.90) and reduced by 46.5% the number of liver biopsies needed. SAFE biopsy had 92.5% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.94) for the detection of cirrhosis, obviating 81.5% of liver biopsies. A third algorithm identified significant fibrosis and cirrhosis simultaneously with high accuracy and a 36% reduction in the need for liver biopsy. The patient's age and body mass index influenced the performance of SAFE biopsy, which was improved with adjusted Fibrotest-Fibrosure cutoffs. Two hundred two cases (9.9%) had discordant results for significant fibrosis with SAFE biopsy versus histology, whereas 153 cases (7.5%) were discordant for cirrhosis detection; 71 of the former cases and 56 of the latter cases had a Fibroscan measurement within 2 months of histological evaluation. Fibroscan confirmed SAFE biopsy findings in 83.1% and 75%, respectively."

CD010542,0,19399815,0,Evaluation of the patient with hepatitis B.,"The initial evaluation of a patient with hepatitis B virus infection should attempt to assess the disease activity and stage in the context of the known natural history of this infection and to properly assess the needs for treatment and surveillance. In addition to a medical history and focused physical examination, the initial evaluation usually requires serological, biochemical, and virological tests to confirm the diagnosis as well as an imaging study to establish a baseline for future monitoring. A liver biopsy is generally not needed but can provide useful information on prognosis, need for surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and whether to recommend therapy. Follow-up monitoring is aimed at determining disease progression, development of complications, and reassessing the need for treatment. Monitoring frequency should be determined based on the activity and stage of disease. Initiation of screening for HCC should be based on age, race, sex, family history, and stage and duration of disease. The current recommended method of screening and surveillance for HCC is by ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein measurements every 6-12 months. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the role of longitudinal application of noninvasive assays of fibrosis, such as serum fibrosis markers and transient elastography. Better biomarkers and imaging modalities are needed for early detection of HCC. Finally, studies are needed to better refine the indications and to balance the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy."

We assessed CAP diagnostic accuracy in a large cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus. A total of 615 patients with CHC, who underwent both Fibroscan(®) and liver biopsy, were analysed. Fibrosis was graded using METAVIR score. Steatosis was categorized by visual assessment as S(0) : steatosis in <10% of hepatocytes, S(1) : 11-33%, S(2) : 34-66% and S(3) : 67-100%. Performances of CAP and liver stiffness were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and cross-validated using the bootstrap method. The Obuchowski measure was used to assess overall accuracy of CAP and to differentiate between steatosis grades. In multivariate analysis, CAP was related to steatosis (P < 10(-15) ) independently of fibrosis stage (which was related to LSM). The areas under ROC curves using CAP to detect steatosis were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.84) for S ≥ S(1) , 0.86 (0.81-0.92) for S ≥ S(2) and 0.88 (0.73-1) S = S(3) . CAP exhibited a good ability to differentiate steatosis grades (Obuchowski measure = 0.92). Performance of LSM for fibrosis assessment confirmed results from previous studies. CAP is a novel tool to assess the degree of steatosis and both fibrosis and steatosis can be evaluated noninvasively during the same procedure using Fibroscan(®) , in patients with CHC."

In the last decade, non-invasive methodologies have been proposed to predict the presence of fibrosis in chronic liver disease. Most of these methods are based on algorithms, including biochemical parameters, which have demonstrated an acceptable diagnostic accuracy towards the two extremities of the fibrogenetic process. The introduction of transient elastography has represented a further advancement in clinical Hepatology and it seems that the combination of different non-invasive methodologies will provide an improvement in the clinical management of disease progression in viral chronic hepatitis. Studies, conducted especially in chronic viral hepatitis C, suggest that transient elastography is a useful technique for the detection of severe fibrosis-cirrhosis and for the exclusion of significant fibrosis (>or=F2), that could be employed as ""diagnostic discriminator"" for establishing clinical priorities and reducing the number of liver biopsies. This review article will focus on the clinical utility of this novel methodology for the assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis and will highlight potential further advantages."

A decalogue from the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) Expert Committee.,"We report the evidence-based Italian Association for the Study of Liver guidelines for the appropriate diagnosis and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in clinical practice and its related research agenda. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease varies according to age, gender and ethnicity. In the general population, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is about 25% and the incidence is of two new cases/100 people/year. 2-3% of individuals in the general population will suffer from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Uncomplicated steatosis will usually follow a benign course. Individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, however, have a reduced life expectancy, mainly owing to vascular diseases and liver-related causes. Moreover, steatosis has deleterious effects on the natural history of HCV infection. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is usually diagnosed in asymptomatic patients prompted by the occasional discovery of increased liver enzymes and/or of ultrasonographic steatosis. Medical history, complete physical examination, etiologic screening of liver injury, liver biochemistry tests, serum lipids and insulin sensitivity tests should be performed in every patient. Occult alcohol abuse should be ruled out. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging technique. Liver biopsy, the gold standard in diagnosis and prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is an invasive procedure and its results will not influence treatment in most cases but will provide prognostic information. Assessment of fibrosis by composite scores, specific laboratory parameters and transient elastography might reduce the number of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients requiring liver biopsy. Dieting and physical training reinforced by behavioural therapy are associated with improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome should be ruled out at timed intervals in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients should undergo periodic evaluation of cardiovascular risk and of advancement of their liver disease; those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-cirrhosis should be evaluated for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma."

CD010542,0,21039833,0,Transient elastography.,"In clinical practice, it is important to assess the severity of liver fibrosis in patients with various liver diseases to determine the prognosis, decide treatment, and monitor disease progression and response to treatment. Liver biopsy is limited by its invasiveness and patient acceptability. The development of transient elastography provides clinicians with a non-invasive, accurate, and reproducible tool to estimate liver fibrosis. The technique has been validated among many liver diseases and requires only simple training. Due to its non-invasive nature and ease of use, transient elastography can be used repeatedly on patients, and is optimal for large-scale epidemiological studies, in which stable patients with no indication for liver biopsy can also be included. However, falsely-high liver stiffness measurements might occur during acute hepatitis, extrahepatic cholestasis, congestive heart failure, and amyloidosis. Failed acquisition is also common in obese patients. The development of S and XL probes might cater for different population groups, but calibration in patients with liver biopsy is essential."

In this multicenter study, we evaluated the feasibility and performance of the novel FibroScan XL probe in 276 patients with chronic liver disease (42% viral hepatitis, 46% nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]) and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m(2) . Patients underwent liver biopsy and TE with the standard M and XL probes. TE failure was defined as no valid LSMs and unreliable examinations as <10 valid LSMs or an interquartile range (IQR)/LSM >30% or success rate <60%. Probe performance for diagnosing ≥ F2 fibrosis and cirrhosis (F4) versus biopsy were examined using areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). FibroScan failure was less frequent with the XL probe than the M probe (1.1% versus 16%) and the XL probe was more often reliable (73% versus 50%; both P < 0.00005). Reliable results with the XL probe were obtained in 61% of patients in whom the M probe was unreliable. Among 178 patients with ≥ 10 valid LSMs using both probes, liver stiffness was highly correlated between probes (ρ = 0.86; P < 0.0005); however, median liver stiffness was lower using the XL probe (6.8 versus 7.8 kPa; P < 0.00005).

At present, liver biopsy is still the reference standard for the assessment of liver fibrosis. However, it is an invasive method associated with patient discomfort and in rare cases with serious complications. In addition, the accuracy of liver biopsy is limited due to intra- and interobserver variability and sampling errors. Non-invasive markers and methods for the assessment of liver fibrosis have been intensively evaluated in many studies. The FibroScan (Echosens, France) uses the transient elastography principle for the measurement of liver stiffness. At present (January 2007), studies evaluating the FibroScan in a wide range of liver diseases have been published in 20 full papers and 76 abstracts. The present review gives an overview of the current literature. The best results are reported for the differentiation between cirrhosis and no cirrhosis. With the combination of FibroScan and non-invasive serum fibrosis markers, the accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (Metavir F > or = 2) can be further improved. According to recent data the FibroScan can also be useful for the evaluation of treatment response in patients receiving antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis C.

This was a prospective cohort study of 239 consecutive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with a new diagnosis of cirrhosis, done by TE, and no previous decompensation of liver disease. The time from diagnosis to the first liver decompensation and death from liver disease, as well as the predictors of these outcomes, were evaluated. After a median (Q1-Q3) follow-up of 20 (9-34) months, 31 (13%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9%-17%) patients developed a decompensation. The incidence of decompensation was 6.7 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI, 4.7-9-6). Fourteen (8%) out of 181 patients with a baseline LS < 40 kPa developed a decompensation versus 17 (29%) out of 58 with LS ≥ 40 kPa (P = 0.001).

CD010542,0,21205132,0,How to assess liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C: serum markers or transient elastography vs. liver biopsy?,"The assessment of liver fibrosis is a major issue in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Liver biopsy has traditionally been considered the gold standard for the evaluation of tissue damage, including fibrosis. In addition, it detects associated lesions such as steatosis, steatohepatitis or iron overload, which provide useful information for patient management and prognosis. Liver biopsy is, however, an invasive procedure, with a risk of rare but potentially life-threatening complications and it is prone to sampling errors. These limitations have led to the development of non-invasive methods. Currently available tests rely on two different but complementary approaches: (i) a 'biological' approach based on the dosage of serum biomarkers of fibrosis; (ii) a 'physical' approach based on the measurement of liver stiffness, using transient elastography. Although significant progress has been made in the non-invasive diagnosis of fibrosis, it is increasingly clear that these methods will not completely replace liver biopsy. Instead, non-invasive methods and liver biopsy should be used in an integrated approach for more efficient and convenient management of patients with chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this review is to discuss the advantages and limitations of liver biopsy and non-invasive methods and the perspectives for their use in clinical practice."

CD010542,0,22370225,0,"[Hungarian consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of B, C, and D viral hepatitis].","More than 1% of the Hungarian population is infected with hepatitis B, C, or D viruses. Since 2006 the diagnostics and therapy of these infections are carried out in treatment centers according to national guidelines - since 2010 according to financial protocols. The consensus-based guidelines for 2012 are published in this paper. The guidelines stress the importance of quick and detailed virologic evaluations, the applicability of transient elastography as an acceptable alternative of liver biopsy in this regard, as well as the relevance of appropriate consistent follow up schedule for viral response during therapy. The first choice of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infection is pegylated interferon for 48 weeks or continuous entecavir therapy. The later must be continued for at least 6 months after hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarat is not yet reimbursed by the National Health Insurance Fund. Adefovir dipivoxil is recommended mainly in combination therapy. Lamivudine is no longer a first choice; patients currently taking lamivudine must switch if response is inadequate. Appropriate treatment of patients taking immunosuppressive medications is highly recommended. Pegylated interferon based therapy is recommended for the treatment of concomitant hepatitis D infection. Treatment naive chronic hepatitis C patients should initially receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin dual combination therapy. In genotype 1 infection if response is insufficient at 4 or 12 weeks one of the two new direct acting antivirals (boceprevir or telaprevir) should be added. The length of treatment is usually 48 weeks; in cases of extended early viral response shorter courses are recommended. Previous treatment failure patients with genotype 1 infection should receive a protease inhibitor backed triple combination therapy, mostly for 48 weeks. However, relapsers without cirrhosis and with extended rapid viral response, shorter telaprevir based combination therapy is sufficient. Drug-drug interactions as well as emergence of viral resistance are of particular importance. For genotype 2 or 3 HCV infections 24 weeks, for genotype 4 infections 24, 48 or 72 weeks of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy is recommended in general. The guidelines published here become protocols when published as official publications of the Hungarian Health Authority."

Two hundred forty-six consecutive patients from two ethnic groups had successful liver stiffness measurement and satisfactory liver biopsy specimens. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of transient elastography for F3 or higher and F4 disease was 0.93 and 0.95, respectively, and was significantly higher than that of the aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, FIB-4, BARD, and NAFLD fibrosis scores (AUROC ranged from 0.62 to 0.81, P < 0.05 for all comparisons). At a cutoff value of 7.9 kPa, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for F3 or greater disease were 91%, 75%, 52%, and 97%, respectively.

CD010542,0,21254180,0,Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis.,"Liver biopsy has long been an important tool for assessing the degree of liver fibrosis. Information on the presence and degree of liver fibrosis is useful before making therapeutic decisions or predicting disease outcomes. The need to stage liver fibrosis, however, should decrease as treatment options become more successful (as has occurred with viral hepatitis). In recent years, noninvasive tests have demonstrated a reasonable ability to identify significant fibrosis, cirrhosis in particular, nor is it surprising that liver disease specialists and patients favor a noninvasive approach. However, only those tests with the highest diagnostic accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and availability should be implemented. Apart from their diagnostic accuracy, the potential ability of these tests to predict disease outcomes (a more relevant endpoint) should be compared with that of liver biopsy. Indeed, the use of a standardized system to evaluate the utility of biomarkers would facilitate their implementation in clinical practice."
CD010542,0,22537436,0,Noninvasive methods to assess liver disease in patients with hepatitis B or C.,"The prognosis and management of patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C depend on the amount and progression of liver fibrosis and the risk for cirrhosis. Liver biopsy, traditionally considered to be the reference standard for staging of fibrosis, has been challenged over the past decade by the development of noninvasive methodologies. These methods rely on distinct but complementary approaches: a biologic approach, which quantifies serum levels of biomarkers of fibrosis, and a physical approach, which measures liver stiffness by ultrasound or magnetic resonance elastography. Noninvasive methods were initially studied and validated in patients with chronic hepatitis C but are now used increasingly for patients with hepatitis B, reducing the need for liver biopsy analysis. We review the advantages and limitations of the noninvasive methods used to manage patients with chronic viral hepatitis B or C infection."
CD010542,0,22233410,0,How far is noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis from replacing liver biopsy in hepatitis C?,"Chronic hepatitis C represents a major cause of progressive liver disease that can eventually evolve into cirrhosis and its end-stage complications. Formation and accumulation of fibrosis in the liver is the common pathway that leads to evolutive liver disease. Precise staging of liver fibrosis is essential for patient management in clinical practice because the presence of bridging fibrosis represents a strong indication for antiviral therapy, while cirrhosis requires a specific follow-up. Liver biopsy has always represented the standard of reference for assessment of hepatic fibrosis, but it has limitations: it is invasive, costly and prone to sampling errors. Recently, blood markers and instrumental methods have been proposed for the noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C. However, international guidelines do not recommend the widespread use of noninvasive methods for liver fibrosis in clinical practice. This is because of, in some cases, unsatisfactory accuracy and incomplete validation of others. Some studies suggest that the effectiveness of noninvasive methods for assessing liver fibrosis may increase when they are combined, and a number of sequential and synchronous algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, with the aim of reducing rather than substituting liver biopsies. This may represent a rational and reliable approach for implementing noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in clinical practice. It could allow more comprehensive first-line screening of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C than would be feasible with liver biopsy alone."

CD010542,0,22239518,1,Transient elastography for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease.,"There is increasing interest in developing noninvasive means to evaluate liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease to determine disease severity, prognosis and optimal treatment. Transient elastography (TE) has previously been demonstrated to predict the presence or absence of advanced fibrosis. The current study was conducted to determine whether TE can identify patients with chronic liver disease at risk of clinical decompensation. A total of 667 patients underwent TE and were followed for a median of 861 days and 57 patients achieved the primary outcome, a composite of clinical endpoints including death, ascites, encephalopathy, increased Child Score ≥ 2, variceal bleed, hepatocellular carcinoma or listing for transplant. Overall, TE had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 for predicting clinical outcome. Using a cut-off of 10.5 kPa, TE has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.7%, 63.0%, 19.3% and 99.2%, respectively. A predictive model for clinical events was developed using generalized cross-validation for clinical endpoints considering TE, liver biopsy results and multiple other predictors. Individually, TE performed better than biopsy, or any other variable, for predicting clinical outcome [Harrell's C Statistic 0.86 for TE, 0.78 for stage]. Patients with a TE score of >12.5 kPa were found to have a relative hazard for clinical event of 18.99 compared with patients with TE score <10.5. A combined variable model including TE, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) yielded the highest predictive accuracy with Harrell's C value of 0.93. In the subset of patients with cirrhosis, TE was not found to be independently associated with clinical outcomes in univariate or multivariate analysis although it retained a high sensitivity and NPV of 97.5% and 92.3%, respectively, at a kPa cut-off of 10.5. TE can successfully identify patients with chronic liver disease who are at low risk of clinical decompensation over a time period of 2 years."

CD010542,0,20167986,0,Liver transient elastography (Fibroscan): a place in the management algorithms of chronic viral hepatitis.,"Treatment guidelines are continuously evolving in chronic viral hepatitis, taking into consideration our greater understanding of natural history and therapeutic efficacy and safety. Key in the decision making process is an assessment of liver injury. Traditionally, liver biopsy has provided this information; however, this is an invasive procedure and not completely reliable. Liver transient elastography (Fibroscan) is exciting new technology that allows estimation of hepatic fibrosis through measurement of liver stiffness. It is acceptably accurate, safe, cheap, quick and widely applicable, and can reduce the need for liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis. In chronic hepatitis C, it can identify those most likely to benefit from treatment, as well as those with cirrhosis who require more specific care. In chronic hepatitis B, it could screen groups previously excluded from treatment (normal alanine aminotransferase and low DNA) to identify the subgroup that would benefit from therapy. It cannot replace biopsy in all settings, but it will narrow the group who do require biopsy, and provide information on liver damage in patients for whom biopsy would probably not have been considered."

The assessment of disease progression not only provides useful information for diagnosis and therapeutic supervision judgment but also for monitoring disease. Different invasive and non invasive methods are applied to diagnose the disease from initial to end stage (mild fibrosis to cirrhosis). Although, liver biopsy is still considered as gold standard to identify liver histological stages, an assessment of the disease development based on non-invasive clinical findings is also emerging and this may replace the need of biopsy in near future. This review gives brief insight on non-invasive methods currently available for predicting liver fibrosis in HCV with their current pros and cons to make easier for a clinician to choose better marker to assess liver fibrosis in HCV infected patients."

Liver biopsy is generally considered the gold standard for assessing hepatic fibrosis; however, this protocol frequently carries a risk of severe complications and false-negative results. Transient elastography (Fibroscan, Echosens, Paris, France), which is a noninvasive method of measuring liver stiffness, has become available for assessing liver fibrosis. Liver stiffness reportedly differs markedly with the cirrhosis etiology. The aim of this study was thus to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the Fibroscan in the detection of cirrhosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease."

CD010542,0,21040236,0,The optimal cut-off for predicting large oesophageal varices using transient elastography is disease specific.,"The diagnosis of cirrhosis requires screening for oesophageal varices by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In many countries, serological tests and elastography are replacing liver biopsy for diagnosing cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to see whether there was an optimal cut-off of liver stiffness that could predict the presence of large (>F2) oesophageal varices and whether this was disease specific. A total of two hundred and twenty-two patients with all cause cirrhosis (Child class A) were screened, and 211 had successful elastography and are included in the analysis. Of the patients studied, one hundred and thirty-two patients had no or small F1 varices and 79 had large varices. Liver stiffness of 19.8 kPa had a negative predictive value of 91% and a positive predictive value of 55% with an area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of 0.73 in differentiating between small and large varices. Seven patients with large varices would have been incorrectly classified. In the 157 patients with hepatitis C as the aetiology of cirrhosis, the negative predictive value was 98% and only one patient was misclassified. Liver stiffness was superior in diagnostic accuracy to platelet count in all patients. A liver stiffness of >19.8 kPa could be utilized as a cut-off for endoscopy and beta blocker utilization, particularly in patients with hepatitis C."
CD010542,0,18956295,0,Diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: invasive versus noninvasive.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States and many other parts of the world. Its prevalence continues to rise-currently affecting approximately 20 to 30% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. NAFLD represents a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from fatty liver, which in general follows a benign nonprogressive clinical course, to steatohepatitis or NASH, a more serious form of NAFLD that may progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Although currently a combination of noninvasive clinically available laboratory and imaging tests may help in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected NAFLD, a liver biopsy remains the only reliable way to precisely diagnose NASH and establish the severity of liver injury and presence of fibrosis. It also provides important information regarding prognosis as well as response to therapeutic interventions. However, a liver biopsy is an invasive and costly procedure, which is poorly suited as a diagnostic test for a condition that may affect about one-third of the U.S. population. This review provides a concise overview of the role of liver biopsy versus noninvasive diagnostic tools for the differentiation of fatty liver from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as well as for the determination of presence and extent of fibrosis. In particular, this review focuses on the methods currently available in daily clinical practice in hepatology and touches briefly on potential future markers under investigation."
CD010542,0,21898504,0,Comparison of eight diagnostic algorithms for liver fibrosis in hepatitis C: new algorithms are more precise and entirely noninvasive.,"The sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation (SAFE) and the Bordeaux algorithm (BA), which cross-check FibroTest with the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) or FibroScan, are very accurate but provide only a binary diagnosis of significant fibrosis (SAFE or BA for Metavir F ≥ 2) or cirrhosis (SAFE or BA for F4). Therefore, in clinical practice, physicians have to apply the algorithm for F ≥ 2, and then, when needed, the algorithm for F4 (""successive algorithms""). We aimed to evaluate successive SAFE, successive BA, and a new, noninvasive, detailed classification of fibrosis. The study included 1785 patients with chronic hepatitis C, liver biopsy, blood fibrosis tests, and FibroScan (the latter in 729 patients). The most accurate synchronous combination of FibroScan with a blood test (FibroMeter) provided a new detailed (six classes) classification (FM+FS). Successive SAFE had a significantly (P < 10(-3) ) lower diagnostic accuracy (87.3%) than individual SAFE for F ≥ 2 (94.6%) or SAFE for F4 (89.5%), and required significantly more biopsies (70.8% versus 64.0% or 6.4%, respectively, P < 10(-3) ). Similarly, successive BA had significantly (P ≤ 10(-3) ) lower diagnostic accuracy (84.7%) than individual BA for F ≥ 2 (88.3%) or BA for F4 (94.2%), and required significantly more biopsies (49.8% versus 34.6% or 24.6%, respectively, P < 10(-3) ). The diagnostic accuracy of the FM+FS classification (86.7%) was not significantly different from those of successive SAFE or BA. However, this new classification required no biopsy."
