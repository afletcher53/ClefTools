CD005253,0,15125213,0,Comparative study of the effectiveness of thyroxine and steroids on reduction of neonatal morbidity: outcome at 20 months follow-up.,"This study analyzes health, growth and neurodevelopmental outcome of infants who received prenatal corticosteroids with or without thyroxine for fetal lung maturation. During a 12 month period infants from a prospective double blind study who received either steroids or steroids combined with thyroxine for pulmonary maturation and who had reached 18 months of age were recalled for evaluation of health status, growth parameters and neurodevelopmental outcome using the Bayley Scales 2nd edition (BSID-II). Mental developmental index (MDI), psychomotor developmental index (PDI), language developmental age (LDA), cognitive developmental age (CDA), and behavioral rating scales (BRS) were compared for the two treatment groups. The Hollingshead Socioeconomic Status Index was determined for each infant. Of a total of 134 patients enrolled during the study period, 66 patients return for follow up. Data from 60 patients was included in the final analysis. Of these, 32 had received the combination regimen and 28 had solely received only steroids. Demographics and neonatal morbidity were similar in both groups. No statistical differences in growth parameters, hospital admissions, respiratory problems, surgical procedures or frequency of infections were found. Neurodevelopmental parameters (MDI, PDI) were similar in both treatment groups, although, below normal in both groups. Language delay was more common in infants who received prenatal corticosteroids. There were no difference in the incidence of neurologic abnormalities. The addition of thyroxine to steroids did not affect growth or neuro-developmental outcome of the infants at 18 to 22 postnatal age."
CD005253,0,9794037,0,[Prevalence of endemic goiter in the health sector of Zitenga (Burkina Faso)].,"The prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) was studied in the health district of Zitenga village (Oubritenga province, Burkina Faso), as part of an assisted development program. The study was designed to assess the prevalence of IDD in a population of more than 2,000 people. A multistage cluster sample of 210 people was randomly selected. The women in the sample were aged 0 to 45 years and the men, 0 to 25 years. Clinical and laboratory results (circulating TSH concentration, T4 and iodine excretion in urine), and dietary intake were recorded. The prevalence of goiter (all grades) was 55.2%. The values recorded for iodine excretion in urine showed that there was moderate iodine deficiency in this area. Blood thyroxine levels were below the laboratory reference range for 63% of the subjects, whereas TSH levels were above the laboratory reference range for 69.3% of the subjects. There was no correlation between hormone status, iodine excretion and goiter. The entire population of this area was deficient in iodine; some individuals had clinical signs of iodine deficiency, such as goiter. Further studies are required to investigate the factors responsible for goiter in this area and iodine supplementation should be provided for the population."
CD005253,0,26051299,0,Treatment of congenital thyroid dysfunction: Achievements and challenges.,"The active thyroid hormone tri-iodothyronine (T3) is essential for a normal development of children. Especially within the first years of life, thyroid hormone is pivotal in enabling maturation of complex brain function and somatic growth. The most compelling example for a life without thyroid hormone are those historical cases of children who came to birth without a thyroid gland - as shown in autopsy-studies- and who suffered from untreated hypothyroidism, at that time initially called ""sporadic congenital hypothyroidism"" (CH). In the last decades huge achievements resulted in a normal development of these children based on newborn screening programs that enable an early onset of a high dose LT4-treatment. Further progress will be necessary to further tailor an individualized thyroid hormone substitution approach and to identify those more complex patients with congenital hypothyroidism and associated defects, who will not benefit from an even optimized LT4 therapy. Besides the primary production of thyroid hormone a variety of further mechanisms are necessary to mediate the function of T3 on normal development that are located downstream of thyroid hormone production. Abnormalities of these mechanisms include the MCT8-transport defect, deiodinase-insufficiency and thyroid hormone receptor alpha-and beta defects. These thyroid hormone resistant diseases can not be treated with classical LT4 substitution alone. The development of new treatment options for those rare cases of thyroid hormone resistance is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of congenital thyroid diseases today."

MR spectroscopy is a sensitive technique for detecting the changes of brain metabolites in various neurodevelopmental disorders.

CD005253,0,3139742,0,Free thyroxine values in dried blood spots on filter paper in newborns are related to both gestational age and birth body weight.,"The results of free thyroxine (FT4) measurements in dried blood spots on filter paper in 744 euthyroid newborns (616 at term, 128 preterm), 10 newborns with congenital hypothyroidism and 4 euthyroid newborns with congenital TBG deficiency are reported. FT4 was measured by column adsorption chromatography of free hormone followed by radioimmunoassay in the eluate. FT4 values averaged 24 +/- 0.2 pmol/L (mean +/- SE) in euthyroid newborns, 23.0 +/- 0.9 pmol/L in euthyroid newborns with TBG deficiency (p = NS), and 5.7 +/- 0.4 pmol/L in hypothyroid newborns (p less than 0.001 vs both groups). Total T4 (TT4) values in newborns with TBG deficiency were not different from those in hypothyroid newborns, but were significantly lower than those in euthyroid newborns without TBG abnormalities. FT4 values were higher in full-term newborns than in preterm newborns (25.2 +/- 0.3 vs 21.2 +/- 0.5 pmol/L, p less than 0.001). In both full-term and preterm newborns FT4 values in dried blood spots increased with birth body weight (bbw), virtually plateauing when bbw was greater than 2,500 g. The cut-off values established on the basis of the bbw (8.0 and 13.1 pmol/L for a bbw of less than or equal to 2,500 g and greater than 2,500 g, respectively) showed higher specificity and predictive value of positive results than the cut-off values based on the gestational age. In any case, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of FT4 determinations proved to be higher than those of TT4 and TSH measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD005253,0,18824871,0,Thyroid hypoplasia as a cause of congenital hypothyroidism in Williams syndrome.,"In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended. However, the frequency of biochemical thyroid assessment, particularly in the first year of life, is being debated. In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation. Therefore, treatment with L-thyroxinewas started. Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life."

CD005253,0,14557433,0,Obesity due to proopiomelanocortin deficiency: three new cases and treatment trials with thyroid hormone and ACTH4-10.,"The symptoms of severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair define the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency syndrome as described so far in two children with complete loss-of-function mutations of the human POMC gene. In POMC deficiency, obesity reflects the lack of POMC-derived peptides as ligands at the melanocortin (MC) MC4 and MC3 receptors, which are expressed in the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway of body weight regulation. Hypocortisolism and alteration of pigmentation are caused by the lack of POMC-derived peptides at the adrenal MC2 receptor and the skin MC1 receptor, respectively. Here we describe three new cases of complete loss-of-function mutations of the POMC gene. Patients were diagnosed based on the clinical trials of red hair, adrenal insufficiency, and early-onset severe obesity. One previously described translation initiation mutation (C3804A) as well as one new nonsense (A6851T) and two new frame-shift mutations (6996del and 7100 + 2G) were found in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity. The heterozygous parents were found to have high normal or mildly elevated body weight, suggesting a dosage effect of the POMC gene product on weight regulation. To compensate for the lack of hypothalamic melanocortin function, we initiated a trial in the two previously published patients with intranasal ACTH4-10, a melanocortin fragment for which an anorexic effect has been described recently. During 3 months with increasing doses of ACTH4-10, no change of body weight or metabolic rate was observed, suggesting that at least in these two POMC-deficient patients ACTH4-10 is without any compensatory effect. In the same two patients, further investigation revealed a mildly elevated TSH. However, a 1-yr treatment with thyroid hormone did not result in a significant reduction of body weight."

Clinical studies have evaluated parenteral triiodothyronine supplementation after cardiopulmonary bypass in children.

But there is no review of such biomarkers detected in umbilical blood at birth. By comparing clinical values of common inflammatory markers detected in cord blood shortly after birth, in this study we tried to find the most performing one or the most efficient combination that might be potentially used in birth room, as the earliest predictor of early-onset neonatal sepsis."
CD005253,0,25315615,0,Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor: an indicator of pneumonia severity in children.,"Enhanced level of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) level has been associated with activation of the immune system. It may be a novel biomarker for pneumonia severity, yet data on this subject are limited. In the present study we seek to determine the suPAR level in hospitalized children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), its correlation with pneumonia severity, and to compare the suPAR level between pneumonia and healthy conditions. The study encompassed a total of 596 children: 447 with pneumonia and 119 healthy. suPAR was measured in 227 out of the 447 pneumonia patients and in all healthy subjects. We used clinical indicators (fever, time for defeverscence, heart and breath rate, saturation, and length of antibiotic treatment and of hospitalization) and laboratory indicators (CRP, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, and sodium) to assess the CAP severity. The finding were that the suPAR concentration in children with pneumonia was significantly higher (median 7.11 ng/mL) than in healthy individuals (4.68 ng/mL). We found a positive correlation between the suPAR and the following factors: fever, time for defeverscence, length of hospital stay, and elevated CRP and procalcitonin levels. There was a reverse correlation with sodium concentration and capillary blood saturation. Moreover, the suPAR level was significantly higher in children with a severe course of pneumonia compared with those having non-severe pneumonia (7.79 vs. 6.87 ng/mL; p = 0.006). In conclusion, suPAR elevation is observed in pneumonia and may reflect its severity."

CD005253,0,5765026,0,"Effect of sodium phenobarbital on bilirubin metabolism in an infant with congenital, nonhemolytic, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and kernicterus.","Sodium phenobarbital and various hormones, compounds capable of hepatic enzyme induction, were given to an infant boy with congenital, nonhemolytic, unconjugated, hyperbilirubinemia and severe kernicterus for prolonged periods between the ages of 2 and 25 months to determine their effect on serum bilirubin concentrations. Phenobarbital, 5 mg/day orally, on two occasions decreased serum bilirubin concentrations approximately threefold over a period of 30 days. Withdrawal of phenobarbital after the first study resulted in a gradual (30 days) return of serum bilirubin to pretreatment levels. The lower serum bilirubin concentrations observed when phenobarbital therapy was reinstituted were maintained for 61 days on 2.5 mg/kg per day of the drug. Orally administered L-triiodothyronine, 0.05-0.1 mg/day for 71 days, intramuscular human growth hormone, 1 mg/day for 21 days, and testosterone propionate, 0.1 mg/day for 9 days, did not decrease serum bilirubin levels below lowest control values of 18 mg/100 ml.Bilirubin-(3)H was administered twice before and once with bilirubin-(14)C during phenobarbital therapy to study the kinetics of bilirubin metabolism. Results of the first and second control studies and of the bilirubin-(3)H and bilirubin-(14)C phenobarbital studies, respectively, were as follows: total body bilirubin pools, 200, 184, 73, and 72 mg; half-lives, 111, 84, 37, and 39 hr; and turnover, 30, 37, 33, and 31 mg/day. The data show that the approximate threefold decrease in serum bilirubin concentration and total body pool resulted from a comparable decrease in bilirubin half-life without a significant change in turnover. In vitro histological (electron microscopy) and enzymological studies of liver obtained by surgical biopsies before and during phenobaribtal administration showed that both the hepatocyte content of agranular endoplasmic reticulum (AER) and the ability of liver homogenate to conjugate p-nitrophenol were significantly increased during phenobarbital treatment. The observations suggest that phenobarbital affects bilirubin metabolism by the induction of an enzyme(s) with a slow rate(s) of degradation (or rapid rate of degradation with limited capacity)."

Diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is difficult because of the variable and nonspecific clinical presentation. Therefore, many newborns with nonspecific symptoms are started on antibiotic treatment before the presence of sepsis has been proven. With our recently published single-centre intervention study we were able to show that Procalcitonin determinations allowed to shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy in newborns with suspected early-onset sepsis."
CD005253,0,1593394,0,Neurodevelopment in infants and preschool children with congenital hypothyroidism: etiological and treatment factors affecting outcome.,"Studied global intelligence and specific abilities of children from 1 to 5 years old, 108 with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) diagnosed by newborn screening and 71 sibling controls. Intelligence levels of the CH group were within the normal range but differed significantly from controls at age 5. CH demonstrated a language deficit at age 3, which diminished with age, as well as significantly poorer visuospatial and verbal skills at age 5. Children with absent thyroid glands or evidence of hypothyroidism in utero were outperformed by other CH children in most ability areas from 1 year on. Different components of ability were correlated with specific factors reflecting timing or duration of thyroid hormone deficiency, suggesting unique critical periods of thyroid hormone sensitivity for different specific cognitive abilities and their neural substrates. It is concluded that even though screened CH children are markedly improved by neonatal diagnosis, they are still at risk for subtle irreversible deficits, which depend on factors such as type, age at onset, and duration of disease."

In this paper the overall pattern of response to L-T4 replacement therapy was studied in a group of 19 children with CH diagnosed by neonatal screening (10 with hypoplastic/aplastic thyroid disease, group H/A; 9 with gland ectopy, group E) who were followed-up for 60 +/- 27 months (mean +/- SD). With 1 exception serum T4 at diagnosis was greater than 2 micrograms/dl in children of group E and less than 2 micrograms/dl in those of group H/A. The initial dose of L-T4 (8-10 micrograms/kg BW/day) was modified in relation to age and weight in order to maintain serum TSH less than or equal to 5 microU/ml and FT3 in the normal range. A general inverse correlation between serum TSH and FT4 or FT3 concentrations was found, and the mean levels of serum FT4 and FT3 were significantly higher according to the following order of TSH results: low TSH (0-0.5 microU/ml) greater than normal (greater than 0.5-5 microU/ml) greater than elevated TSH (greater than 5 microU/ml). TSH levels less than or equal to 5 microU/ml were associated with FT4 values in the upper half of the normal range (54% of observations) or even higher (46%). Elevation of serum FT4 alone with FT3 values in the normal range did not result in clinical thyrotoxicosis, alteration of growth or premature craniosynostosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Obtained results were compared to the findings of the same parameters in 28 women who delivered at term, but had been receiving gestanges 1 to 5 months prior to the delivery, and in their babies. In both groups, serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were normal both in mothers and in their babies. Foetal serum reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) levels were higher (1.58 +/- 0.14, means +/- SEM) as compared to serum levels (0.36 +/- 0.04) of the mothers treated with gestagens; similar results were obtained in the mothers with normal pregnancy (0.41 +/- 0.03) and their babies (1.65 +/- 0.15, means +/- SEM). In 13 out of 64 (20%) women with normal pregnancy serum thyroxine (T4) was elevated in delivery at term, with no impact on the clinical course. Of 28 women who were treated with gestagens for 1 to 5 months only 4 had elevated serum T4 on the delivery. Using gestagens, according to our results, contributes to an increase of the newborn TBG levels (27.00 +/- 2.65; means +/- SEM) in a significant way (p less than 1.001) as compared to TBG of the newborn delivered after a normal pregnancy (21.40 +/- 2.55)."

CD005253,0,21073118,0,Confirmation of neonatal screening: reference intervals and evaluation of methodological changes in TSH measurement.,"Neonatal reference values for serum thyrotropin are scarce and comprise only small numbers of patients. During 2006, changes were made in IMMULITE kits for TSH measurement. To validate methodological changes, 80 serum samples from patients were evaluated and to establish reference intervals, 334 neonates and infants were analyzed (divided into 4 groups). Group 1 (G1) (48-72 h of life) (n=153), group 2A (G2A) (7-10 days of life) (n=65), group 2B (G2B) (11-14 days of life) (n=35), group 3 (G3) (28-40 days of life) (n=81). Current kits overestimate TSH results by 26 to 37%; TSH (mIU/L) reference intervals (percentile 2.5-97.5) were G1 (1.1-12.7), G2A (1.8-9.8), G2B (1.1-7.1) (p < 0.03 vs. G2A), G3 (1.2-6.9). We suggest that during the second week of life, reference values should be divided into an early stage and a late stage, at least, for there to be an adequate interpretation of borderline measurements in newborn thyroid screening."
CD005253,0,263304,0,Fetal hypothyroidism and maternal thyroid status in severe endemic goiter.,"The relationship between maternal thyroid function and newborn thyroid function was studied in a region of very severe endemic goiter (Ubangi, Republic of Zaïre). T4, T3, and TSH concentrations were measured in the sera of 56 mothers (at the time of delivery) and 60 newborns (in the cord). The results obtained in these groups (untreated) were compared with those obtained in two control groups, comprising 53 mothers whose iodine deficiency had been corrected by the injection of iodized oil and 68 neonates born to such mothers. The results show that the mean (+/- SEM) T4 serum concentration (micrograms per dl) was 11.5 +/- 0.7 in the untreated mothers compared with 15.7 +/- 0.7 in the treated mothers (P less than 0.001), and 9.4 +/- 0.8 in the untreated newborns compared with 12.4 +/- 0.5 in the newborns of treated mothers (P less than 0.01). The values observed for the mean T3 serum concentrations (nanograms per dl) in the same groups were 171 +/- 10 and 154 +/- 9 (mothers; P greater than 0.05) and 68 +/- 6 and 55 +/- 6 (newborns; P greater than 0.05); the mean TSH serum concentrations (microunits per ml) were 8.7 (7.6 - 9.9) and 5.4 (4.9 - 5.9; mothers; P less than 0.001) and 19.6 (16.6 - 23.2) and 6.4 (5.8 - 7.0; newborns; P less than 0.001). The proportion of untreated newborns, i.e. 40%, with individual TSH values deviating by more than 2 SDS above the mean of the treated newborns is much greater than the corresponding proportion, i.e. 15%, of untreated mothers in relation to the treated ones. In 6 out of 34 untreated newborns, definite biochemical signs of congenital hypothyroidism were observed. Correlation coefficients were calculated between the untreated subjects. A positive correlation coefficient of 0.80 (P less than 0.001) was observed between the serum T4 concentrations of the mothers and those of the newborns, and one of 0.61 (P less than 0.001) was observed between their respective serum TSH values. Significant inverse correlations were observed between maternal serum T4 and cord serum TSH (-0.79; P less than 0.001) and between cord T4 concentrations and maternal TSH concentrations (-0.57; P less than 0.01). No definite trend is observed between the variations of serum T3 on one hand, and those of serum T4 or serum TSH on the other hand. Out of 51 mothers in whom serum T4 was determined, 11 showed values below 8 micrograms /dl; the newborns of those mothers showed very low serum T4 values (5.5 +/- 1.6 micrograms/100 ml) and extremely high serum TSH levels [144 (98-210) microU/ml]. It is concluded that, contrary to the situation observed in physiological conditions, maternal thyroid function in regions of severe endemic goiter is a good indicator of newborn thyroid function. The reasons for this probably lie in the influence of environmental factors acting simultaneously on the mother and the fetus."

Salt iodisation and supplementation with iodine can prevent iodine deficiency disorders and stunted growth. No systematic review has yet collated the evidence linking iodine to growth. With an increased emphasis on stunting within the WHO Global Nutrition Targets for 2025, we propose a systematic review to address this question."
CD005253,0,22308837,0,Normal thyroid function in young adults who were born very preterm.,"There is some evidence for elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels in children born preterm, but follow-up studies into adulthood are lacking. We tested whether thyroid function in young adults born at a gestational age < 32 weeks, with either an appropriate (appropriate for gestational age, AGA) or low birth weight for gestational age (small for gestational age, SGA), differed from that in age-matched controls. We made our measurements when the study participants reached 21 years of age. Serum concentrations of TSH and free T4 (fT4) and body composition were measured in subjects born preterm and AGA (n = 29) or SGA (n = 28), and in non-preterm controls (n = 30). The TSH and fT4 concentrations of participants were within normal limits. Free T4 levels in subjects born preterm were slightly higher than those in controls: 17.0 +/- 2.4 (AGA) and 17.2 +/- 1.7 (SGA) vs. 16.1 +/- 1.9 pmo/L (p = 0.04). TSH concentrations did not differ between groups. From these preliminary data, we conclude that young adults born preterm have a normal thyroid function."
CD005253,0,19263338,0,Antenatal betamethasone does not influence lymphocyte apoptosis in preterm neonates.,"Despite the widespread use of antenatal glucocorticosteroids (GCs), the possibility of adverse effects on the immune response in preterm neonates remains a major concern. GCs stimulate lymphocyte apoptosis, resulting in lymphopenia and functional disorders, which have been associated with sepsis-related death in critically ill neonates. We sought to assess the effect of antenatal betamethasone (BM) on lymphocyte apoptosis in preterm neonates. Fifty preterm neonates exposed to antenatal BM and 50 controls were studied prospectively. Lymphocyte apoptosis was assessed using the annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) assay, analysis of cell cycle after staining with PI, and intracellular caspase-3 activity. The two groups did not differ significantly as regards absolute lymphocyte counts and the percentage of lymphocytes being annexin-V (+)/PI (-) (early apoptotic) or lymphocytes in the subG1 peak after staining with PI and those with intracellular caspase-3 activation. The lymphocyte number and apoptosis were not associated with the time elapsed between antenatal BM administration and delivery. A single course of antenatal BM does not influence apoptosis of neonatal lymphocytes. This is of significant importance with respect to the preservation of lymphocyte-associated immune response in preterm neonates."

We investigated the effect of thyroid replacement therapy on calcium metabolism and bone mineralization in congenital hypothyroid (CH) infants and children. One hundred and 16 Caucasian CH consecutive patients were studied and were grouped according to their age: 23 patients at diagnosis, 20 at 3 mo, 24 at 6 mo, 25 at 12 mo and 24 at 36 mo. Thyroid replacement therapy was started at an initial dose of 6-8 micrograms/kg/day of L-thyroxine, and then decreased progressively. Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase (AP), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and osteocalcin (BGP) were measured as calcium metabolism indices. Bone mineral content (BMC) was measured at the mid-portion of the right radius AP, PTH and BGP concentrations were significantly higher in subjects at 3 mo of age (p < 0.05). This rise coincided with the end of the period of maximum dosage of L-thyroxine. Mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia was observed in 20 patients. All the other indices did not differ between age groups. BMC values and BMC annual increment were not different from those calculated for age-matched controls. We found that L-thyroxine replacement therapy does not alter bone mineralization of CH infants and children. Only a transitory increase of osteoblastic function was observed after the first few months of therapy."

Thyroid function tests revealed a low thyrotropin level (<0.004 mIU/L) and elevated free thyroxine level (3.4 ng/ dL) diagnosed with Graves' disease and treated with methimazole. This anti-thyroid drug is recommended as first-line treatment in children with Graves' disease because it produces minor adverse effects with respect to propylthiouracil. She developed a lateralized exanthem mimicking figurate inflammatory dermatosis of infancy after methimazole therapy. The symptoms resolved after discontinuation of methimazole and treatment with an antihistamine and a corticosteroid. Furthermore, the treatment was changed to propylthiouracil without any adverse effects. According to current literature this is the first case of cutaneous figurate erythema related to methimazole, different from other well-known reactions such as skin eruption or urticaria."

CD005253,0,10582538,0,Changes in serum apolipoprotein concentrations after L-thyroxine therapy in infants with congenital hypothyroidism.,"To further characterize the impact of thyroid hormones on the serum lipid profile, we studied serum apolipoproteins in infants with congenital hypothyroidism before and after L-thyroxine (L-T4) replacement therapy. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) decreased after L-T4 therapy. Total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) levels did not change significantly after therapy. Two months after L-T4 replacement therapy, serum apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), C-III, and E declined and apo B increased significantly. No significant changes were observed for serum concentrations of apo A-II and C-II after L-T4 substitution. We conclude that in infants, thyroid hormone reduces serum levels of apo A-I, the principal protein component of HDLC, and this may contribute to the decline of serum HDLC concentrations after L-T4 replacement therapy."

A case report and review of the literature.,"We report a rare case of fetal goitrous hypothyroidism complicated by polyhydramnios and preterm labor in a mother without thyroid gland pathology. The diagnosis was made in the 26th week by ultrasound and cordocentesis [TSH 170 microU/ml, free T(4) 0.2 ng/dl]. The therapeutic regime required repeated fetal blood sampling for determination of thyroid hormones. Five intra-amniotic administrations of 250 microg levothyroxine (LT4) weekly were initiated. Because of the persisting goiter and the elevated level of TSH (128 microU/ml in 32 weeks) in the fetal serum the dosage had to be adjusted to 500 microg LT4 in the next five injections. TSH in fetal serum declined to 49.2 microU/ml in 36 weeks. Normal fetal growth and an uncomplicated course of pregnancy between the 27th and 37th week of gestation were observed. Monitoring of intrauterine therapy by determination of TSH in fetal serum may provide more reliable data than measuring TSH in amniotic fluid. A review of 15 cases of fetal goitrous hypothyroidism in the English literature is presented."

CD005253,0,7925183,0,Vulnerability of the developing brain to thyroid abnormalities: environmental insults to the thyroid system.,"Neurologic development follows orderly patterns that can be severely disturbed when thyroid hormones are deficient or excessive. Should this occur at appropriate development periods, irreversible neurologic damage can result. The nature of the deficits depends upon the specific development period and the severity of the thyroid disturbance. PCBs and dioxins are structurally similar to the thyroid hormones. Their binding characteristics are similar to those of thyroid hormones and all three groups bind to the cytosolic Ah receptor, the thyroid hormone receptor and the serum thyroid hormone binding protein transthyretin. Depending upon the dose of toxin and the congener used, the toxins either decrease or mimic the biological action of the thyroid hormones. Either effect, if occurring during brain development, can have disastrous consequences. Children and animals exposed to PCBs or dioxins in utero and/or as infants can exhibit varying degrees of behavioral disorders. These disorders resemble those seen in children exposed to thyroid hormone deficiencies in utero and/or in infancy. The mechanism of developmental neurotoxicity of PCBs and dioxins is not known but data suggest it could be partially or entirely mediated by alterations in availability and action of thyroid hormones during neurological development. It is possible that transient exposure of the mother to doses of toxins presently considered nontoxic to the mother could have an impact upon fetal or perinatal neurological development. If the toxins act via their effect on thyroid hormone action, it is possible that doses of toxins that would normally not alter fetal development, could become deleterious if superimposed on a pre-existing maternal/or fetal thyroid disorder."

There were 21 girls and 14 boys. Serum T4 and TSH level, 24 hours 131I uptake, and technetium-99m thyroid scintigraphy were performed after discontinuation of synthetic thyroid hormone for 4-6 weeks. Athyrosis was the most common cause and accounted for forty-three per cent of the patients. Twenty per cent of the patients had thyroid hypoplasia. Ectopic thyroid was found in thirty-three per cent of the patients. Only a patient whose diagnosis was organification defect had slightly enlarged thyroid gland, high retention of 131I and positive perchlorate discharge test. Onset of symptoms before 9 months of age may be helpful for distinguishing between lingual thyroid and the others. Serum T4 level less than 2 micrograms/dL was observed to be more common in athyrosis and lingual thyroid groups than thyroid hypoplasia group."

When comparing the data collected in six different villages of the area, significant negative correlations were found between the decrease in urinary iodide and iodide/thiocyanate ratio (I/SCN) and the increase in prevalences of visible goitres, endemic cretinism and transient neonatal hypothyroidism. The cretins were divided on clinical signs into two groups: myxoedematous (MC) and neurological (NC) cretinism. Differences were noted in the neurological signs and the type of deafness encountered in both types. Although some overlap did exist, proximal spasticity and rigidity were characteristic of NC. The hormonal profiles of the two groups, including TRH tests, were clearly different. The two groups were similar with regard to the percentage of palpable thyroids, the absence of antimicrosomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, seropositive viral antibodies and thiocyanate concentrations in serum and urine. Thus it is unlikely that these factors have any significant aetiological role in NC. The data collected in the general population in this area and those obtained in the mothers of the myxoedematous and neurological cretins support the hypothesis that the neurological signs are the result of hypothyroxinaemia in the mothers and the fetus at different periods of pregnancy. They could be aggravated by neonatal hypothyroidism, which may be transient in NC and permanent in MC."

In both groups of infants the same level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine was found, but it was higher than that in mothers. The binding properties of specific plasma proteins and free thyroxine index were the same in both groups of infants. The level of TSH in serum of suckling infants (4.7 +/- 0.5 microunits ml-1) was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than that in weaned infants (3.0 +/- 0.3 microunits ml-1). The level in mothers (4.0 +/- 0.3 microunits ml-1) did not differ significantly from that in both groups of infants. A positive correlation was found between the level of TSH in lactating mothers and their suckling infants (r = +0.494, P less than 0.05). The data suggest that the regulation of thyroid activity in infants may be affected by suckling."

During 1982-4, 488 infants with primary congenital hypothyroidism were detected by the 25 regional screening laboratories in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In addition, one infant had signs of cretinism at birth and was investigated before the screening test was done and four infants were known to have been missed by the screening programme; among these four infants the initial thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations were normal in two with inherited defects of synthesis of thyroxine, not measured in one, and false negative in one. The overall incidence of primary hypothyroidism was 1:3937 births (boys 1:6640, girls 1:2756). The incidence seemed to be reduced in infants born to black mothers (two cases only) and increased in those born to Asian mothers (61 cases). Congenital anomalies other than those of the thyroid glands were reported in 36 children (7%), and 15 (3%) died from various causes before the age of 4.

To evaluate the effects of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) on maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in pregnant women. Methods. 208 pregnant women at 24-28 weeks were divided into two groups, TPOAb-positive and TPOAb-negative groups. Thyroid function and TPOAb were determined in all subjects until 12 months postpartum. Levothyroxine was supplemented to maintain euthyroid with periodical checking of thyroid functions. The prevalence of postpartum thyroiditis (PPT), placenta previa, placental abruption, premature rupture of membrane, postpartum haemorrhage, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital hypothyroidism, and neonatal diseases were observed in two groups. Results. Of all women, 11.54% had a PPT. The prevalence of PPT was significantly higher in TPOAb-positive than TPOAb-negative group (42.31% versus 7.14%, P < 0.001), with 45.46% and 53.85% of PPT happening at 6 weeks postpartum in TPOAb-positive and TPOAb-negative groups. The incidence of polyhydramnios was significantly higher in TPOAb-positive than TPOAb-negative group (15.38% versus 2.74%, P = 0.02). Conclusion. Pregnant women with TPOAb-positive had increased risk of PPT, predominantly happening at 6 weeks postpartum. TPOAb was associated with increased incidence of polyhydramnios and the underlying mechanisms required further investigation. Earlier screening of thyroid function during pregnancy and postpartum was warranted in our region."

CD005253,0,8640295,0,Earliest prevention of endemic goiter by iodine supplementation during pregnancy.,"During pregnancy complex changes of maternal thyroid function occur and they are influenced by the maternal iodine supply. It has been demonstrated that with decreasing iodine supply maternal goiter and hypothyroxinemia as well as fetal and neonatal hypothyroidism become more prevalent. Therefore iodine supplementation during pregnancy is now strongly recommended also in areas of moderate iodine deficiency. To monitor the success of iodine supplementation and its theoretical risk of increasing the frequency of thyroid autoantibodies, we have investigated the thyroid volume, thyroid function, urinary iodine excretion and antibodies to thyroid peroxidase at 10-12 weeks of gestation and postpartum in 38 mothers receiving 300 micrograms potassium iodide/day and in 70 mothers without iodine supplementation. In all of their newborns thyroid volume was determined by ultrasound. The thyrotropin (TSH) levels and antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO-ab) in the neonates were measured in dried blood spots on filter paper from their newborn screening. Urinary iodine excretion was increased significantly after iodine supplementation in mothers (p < 0.001) and their newborns (< 0.05). No hypo- or hyperthyroidism was observed in the mothers or newborns. Interestingly, no difference of maternal thyroid volumes was observed between the two groups after pregnancy, but the volumes of the thyroid glands in newborns of mothers who received iodine were significantly (p < 0.004) lower (0.7 +/- 0.4 ml) than in the control group (1.5 +/- 1.1 ml). There was no change in the frequency of TPO-ab in either group after pregnancy. In four mothers transplacental passage of these antibodies was documented by positive measurement in the blood sample of the newborn. This study documents that iodine supplementation during pregnancy in an area of moderate iodine deficiency results in a lower size of neonatal thyroid volume and that this supplementation was not accompanied by an increase in the frequency of TPO-ab."

This review provides an overview of present findings concerning the association between maternal hypothyroxinemia during pregnancy and childhood cognitive functioning. Possible causes of maternal hypothyroxinemia and potential mechanisms underlying this association are also discussed. Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that maternal hypothyroxinemia in the first half of pregnancy but not later in pregnancy impairs cognitive development in infancy and childhood. Animal models confirm that the first half of pregnancy may constitute a sensitive period in which maternal hypothyroxinemia alters neurogenesis and causes neuronal migration errors in the developing foetal brain. However, observational studies in humans cannot demonstrate causality of the association between hypothyroxinemia and neurodevelopment. In the only completed randomized trial of antenatal thyroid screening and subsequent levothyroxine treatment of mild maternal subclinical thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroxinemia, the interventions did not affect offspring intelligence quotient (IQ). More randomized trials are needed investigating whether screening for hypothyroxinemia and its treatment earlier in the first trimester of pregnancy can improve child cognitive functioning or prevent neurodevelopmental changes. Long-term observational studies should identify molecular, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological factors involved in the association between maternal hypothyroxinemia and offspring cognitive functioning. Information on such mechanisms can be used for the development of innovative prevention and intervention studies that address maternal hypothyroxinemia and its potential consequences."

Recent trials have failed to show that supplemental thyroid hormone improves overall neurodevelopmental outcome. The objective of this article is too determine perinatal risk factors for transient hypothyroxinemia (TH). We studied a cohort of infants born between July 1993 and July 2000 who were less than 1500 g and who received a newborn screening for thyroid function ( n = 932). Total serum thyroxine (T(4)) was collected routinely on the fifth day of life. T (4) was correlated with gestational age (R = 0.59, p < 0.01). After controlling for potential confounding variables, gestational age, dopamine, and mechanical ventilation were found to be independently associated with low T (4) (overall model: r(2) = 0.41, p < 0.01). Number needed to treat (NNT) analysis showed treating all infants less than 27 weeks would lead to treating 6.3 infants for every one with a subsequent T(4) < 5 microg/dL. By combining gestational age and need for dopamine support, NNT = 2.4 for every one infant with subsequent T(4) < 5 microg/dL. Low gestational age, mechanical ventilation, and need for dopamine were associated with low T(4) levels and may be helpful in optimizing treatment strategies for TH."
CD005253,0,9779338,0,Does transient hypothyroxinemia cause abnormal neurodevelopment in premature infants?,"THOP is a relatively common condition whose long-term effects remain uncertain. The preponderance of evidence indicates that at the very least THOP is a marker of elevated risk of neurodevelopmental adversity, but whether this association is truly causal and whether thyroxine treatment in the neonatal period can prevent adverse outcome is as yet unknown. Since the number of infants born and surviving at very early gestations continues to increase, the importance of this condition will be magnified in the future. The major difficulty in establishing the causal role of THOP is the tangled time order of events in the early neonatal period. It is therefore unlikely that further observational studies will advance understanding. Energies should be focused on Assessing neurodevelopment objectively in survivors in each of the TRH trials. Developing a new multicenter trial of newborn supplementation with thyroid hormone that is carefully planned to have sufficient power to assess neurodevelopment in treated and untreated infants under a variety of baseline conditions."

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the red blood cells was either macrocytic or normocytic. The hemoglobin did not correlate with the serum thyroxine level. Anemia occurred only in those patients with heights below the third percentile, but there was no similar correlation with weights. Of the 10 patients who had radiographs for bone age, all showed severe delay (47 to 103 months) and had heights below the third percentile. Nine of these patients were anemic, but the severity of the anemia did not correlate with the delay in bone age. Neither microcytic anemia nor pernicious anemia, noted in many adult hypothyroid patients, was found in the children and adolescents with hypothyroidism studied here. The ""uncomplicated"" anemia secondary to hypothyroidism responded to thyroid replacement therapy alone. Anemia can be the most prominent feature of hypothyroidism. In patients with mild to moderate anemia of unknown origin, especially those with fall-off in linear growth and increased MCV, hypothyroidism should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the anemia."

CD005253,0,7122691,0,Propylthiouracil disposition in pregnant and post-partum women.,"Propylthiouracil (PTU) disposition was investigated in hyperthyroid women during pregnancy and post partum. The plasma half-life after the first dose averaged 0.66 h and became greater than 1 h with chronic drug therapy. The apparent volume of distribution after the first dose averaged 0.26 liter/kg, similar to nonpregnant hyperthyroid patients. There was a tendency to increased apparent volume of distribution with chronic drug ingestion. Plasma clearance of PTU showed no change related to disease or to pregnancy. Our data suggest that pregnancy does not have a major effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of PTU in the hyperthyroid mother. Observation of a prolonged plasma half-life for PTU in 1 patient post partum deserves further investigation to determine if this change is associated with clinically significant therapeutic or toxic effects."

CD005253,0,11773802,0,The influence of etiology and treatment factors on intellectual outcome in congenital hypothyroidism.,"To determine the effects of hypothyroidism and hormonal patterns on outcome, we tested 65 7- to 12-year-old children with congenital hypothyroidism using standardized tests of intelligence, neuropsychological functioning, memory, and achievement. Results were analyzed by etiology, time to thyrotropin normalization, and hormone levels at testing. Children with athyreosis scored below other etiologies on visuospatial, attention, and arithmetic indices. Children whose thyroid-stimulating hormone levels normalized by 1 to 2 months of age scored higher than later normalizers on indices of visual memory, attention, and arithmetic. Normalization of thyroid-stimulating hormone by 3 months of age was associated with better memory and learning abilities than later normalization. Thyroid hormone levels at testing were correlated with indices of sensorimotor, spatial, and language abilities. Two children with persistently elevated thyrotropin levels were not adversely affected. Present findings signify the need to establish etiology, normalize thyrotropin early, and maintain hormone levels in the normal range throughout childhood in children with congenital hypothyroidism."

Overall, plasma TSH was above 7 mU/l in 1280 out of 2960 samples (43%); the percentage was not related to severity of hypothyroidism at diagnosis. Mean values for thyroxine and free thyroxine, and to a lesser extent free triiodothyronine, were consistently lower in samples with TSH concentrations over 7 mU/l and this was the case in patients with either severe or less severe hypothyroidism. Raised TSH concentrations were also associated with lower mean doses of thyroxine (micrograms/kg/day) but here the mean doses of thyroxine in children with severe hypothyroidism were higher than in the children with less severe hypothyroidism. The mean dose of thyroxine associated with low/normal TSH values was highest in the first 6 months and fell progressively. Thyroxine dose was significantly related to thyroxine and free thyroxine concentrations but not to triiodothyronine and free triiodothyronine and the latter appeared to be of limited value as measures of plasma thyroid hormone status during treatment."

CD005253,0,22323846,0,Management and follow-up of thyroid cancer in pregnant women.,"Thyroid cancer, the most common endocrine malignancy, is often detected in young female patients. Therefore, pregnancy following thyroid cancer is not infrequent, and about 10% of thyroid cancers occurring during the reproductive years are diagnosed during pregnancy or in the early post-partum period. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in young people generally has an excellent prognosis, and disease-free survival among women with DTC diagnosed during pregnancy may not differ from that in age-matched non-pregnant women with similar disease. However, thyroid cancer detected during pregnancy may cause anxiety about the optimal timing of recommended treatments and about both maternal and neonatal morbidity, as weel as pregnancy following a diagnosis of thyroid cancer obviously needs both maternal and foetal management. The main objectives in clinical monitoring of pregnant thyroid cancer patients are: 1) to reach an adequate balance of maternal calcium and thyroid hormones that is absolutely required by the foetal central nervous system for normal maturation; 2) to maintain optimal levels of maternal thyroxin to avoid possible recurrence or spread of disease; and 3) to perform safe follow-up visits for the mother and to plan further therapy when needed. Data from a review of the literature and the authors' own experience show that in patients undergoing either suppressive or substitutive thyroxine therapy foetal thyroid growth is normal at ultrasound study, newborn thyroid status is normal, and the incidence of maternal morbidity is not influenced by the pregnancy. In this review, the authors underline that regular adjustment of levo-thyroxine and calcium therapy is of outmost importance for both maternal and foetal well-being and offer some insight, very interesting from a practical point of view, to provide a clear and simple pathway for the management of pregnancy-associated thyroid cancer."

The underlying reason for this is the pathological lack of adaptation of the thyroid gland to high doses of iodine with persisting inhibition of hormone production through excess of intracellular iodine (Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Asthmatic patients--as in the case described - are usually affected, when they have taken iodine-containing expectorants over a long time. Provocation of an iodine-induced hypothyroidism by the recently required iodine prophylaxis of endemic goiter is not to be expected because the quantities of iodine lie within the physiological range."

Eighty-one pregnant women with low social background were selected on the basis of the presence of active carious lesions and were randomly divided into control (38) and experimental (43) groups. The initial dental status (DMFS and white spot lesions) was established through clinical examination. The prophylactic measures were repeated during pregnancy and 6 and 12 months after delivery. Both groups received primary care intervention. They were instructed in relation to the etiologic factors of dental caries and received oral hygiene kits. Oral hygiene instructions were reinforced through interactive brushing. The experimental group also received antimicrobial treatment (topical application of NaF and iodine solution immediately after prophylaxis and 3 and 5 days later) and restorative care using glass ionomer cement. By the time the children were 2 years of age, 33.3% of the infants in the control group and 14.7% in the experimental group had caries activity. A significant difference in caries prevalence was observed between children with and without visible dental plaque. The mean number of tooth surfaces with carious lesions (including areas of demineralization) was higher among the children in the control group compared to the experimental group (6.3 x 3.2), however, with no statistical significance. Maternal caries increase was a significant factor influencing the caries experience of the children. These data support the evidence of an association between caries prevalence in young children and clinical (dental plaque) and maternal factors."
CD005253,0,11400772,0,Neonatal screening for hypothyroidism at a university hospital in Thailand.,"Neonatal screening is an essential program for early identification of congenital hypothyroidism. Between July 1991 and May 1998, 37, 262 infants born at Chulalongkorn Hospital were enrolled to the screening program. Blood TSH levels were determined on infants at > or = 48 hours after birth. They were performed in dried blood sample taken by heel prick on filter papers. TSH levels were measured by fluoroimmunoassay from July 1991 to December 1997 and by immunoradiometric assay from January to May 1998. Infants with TSH screening level higher than the cut off level (20 mu/l) were recalled for re-evaluation which consist of complete physical examination and blood test for serum T4 and TSH. Bone age determination and thyroid scan using technetium-pertechnetate were performed if the serum T4 and TSH levels were abnormal. The recall rate was 0.28% and response rate was only 69%. Primary congenital hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 15 infants. Prevalence was 1: 2,484. Among these infants, 8 had ectopic thyroid, 3 had normal glands and 3 were athyrotic. One infant died before the thyroid scan could be performed and did not receive treatment. The median age at initiation of thyroxin therapy was 29 days (range, 20-67 days). The follow up result was satisfactory. This study demonstrated the potential vulnerability of congenital hypothyroid screening program in Thailand. Improvement of parents' education, communication and monitoring should be emphasized for a large screening program."

CD005253,0,14757964,0,"Selenium and thyroid function in infants, children and adolescents.","Selenium is an integral component of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and iodothyronine deiodinases. Although selenium nutrition could conceivably affect thyroid function in infants, children and adolescents, available data suggest that the effect of selenium deficiency on thyroid function is relatively modest. In patients with isolated selenium deficiency (such as patients with phenylketonuria receiving a low-protein diet), peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism is impaired but there are no changes in thyrotropin (TSH) or clinical signs of hypothyroidism, suggesting that these patients are euthyroid. Selenium supplementation may be advisable to optimize tissue GPx activity and prevent potential oxidative stress damage. In areas where combined selenium and iodine deficiencies are present (such as endemic goiter areas in Central Africa), selenium deficiency may be responsible for the destruction of the thyroid gland in myxoedematous cretins but may also play a protective role by mitigating fetal hypothyroidism. In these areas, selenium supplementation should only be advocated at the same time or after iodine supplementation. In patients with absent or decreased production of thyroid hormones and who rely solely on deiodination of exogenous L-thyroxine for generation of the active triiodothyronine (such as patients with congenital hypothyroidism), selenium supplementation may optimize thyroid hormone feedback at the pituitary level and decrease stimulation of the residual thyroid tissue."
CD005253,0,3874538,0,Late infantile tetany and secondary hyperparathyroidism in infants fed humanized cow milk formula. Longitudinal follow-up.,"Five full-term infants with birth weights appropriate for gestational age presented with hypocalcemic tetany at 5 to 9 days of age. All infants had been fed Similac 20, a cow milk formula. Initial mean serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and magnesium (Mg) levels of the tetanic infants were 6.8, 9.5, and 1.6 mg/dL, respectively. The mean serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was elevated at 79 mu LEq/mL (adult normal values, less than or equal to 57 mu LEq/mL). Following restoration of normocalcemia with Ca supplements, feeding was reinstituted with Similac 20 in two infants and Similac PM 60/40 in three infants. Serum biochemical and hormonal values were compared with those of 18 exclusively breast-fed infants followed up from three weeks to six months and 14 Similac 20-fed full-term infants followed up from one week to six months. In tetanic infants, serum Ca concentrations became elevated (10.4 +/- 0.05 mg/dL; mean +/- SEM) by six weeks (vs 9.2 +/- 0.3 mg/dL in breast-fed infants) (P less than .001) and serum Mg concentrations (2.26 +/- 0.01 mg/dL) by four weeks (vs 1.92 +/- 0.07 mg/dL in breast-fed infants) (P less than .01). Mean serum P concentrations declined progressively. Mean serum PTH concentrations were elevated and ranged from 74 to 143 mu LEq/mL at two to 16 weeks (vs mean 28 to 35 mu LEq/mL in breast-fed infants (P less than .0001). In 14 formula-fed-nontetanic full-term infants, serum PTH concentrations were intermediate between formula-fed-tetanic and breast-fed infants, mean serum Ca concentrations ranged from 10.2 to 10.4 mg/dL, and mean serum P concentrations declined from 8.3 to 7.1 mg/dL. We speculate that acute hypocalcemic tetany in the study infants was induced by the relatively high P load in cow milk formulas (vs human milk); with the continued P load, secondary hyperparathyroidism continued, maintaining P, Ca, and Mg homeostasis."
CD005253,0,12793603,0,Thyroid hormone synthesis and storage in the thyroid gland of human neonates.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphological and biochemical maturation of the thyroid gland in human neonates. The mean iodine concentration in the thyroid gland of very premature infants (less than 32 weeks gestational age, 0-3 days survival, n = 12) was significantly lower than in the older group (34-41 weeks gestational age, 0-30 days survival; n = 15; p < 0.05). For the whole group of neonates there was a statistically significant linear correlation between duration of life, i.e. gestational age and survival, and iodine concentration (r = 0.64, p < 0.01). Although there was wide dispersion of the results the same tendency was seen for thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration in the thyroid gland (r = 0.52, n = 21; p < 0.05). Comparative histological examination of the fetal thyroids gave results in accordance with the biochemical data as intrafollicular colloid appeared to be more abundant in more mature thyroids. The iodine content in Tg was found to be 0.63 +/- 0.22% in very preterm neonates and was slightly but not significantly lower than that found in the thyroids of the older group (0.82 +/- 0.14%; p = 0.055). The content of T4 and T3 per Tg molecule in the neonates was related to the iodine content. The differences in mean values of T4/Tg and T3/Tg molar ratios between the two groups were not significant: T4: 2.8 +/- 1.8 mol/ mol, T3: 0.29 +/- 0.12 mol/mol in very preterm neonates; and T4: 3.5 +/- 0.7 mol/mol, T3: 0.34 +/- 0.09 mol/mol in the older group.

CD005253,0,15045705,0,"A radioimmunoassay for measurement of 3,3'-diiodothyronine sulfate: Studies in thyroidal and nonthyroidal diseases, pregnancy, and fetal/neonatal life.","Data suggesting that (1) sulfation of the phenolic hydroxyl of iodothyronines plays an important role in thyroid hormone metabolism and (2) maternal serum 3,3'-diiodothyronone sulfate (3,3'-T(2)S) may reflect on the status of fetal thyroid function stimulated us to develop a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for measurement of T(2)S. Our T(2)S RIA is highly sensitive, practical, and reproducible. T(4)S, T(3)S, and T(1)S crossreacted 3.1%, 0.81%, and 5.3%, respectively; thyroxine (T(4)), triiodothyronine (T(3)), and reverse (r)T(3), 3,3'-T(2) and 3'-T(1) crossreacted <0.1%. Although rT(3) sulfate (rT(3)S) crossreacted 55% in 3,3'-T(2)S RIA, its serum levels are very low and have little influence on serum T(2)S values reported here. T(2)S was measured in ethanol extracts of serum, amniotic fluid, and urine. Recovery of nonradioactive T(2)S added to serum was 96%. The dose-response curves of inhibition of binding of (125)I-T(2)S to anti-T(2)S by serial dilutions of ethanol extracts of serum or urine were essentially parallel to the standard curve. The detection threshold of the RIA varied between 0.17 and 0.50 nmol/L (or 10 and 30 ng/dL). The coefficient of variation (CV) averaged 9% within an assay and 13% between assays. The serum concentration of T(2)S was [mean +/- SE, nmol/L] 0.86 +/- 0.59 in 36 normal subjects, 2.2 +/- 0.06 in 10 hyperthyroid patients (P <.05), 0.73 +/- 0.10 in 11 hypothyroid patients (not significant [NS]), 6.0 +/- 1.5 in 16 patients with systemic nonthyroidal illness (P <.001), 18 +/- 2.5 in 16 newborn cord blood sera (P <.02), 2.7 +/- 0.32 in 25 pregnant women [15 to 40 weeks gestation, P <.001], 0.94 +/- 0.10 in 10 hypothyroid women receiving T(4) replacement therapy (NS), and 2.0 +/- 0.38 in 11 hypothyroid women treated with T(4) replacement and oral contraceptives (P <.02); serum T(2)S levels in the third trimester of pregnancy were similar to those in the second trimester of pregnancy. T(2)S concentration in amniotic fluid was 12.5 +/- 2.7 nmol/L (n = 7) at 15 to 20 weeks gestation, and it decreased markedly to 3.3 +/- 1.3 nmol/L (n = 3) at 35 to 38 weeks gestation. Urinary excretion of T(2)S in random urine samples of 19 normal subjects was 10.9 +/- 1.3 nmol/g creatinine. (1) T(2)S is a normal component of human serum, urine, and amniotic fluid, and serum T(2)S levels change substantially in several physiologic and pathologic conditions; (2) high serum T(2)S in pregnancy may signify increased transfer of T(2)S from fetal to maternal compartment, estrogen-induced increase in T(2)S production, decreased clearance, or a combination of these factors. The data do not support the notion that fetal thyroid function is the only or the predominant factor responsible for high serum T(2)S in pregnant women."
CD005253,0,27244801,0,Case Report: The Specter of Untreated Congenital Hypothyroidism in Immigrant Families.,"Newborn screening has dramatically reduced rates of untreated congenital hypothyroidism (CH). However, in low-income nations where newborn screening programs do not exist, untreated CH remains a significant health and societal challenge. The goal of this report is to alert health care providers about the potential of undiagnosed CH in unscreened immigrant children. We report 3 siblings of Somali descent with CH who started treatment with levothyroxine at age 0.5 years, 7.7 years, and 14.8 years and were followed for 8 years. This case series demonstrates a spectrum of severity, response to treatment, and neurocognitive and growth outcomes depending on the age at treatment initiation. Patient 1, now 22 years old, went undiagnosed for 14.8 years. On diagnosis, his height was -7.5 SDs with a very delayed bone age of -13.5 SDs. His longstanding CH was associated with empty sella syndrome, static encephalopathy, and severe musculoskeletal deformities. Even after treatment, his height (-5.2 SDs) and cognitive deficits remained the most severe of the 3 siblings. Patient 2, diagnosed at 7.7 years, had moderate CH manifestations and thus a relatively intermediate outcome after treatment. Patient 3, who had the earliest diagnosis at 0.5 years, displayed the best response, but continues to have residual global developmental delay. In conclusion, untreated CH remains an important diagnostic consideration among immigrant children."

As this thyroglobulin assay required at least 400 microliter serum for a duplicate determination, it was decided to employ a sensitive immunoluminometric assay (detection limit 50 amol/tube) instead, the amount of serum needed being reduced to 100 microliter, the sensitivity to under 3 micrograms/l. We describe the serum thyroglobulin concentrations determined by the immunoluminometric assay in both cord and venous blood and in both full-term and pre-term babies divided into 4 main groups with respect to thyroid function. The criteria for the groups with thyroid dysfunction were determined as a result of a) isolated thyrotropin elevation measured in the dry blood spot test (thyrotropin above 4 mU/l), b) lowered thyroxine:thyroxine binding globulin ratio together with elevated thyrotropin both prior to and under substitution with L-thyroxine. In full-term babies thyroglobulin levels in serum fell steadily over the first months of life. The same effect was seen in pre-term babies. The effect of L-thyroxine on the suppression of serum thyroglobulin levels appeared to be dose-dependent, as newborns from experimental criterium group a) (defined above) showed no suppression of serum thyroglobulin levels when under partial substitution with L-thyroxine (median 84 micrograms/l), whereas those in group b), i.e. with full L-thyroxine substitution showed a noticeable suppression of serum thyroglobulin (median 27 micrograms/l)."

Numerous studies have assessed the effects of micronutrient supplementation on growth and cognitive development in infants, toddlers and preschoolers. However, micronutrient interventions on the cognitive performance of older children are limited. This article seeks to provide an update on micronutrient interventions and cognitive outcomes among children aged 5-15 years in developing countries. A total of 13 randomized controlled trials published since 2000 were identified. Majority of these studies assessed the effects of micronutrient-fortified foods on various domains of cognitive function. Among key micronutrients assessed were iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A. This review found a lack of consistency in the impact of micronutrient supplementation on intelligence, long term mental functions and school examination grades of the children. A beneficial effect of micronutrient supplementation on short term memory was more consistently reported. Overall, the evidence from this review for the impact of micronutrients on cognitive performance in older children remains equivocal. In light of the growing interest on the influence of nutrition on cognition, it is important that culturally-appropriate and sufficiently sensitive assessment tools be used for measuring the desired cognitive outcomes that are most likely to be affected by the nutrients under study."

T4 was found to be significantly higher in breast-fed than in weaned infants at the age of 4 and 6 months and so was rT3 at the age 4 months. The body weight of breast-fed girls at the age 4 and 6 months was lower than that of formula-fed ones. Breast-feeding at the age 9 months resulted in a decreased serum TSH. Serum T3 of infants weaned before the end of the first week of life was higher than in other groups of infants at the age of 10 weeks. Serum T4 of children 1-2-year-old correlated positively with the age at weaning, provided that they had been breast-fed at least for 60 days. Serum rT3 of 2-year-old children also correlated with the age of weaning. Serum TSH at the age of 3 years was higher in children who had been weaned during first 60 days of life than in those weaned later.

CD005253,0,20537182,0,Congenital hypothyroidism.,"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) occurs in approximately 1:2,000 to 1:4,000 newborns. The clinical manifestations are often subtle or not present at birth. This likely is due to trans-placental passage of some maternal thyroid hormone, while many infants have some thyroid production of their own. Common symptoms include decreased activity and increased sleep, feeding difficulty, constipation, and prolonged jaundice. On examination, common signs include myxedematous facies, large fontanels, macroglossia, a distended abdomen with umbilical hernia, and hypotonia. CH is classified into permanent and transient forms, which in turn can be divided into primary, secondary, or peripheral etiologies. Thyroid dysgenesis accounts for 85% of permanent, primary CH, while inborn errors of thyroid hormone biosynthesis (dyshormonogeneses) account for 10-15% of cases. Secondary or central CH may occur with isolated TSH deficiency, but more commonly it is associated with congenital hypopitiutarism. Transient CH most commonly occurs in preterm infants born in areas of endemic iodine deficiency. In countries with newborn screening programs in place, infants with CH are diagnosed after detection by screening tests. The diagnosis should be confirmed by finding an elevated serum TSH and low T4 or free T4 level. Other diagnostic tests, such as thyroid radionuclide uptake and scan, thyroid sonography, or serum thyroglobulin determination may help pinpoint the underlying etiology, although treatment may be started without these tests. Levothyroxine is the treatment of choice; the recommended starting dose is 10 to 15 mcg/kg/day. The immediate goals of treatment are to rapidly raise the serum T4 above 130 nmol/L (10 ug/dL) and normalize serum TSH levels. Frequent laboratory monitoring in infancy is essential to ensure optimal neurocognitive outcome. Serum TSH and free T4 should be measured every 1-2 months in the first 6 months of life and every 3-4 months thereafter. In general, the prognosis of infants detected by screening and started on treatment early is excellent, with IQs similar to sibling or classmate controls. Studies show that a lower neurocognitive outcome may occur in those infants started at a later age (> 30 days of age), on lower l-thyroxine doses than currently recommended, and in those infants with more severe hypothyroidism."

T3 and the rT3/T3 ratio was increased in healthy and in the sick prematures, the sick prematures showing higher values, and decreased in both groups during the first week of life. We found no significant correlation between TSH and the peripheral thyroid hormone levels as well as no relation between the respiratory compliance-indicating degree of lung maturity-and the T3 or T4 concentrations. Postpartal T3 or T4 serum levels were correlated significantly with the duration of artificial ventilation.

CD005253,0,17701774,0,Iodine and thyroid hormones during pregnancy and postpartum.,"Iodine is a trace element essential for synthesis of the thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones play a vital role in the early growth and development stages of most organs, especially the brain. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that, after famine, iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of cerebral lesions including different degrees of mental retardation and cerebral paralysis. The main function of iodine in vertebrates is to interact with the thyroid hormones. During pregnancy sufficient quantities of iodine are required to prevent the appearance of hypothyroidism, trophoblastic and embryonic or fetal disorders, neonatal and maternal hypothyroidism, and permanent sequelae in infants. Thyroid hormone receptors and iodothyronine deiodinases are present in placenta and central nervous tissue of the fetus. A number of environmental factors influence the epidemiology of thyroid disorders, and even relatively small abnormalities and differences in the level of iodine intake in a population have profound effects on the occurrence of thyroid abnormalities. The prevalence of disorders related to iodine deficit during pregnancy and postpartum has increased. Iodine supplementation is an effective measure in the case of pregnant and lactating women. However, it is not implemented and the problem is still present even in societies with theoretically advanced health systems. During pregnancy and postpartum, the WHO recommends iodine intake be increased to at least 200 microg/day. Side-effects provoked by iodine supplementation are rare during pregnancy at the recommended doses."

The diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. The distinction between acute pyelonephritis and UTI without renal involvement is very important, because renal infection may cause parenchymal scarring and thus requires more aggressive investigation and follow-up monitoring. However, this distinction is not easy among children, because common clinical findings and laboratory parameters are nonspecific, especially among young children. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from febrile UTI without renal lesions in a group of 100 children, we measured serum levels of procalcitonin (PCT), a new marker of infection. The objective of the study was to determine the accuracy of PCT measurements, compared with C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, in diagnosing acute renal involvement during febrile UTI and in predicting subsequent scars, as assessed with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy."

It is unclear if elevated thyrotropin during early treatment indicates non-optimal treatment. In a cohort of 49 children with congenital hypothyroidism, we studied the decline in serum thyrotropin concentration after initiating L-thyroxine treatment, the relationship between elevated thyrotropin and treatment variables, and non-compliance with the treatment as a possible cause of elevated thyrotropin. The initial mean dose of thyroxine was 8.5 (SD 3.3) micrograms/kg body weight/day: 71% of the serum samples obtained 15-21 days after the start of treatment had serum thyrotropin concentrations < 10 mU/l. Six children had no samples with serum thyrotropin < 10 mU/l during the first 3 months of treatment. These children had a lower thyroxine dose prescribed, and serum thyrotropin was normalized when the dose was sufficiently increased.

Urine T4 and T3 were also determined. T4 and T3 serum concentrations increased from Group I to Group III, but were similar on day 1 and 5 in each group. rT3 was higher in Group I on day 1. The low concentrations of T4 were not dependent on the TBG levels. TSH levels were higher on day 1 than on day 5, but the hormonal feed back mechanism was not effective on day 1. Hormonal urine excretions were similar on day 1 and 5, except a higher T4 excretion in Group III on day 5. These results were related to the maturation steps in healthy premature infants where gestational age seemed more important than body weight in respect to some thyroid hormone parameters."

Fifty-one pregnancies (34%) were conceived under hypothyroidism: 16 overt (X +/- standard deviation [SD], thyroxine [T4]: 2.44 +/- 0.7 microg/dL; thyrotropin [TSH]: 33.4 +/- 8.82 mIU/L), and 35 subclinical hypothyroidism (T4: 6.93 +/- 1.88 microg/dL; TSH: 12.87 +/- 8.43 mIU/L); 99 pregnancies were conceived under euthyroidism while undergoing thyroid therapy. When treatment with levothyroxine was inadequate, the outcome of pregnancy was abortion in 60% of overtly hypothyroid patients and in 71.4% of subclinically hypothyroid patients, premature delivery in 20% and 7.2% respectively, and term delivery in 20% and 21.4%, respectively. When treatment was adequate, 100% of overtly hypothyroid patients and 90.5% of subclinically hypothyroid patients carried pregnancies to term; there were no abortions in any of the groups. Abortions, premature and term deliveries in patients who were euthyroid on levothyroxine at the time of conception were 4%, 11.1% and 84.9% respectively. Of the patients receiving levothyroxine therapy before conception, 69.5% had to increase the dose (mean increase 46.2 +/- 29.6 microg/d). Of 126 evaluated newborns, 110 were delivered at term while 16 were premature. Eight newborns, 4 were premature, had congenital malformations (6.3%), and 4 died. Our results show that the evolution of pregnancies did not depend on whether the hypothyroidism was overt or subclinical but mainly on the treatment received. The adequate treatment of hypothyroidism during gestation minimizes risks and generally, makes it possible for pregnancies to be carried to term without complications."

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (measured in a previous study) were the dominant brominated flame retardants, contributing 42-87% of the total, and HBCDs contributed 5-18%. TBBPA concentrations were 2-5 times higher in the infants than in the mothers. The TBBPA concentrations decreased dramatically with age for 2-3 months after birth, which might be caused by its relatively high maternal transfer rate, short half-life, and fast excretion. Significant correlations were found between mothers and infants in the TBBPA and HBCD concentrations, implying that maternal transfer was important. TBBPA correlated weakly with thyroid hormones, showing a positive relationship with FT4 but a negative relationship with T3."
CD005253,0,21857388,0,Impaired neuromotor outcome in school-age children with congenital hypothyroidism receiving early high-dose substitution treatment.,"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) can lead to intellectual deficits despite early high-dose treatment. Our study aimed to determine whether motor impairments can occur despite early high-dose treatment. Sixty-three children with CH and early (median age of onset of treatment 9 d), high-dose treatment (median starting dose of levothyroxine 14.7 μg/kg/d) were tested with the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment (ZNA) at a median age of 13.8 y (range 7.0-14.2 y). Median z-scores in the children with CH were -0.95 in the pure and -0.56 in the adaptive fine motor component, significantly lower than in the ZNA test norms (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). The 26 children with athyreosis were more affected than the 33 children with dysgenesis, particularly in the pure motor (-1.55 versus -0.76, p = 0.03), adaptive fine motor (-1.31 versus 0.13, p < 0.01), and static balance task (-0.47 versus 0.67, p = 0.01). Boys performed worse than girls. Older age at onset of treatment was related to poorer adaptive fine motor performance. Movement quality (assessed by associated movements) was not affected. We conclude that severe CH can cause neuromotor deficits persisting into adolescence. These deficits cannot completely be reversed by postnatal treatment, but earlier age at treatment may reduce the degree of impairment."
CD005253,0,1825262,0,Age-related patterns of thyroid-stimulating hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation in Down syndrome.,"Thyroid function in subjects with Down syndrome was studied using the thyrotropin-releasing hormone test. Forty-seven infants and children with Down syndrome were investigated. Ages ranged from 1 month to 7 years; there were 26 boys and 21 girls. Fourteen of the subjects with Down syndrome who had an exaggerated thyroid-stimulating hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation had two or more annual follow-up tests. The remaining 33 subjects who only underwent one thyrotropin-releasing hormone test were compared with 22 age-matched controls (11 boys and 11 girls). Mean basal thyroxine 4 and triiodothyronine 3 values were in the normal ranges. All thyroid antibody titers were negative. Mean basal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels of subjects with Down syndrome were significantly higher than those of controls for all ages, even though there was a decline in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in both groups. Peak thyroid-stimulating hormone response levels were significantly greater in the subjects with Down syndrome than in the controls. Longitudinal study of the 14 children with Down syndrome with an exaggerated thyroid-stimulating hormone response showed that the response remained exaggerated until the third year of life, when it declined to normal levels. Thyroid dysfunction during the growth spurt of infancy or delayed maturation of the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis are proposed mechanisms."

All children examined in the study had symptomatic recurrent urinary tract infections; they were divided into three groups according to age (0-24 months; 25-72 months; 73-120 months). The contrast medium was injected in a dose of 1 ml/kg + 6 ml. Blood and urine samples were taken at regular time intervals over a 24-hour period in children, whereas in infants only blood samples were collected. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a bicompartmental open model, as follows: t1/2 alpha (h) = 0.33; t1/2 beta (h) = 1.92; Vc (l/kg) = 0.40; V beta (l/kg) = 0.20; Cl (l/kg) = 0.16.

CD005253,0,1867878,0,Neonatal effects of methyldopa therapy in pregnancy hypertension.,"This study has been performed to assess the effect of methyldopa (MD) therapy in pregnancy hypertension on the neonatal adaptation. Infants born to mothers on MD for several weeks prior to delivery and presenting with excessive tremor and irritability were evaluated according to the dose of maternal MD. Pregnancy hypertension and high dose MD was associated with impaired placental perfusion, compromised function of fetoplacental unit and more frequent surgical delivery. Infants of mothers on high (1.25-2.0 g/day) or low (less than 1 g/day) MD had gestational age, head circumference, acid-base balance, Apgar score and blood pressure similar to those born to healthy control mothers. The birth weight of infants of the high MD group, however, were significantly lower than in the low-dose or control groups. MD therapy resulted in a dose-dependent increase in plasma levels of prolactin, thyrotropin and triiodthyronine indicating decreased dopaminergic inhibition of pituitary hormone release. Plasma thyroxine concentration, however, decreased significantly. Cerebrospinal fluid noradrenaline was found to be markedly depressed after maternal MD showing disturbed central nervous system monoamine metabolism. It is suggested that MD administration to mothers presenting with pregnancy hypertension interferes with cerebral monoamine metabolism of the neonate and induces alterations in some endocrine functions under dopaminergic control. The possible role of chronic fetal distress frequently associated with pregnancy hypertension should also be considered."

CD005253,0,24932597,0,Prader-Willi syndrome and growth hormone deficiency.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare multisystem genetic disorder demonstrating great variability with changing clinical features during patient's life. It is characterized by severe hypotonia with poor sucking and feeding difficulties in early infancy, followed by excessive eating and gradual development of morbid obesity in later infancy or early childhood. The phenotype is most probably due to hypothalamic dysfunction which is also responsible for growth hormone (GH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiencies, central adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadism. The multidimensional problems of patients with PWS can be managed with multidisciplinary approach. Reduced GH secretion, low peak GH response to stimulation, decreased spontaneous GH secretion and low serum IGF-1 levels in PWS patients have been documented in many studies. GH therapy has multiple beneficial effects on growth and body composition, motor and mental development in PWS patients. The recommended dosage for GH is 0.5-1 mg/m2/day. GH therapy should not be started in the presence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, severe obesity and diabetes mellitus. GH treatment should be considered for patients with genetically confirmed PWS in conjunction with dietary, environmental and life-style measures."

Fifty-four triplets in all (spontaneous deliveries, full term infants from the Cîmpulung endemic goiter area) were thus determined by sampling out the native families. The controls were 10 triplets from Bucharest, a non-endemic goiter area. A group of 31 pregnant women from the endemic area who have received iodinated oil in the 3rd - 4th month of pregnancy for prophylactic purposes are brought into discussion. The mean thyroxine and TSH values in C were by 29% lower and 60% higher, respectively, as against the values found for the Bucharest subjects. The statistical analysis of the dependency of Nb thyroxine on the C values showed the existence of a close positive relationship between the two parameters (r = 0.81; p less than 0.001). Worth pointing out are the positive effects of iodinated prophylaxis in pregnant women, as demonstrated by the improvement of the thyroid parameters in C, i.e. 5 - 6 months after administration."

In infants with IRDS a reduced thyrotropin (TSH) response to birth was suggested, as serum TSH was lower in IRDS patients than in controls during the first two days of life. Low serum concentrations of thyroid hormones were found in the acute stage of IRDS reaching minimal values by day 3--5. After that period an increase in thyroid hormone levels occurred. The serum T2 increased to the level of healthy prematures by day 6--10, whereas the serum T4 increased to normal levels by day 21--30. Serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) were significantly lower in IRDS patients than in healthy controls; a gradual increase to normal levels occurred during recovery. Serum prealbumin (TBPA) levels in IRDS infants increased rapidly after birth and exceeded levels of healthy infants. Serum albumin values were not significantly different in the two groups of infants. The serum T4/TBG ratios were low during recovery from IRDS."

The boy was born after 40 weeks of gestation by normal vaginal delivery from nonconsanguineous parents. There were no abnormal physical findings; however neonatal mass screening for congenital hypothyroidism at 5 days of age demonstrated elevated thyrotropin (TSH) level (15.5 microU/ml, normal range 0.54-10.0 microU/ml). He was suspected to have subclinical or mild congenital hypothyroidism (CH). Thus he was treated with L-thyroxine using a regimen that rendered his serum TSH concentration within normal range from 27 days of age. Despite early and adequate treatment, he showed signs of global developmental delay and became gradually hypotonic and exhibited a staggering gait at 3 years of age. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated marked cerebellar atrophy with an intact brainstem. Thyroidal uptake of radioiodide and thyroid gland size were normal, indicating a functional defect only. The relation between congenital hypothyroidism and severe cerebellar atrophy in our patient is not clear. As only a few cases of the combination of CH and cerebellar anomalies have been described previously, cerebellar symptoms in CH should be examined carefully."

CD005253,0,15579049,0,Thyroid hormone ligands and metabolic diseases.,"Thyroid hormones regulate fundamental genes involved in the metabolism, development and homeostasis of vertebrates. The endogenous hormones, L-3, 5, 3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T(3)) and L-3, 5, 3', 5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T(4)), are of limited use in pharmacological intervention, mainly due to cardiovascular liabilities. There exist two subtypes of thyroid hormone receptors (TR), alpha and beta, unequally distributed in the body. As TRalpha is most abundant in the heart and most effects of thyroid hormones on the heart are mediated through TRalpha, a reasonable strategy is the development of TR agonists that either are tissue selective or that interact selectively with TRbeta. The prospects for the treatment of metabolic diseases with such ligands are considerable and this review describes the massive efforts of the academic and industrial communities during the last decade. It is, however, the author's view that the development of selective ligands only is in its infancy, an opinion highlighted by the limited chemical structural variation of TR ligands as well as the present lack of TR ligands for the treatment of metabolic diseases in clinical phases."

Potential pitfall for neonatal screening programmes.,"Thyroid function was studied in 54 low birthweight infants during a 3-week period. Each infant was placed in one of three groups. Group 1 (n = 21), infants who were well and appropriately grown fro gestational age; group 2 (n = 23), infants who were appropriately grown but who had hyaline membrane disease; group 3 (n = 10), infants who were small-for-gestational-age. In group 1, 5 (24%) infants had at least one serum thyroxine value less than 3.0 micrograms/100 ml (39 nmol/l). There were 8 (35%) infants in group 2 who had similarly low serum thyroxine values as did 5 (50%) of the 10 infants in group 3. Serum thyrotropin levels and serum binding of the thyroid hormones, as measured by a T3-charcoal uptake test, were normal in all infants. In all instances but 2, serum thyroxine values were at least 4.0 micrograms/100 ml (51 nmol/l) by the end of the 3-week period. There is thus a high incidence of transient 'hypothyroxinaemia' in low birthweight infants, particularly if such infants have hyaline membrane disease or are small-for-gestational-age. These findings must be considered when interpreting results of screening programmes for congenital hypothyroidism and they lend further support to the use of a combination of serum thyroxine and thyrotropin determinations for optimum screening of such infants."

Twenty-three very low-birth-weight infants of gestational age 26 to 28 weeks, whose serum T4 concentrations were 4 micrograms/dL on two occasions, and thyrotropin less than 20 microU/mL, were included in a double-blind study. Following a thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, babies were given either T4 or placebo. Nine babies were thyrotropin-releasing hormone tested prior to therapy; four babies, two from each group, were tested 1 to 2 weeks after therapy. In 11 untreated babies, mean base line serum thyrotropin of 7.0 +/- 1.4 rose to 23.7 +/- 4.1 microU/mL in 30 minutes. This response was not significantly greater than the observed response in full-term babies, 23.7 +/- 4.1 v 16.6 +/- 0.97 microU/mL, respectively, P greater than .05. In two babies treated with T4 the thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone was completely suppressed. Serial serum T4 determinations showed normalization in both groups after a similar time interval. There was no beneficial effect of T4 therapy on growth of head circumference, length, or weight. Developmental data revealed no significant differences in the mental, motor, or gross neurologic outcome in the treated and nontreated infants after 1 year of follow-up. These observations imply that hypothyroxinemia in sick preterm infants is not a direct consequence of hypothyroidism. Despite the lack of demonstrable short-term beneficial effects of T4 therapy, follow-up studies are necessary to resolve the question of long-term benefits."
CD005253,0,15774837,0,Development of contrast sensitivity in infants with prenatal and neonatal thyroid hormone insufficiencies.,"Thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development including structures critical for visual processing. While chick and rodent models have demonstrated abnormal visual development following prenatal thyroid hormone loss, comparable data do not exist in the human. To determine whether human infants with intrauterine and early postnatal thyroid hormone insufficiencies have compromised visual abilities, we investigated contrast sensitivity and visual acuity development in 13 infant offspring of women with hypothyroidism during pregnancy (HYPO), 16 preterm infants born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation, 12 infants with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), and 20 typically developing infants. All were assessed with the sweep visual evoked potential technique at 3, 4.5, and 6 months (corrected) age. Results showed significantly reduced contrast sensitivity but normal visual acuity in HYPO and CH groups relative to controls (p < 0.003 and p < 0.05 respectively). Stratification of the HYPO group into subgroups based on maternal TSH levels during the first half of pregnancy revealed lower contrast sensitivities for infants whose mothers' TSH values were above than below the median (p < 0.05). In the CH group, those with an absent thyroid gland and/or a newborn TSH value above 200 mIU/L had lower contrast sensitivities than did those with other etiologies or TSH levels below 100 mIU/L (p < 0.05). There were no significant effects involving the preterm group. These results indicate that thyroid hormone is important for human visual development."
CD005253,0,21802524,0,The role of iodine in human growth and development.,"Iodine is an essential component of the hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones, and therefore iodine, are essential for mammalian life. Iodine deficiency is a major public health problem; globally, it is estimated that two billion individuals have an insufficient iodine intake. Although goiter is the most visible sequelae of iodine deficiency, the major impact of hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency is impaired neurodevelopment, particularly early in life. In the fetal brain, inadequate thyroid hormone impairs myelination, cell migration, differentiation and maturation. Moderate-to-severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy increases rates of spontaneous abortion, reduces birth weight, and increases infant mortality. Offspring of deficient mothers are at high risk for cognitive disability, with cretinism being the most severe manifestation. It remains unclear if development of the offspring is affected by mild maternal iodine deficiency. Moderate-to-severe iodine deficiency during childhood reduces somatic growth. Correction of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency in primary school aged children improves cognitive and motor function. Iodine prophylaxis of deficient populations with periodic monitoring is an extremely cost effective approach to reduce the substantial adverse effects of iodine deficiency throughout the life cycle."

In level 1 infants, there were significant reductions in T(3) at 7 d (28-30 wk), 14, and 28 d (23-27 and 28-30 wk); T(4) at 7, 14, and 28 d (23-27 wk); at 14 and 28 d (28-30 wk); and at 7 d (31-34 wk); and free T(4) at 14 d (23-27 wk).

CD005253,0,1924992,0,"[Hypothyroidism: current clinical, physiopathological and therapeutic aspects].","The correct diagnosis and an appropriate classification of hypothyroidism must be considered on the light of the most recent physiopathological and molecular information. Hypothyroidism is no longer regarded as the rare disease characterized by a myxedematous condition as described since one century ago. With the present improvement of the diagnostic tools the thyroid hypofunction now includes all those blunted forms that are classified as subclinical or latent hypothyroidism. Thus, the hypothyroid syndrome, previously considered a rare event in its overt form, reaches a prevalence of 14% in female aged over fifty years. Following a coherent, concise historical review, the influence of age, surgery, drugs and autoimmunity on the etiology of the disease are critically discussed. The early detection and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism, to avoid an irreversible damage of the central nervous system, by means of the screening on the paper spot is also stressed. Replacement therapy with synthetic levothyroxine has to be personalized, according to the age and other clinical conditions, and should be prescribed also in the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,6144501,0,Use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in hyperthyroidism.,"There is an increasing use and variety of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) available for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Recent comparative studies suggest that atenolol (200mg daily), metoprolol (200mg daily); acebutolol (400mg daily), oxprenolol ( 160mg daily), nadolol ( 80mg daily) and timolol (20mg daily) produce a beneficial clinical response equal to that seen with propranolol ( 160mg daily). Most beta-blockers reduce resting heart rate by approximately 25 to 30 beats/min, although a lesser reduction is seen with those possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as oxprenolol and pindolol. While earlier studies employing large doses of intravenous propranolol concluded that beta-blockade reduced myocardial contractility, more recent non-invasive studies suggest that the predominant cardiac effect is on heart rate. In patients with cardiac failure, beta-blockers may, however, produce a profound fall in cardiac output. Nevertheless, in combination with digoxin they may be useful in controlling the atrial fibrillation of thyrocardiac disease. beta-Blockers improve nervousness and tremor (although to a lesser extent with cardioselective agents) and severe myopathy, and they also reduce the frequency of paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. There is often subjective improvement in sweating but usually no major effect on eye signs. Recent studies show a 10% reduction in oxygen consumption/basal metabolic rate with long term oral use of selective or nonselective beta-blockers. In addition, many agents (propranolol, metoprolol, nadolol and sotalol but not acebutolol, atenolol or oxprenolol) reduce circulating tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentration by between 10 and 40%, although the clinical significance of this effect (if any) is not established. beta-Blockers may also have endocrinological effects on gastrin, cyclic AMP, catecholamines and other hormone levels. Given in adequate dosage, propranolol has been shown to control thyrotoxic hypercalcaemia. Minor side effects (nausea, headaches, tiredness, etc.) are quite common but overall beta-blockers are well tolerated by the thyrotoxic patient. The major use of these drugs is in symptomatic control while awaiting definitive diagnosis or treatment. As an adjunct to antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine, beta-blockers will produce a satisfactory clinical response in the weeks to months before these forms of therapy produce a euthyroid state. beta-Blockers are more convenient than antithyroid drugs in the control of patients receiving therapeutic radioiodine, in that continuous therapy and assessment of biochemical response is possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

At monthly intervals serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were measured with radioimmunoassay, the Sephadex uptake of radioactive triiodothyronine (T3U) determined the free T4 and T3 indices calculated (FT4I, FT3I). TSH-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins (TBII) were determined by the radiomembrane assay. Serum TSH and T4 were measured at delivery from cord blood and/or from the newborn infants some days after birth. Serum TSH was significantly elevated in one infant. There was an inadequate post-partal rise in serum T4 concentration in this child and in another who showed only a marginal elevation of TSH. The mothers of these infants were given carbimazole in doses of 30 and 25 mg/day, respectively, at the time of delivery. No significant changes were seen in other infants, the daily doses being 20 mg of carbimazole or less. There was no clinical indication of hypo- or hyperthyroidism in any of the newborn. The TBII were positive in most patients and there was a trend of normalization during treatment. No relationship between the dose of antithyroid drug and the level of TBII could be seen. During treatment the dose was adjusted according to the FT3I values. This seems to be an adequate laboratory test for this purpose."

To successfully screen for CH, nurses must understand how to draw blood that will yield valid results on the metabolic screening filter paper. It is also important for the nurse to understand that thyroid levels are normally decreased in preterm infants and that regular follow-up of those low thyroid levels is crucial because levels may return to normal and eventual treatment is necessary. Early follow-up testing and treatment are essential. A thyroid scan or ultrasonography is optional and decided on by evaluating the risk-benefit ratio."

This study was performed to determine the therapeutic window for cycloheximide therapy. Seven day-old newborn rat pups were subjected to 100 min of 8% oxygen following a unilateral carotid artery ligation, and cycloheximide was given at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hr after hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Apoptosis or necrosis was identified by performing flow cytometry with a combination of fluorescinated annexin V and propidium iodide, and the extent of cerebral infarction was evaluated with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 48 hr and 72 hr after HI, respectively. With cycloheximide treatment at 0 hr after HI, both apoptotic and necrotic cells by flow cytometry were significantly reduced, only necrotic cells were significantly reduced at 6 and 12 hr, and no protective effect was seen if administration was delayed until 24 hr after HI compared to the HI control group. Infarct volume, measured by TTC, was significantly reduced by 92% and 61% when cycloheximide was given at 0 or 6 hr after HI respectively; however, there was an insignificant trend in infarct reduction if cycloheximide was administered 12 hr after HI, and no protective effect was observed when administration was delayed until 24 hr after HI. In summary, cycloheximide was neuroprotective when given within 6 hr after HI in the developing newborn rat brain."

CD005253,0,2719993,0,Congenital hypothyroidism: decreased growth velocity in the first weeks of life.,"The growth velocity of 46 infants with congenital hypothyroidism, classified into three groups: athyreosis (n = 12), ectopic (n = 25) and eutopic gland (n = 9), was analyzed. Height, expressed as the standard deviation score (SDS), was measured at birth, at diagnosis and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after initiation of therapy. Bone age was retarded at birth and at diagnosis, epiphyseal surfaces of the knee were correlated with serum T4 values. By contrast, height (mean +/- SD) at birth was normal (0.3 +/- 0.8 SDS) with identical distribution among the three subgroups. Growth velocity was decreased during the first weeks of life: height at diagnosis was -0.1 +/- 0.6 SDS, a value significantly different from size at birth (p less than 0.02). After therapy was started, a continuous decline in growth velocity was observed, reaching -0.2 +/- 0.7 and -0.2 +/- 0.6 SDS, respectively, at 2 and 4 weeks of therapy (p less than 0.01 vs. size at birth). Growth retardation was correlated with the degree of thyroid deficiency. Mean height after 2 weeks of therapy was at -0.6, -0.1, 0.1 SDS in patients with athyreosis, ectopic and eutopic gland, respectively. Catch-up growth occurred thereafter, and the mean height reached 0.3 SDS at 12 weeks for the entire group. A correlation between the decrease in growth velocity and T4 levels at diagnosis was found (p less than 0.05). The normal size at birth and the decreased growth rate observed at diagnosis seem to indicate that growth becomes thyroid hormone dependent immediately after birth."
CD005253,0,24928072,0,Energetic and nutritional constraints on infant brain development: implications for brain expansion during human evolution.,"The human brain confronts two major challenges during its development: (i) meeting a very high energy requirement, and (ii) reliably accessing an adequate dietary source of specific brain selective nutrients needed for its structure and function. Implicitly, these energetic and nutritional constraints to normal brain development today would also have been constraints on human brain evolution. The energetic constraint was solved in large measure by the evolution in hominins of a unique and significant layer of body fat on the fetus starting during the third trimester of gestation. By providing fatty acids for ketone production that are needed as brain fuel, this fat layer supports the brain's high energy needs well into childhood. This fat layer also contains an important reserve of the brain selective omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), not available in other primates. Foremost amongst the brain selective minerals are iodine and iron, with zinc, copper and selenium also being important. A shore-based diet, i.e., fish, molluscs, crustaceans, frogs, bird's eggs and aquatic plants, provides the richest known dietary sources of brain selective nutrients. Regular access to these foods by the early hominin lineage that evolved into humans would therefore have helped free the nutritional constraint on primate brain development and function. Inadequate dietary supply of brain selective nutrients still has a deleterious impact on human brain development on a global scale today, demonstrating the brain's ongoing vulnerability. The core of the shore-based paradigm of human brain evolution proposes that sustained access by certain groups of early Homo to freshwater and marine food resources would have helped surmount both the nutritional as well as the energetic constraints on mammalian brain development."

To examine the quantitative variations in thyroid hormone profile of neonates born to malnourished and/or anemic mothers, we quantitated the T3, T4, rT3 and TSH levels in cord blood of neonates and maternal blood of their corresponding mothers that are malnourished and/or anemic. Further, we classified neonates born to each of these groups of mothers into Small for Gestational Age (SGA) or Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA) based on the intrauterine growth curve for our population, and examined the thyroid hormone profile in these neonates. Our results show that firstly, the effects of malnutrition or anemia on thyroid hormone profile are distinct, secondly, significantly higher levels of cord blood T4 and correspondingly lower levels of T3 and rT3 are observed in the neonates born to anemic and malnourished mothers and thirdly, decreases in cord blood T3 levels were observed in Small for Gestational Age neonates born to anemic mothers. These observations lead us to speculate that alterations in the pituitary-thyroid function result in beneficial adaptations to the hostile intrauterine environment in malnutrition related growth retardation and anemia."

CD005253,0,10037082,0,Thyroid function in very preterm newborns: possible implications.,"Thyroid hormones are essential for brain maturation. Very preterm infants, who are at risk of neurodevelopmental disabilities also have low thyroxine (T4) and free thyroxine (FT4) values in the first weeks after birth. This transient hypothyroxinemia may in part be causal to the neurodevelopmental problems. We have carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with T4 in 200 infants less than 30 weeks gestation. T4 (or placebo) was given in fixed dose of 8 microg/kg birth weight per day during the first 6 weeks after birth. It resulted in a significant increase of T4, FT4, and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3). Thyrotropin (TSH) secretion was suppressed, and, probably as a result of TSH suppression, triodothyronine (T3) levels were decreased in the T4 group. Mortality was 14% in the T4 group and 21% in the placebo group (NS). No effect was found on morbidity. Heart rate was significantly higher in T4-treated infants less than 28 weeks gestation, but not in T4-treated infants 28 weeks or more, who had the highest FT4 levels. In the study groups as a whole, no clear effect of T4 administration was found on neurodevelopmental outcome. However, there was a strong trend toward improvement of adverse outcome, defined as death or abnormal developmental outcome at 2 years of age. In addition, mental outcome in a subgroup of T4-treated infants less than 27 weeks' gestation was significantly better than in placebo infants of the same age group. In conclusion, this trial does not clearly have conclusive results. New trials of thyroid hormone treatment should be carried out in preterm infants, in order to investigate whether indeed T4 supplementation is required in preterm infants less than 27 or 28 weeks gestation. Addition of T3 to the treatment schedule needs to be considered."
CD005253,0,18334798,0,Hypocalcemia in the newborn.,"Healthy term babies undergo a physiological nadir in serum calcium levels by 24-48 hours of age. The nadir may be related to the delayed response of parathyroid and calcitonin hormones in a newborn. This nadir may drop to hypocalcemic levels in high-risk neonates including infants of diabetic mothers, preterm infants and infants with perinatal asphyxia. The early onset hypocalcemia which presents within 72 hours, requires treatment with calcium supplementation for at least 72 hours. In contrast, late onset hypocalcemia usually presents after 7 days and requires long term therapy. Ionized calcium is crucial for many biochemical processes and total serum calcium is a poor substitute for the diagnosis of hypocalcemia."
CD005253,0,8408456,0,Amelioration of some pregnancy-associated variations in thyroid function by iodine supplementation.,"Knowledge of the effect of differences in iodine intake levels on public health in areas with no endemic goiter is limited. Groups at risk when iodine intake is relatively low are pregnant and lactating women and their newborns. A prospective randomized study was performed to evaluate the effect of iodine supplementation in an area where the median daily iodine excretion in urine is around 50 micrograms. Fifty-four normal pregnant women were randomized to be controls or to receive 200 micrograms iodine/day from weeks 17-18 of pregnancy until 12 months after delivery. In the control group, serum TSH, serum thyroglobulin (Tg), and thyroid size showed significant increases during pregnancy. These variations were ameliorated by iodine supplementation. Iodine did not induce significant variations in serum T4, T3, or free T4. Cord blood Tg was much lower when the mother had received iodine, whereas TSH, T4, T3, and free T4 levels were unaltered. The results suggest that a relatively low iodine intake during pregnancy leads to thyroidal stress, with increases in Tg release and thyroid size. However, the thyroid gland is able to adapt and keep thyroid hormones in the mother and the child normal, at least under normal circumstances, as evaluated in the present study. It is not known whether this stress is sufficient to be of importance for late development of autonomous thyroid growth and function."

CD005253,0,23214070,0,[Management of Graves' disease and hypothyroidism in pregnancy].,"In the treatment of pregnant patients with Graves' disease, propylthiouracil is preferred over methimazole in early pregnancy because of a possible teratogenicity of methimazole. Methimazole is preferable to propylthiouracil in other time of pregnancy on the basis of severe liver dysfunction occasionally caused by propylthiouracil. Fetal hypothyroidism can be avoided when maternal free T4 levels are maintained at or above the upper normal limit for non-pregnant subjects. However, maternal free T4 should be kept normal for pregnant reference range when pregnancy complications develop. Fetal hypothyroidism in this setting will not affect the infant's development as long as mothers are euthyroid and the infants recover from hypothyroid state within a short time after birth. In hypothyroid women, 1-T4 dose often needs to be increased in pregnancy. Maternal T4 deficiency in early pregnancy has been suggested to affect normal brain development in the offspring. However, it has recently been shown in iodine rich area that no adverse effect on neuropsychological development was seen irrespective of the severity of maternal T4 deficiency. Insufficient iodine intake in the mother can cause low T4 in pregnancy and also inadequate production of T4 in breast-fed infants when sufficient T4 is essential for normal brain development."

CD005253,0,1517370,0,Maternal and neonatal thyroid function at birth in an area of marginally low iodine intake.,"Thyroid function was evaluated in cord serum of healthy full-term newborns and compared to that of mothers immediately after parturition. The study was carried out in an area without overt iodine deficiency, but with a marginal iodine supply (less than 100 micrograms/day in 80% of women). The aim of the study was to delineate the interrelationships between the thyroid statuses of mother and child at birth. Maternal thyroid function was characterized at delivery by relative hypothyroxinemia; increased T3/T4 ratios, indicating preferential T3 secretion; slightly increased TSH levels within the normal range in 97% of women; increased serum thyroglobulin (TG) values, which were above normal in 60% of women; and also goiter formation in almost 10% of women. The findings indicated glandular stimulation and confirmed our earlier reports that pregnancy constitutes a stress for the maternal thyroid economy, enhanced by the limited availability of iodine in the diet. By contrast, newborns showed a strikingly distinct pattern: there was no relative hypothyroxinemia and free T4 levels were significantly higher than in the respective mothers (19.4 vs. 14.7 pmol/L; P less than 0.001). In spite of these differences, however, mean neonatal TSH and TG levels were significantly higher than maternal values, respectively 6.0 vs. 1.9 mU/L for TSH (P less than 0.001) and 70 vs. 40 micrograms/L for TG (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, neonatal TG and TSH levels increased in parallel and were highly correlated with maternal data, suggesting a regulatory link between both thyroid economies. The results suggested that the common regulatory link is the limited availability of the iodine supply. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that even in conditions with a marginally low iodine intake, pregnancy constitutes a stimulus for both the maternal and newborn thyroids. Changes in both groups are associated and the abnormalities in TSH and TG are amplified in the newborns. The TSH and TG alterations at birth in full-term healthy newborns, associated with similar alterations in maternal thyroid function, provide evidence for a common stimulatory factor, relative iodine deficiency. The data emphasize the hypersensitivity of neonatal thyroid function to marginal iodine deficiency and point to the need to increase the iodine supply in groups at risk, such as women during pregnancy, and also newborns in the perinatal period."

CD005253,0,16862939,0,Zinc in human health.,"Malnutrition is a contributing cause of about half of the 10 million deaths annually worldwide, and contributes to a substantial proportion of the infectious disease morbidity among children in developing countries. Recent epidemiological and clinical evidence has shown that in most developing countries deficiencies of specific micronutrients are partly responsible for the severity of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in malnourished children. Efforts to improve micronutrient status have focused on iron, vitamin A and iodine. Supplementation with iron and vitamin A significantly reduces child mortality, while implementation of the universal salt iodization strategy reduces the incidence of iodine deficiency disorders. These strategies are considered to be among the most cost-effective health interventions in developing countries. A number of recent zinc supplementation studies in developing countries suggest that greater priority should also be given to the correction of mild to moderate zinc deficiency in children, pregnant women and lactating mothers. Some of these studies showed that zinc supplementation reduces the duration of malaria, and the severity of diarrhoea and respiratory infections (including pneumonia), and improves immunocompetence in susceptible children. The results of these studies indicate that zinc may be another specific micronutrient in which there is widespread deficiency in developing countries and that great benefits can be achieved by its supplementation."

CD005253,0,12532684,0,Chernobyl and iodine deficiency in the Russian Federation: an environmental disaster leading to a public health opportunity.,"The Chernobyl nuclear disaster of April 26, 1986, triggered a chain of devastating events that later included an unexpected increase in childhood thyroid cancer and evidence of iodine deficiency (ID) in Russia. For the Russian people the Chernobyl event had profound psychological impacts, provoking anxiety about nuclear technology and mistrust of governmental control efforts. Frequently in public health a crisis is required to create the political will to manage longstanding problems, and public health officials must rapidly mobilize to take advantage of the opportunity. In this case, ID, previously not seen as a problem in Russia, was recognized to be potentially serious, and the Russian Federation, assisted by the catalytic bi-national effort of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation (Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission (GCC)) established a model salt iodization policy, developed a planning process, and implemented a program to prevent ID through a systematic approach that included the people, government, and private groups using open communication, dissemination of the findings, and action plans. By 1999, political will had been mobilized and over 20% of the nation's salt was being iodized, up from about 1% in 1996. Universal iodization of salt was not a specific objective of the GCC; however, the increasing availability of iodized salt is leading to the elimination of ID, which is now a political goal in Russia. The full realization of this goal will require more time for education, marketing, and possibly legislative action."
CD005253,0,23375074,0,Infant neurocognitive development is independent of the use of iodised salt or iodine supplements given during pregnancy.,"The benefits of iodine supplements during pregnancy remain controversial in areas with a mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of improving iodine intakes, with iodised salt (IS) or iodine supplements, in pregnant Spanish women. A total of 131 pregnant women in their first trimester were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) IS in cooking and at the table, (2) 200 μg potassium iodide (KI)/d or (3) 300 μg KI/d. No differences were found in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3) or thyroid volume (TV) between the three groups. Regardless of the group in which women were included, those who had been taking IS for at least 1 year before becoming pregnant had a significantly lower TV in the third trimester (P= 0.01) and a significantly higher urinary iodine in the first (173.7 (sd 81.8) v. 113.8 (sd 79.6) μg/l, P= 0.001) and third trimesters (206.3 (sd 91.2) v. 160.4 (sd 87.7) μg/l, P= 0.03). Also, no differences were seen in TSH, FT4 or FT3. Children's neurological development was not significantly associated with the consumption of IS for at least 1 year before becoming pregnant and no differences were found according to the treatment group. In conclusion, in pregnant women with insufficient iodine intake, the intake of IS before becoming pregnant was associated with a better maternal thyroid function. The form of iodide intake was not associated with maternal thyroid function or children's neurological development."

CD005253,0,8055793,0,"Principles, main goals and methods of the nationwide program: ""investigations on iodine deficiency and model of iodine prophylaxis in Poland"".","The main reasons to start investigations on IDD in Poland as a nationwide project of the Ministry of Health and Welfare sponsored by the State Committee For Scientific Research and Foundation for Polish Science were: cessation of iodizing of kitchen salt in Poland in 1980, increase of the incidence of goitre in the population and hyperthyrotropinemia in newborns, results of the survey undertaken after Chernobyl disaster indicating an increase of goiter incidence (Nauman et al.) and results of the pilot study (Gutekunst, Gembicki, Kinalska and Rybakowa) indicating an increase of thyroid volume and diminishing of iodine excretion in urine of children in Kraków, Białystok ad Poznań regions. Therefore the main goals of the project were as follows: to evaluate IDD in Poland on the population basis, to map goiter incidence and iodine deficiency in geographic areas, to evaluate a voluntary model of iodine prophylaxis in Poland (20 mg of KI/kg of salt). The investigations were carried out in 19330 children (48.7% of boys and 51.3% for girls) in age group 6-13 years, attending 111 coeducational randomly selected schools from all the country. This number represents 0.35% of children subpopulation in the above age-groups. For practical purposes local coordinating centers at the relevant Departments of Endocrinology and Board of Coordinators were set up. The programme of survey included: filling the questionnaire by children's parents, thyroid palpation and classification according to WHO and ICCIDD criteria, thyroid volume determination by means of ultrasonograph Kontron Sigma 1 L with linear transducer 7.5 MHz, determination of iodine in casual morning urine sample using Sandell and Kalthoff method. Determination of iodine concentration in urine was performed in each case of goiter and in the same number of children without goiter. The results were segregated according to coordinating centers and according to 6 geographical areas of the country. The results were calculated according to the descriptive statistics using Student's test, Chi-square test F-test and Leven's test. The results segregated according to geographic areas were tested by means of analysis of variance using the linear model. The final results of the programme are presented in the next papers."

The patients and controls did not differ in mean age at X-ray examination and age at the start of treatment (14.5 +/- 5.7 days). One of the methods used to score the size of femoral and tibial epiphyses was just as good as the other ones tested, but has the advantage of being the easiest to use and therefore clinically most suitable. Skeletal maturity assessed by this method correlated best with serum T4 (r = 0.62, p less than 0.01). Griffiths tests were performed in 37 of the 46 patients at 28-48 months of life. The best correlation obtained between neonatal skeletal maturity and Griffiths global developmental quotient at 3 years of age was r = 0.58 (p less than 0.001). Although statistically significant, it was too weak to be of clinical value in identifying individual patients at risk. We conclude that an assessment of skeletal maturation is not useful for the prognosis of psychomotor development in individual patients with congenital hypothyroidism receiving treatment within the first 2 weeks of life."

We investigated the status of iodine nutrition in 111 healthy subjects in this age group in an attempt to evaluate the risk of brain damage due to iodine deficiency in Belgium. In 244 causal urine samples collected in these subjects, the median concentration of iodine was 101 micrograms/l vs 180-220 micrograms/l under normal conditions. The daily supplementation of the subjects with a physiological dose of 90 micrograms iodine was followed by a slow and progressive increase of urinary iodine, which reached a normal level only after a delay of about 30 weeks of therapy. This observation suggests that part of the supplement of iodine offered to the children was stored in their thyroid glands until the iodine content of the gland had reverted to normal, reflecting the state of hyperavidity of the thyroid for iodide characteristic of iodine deficiency. In conclusion, infants and young children in Belgium are as iodine deficient as all other age groups of the population and, consequently, are at risk of brain damage. This works further illustrates the need for systematic iodine supplementation of the population in Belgium."

CD005253,0,2047138,0,Diagnostic dilemmas. Results of screening tests for congenital hypothyroidism.,"The natural history of congenital hypothyroidism has changed drastically since the institution of newborn screening in North America, Europe, and Japan. Before screening was available, diagnosis of this condition was often delayed. The IQ of 65% of all patients with congenital hypothyroidism was below 85, and 19% were profoundly retarded (IQ less than 15). In two large screening programs in which long-term IQ data are available, no child has tested below the IQ of 74. Furthermore, a comparison of affected children treated within the first month of life with matched controls demonstrated no significant difference in IQ scores between the two groups. Widespread screening has lead to the evaluation of over 7 million infants annually. This represents over 1200 fewer children with subnormal intelligence, and approximately 360 children annually who are saved from the effects of profound mental retardation. There is little doubt that newborn screening is one of the greatest advances in diagnosis and treatment of endocrine disease in the newborn period to occur in the past 20 years. However, even experienced screening programs are not perfect, so the practitioner must remain alert to the possibility of undiagnosed hypothyroidism presenting in infancy."

For some fetal tissues a comparison was made with the T4 values obtained in a previous study. Both hormones were already measurable in peripheral tissues at 8 weeks of gestation. The increase in GH was faster than for T4 and it reached the zenith at approximately 20 weeks; thereafter, the GH concentration declined until delivery. In contrast, T4 progressively increased until term. Thirteen tissues were studied both in fetuses and in adults: the GH concentration was about 10 times higher in fetal tissues, with the exception of the brain and the pancreas. The brain showed the lowest GH concentration throughout fetal life and adulthood, whereas the highest GH levels were recorded in adults' pancreas, but they resulted to be artifacts since the RIA values were not confirmed by the IRMA test. In both groups of subjects the highest GH concentrations were found in kidneys, liver and small intestine; the lowest, beyond the brain, in red muscle and cartilage. Thus, the pattern of the quantitative distribution of GH in fetal tissues is the same as in adults, suggesting a functional role of the hormone in the developing human during the prenatal period, in contrast with the concept that high tissue levels of GH are a mere reflection of high GH blood levels. Moreover, in all tissues examined no correlation was found between GH and T4 concentration."
CD005253,0,711496,0,Value of serum thyroxine measurements for the management of congenital hypothyroidism in children.,"Fourteen cases of primary congenital hypothyroidism were studied and separated for the analysis purpose into two groups. Group A consisted of 7 children whose hypothyroidism was diagnosed after 1971 and the therapy by thyroid gland extracts evaluated by regular serum thyroid hormone determinations. Group B was made of 7 children whose disease was diagnosed and treated before 1971. Two periods were therefore studied in group B: first period, before any hormonal determinations (as a growth control period for group A), and second period, during which hormonal determinations were made and taken into consideration for the dosage. Although growth patterns were similar in both groups, mean thyroid extracts dose was 63 +/- 25 mg/m2/day (mean +/- SD) during follow-up with hormonal determinations, while it was markedly higher during the first period of group B (125 +/- 76, range 46.1 to 219.9 mg/m2/day). The mean dose of 63 +/- 25 mg/m2 induces a mean level of plasma thyroxine of 82 +/- 32 microgram/1 (mean +/- 1SD), a normal growth (with catch-up growth in the patients who had a retarded growth), and a good psychomotor development. Regular measurements of serum thyroxine during therapy seems to be a valid parameter for determining the dose of thyroid gland extracts necessary for adequate substitution. Serum=1-triiodo-thyronine levels have more fluctuations than thyroxine. Serum TSH mainly prevents the underdose of patients but cannot help in case of overdose. The suggested dose for treatment of such patients is 88 mg/m2/day (= 63 + 1SD)."
CD005253,0,2267226,0,Congenital hereditary hypothyroidism--prenatal diagnosis and treatment.,"Intrauterine diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism was established on the basis of TSH concentration in amniotic fluid in the 22nd week of gestation for the offspring of a couple both known to have an iodide organification defect. Prenatal treatment consisted of intramniotic injections of 500 mcg Na-1-thyroxine, which was administered from the first amniocentesis until one week before delivery. Following delivery, the diagnosis was confirmed by the elevated level of TSH, 60.5 uU/ml, and a gradual decrease of fT4 to 0.8 ng/ml. Regular substitution therapy was commenced on the third day of life. The normal shape and location of the thyroid gland was demonstrated by Technetium scintiscan. At 18 months the infant revealed no significant deviation from normalcy in growth or mental capacity. This experience indicates that testing of amniotic fluid for TSH in the 22nd week of gestation can be diagnostic for congenital primary hypothyroidism. Furthermore, it is suggested that the treatment approach described is warranted in all cases in which there is a high risk of congenital primary hypothyroidism."

Areas covered: This review evaluates the most recent clinical studies about these new formulations. The liquid formulation has been shown to overcome: the food and beverages intereference with L-T4 tablets absorption, caused by food or coffee at breakfast; malabsorption induced by the increased gastric pH, resulting from atrophic gastritis, or due to proton-pump inhibitors; and malabsorption after bariatric surgery. The use of liquid L-T4 has been studied also in pregnancy, newborns and infants, suggesting a better bioequivalence than tablets. Finally, liquid L-T4 is more active than tablets in the control of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in hypothyroid patients without malabsorption, drug interference, or gastric disorders, leading to a hypothesized higher absorption of liquid L-T4 also in these patients. Few studies have evaluated soft gel L-T4 with promising results in patients with malabsorption related to coffee or gastritis. Expert opinion: Liquid L-T4 (and soft gel capsules) are more active than the tablet L-T4 in the control of TSH in hypothyroid patients with gastric disorders, malabsorption, or drug interference, but also in patients without absorption disorders."

All the group 2 infants and 36% of those in group 1 had a T4 screening value below the cut-off point (-2.1 SD). In group 1 there was a significant increase in T4 with birthweight at a given gestational age, as well as with gestational age at a given birthweight. In group 2 there was also a significant increase in T4 values in relation to birthweight and gestational age, but it could not be ascertained whether this increase existed at a given gestational age or birthweight. A statistical model giving normal ranges of T4 for both groups of infants is presented, which, if applied to low birthweight infants, makes it possible to estimate the effect of low birthweight on T4 screening values, provided the birthweight and gestational age are known. In this manner the sensitivity of screening for congenital hypothyroidism is enhanced and the recall rate reduced."

CD005253,0,1185416,0,Congenital hypopituitarism associated with neonatal hypoglycemia and microphallus: four cases secondary to hypothalamic hormone deficiencies.,"The association of hypoglycemia and microphallus in the male neonate is presumptive evidence of congenital hypopituitarism. This was observed in four male infants with normal birth weight and length, optic discs, and intelligence, and without gross central nervous system malformations. Plasma and urinary cortisol values were low. Stimulation with metyrapone and insulin hypoglycemia failed to elicit a rise in plasma corticoids, but multiple doses of ACTH evoked a response. Growth hormone responses to arginine, insulin, sleep, L-dopa, and glucagon were uniformly less than 2.5 ng/ml. In three patients, however, length remained within 2 SD of the mean until two years of age; in one, there was a sharp decrease in growth by three months. Two patients had low plasma TSH and thyroxine concentrations within the first month of life. In the other two patients, whose thyroxine levels were measurable, intravenous administration of thyrotropin-releasing factor evoked a normal rise in plasma TSH; serum thyroxine decreased into the hypothyroid range in one after GH therapy was initiated. Plasma prolactin was normal in the first two patients receiving thyroxine replacement therapy. The other two patients had elevated baseline prolactin levels and had an augmented rise in plasma prolactin after administration of TRF. Human chorionic gonadotropin induced a 10- to 15-fold rise in plasma testosterone in the two patients tested. The changes in plasma FSH and LH after luteinizing hormone-releasing factor were either low or in the prepubertal range. In three patients, treated with testosterone enanthate intramuscularly, phallic growth occurred. In addition, all three had a transient increase in height but no acceleration of skeletal maturation. The data suggest a deficiency of hypothalamic hypophysiotropic hormones rather than a primary pituitary defect. Early recognition of this syndrome complex is critical for prompt treatment of the life-threatening cortisol deficiency. The diagnosis is more difficult in affected females because their external genitals are normal. The microphallus is a remediable manifestation of hypopituitarism."

CD005253,0,11272101,0,Plasma free fatty acids in neonates with congenital hypothyroidism.,"Since the introduction of neonatal mass screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH), numerous cases have been detected. It is of interest that even severely hypothyroid neonates rarely exhibit bradycardia, hypothermia, or inactivity, which have been recognized as typical signs of CH. Regarding neonates and young infants, few reported data are available on the effects of thyroid hormones on energy expenditure. Plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), markers for lipolysis, play essential roles in maintaining physiologic homeostasis. To study fuel utilization in CH neonates, we measured heart rates, plasma FFA, and thyroid hormones before and after levothryoxine (LT4) replacement therapy. Fifty-five screen-detected CH neonates and 29 age-matched normal neonates for controls were enrolled. The CH neonates were divided into two groups according to serum thyroid hormone levels: a mildly hypothyroid group (n = 37), serum thyrotropin (TSH) less than 100 microIU/mL and free thyroxine (FT4) 0.6 ng/dL or more; and a severely hypothyroid group (n = 18), TSH 100 microIU/mL or more and FT4 less than 0.6 ng/dL. Twenty-four of the 55 patients had their heart rates measured by electrocardiography. Fasting blood samples were taken from the subjects during physical movements. Serum levels of TSH, FT4, FFA, and other blood chemicals, measured on an autoanalyzer system in our hospital, were compared before and after LT4 substitution therapy. The following results were obtained. The mean plasma FFA values before LT4 replacement were 208.5 +/- 89.4 microEq/L in the mildly hypothyroid group, 228.5 +/- 114.7 microEq/L in the severely hypothyroid group, and 213.9 +/- 97.7 microEq/L in controls. No statistical differences were noted among the three values. Two months after LT4 replacement therapy, at the age of 3 months, plasma FFA concentrations significantly increased in both groups compared with those before the therapy. Control infants also showed a significant increase in plasma FFA concentrations from 1 to 3 months of age. There were no significant differences in plasma FFA concentrations among the three groups at the age of 3 months. No significant correlations were found between plasma FFA and serum thyroid hormones. From these results it is suggested that in neonates and young infants, thyroid hormones do not play major roles in mobilization of fats through the adrenergic regulation of lipolysis for energy supply. This may be one of the reasons for the unexpectedly mild signs and symptoms in the screen-detected hypothyroid neonates."

A household was the basic sampling unit. Villages were selected randomly in the state and from these households were selected randomly using the electoral lists. All members of the households were studied. Total of 17,837 individuals from 3,197 households from 249 villages were studied. There were 8,953 males and 8,884 females. A total of 617 endemic cretins were identified: 316 males and 301 females. The overall prevalence of endemic cretinism was 3.46%: (males 3.53% and females 3.39%). Endemic cretinism was observed in 194 (77.9%) villages studied. Neurological cretinism was the predominant form (98.7%). Deaf-mutism was the most salient neurological feature seen in 472 (76.5%) subjects. Motor system examination revealed proximal spasticity and brisk reflexes, both more marked in the lower limbs. Recording of daily life activities revealed 14.1% of the cretins to be totally dependent and another 23% to be requiring considerable assistance for their daily routine activities. The overall prevalence of goitre found in this survey was 54%. Urinary iodine concentration was estimated from a representative sample of the population; mean 4 micrograms/dl (SD 2.68).

CD005253,0,17897901,0,[Reflections on mental retardation and congenital hypothyroidism: effects of trace mineral deficiencies].,"While deficiencies of trace minerals and vitamins are rare in humans eating a variety of food, they can occur in premature infants and those with disturbances in dietary behavior for physical or psychological reasons and during parenteral or enteral nutrition. Some deficiencies - such as iron and iodine - cause such serious specific disorders that they must be considered separately. Congenital hypothyroidism induced by iodine deficiency is a major problem. Its public health importance comes from the neurological complications that lead to the most severe forms of endemic congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism). In areas without iodine deficiency, the standard incidence of this disease in the West is 1/4,500 live births. In areas with iodine deficiency, however, its incidence varies from 1 to 5%! It is nonetheless underestimated, because the screening methods revolutionized 20 years ago are still not applied systematically. Additional factors include the thiocyanates in cassava, the selenium deficiency resulting in selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase deficiency, and the natural goitrogens in some foods: milk, millet, walnuts, and bacterial and chemical water pollutants. Adolescents and adults need 100 microg/day, children aged 1-10 years 60-100 microg, and babies under one year, 35-40 microg, but these daily requirements are not necessarily met. This threat weighs on a billion people, 50-100 million in Europe, especially pregnant women, fetuses, newborns, and young children whose cerebral development may be negatively affected in the womb and in early life. According to some authors, subjects with cretinism syndrome should be found in places where goiter prevalence exceeds 20%. Evaluation of diffuse intellectual impairment in the population would require tools too specific for most studies. Generations of children are the victims throughout wide swaths of the African ecosystem in which it is endemic and associated with poor adaptation to the environment. But studies of isolated places cannot be transposed to entire populations. Because pregnancy in women with hypothyroidism is often thought to have a very negative prognosis, the two cases we report merit attention. In one case, despite certainly insufficient thyroid hormone replacement treatment, the child was born alive and healthy. In the second case, where hypothyroidism followed a thyroidectomy in a woman with Graves disease, a hydrocephalic child was liveborn, without any replacement treatment. In her next pregnancy, she received optimal hormonal treatment and delivered a healthy liveborn child. The disorders due to severe iodine deficiency did not affect our two patients. In a series of 166 cases of congenital hypothyroidism in newborns, only two cases had maternal antithyroid antibodies. Elsewhere, 9 women with hypothyroidism had 11 pregnancies, 9 normal children, 1 premature child (mother had eclampsia), and 1 with Down syndrome and an Ostium primum defect (mother aged 41 years). Ontogenesis of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis of the fetus still appears today to develop independently of the mother in cases of hypothyroidism. An important role is played by type III deiodinase, which is especially active in the placenta during pregnancy, probably involving the T3 activity on nuclear and also mitochondrial receptors. The maturation of these receptors is not well understood."
CD005253,0,16943215,0,[Tc]-99m thyroid scintigraphy in congenital hypothyroidism screening program.,"The aetiology of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) may be important in determining disease severity, outcome and treatment schedules because athyroid patients need higher treatment doses and close monitoring particularly early in life. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid scintigraphy (TS) findings in infants with CH and to determine the relationship of serum TSH and T4 values with thyroid agenesia, in an attempt to identify factors that may detect thyroid agenesia before treatment. Since August 2002 to April 2005, screening program for CH was carried out in the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services, Isfahan, Iran. Screening was performed by measuring both the serums T4 and TSH concentration at day 3-7 of birth. Full-term newborns were recalled based on a serum TSH >20 mIU/l or serum T4 < 6.5 microg/dl and premature newborns based on T4 level by weight and TSH level by age. After repeating the laboratory test and clinical evaluation, Tc-99m TS was recommended for all infants with suspected CH before thyroxin replacement therapy. On the basis of Tc-99m TS, the thyroid gland was classified as normal scan, ectopic, goiter and athyrosis. TS results were compared with serum T4 and TSH levels. Of 93 381 newborns screened over a period of nearly 3 years, 262 neonates were found to have CH. The overall incidence of CH was 1 : 357 live births with a female/male ratio (F/M) of 1.4/1. Thyroid scan was performed on 116 (54%) of the infants with CH; of them, 33 cases (28.4%) were athyrotic (F/M = 0.8/1) while seven infants (6%) had ectopic thyroid (F/M = 1.3/1) and 76 cases (65.6%) had a normal thyroid scan (F/M = 1.5/1). Infants with the absence of thyroid in TS had significantly higher TSH value in comparison with those with ectopic or normal TS (116.3 +/- 109.64 vs. 108.10 +/- 62.92 or 55.35 +/- 48.26 mIU/l, respectively, P < 0.0001). Although not statistically different, the mean T4 level was higher in normal TS group than in ectopic and athyrotic groups (8.03 +/- 3.48 vs. 6.36 +/- 5.57 or 5.04 +/- 3 microg/dl, respectively, P = 0.09). We conclude that Tc-99m TS is a useful diagnostic tool for the initial investigation of suspected CH and considering the correlation of TS results with blood TSH levels, proper management and close monitoring of hypothyroid infants with severe hormonal alterations is necessary for the detection of thyroid agenesia."

CD005253,0,22908106,0,Unawareness of the effects of soy intake on the management of congenital hypothyroidism.,"It has been established that soy products can interfere with thyroid hormone absorption resulting in continued hypothyroidism in individuals receiving recommended levothyroxine replacement. It has also been reported that achievement of euthyroidism in hypothyroid patients using soy products requires increased doses of levothyroxine. We have observed 2 patients with congenital hypothyroidism who continued to manifest clinical hypothyroidism while receiving recommended doses of hormone and ingesting soy products. The first patient was diagnosed by newborn screening (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] =169 µIU/mL) and treated with 50 µg of levothyroxine since 6 days of age while simultaneously starting soy formula. At 3 weeks of age, she was clinically and biochemically hypothyroid (thyroxine = 4.0 µg/dL, TSH = 216 µIU/mL). We stopped her soy formula and decreased her levothyroxine dose. Three weeks later signs of hypothyroidism were resolving, and, by 10 weeks of age, she was clinically and biochemically euthyroid. Another patient was diagnosed by newborn screening, received levothyroxine, and did well. She was lost to us for 2 years. During this interval she began consuming soy milk and became profoundly hypothyroid (free thyroxine <0.4 ng/dL, TSH = 248 µIU/mL), even though the primary care physician had increased her levothyroxine dose to 112 µg/day. She was switched to cow milk, and her thyroid function slowly normalized with decreasing doses of levothyroxine. These 2 patients reinforce the importance of remembering that soy products interfere with levothyroxine absorption and can endanger infants and young children with congenital hypothyroidism who are at risk for developmental and growth delay."

We analyzed the electronic database of a large private neonatal practice group (Pediatrix, Ft. Lauderdale, FL) for 23- to 32-week gestation neonates ( N = 96,813) managed during 1997 to 2006. L-thyroxine use was analyzed by birth year and by gestational age (GA). L-thyroxine use increased with decreasing GA (nadir 0.3% at 32 weeks, peak 8.4% at 24 weeks). L-thyroxine supplementation increased 2.6-fold over time among infants ≤26 weeks' GA (3.4% in 1997 to 1999 to 8.7% in 2004 to 2006), but did not change among infants born at ≥29 weeks' GA. The highest rate of l-thyroxine supplementation (12.8%) occurred among 24-week GA infants in 2006. Median age at start of l-thyroxine was 23 days (25 to 75%, 15 to 38 days). Only 2% of treated infants were started on day of life 1. Despite no clear evidence from randomized trials supporting thyroid supplementation, l-thyroxine treatment of very preterm infants has significantly increased over the past decade. As l-thyroxine treatment was not consistent with protocols from published randomized trials, new focused randomized controlled trials are needed."

In order to evaluate the effect of thyroid hormone deficiency on antibody production, we evaluated serum IgA and IgM concentrations in 83 children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), diagnosed by neonatal screening. Patients were compared to two healthy, age-matched control groups. Patients with permanent CH had a significantly higher frequency of undetectable IgA concentrations (thyroid agenesis, P<10(-5); thyroid ectopy, P=0.013) and lower concentrations of IgA (thyroid agenesis, P<10(-6); thyroid ectopy, P<10(-5); dyshormonogenesis, P=0.0002) and IgM (thyroid agenesis, P=0.0002; thyroid ectopy, P<10(-6); dyshormonogenesis, P=0.0017) compared to control group. No difference was observed between patients with transient hypothyroidism and controls. A significant correlation was observed between serum IgA and IgM concentrations and fT4 levels.

In this study, the association between elevated cord blood thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) and infant development was examined in Northern China. Three groups of infants with elevated cord blood TSH were compared with infants with normal TSH levels on an information processing task at 7 mo, and in cognitive and motor developmental assessments at 13 mo. Infants with elevated TSH had poorer information processing skills and lower scores on the cognitive development index. There were no differences in motor abilities. Relationships between socioenvironmental factors and iodine status were assessed. Infants from more rural settings and those whose mothers had completed fewer years of schooling and had lower paying occupations had higher cord blood TSH levels. A regression analysis indicated that maternal education was predictive of cognitive performance among infants with elevated TSH but not control infants. The findings suggest that subclinical prenatal ID has negative effects on infant development and that, in some instances, maternal education may ameliorate these effects."

CD005253,0,10999814,0,Thyroid function and intellectual development of infants nursed by mothers taking methimazole.,"For many years, breast-feeding was forbidden if antithyroid drugs were being used. Recently, limited studies have shown the relative safety of propylthiouracil and methimazole (MMI). It is not known whether MMI therapy of lactating mothers for 1 yr is safe for breast-fed infants and does not cause alterations in thyroid function and intellectual development. Between 1988 and 1998, 139 thyrotoxic lactating mothers and their infants were studied. Fifty-one thyrotoxic lactating mothers were treated with MMI during pregnancy, and MMI was continued during breast-feeding. Eighty-eight mothers were given 10 mg MMI (n 46) or 20 mg MMI (n = 42) daily for 1 month, 10 mg daily for the second month, and 5-10 mg daily thereafter. Serum T4, T3, and TSH concentrations were measured in thyrotoxic lactating mothers and their infants, before and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 months. Serum MMI was measured in the infants of thyrotoxic lactating mothers taking 20 mg MMI. Thyroid function, urinary iodine, thyroid antibodies, intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal and functional components (Wechsler and Goodenough tests) were performed on 14 children of thyrotoxic lactating mothers between 48 and 74 months of age and on 17 controls. Mean +/- SD of FT4I in thyrotoxic lactating mothers treated with 10 mg MMI for 1 month decreased from 19.4 +/- 4.1 to 11.6 +/- 4.4 and from 20.5 +/- 4.7 to 9.8 +/- 1.5 when treated with 20 mg MMI. Values for FT3I decreased from 462 +/- 52 to 194 +/- 52 with 10 mg MMI and from 481 +/- 92 to 171 +/- 38 with 20 mg MMI. FT4I and FT3I were normal from the third to the twelfth months. In all infants FT4I, FT3I, and TSH concentrations were normal before and up to 12 months of MMI therapy in their lactating mothers. The lowest T4 and T3 values were 108 and 1.87 nmol/L, and the highest TSH value was 4.0 mU/L. Serum MMI levels in infants were less than 0.03 microg/mL. Six mothers receiving 20 mg MMI had increased serum TSH concentrations ranging from 26-135 mU/L after 1 month of treatment. Their infants were euthyroid with serum TSH values less than 2.6 mU/L. At 48-74 months of age, height, weight, FT4I, FT3I, TSH, and antithyroid antibody titers were not different than controls. The mean IQ was 107 +/- 14 vs. 106 +/- 16 (Goodenough test) and 103 +/- 10 vs. 103 +/- 16 (Wechsler test) for infants of thyrotoxic lactating mothers and control infants, respectively. Similarly, there was no difference in verbal and performance IQ and their components between infants of thyrotoxic lactating mothers and control children. No deleterious effects occur in thyroid function and physical and intellectual development of breast-fed infants whose lactating mothers were treated with doses of MMI up to 20 mg daily."

CD005253,0,18676011,0,Iodine-deficiency disorders.,"2 billion individuals worldwide have insufficient iodine intake, with those in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa particularly affected. Iodine deficiency has many adverse effects on growth and development. These effects are due to inadequate production of thyroid hormone and are termed iodine-deficiency disorders. Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of preventable mental impairment worldwide. Assessment methods include urinary iodine concentration, goitre, newborn thyroid-stimulating hormone, and blood thyroglobulin. In nearly all countries, the best strategy to control iodine deficiency is iodisation of salt, which is one of the most cost-effective ways to contribute to economic and social development. When iodisation of salt is not possible, iodine supplements can be given to susceptible groups. Introduction of iodised salt to regions of chronic iodine-deficiency disorders might transiently increase the proportion of thyroid disorders, but overall the small risks of iodine excess are far outweighed by the substantial risks of iodine deficiency. International efforts to control iodine-deficiency disorders are slowing, and reaching the third of the worldwide population that remains deficient poses major challenges."

Interestingly, evidence suggests that musical training can contribute to structural plasticity in a number of brain areas, including the hippocampus. Therefore, we investigated whether taking music lessons could ameliorate the volumetric reductions of the hippocampus in children with CH. Left and right hippocampal volumes were measured in four groups of children: children with CH with and without music lessons, and healthy controls with and without music lessons. We found that the volume of the right hippocampus was comparable between children with CH who had taken music lessons and the healthy controls. Children with CH who had not taken music lessons had reduced hippocampal volumes compared with the other three groups. These results suggest that music lessons may induce structural neuroplasticity in children with atypical hippocampal development because of early thyroid hormone deficiencies."

Maternal and fetal responses.,"Serial maternal and cord blood determinations of the ions and hormones involved in calcium homeostasis were made in pre-eclamptic women treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate. A 4 gm loading dose followed by 1 to 2 gm/hr caused maternal serum magnesium concentrations to rise 150%, to levels of 3.3 to 4.5 mEq/L, and ionized calcium levels to fall 16%, to 1.89 mEq/L. The hypocalcemia etly altering calcitonin. Changes in total calcium paralleled those of ionized calcium; phosphorus levels were not affected by magnesium infusion. At the time of delivery the offspring of these women were hypermagnesemic and relatively hypocalcemic, although less so than their mothers. Fetal ionized calcium levels, although lower with magnesium treatment than in control subjects, were within the lower limits of the normal range, which perhaps explains why the fetus did not respond with increased PTH or decreased calcitonin output. These results indicate that the principal maternal response to magnesium-induced hypocalcemia involves increased parathyroid hormone secretion which tends to preserve maternal calcium homeostasis, while the fetus is partially protected from hypermagnesemia and hypocalcemia by the placenta."

Approximately 2.5% of adults in the United States and 4% of adults in Canada follow vegetarian diets. A vegetarian diet is defined as one that does not include meat, fish, or fowl. Interest in vegetarianism appears to be increasing, with many restaurants and college foodservices offering vegetarian meals routinely. Substantial growth in sales of foods attractive to vegetarians has occurred and these foods appear in many supermarkets. This position paper reviews the current scientific data related to key nutrients for vegetarians including protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, vitamin A, n-3 fatty acids, and iodine. A vegetarian, including vegan, diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients. In some cases, use of fortified foods or supplements can be helpful in meeting recommendations for individual nutrients. Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits including lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, and phytochemicals. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower body mass indices than non-vegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from ischemic heart disease, lower blood cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer. While a number of federally funded and institutional feeding programs can accommodate vegetarians, few have foods suitable for vegans at this time. Because of the variability of dietary practices among vegetarians, individual assessment of dietary intakes of vegetarians is required. Dietetics professionals have a responsibility to support and encourage those who express an interest in consuming a vegetarian diet. They can play key roles in educating vegetarian clients about food sources of specific nutrients, food purchase and preparation, and any dietary modifications that may be necessary to meet individual needs. Menu planning for vegetarians can be simplified by use of a food guide that specifies food groups and serving sizes."

Comparative study of autopsy material from the Institute for Pathology].,"In spring 1980 the amount of iodine in Swiss salt for human consumption was increased from 10 to 20 mg KI per kg, a dose producing a daily intake of iodine assumed to be sufficient to prevent goiter due to iodine deficiency. To study the influence of this higher level of iodine in table salt, thyroid weights and goiter incidence were determined in different age groups of both sexes in all autopsy cases seen in the Institute of Pathology, University of Zürich in 1984 and 1985. The findings were compared with the results of a similar investigation performed for the years 1978 and 1979 by Gerber shortly before doubling of the iodine content in Swiss table salt. The mean thyroid weights of adults aged up to 40 years were practically identical in both periods. In 1984/85, however, the mean thyroid weights of adults aged over 40 years were definitely lower than those of 1978/79 and did not exceed 25 g up to the age of 50. As regards goiter incidence, there were practically no differences between the two periods, viz. 30% in 1978/79 and 31% in 1984/85 for both sexes. The high incidence of goiter in older patients is probably due to insufficient iodine intake in youth. However, other factors such as inborn errors of iodine metabolism have also to be considered."

A statement by the World Health Organization.,"The risks and expected benefits from iodized oil, given orally or by injection, to pregnant women in areas of severe iodine deficiency where iodized salt is not available were evaluated. The conclusions, which were approved by the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), showed that for preventing and controlling moderate and severe iodine deficiency, the giving of iodized oil is safe at any time during pregnancy. Maximum protection against endemic cretinism and neonatal hypothyroidism will be achieved when iodized oil is given before conception.

Forty-five children, early treated according to general recommendations, were studied. Linear multiple regression analysis was used, controlling for socio-economic status and the pretreatment serum thyroxine concentration. At 2 years of age, 19% of the variance in Mental Development Index (Bayley Scales of Infant Development) was attributed to treatment variables: combinations of serum thyroxine and serum TSH during the 1st year and bone age at mean age 1.5 years (mean z-scores). At 6 years of age, 35% of the variance in Verbal IQ (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence) was attributed to treatment variables: 13% to the mean serum thyroxine concentration during the 1st year, 12% to the initial L-thyroxine dose per kilogram body weight per day, and 10% to a combined measure for serum thyroxine and serum TSH during the 2nd year (mean z-score)."

Clinical findings in infants with positive screening tests.,"In a pilot screening programme for congenital hypothyroidism, PKU filter paper blood samples from 20 000 infants born in Stockholm were analysed for TSH and T4 to identify optimal conditions for routine nationwide screening. Among 160 infants with positive screening tests, 7 infants (group I) had true-positive results, 6 had primary and one secondary hypothyroidism. The 153 infants with false-positive tests were divided into group II:74 infants with an isolated increased TSH level; group III: 71 infants with an isolated decreased T4 concentration; and group IV: 8 infants with increased TSH and decreased T4 levels. In group I the clinical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism varied when the diagnosis was made at 3 weeks of age. The median hypothyroid index score was 8 (range 0--18). In groups II-IV most infants showed very few signs of hypothyroidism. The median hypothyroid index scores were 1, 1, and 0, respectively. Clinical findings were of little value in the individual case for distinguishing true from false positive screening tests.

The role of multiple micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood has been evaluated in randomized trials. Multiple micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy has a positive effect on birthweight and reduces prevalence of low birthweight and small for gestational age babies. It had comparable effects on prevalence of anemia regarding iron-folate supplementation. Multiple micronutrient supplementations in children have been shown to improve linear growth, weight, hemoglobin, serum zinc, serum retinol levels and motor development. Some of the most commonly used strategies to deliver multiple micronutrients include powders (e.g. Sprinkles(®)), crushable tablets (e.g. Foodlets), etc. Multiple micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood seems to be an effective way of prevention of micronutrient deficiencies and has a significant protective effect against adverse outcomes related to their deficiencies. Their use on a larger scale should be considered to improve the survival and decrease morbidity and mortality in children and women."
CD005253,0,15247872,0,[Severe neonatal hyperthyroidism which reveals a maternal Graves' disease].,"Two of every thousand pregnancies are complicated by Graves' disease. Diagnosis is suggested by maternal disorders (tachycardia, exophthalmia, weight loss.) or fetal disorders (tachycardia, intra-uterine growth retardation, preterm birth.). Due to transfer into the fetal compartment of maternal antibodies which stimulate the fetal thyroid by binding to the thyroid thyrotropin (TSH) receptor, only 1% of children born to these mothers are described as having hyperthyroidism. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis disappears with clearance of the maternal antibodies; clinical signs usually disappear during the first four Months of life. The most frequent neonatal clinical signs of thyrotoxicosis are tachycardia, goiter, hyperexcitability, poor weight gain, hepatosplenomegaly, stare and eyelid retraction. Diagnosis is based on determination of the blood level of triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and TSH. To confirm the nature of hyperthyroidism, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) should be assayed. The kinetics of TSI provides a guide for therapeutic adaptation and disappearance of TSI is a sign of recovery. Rare cases of familial non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism have been shown to be caused by germline mutation of the thyrotropin receptor.

CD005253,0,10771808,0,Disorders of thyroid gland in India.,"The profile of thyroid disorders encountered in pediatric and adolescent age groups in India is similar to that seen in most parts of the world except for the prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders in certain endemic regions of this country. Clinical presentation is most commonly for hypothyroidism and goiters and infrequently for hyperthyroidism. Of nearly 800 children referred for thyroid problems, 79% had hypothyroidism (goitrous as well as nongoitrous), 19% had euthyroid goiters and 2% had hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism was due to thyroid dysgenesis in 75% (aplasia/hypoplasia--50% and ectopic thyroid gland 25%), thyroiditis in nearly 5% and dyshormonogenes is in 20%. The incidence of congenital hypothyroidism in our experience of screening nearly 40,000 newborns is about 1 in 2,640, which is much higher than the worldwide average of 1 in 3,800. Diagnostic delay in hypothyroidism is common and is related to lack of awareness amongst primary healthy care practitioners and family physicians as well as the cost and availability of laboratory investigations. This delay, compounded with inadequate therapeutic surveillance is responsible for the poor outcome in affected children. High incidence of dyshormonogenesis, inherited as autosomal recessive trait also calls for genetic counselling and routine sibling examination. Our results of family studies on first degree relatives of children with thyroiditis revealed presence of antimicrosomal antibodies in 43% and thyroid disease in 26%. Many etiologic factors cause goiters which may be functionally euthyroid or hypothyroid with almost equal frequency in our series. In nearly 200 schools children surveyed for goiter prevalence, 8% in high socioeconomic groups and about 21% in the low income group, had goiters. Female predominance was marked. However, iodine deficiency was not the sole cause as revealed by dietary survey and urinary iodine estimations. Hyperthyroidism is infrequent, less severe and in our experience responded well to long-term administration of antithyroid drugs. A high index of clinical awareness and education of primary health workers will help a great deal in improving the ultimate outcome in children with thyroid disorders/hypothyroidism."

CD005253,0,25825295,0,Global burden and significance of multiple micronutrient deficiencies in pregnancy.,"Maternal mortality, low birthweight infants and childhood stunting continue to be major global public health problems, part of a recurring cycle of disadvantage. Maternal undernutrition in particular is one of the most neglected aspects of nutrition in public health. One possible low-cost public health intervention that might help address these problems is the antenatal provision of multiple micronutrient supplements. If the evidence base could be established, cost-effectiveness found to be acceptable and safety ensured, supplementation could ameliorate the impact of poor nutrition and diets, high disease burdens and the sociocultural factors contributing to these problems. There have been good studies in over a dozen countries addressing some of these issues but with conflicting results. Consequently, at least three meta-analyses have been undertaken to establish significant findings that could help guide policies and programs. They concluded that multimicronutrient supplementation improves birthweight and likely reduces the number of infants born low birthweight. Supplementation with iron-folic acid or multimicronutrients also appears to have positive longer-term impacts on the health and development of the offspring. There remain concerns about possible increased infant mortality in some populations. Given the results of the meta-analyses, cautious scaling-up of country effectiveness trials appears justified with careful monitoring and evaluation."

CD005253,0,25185644,0,An update on the medical treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism.,"Medical treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism is based on the use of thionamides; namely, methimazole and propylthiouracil. In the past, methimazole was preferred by European endocrinologists, whereas propylthiouracil was the first choice for the majority of their North American colleagues. However, because of the recent definition of a better side-effect profile, methimazole is nowadays the first choice world while. Although thionamides are quite effective for the short-term control of Graves' hyperthyroidism, a relatively high proportion of patients relapses after thionamide withdrawal. Other possible medical treatments, include iodine and compounds containing iodine, perchlorate, lithium (as an adjuvant in patients undergoing radioiodine therapy), β-adrenergic antagonists, glucocorticoids, and some new molecules still under investigation. Management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using thionamides as well as the other available medical treatments is here reviewed in detail, with a special mention of situations such as pregnancy and lactation, as well as neonatal and fetal thyrotoxicosis."

The clinical condition of both groups was compared using a ""Neonatal Special Care Evolution Score"". The effect of thyroid hormone treatment, given from D10 on to the sick infants, was also studied. TSH, thyroid hormone levels (TG, T4, T3, rT3, FT4 and FT3) and TBG were measured by radioimmunoassays at D0, D10, D20, D30 and D40. Healthy preterm infants on D0 have a median TSH level of 22 microU/ml and a high TG level of 200 ng/ml; thereafter, median serum levels decrease to 6 microU/ml and 35 ng/ml respectively. During the same period, median serum T4 is maintained at a low level of about 6-8 micrograms/dl, median serum T3 gradually increases from 80 ng/dl on D0 to 150 ng/dl on D40, and median serum rT3 decreases beyond D10 from a plateau of 200 ng/dl to about 100 ng/dl. In the sick preterm infants before treatment, serum TSH is as in the control group but serum T4, T3 and rT3 on D10 are well below the control values (P = 0.005). In all conditions, there is a significant correlation between serum T4 and FT4, and between serum T3 and FT3. Thyroxine, given to the sick preterm infants from D10 on, brings median serum T4 values closely to the ones of the control group whereas serum levels of TSH and TG are unaffected and similar to those of the healthy preterm infants. Furthermore, thyroxine brings serum rT3 within the range of the control group but leaves median serum T3 at a low level of about 50 ng/dl. On T3 treatment, serum T3 normalizes but rT3 and particularly T4 tend to decline further. In the conditions of this study a significant difference in TBG level is not proven. Although an untreated sick group was not enrolled in the study, thyroid hormone treatment brought the ""Neonatal Special Care Evolution Score"" of the treated sick infants closer to that of the healthy preterm infants. In the sick preterm infant with failure to thrive on D10, there is an impaired thyroid discharge of T4 in spite of serum TSH values not different from those of the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD005253,0,26203920,0,Thyroid autoantibodies and the effect on pregnancy outcomes.,"Thyroid antibody positivity is relatively common in women. While many epidemiological studies have investigated the links between thyroid antibodies and pregnancy complications, evidence regarding the effect of Levothyroxine treatment of euthyroid pregnant women with autoimmune thyroid disease on pregnancy outcome is limited. The objective of this paper is to provide a review on the impact of treatment of euthyroid thyroid antibody-positive pregnant women on adverse pregnancy outcome. This systematic review was conducted with a prospective protocol. PubMed, Science direct, Google scholar, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched through January 2014 to identify studies that met pre-stated inclusion criteria. The search was limited to English manuscripts. We found that there is inadequate data regarding both the adverse effect of thyroid antibody positivity in euthyroid women on pregnancy outcomes and the effects Levothyroxine on these women. It seems that the results of most studies indicate adverse effects of thyroid antibody positivity in euthyroid women on pregnancy outcomes. Further randomised clinical trials are needed to investigate the effects of treating pregnant euthyroid women with positive thyroid antibodies on the maternal and early/late neonatal outcomes."

CD005253,0,11837500,0,Pre- and postnatal brain development in neonates with congenital hypothyroidism.,"Patients with early treated congenital hypothyroidism (CH) often develop subnormally and display subtle neurological defects. Can optimal treatment fully prevent these abnormalities, especially in patients with severe CH? This question was addressed by examining 61 patients (27 severe, 34 mild CH) aged 10-30 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, a developmental test appropriate for this age. According to age at start of treatment (Early <13 days, Late > or = 13 days) and levothyroxine dose at the onset of treatment (High > or = 9.5 microg/kg/day, Low <9.5 microg/kg/day), four treatment groups were formed: Early/High, Early/Low, Late/High and Late/Low. Within the severe group, only the Early/High-treated patients reached normal developmental scores. Within the mild group, the Late/Low-treated infants had lower scores than the other patients with mild CH. The results suggest that if patients are treated early with a relatively high dosage of levothyroxine, normal psychomotor development can be expected, irrespective of the type of CH. When treated later on with a lower dose, suboptimal development is likely in infants exhibiting both types of CH. These cerebral abnormalities can originate during the pre- or postnatal period. The most important argument for a prenatal origin of the abnormalities is the relationship between bone age at diagnosis and subsequent developmental scores. We found, however, that this relationship can also be the result of late and inadequate treatment. In a series of 21 infants with CH (10 severe, 11 mild), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were used to assess neurological maturation at diagnosis and after 12 months of treatment. At diagnosis, which was late (21 days after birth), SEP values were significantly less retarded than bone age (3.1 versus 6.5 weeks of delay, p < 0.001), measured using Sénécal's method. At 21 days, SEP and bone age values did not correlate, but they did correlate at 12 months (r = 0.47, p = 0.012). Therapy was inadequate in the whole group (mean initial dosage of levothyroxine 6.2 microg/kg/day), and in the severe group hypothyroidism persisted longer than in the mild group. The results suggest that the relationship between bone age and SEP values at 12 months was caused by late and inadequate hormone substitution more than intrauterine thyroid hormone deficiency."
CD005253,0,2229277,0,Thyroid hormones influences sex steroid binding protein levels in infancy: study in congenital hypothyroidism.,"In order to test the hypothesis of a role of thyroid hormones on the circulating levels of sex steroid binding protein (SHBG) in children, SHBG levels were determined in 15 infants with congenital hypothyroidism at diagnosis and during the first 18 months of T4 therapy and in a separate group of 13 children with congenital hypothyroidism (7.1 +/- 0.5 yr, mean +/- SD), treated before 1 month of age, both during adequate L-T4 therapy and 4 weeks after withdrawing therapy. SHBG levels were significantly lower in hypothyroid infants than in controls (48.2 +/- 6.5 vs. 77.8 +/- 7.9 nmol/L; P less than 0.01), and significantly lower in infants with athyreosis compared to those with ectopic or eutopic glands (P less than 0.05). In patients with low values at diagnosis, SHBG increased rapidly and remained normal during LT4 therapy. After 1.5-18 months of treatment, a positive correlation (P less than 0.01) was found between SHBG, FT4, and FT3 levels. In older hypothyroid children, 4 weeks after withdrawal of therapy a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in SHBG concentrations was observed. Analysis of these results as well as previous reports in adults, indicates that thyroid hormones influence SHBG concentrations in infants and children. This study also indicates that thyroid hormones may play a role in the physiological postnatal increase of SHBG."
CD005253,0,9103947,0,Fetal thyroid function: diagnosis and management of fetal thyroid disorders.,"The fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis develops independently of the maternal axis, but it is dependent on the maternal-placental system for adequate supply of iodide substrate. This iodide is supplied by direct transfer of maternal plasma iodide and by placental deiodination of T4. In addition, although placental transport of iodothyronines is limited, significant maternal-fetal transfer of T4 occurs, accounting for approximately 30% of the average 10 ug/dL serum-T4 concentration in fetal-cord blood at term. Current information suggests that this maternal contribution to the fetal-T4 levels is important for normal fetal maturation, particularly of the central nervous system. Combined maternal-fetal hypothyroxinemia can lead to irreversible fetal central nervous system damage. The timing of this fetal T4 dependency is not clear. It may be important in the first half of gestation, before the fetal thyroid gland is capable of T4 production, as well as the latter half of gestation when thyroid hormone effects on multiple organ systems are developing. Management of fetal thyroid dysfunction requires normalization of maternal serum T4 concentrations, avoidance or careful monitoring of potentially goitrogenic drug effects in the fetus, and in some instances, direct or indirect fetal therapy. In most cases fetal hypothyroidism is sporadic and undetected, and prognosis for normal growth and development is excellent if the mother is euthyroid and the hypothyroid state is detected and adequately treated at birth. Fetal treatment by intraamniotic thyroxine injection has been provided in cases of inadvertent maternal radioiodine treatment of Graves' disease between 10 and 20 weeks gestation and for fetal goiter detected by ultrasound. Effective treatment of fetal hyperthyroidism in pregnant women with high titers of thyroid stimulating autoantibody is possible by judicious administration of antithyroid drugs to the mother. Management of the hyperthyroid state in the neonate also is essential."

CD005253,0,15456686,0,An investigation of impulsivity in children with early-treated congenital hypothyroidism.,"The main feature of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a total or partial absence of thyroid hormone, caused by a developmental disorder of the thyroid gland. Introduction of neonatal thyroid screening allows early treatment with replacement hormone. As a result the prognosis of CH has greatly improved but neuropsychological problems do still occur. Claims that early-treated CH is associated with impulsivity were tested with a memory search task comprising 2 response probability conditions: a baseline condition in which ""yes"" and ""no"" responses were equally probable and a response bias condition in which the probability of a ""no"" response was raised to 70%. Impulsivity was defined as the ability to stop and change a response set and was assessed from the amount of inaccurate ""no"" responses made. Comparisons were made between 47 children with early-treated CH and 35 controls at the age of 7.5 years. Children with early-treated CH were notably slow and variable in their overall task performance but, most important, did not show signs of poor impulse control. Suggested short-term memory problems in these children could not be confirmed. Performance could not be attributed to early disease-related factors or lowered intelligence."
CD005253,0,9035162,0,Persistent hypercalciuria and elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in children with infantile hypercalcaemia.,"The aim of the study was to characterize abnormalities of calcium-phosphate and vitamin D3 metabolism in children with a past history of ""mild"" Lightwood-type idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia. Seventeen seemingly healthy children aged 2-12 years, with long-term idiopathic hypercalcaemic syndrome since infancy were studied. Two reference groups were also included (vitamin D3 intoxication/healthy and Williams groups). Despite a long-term milk-restricted diet and a restricted vitamin D3 intake, urinary calcium excretion in the study group was 0.117 +/- 0.07 mumol/kg per 24 h. Compared with the reference groups (0.047 +/- 0.029 and 0.067 +/- 0.06 mumol/kg per 24 h, P < 0.05), there was significant hypercalciuria in the children with idiopathic hypercalcaemia since infancy. Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the study group were also elevated compared with the reference groups (57.4 +/- 15.5 vs. 34.6 +/- 9.3 and 22.7 +/- 10.5 ng/ml). 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels were at the upper limit of normal (45.9 +/- 13.1 vs. 35.0 +/- 8.1 and 30.0 +/- 13.7 pg/ml). Non-progressive, clinically silent nephrocalcinosis was visible on ultrasound examinations. The disturbances of vitamin D3 and calcium-phosphate metabolism persistent in the normocalcaemic phase of idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia may be a primary metabolic defect of the condition.

During pregnancy, the mother was noted to have marked polyhydramnios and severe abdominal distension. At birth, a large diamniotic, monochorionic placenta was noted. According to a study of the minor blood groups and HLA typing, the possibility of monozygosity is 0.985. The mode of inheritance of the syndrome is debatable, and according to observations of discordance in monozygotic twins, single gene control seems unlikely. The thyroid function was noted to be subnormal when the proband was 3 days old. Oral thyroxine has been supplied since infancy.

CD005253,0,782770,0,Inherited hypothyroidism.,"Familial hypothyroidism results from both thyroidal and extrathyroidal dysfunction. Specific intrathyroidal abnormalities in thyroid hormone synthesis causing goitrous hypothyroidism are iodide trap defect, organification defect, ""coupling"" defect, iodoprotein defect, and dehalogenase defect. The diagnostic studies for each are outlined utilizing radioiodine(131I) studies. Other causes of cretinism include failure of the thyroid gland to respond to TSH and lack of pituitary TSH (or hypothalamic TRH). The syndrome of peripheral resistance to thyroid hormone is discussed. The diagnosis of inherited hypothyrodism rests on an adequate family history and measurement of both T4 and TSH levels which can be determined in cord blood or peripheral blood from the infant. The importance of early treatment of hypothyroidism in the neonatal period to prevent brain damage is emphasized. The rec:nt discovery of the importance of reverse T3 (RT3) in fetal thyroid metabolism is described, and the possibility of amniocentesis as an aid in prenatal diagnosis is considered.

CD005253,0,11575595,0,Attention problems in adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism: a multicomponential analysis.,"Even though early treatment of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) with newborn screening prevents the mental retardation previously seen in cretinism, affected children still exhibit subtle persisting neurocognitive deficits. One of their commonest problems is poor attention, which reflects both early disease severity and later (high) circulating thyroid hormone levels. While attention is currently regarded as multicomponential in nature, with different processing components supported by different brain regions, the specific components of attention affected by CH have not been identified. In light of animal evidence showing that neonatal thyroid hormone deficiencies impede the neurodevelopment of structures important for selective aspects of attention, we proposed a multicomponential approach to study attention in children with CH. This was accomplished via retrospective analysis of existing data on adolescents with CH whose attention was previously evaluated using multiple tests. Results showed significantly poorer overall attention in CH than controls with differences occurring mainly on focus and inhibit indices. However, performance on various indices was associated with different disease parameters. Poor encode and focus were correlated with more severe hypothyroidism and a longer period of thyroid hormone insufficiency and poor select and shift with higher thyroid hormone levels at testing. These results signify that thyroid hormone is important for the development and later regulation of brain structures supporting distinct aspects of attention."

CD005253,0,3976763,0,Thyroid function in epileptic mothers and their infants at birth.,"It has been suggested that patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy have depressed thyroid function. Thyroid function was studied in 16 pregnant epileptic women who were receiving various anticonvulsants; 20 nonepileptic pregnant women served as controls. Maternal and umbilical cord blood was collected at delivery and serum thyrotropin, total thyroxine, triiodothyronine, triiodothyronine resin uptake, and free thyroxine levels were measured. The free thyroxine index was calculated from the thyroxine and triiodothyronine resin uptake data. There were no significant differences in any of the maternal parameters. In cord serum, the thyroxine level was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in the infants of the epileptic mothers. The triiodothyronine resin uptake was slightly increased in the epileptic group (p less than 0.05) so that the free thyroxine index largely compensated for this. The thyrotropin, free thyroxine, and triiodothyronine levels did not differ between the two groups. Thus the low thyroxine values in cord blood of infants of epileptic mothers receiving anticonvulsants probably reflect an alteration in protein binding rather than a true alteration in thyroid function."

Infants with transient CH due to maternal TRAb presented with a spectrum of clinical and biochemical hypothyroidism. Blood spot TSH concentrations ranged 60.5-332 mIU/L. CH was confirmed by plasma thyroid function tests in all cases (plasma TSH ranged 21-752 mIU/L). The seven infants belonged to five different families. On examination, four infants were clinically hypothyroid. Five infants had a thyroid ultrasound, of which three were abnormal. All infants were treated with thyroxine, which was subsequently withdrawn from three. Following thyroxine withdrawal, one infant resumed normal thyroid function and two developed compensated hypothyroidism. Of the five mothers, two had undiagnosed hypothyroidism and three were receiving thyroxine for longstanding hypothyroidism. Thyroid peroxidase antibody (aTPO) was measured in four and was negative in two, borderline positive in one and strongly positive in another. TRAb was measured in all five women and was strongly positive in all of them. This case series highlights the importance of identifying CH due to TRAb by investigating both the infant and the mother following a raised TSH found on newborn screening. The identification of those infants with transient CH caused by maternal transfer of TRAb is essential for optimizing management during childhood (including potential withdrawal of thyroxine replacement in the longer term) and in any subsequent pregnancy."

Consequences of age at thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization on postural control were evaluated in 17 children with congenital hypothyroidism (14 females, three males; median age 12 years 1 month, range 7 to 14 years) and in 11 control individuals (eight females, three males: median age 10 years 6 months, range 8 to 14 years). Children with congenital hypothyroidism were split into two groups according to time of TSH normalization: before (group 1) or after (group 2) 3 months of age. Posturography (static and dynamic tests), educational (school performance), and psychomotor (WISC and revised Bruininks Oseretsky tests) evaluations were carried out. Group 2 results showed significant abnormalities in postural, educational, and psychomotor aptitudes in comparison with group 1 and control children (stability, Bruininks-Oseretsky, school performance: p < or = 0.05 or p < or = 0.01).

Hypothyroidism is more common in Down syndrome population than normal population. In this report we present four infants with Down syndrome who have pericardial effusion due to congenital hypothyroidism. All of these children with Down syndrome were admitted to our clinic with pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion was completely resolved with thyroxin therapy without pericardiosentesis. Any child with Down syndrome who present with dyspnea and cardiomegaly should be suspected of having pericardial effusion due to hypothyroidism and echocardiography examination should be performed immediately. Pericardial effusion due to hypothyroidism will completely resolve with L-thyroxin therapy without pericardiosentesis. In conclusion, since a delayed diagnosis of hypothyroidism is likely and may favor the development of massive pericardial effusion and because of the difficult diagnosis of the hypothyroidism in Down syndrome, periodic follow-up of thyroid function tests are important."
CD005253,0,9439908,0,Thyroid function in preterm newborns; is T4 treatment required in infants < 27 weeks' gestational age?,"Thyroid hormones are essential for brain maturation. Very preterm infants, who are at risk of neurodevelopmental disabilities also have low T4 and FT4 values in the first weeks after birth. This transient hypothyroxinemia may in part be causal to the neurodevelopmental problems. We have carried out a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with T4 in 200 infants < 30 weeks' gestation. In the study groups as a whole (n = 100 in the T4 group, n = 100 in the Placebo group), no clear effect of T4 administration was found. In this study we examined whether gestational age influenced the effect of T4 administration. The T4- and placebo groups were subdivided into 4 groups according to gestational age. FT4-values during the first weeks after birth were lowest in the youngest gestational age group in the T4 as well as in the placebo group. In this group with infants < 27 weeks' gestation mental developmental outcome at 2 years of age was significantly better than in the placebo group of the same gestational age. There was also a trend towards a better psychomotor and neurological outcome. Beyond 27 weeks' gestation, no clear effect of T4 could be found; on the contrary, a possible harmful effect on mental developmental outcome might be the result. In conclusion. T4 treatment possibly improves developmental outcome in infants < 27 weeks' gestation, but seems not necessary beyond this gestational age."
CD005253,0,24874596,0,Delayed development of GFA immunoreactivity in the parietal cortex during thyroid hormone deficiency.,"The influence of neonatal hypothyroidism on the development of immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFA) was studied in parietal cortex of rats treated from birth with the antithyroid agent propylthiouracil (PTU) for 3 or 8 weeks. Density of GFA immunoreactivity was evaluated in cryostate sections reacted with an antiserum specific for GFA. Three weeks postnatally, the density of GFA-immunoreactive structures in the cortical layers II-V was 70% lower in PTU-treated animals than in controls injected with the solvent. This marked difference between the groups was, however, not seen in either the molecular layer, layer VI or white matter. The inhibited development of GFA immunoreactivity was not persistent in animals treated with PTU for 8 weeks continuously. Plasma from animals treated with PTU for 1,2,3 and 8 weeks was collected and the TSH level in each group compared with samples from age-matched controls and newborn pups. The treatment with PTU resulted in a more than 10-fold increase in TSH level after 1 week of injections. In longterm groups of 8 weeks, the TSH level decreased in the PTU-treated animals, but stayed considerably higher than control values throughout the experiments. The results described in the present paper indicate a thyroid hormone dependent development of the GFA immunoreactivity in cortex cerebri astrocytes."
CD005253,0,4036889,0,Congenital hypothyroidism. The effect of stopping treatment at 3 years of age.,"Fifty-six children with congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed by neonatal screening were reviewed at 3 years of age or older. The presence or absence of the thyroid gland was determined by radionuclide scanning prior to treatment in the newborn period. Thyroxine therapy was discontinued in those children who did not have anatomic defects or a secondary rise in their thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) level once it was suppressed by thyroid hormones. Sixteen of 17 children developed a low thyroxine and an elevated TSH level within three to six weeks. One child was not receiving thyroxine for nine months and was clinically and biochemically euthyroid. We conclude that (1) newborn thyroid scans are useful to determine the cause of hypothyroidism, (2) a secondary rise in the TSH level indicates permanent hypothyroidism, (3) only about one third of infants whose condition is diagnosed by newborn screening will qualify for a trial off therapy at 3 years of age, (4) only 1% to 2% of infants whose condition is diagnosed by newborn screening have transient hypothyroidism, and (5) a three-week period of hormone withdrawal after the age of 3 years seems adequate and safe to confirm permanent hypothyroidism."

CD005253,0,7749040,0,Characteristics and clinical correlates of a novel thyroid-stimulating autoantibody.,"We reported a patient who gave birth to 3 children with transient neonatal hypothyroidism. She had 3 different antibodies (Ab) to the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) in her serum, viz., TSH binding-inhibiting (TBIAb), thyroid-stimulating (TSAb) and an additional stimulating Ab (SAb). The SAb differed from TSAb in that its in vitro stimulating effect in human thyroid and FRTL5 cells was not inhibited by TBIAb [similar data now obtained with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with cloned human TSHR]. Because of symptomatic goiter enlargement the patient underwent subtotal thyroidectomy. About 50% of the gland was infiltrated with lymphocytes; thyroid follicles had columnar epithelium, despite suppression of TSH by thyroxine and the presence of the potent TBIAb. Fifteen months later, when all 3 Ab showed a decline of approximately 3 fold, she gave birth to hypothyroid twins. These data support the following conclusions: 1) thyroidectomy and immunosuppression of pregnancy do not prevent neonatal thyroid disease if TSHR Ab (TRAb) are of high titer; 2) the thyroid is not a major site of TRAb production; 3) SAb is a thyroid stimulator, distinct from TSAb in that it does not share binding epitopes on the TSHR with either TSH or TBIAb; 4) SAb was the probable cause of thyroid growth in this patient."

CD005253,0,1644422,0,Birth prevalence of primary congenital hypothyroidism by sex and ethnicity.,"Over 5 million infants have been screened for primary congenital hypothyroidism in California since 1980. This large number along with the multi-ethnic nature of California's population allows for a detailed analysis of the effects of ethnic origin, sex, and their interaction on birth prevalence. Sex is the most important factor, with at least a 2:1 (female:male) ratio across all major ethnic groups except blacks. The sex ratio among Hispanics is more striking; female cases outnumber male cases by a ratio of 3:1, and the birth prevalence for Hispanic females is 1 in 1886 births. Previously published rates for Asians and blacks are suspect because of small sample sizes, and Hispanic rates also may be misleading if sex is not taken into account. These factors are important when screening tests, such as the serum T4 test, are used as a statistical prescreening before thyroid stimulation hormone levels can be determined and before the influence of ethnic group and sex can be taken into account, because other factors may prevent high-risk groups (such as Hispanic females) from being declared positive."

As a consequence, the prevalence of iodine deficiency decreased dramatically. The United States and Canada are among the few developed countries that do not practice USI. Such an undertaking would require evidence of deficiency among vulnerable population groups, including pregnant women, newborns, and developing infants. Government agencies in the United States rely heavily on data from NHANES to assess the iodine status of the general population and pregnant women in particular. NHANES data suggest that pregnant women in the United States remain mildly deficient. This is important, because the developing fetus is dependent on maternal iodine intake for normal brain development throughout pregnancy. Professional societies have recommended that pregnant and lactating women, or those considering pregnancy, consume a supplement providing 150 μg iodine daily. The United States and Canada collaborate on the daily recommended intake and are also confronted with the challenge of identifying the studies needed to determine if USI is likely to be beneficial to vulnerable population groups without exposing them to harm."

Recently, perchlorate was analyzed in TDS samples. Perchlorate is used as an oxidizing agent in rocket propellant, is found in other items (e.g., explosives, road flares, fireworks, and car airbags), occurs naturally in some fertilizers, and may be generated under certain climatic conditions. It has been detected in surface and groundwater and in food. Perchlorate at high (e.g., pharmacological) doses can interfere with iodide uptake into the thyroid gland, disrupting its function. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has identified that ""the fetuses of pregnant women who might have hypothyroidism or iodide deficiency as the most sensitive population."" This study reports on intake estimates of perchlorate and iodine, a precursor to iodide, using the analytical results from the TDS. Estimated average perchlorate and iodine daily intakes as well as the contribution of specific food groups to total intakes were estimated for 14 age/sex subgroups of the US population. The estimated smallest lower bound to the largest upper bound average perchlorate intakes by the 14 age/sex groups range from 0.08 to 0.39 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day (microg/kg bw/day), compared with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reference dose (RfD) of 0.7 microg/kg bw/day. Infants and children demonstrated the highest estimated intakes of perchlorate on a body weight basis.

CD005253,0,7924939,0,[Neonatal hyperthyroidism in non-diagnosed Basedow's disease of the mother. Problems of diagnosis and therapy illustrated by a case history].,"A male preterm infant (born at 34 weeks, birth weight 2130 g) developed jaundice (total bilirubin 7.4 mg/dl), hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia (82,000/microliters) and a raised C-reactive protein (1.2 mg/dl). Although sepsis was suspected, no organism was demonstrated. When the mother visited the child for the first time after 2 weeks, she had florid hyperthyroidism. This explained many of the child's clinical features (poor weight gain, tachycardia, exophthalmos). Both mother and child had raised TSH receptor antibodies (mother: 684.6 U/l; 54.1 U/l, normal < 15 U/l), an increased free T4 and a suppressed TSH. Because of the tachycardia, the child was treated with propranolol (1 mg/kg.d for 5 weeks). He was also initially given Lugol's solution (25 mg iodide/kg.d for 1 week) and then propylthiouracil (7 mg/kg.d) because of the increasing total T3. L-Thyroxine replacement was subsequently required for a period of 2.5 weeks because of treatment-related hypothyroidism. Since stopping treatment (at 12 weeks of age), the child has developed normally.--Neonatal hyperthyroidism due to transplacental transfer of TSH receptor antibodies associated with maternal Graves' disease is a rare self-limiting condition. However, it may pose considerable danger to the child both in utero and postnatally (with a mortality if untreated of up to 20%). Interdisciplinary cooperation is essential."

CD005253,0,12128252,0,Acute neuronal injury after hypoxia is influenced by the reoxygenation mode in juvenile hippocampal slice cultures.,"In neonates asphyxia is usually followed by hyperoxia due to resuscitation procedures. In order to study whether hyperoxic reoxygenation might cause additional cell injury we subjected organotypic hippocampal slice cultures of juvenile rats to normoxic or hyperoxic reoxygenation (19 or 85% oxygen, respectively) following hypoxia (3% oxygen) for 30, 60, and 120 min. Cell injury was quantified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence 1 h after end of the reoxygenation period. In both experimental groups, LDH activity was significantly enhanced by hypoxia as compared to normoxic controls. However, hyperoxic reoxygenation caused a larger increase in LDH activity than normoxic reoxygenation (e.g., by a factor of 1.60 vs. 1.29 following 120 min hypoxia). PI fluorescence increased after hypoxia in all principal cell layers of the hippocampus but again showed a larger enhancement after hyperoxic reoxygenation as compared to normoxic reoxygenation (e.g., by a factor of 3.9 vs. 1.7 for CA1 and 120 min of hypoxia). After normoxic reoxygenation, PI fluorescence intensity was lower in the dentate gyrus as compared to CA1 and CA3, while it reached similar values like CA1 after high oxygen supply. In conclusion, juvenile hippocampal slice cultures subjected to hyperoxic reoxygenation display a greater amount of acute neuronal injury than slice cultures undergoing normoxic reoxygenation."

CD005253,0,19506551,0,Widespread microbial invasion of the chorioamniotic membranes is a consequence and not a cause of intra-amniotic infection.,"Acute chorioamnionitis is a response to amniotic fluid (AF) infection. However, it remains unclear whether substantial bacterial propagation in the chorioamniotic membranes (CAMs) precedes microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), which is inconsistent with characteristic 'amniotropic neutrophil migration' in acute chorioamnionitis. This study was performed to determine whether CAMs have widespread bacterial infection during MIAC and whether bacteria normally colonize CAMs. AF pellets and CAMs from the following groups were studied: group 1, patients with positive (n=18) or negative (n=22) AF cultures; group 2, patients with or without acute chorioamnionitis in which the amnion and chorion were studied separately (n=60); and group 3, patients at term who underwent a cesarean delivery (n=30). SYTO 9/propidium iodide fluorescent staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization for 16S rRNA were performed. Real-time quantitative PCR for 16S rDNA and PCR for genital mycoplasmas were also conducted. Bacteria were more frequently detected in AF than in CAMs of patients with positive AF culture (100 vs. 33%; P<0.0001). Bacteria were detected more frequently in CAMs as the severity of chorioamnionitis increased (P<0.01). The median 16S rRNA gene copy number in the amnion was significantly greater than in the chorion (group 2; P<0.0001). Bacteria were not detected in CAMs or AF in women at term before labor (group 3). A fraction of patients with chorioamnionitis or MIAC did not have bacteria in CAMs. Collectively, the findings herein indicate that MIAC does not follow widespread infection of CAMs, but precedes it. We propose a model of MIAC: the initial stage is intra-amniotic bacterial invasion through a discrete region of the CAMs, followed by intra-amniotic proliferation, and bacterial invasion of CAMs primarily extends from the amniotic fluid. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing the intra-amniotic compartment for diagnosis and treatment of preterm birth."
CD005253,0,18434651,0,Mutations in the iodotyrosine deiodinase gene and hypothyroidism.,"DEHAL1 has been identified as the gene encoding iodotyrosine deiodinase in the thyroid, where it controls the reuse of iodide for thyroid hormone synthesis. We screened patients with hypothyroidism who had features suggestive of an iodotyrosine deiodinase defect for mutations in DEHAL1. Two missense mutations and a deletion of three base pairs were identified in four patients from three unrelated families; all the patients had a dramatic reduction of in vitro activity of iodotyrosine deiodinase. Patients had severe goitrous hypothyroidism, which was evident in infancy and childhood. Two patients had cognitive deficits due to late diagnosis and treatment. Thus, mutations in DEHAL1 led to a deficiency in iodotyrosine deiodinase in these patients. Because infants with DEHAL1 defects may have normal thyroid function at birth, they may be missed by neonatal screening programs for congenital hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,26314768,0,Transient hypothyroidism associated with viral Human Parechovirus encephalitis in a newborn.,"Human Parechovirus type 3 (HPeV-3) is a neurotropic virus which can cause neonatal encephalitis, presenting as encephalopathy with seizures and diffuse white matter lesions on brain imaging. Neurodevelopmental outcome is linked to the extent of white matter abnormalities. We report on a neonate with clinical and biochemical findings of transient central hypothyroidism associated with HPeV-3 encephalitis. The co-occurrence of transient hypothyroidism and viral encephalitis has not been reported in newborns before. Transient suppression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroidal axis is described in critically ill babies as the nonthyroidal-illness syndrome. Assessment of thyroid function in neonatal cases of HPeV-3 infection is required to conclude whether a transient hypothyroidism as in nonthyroidal-illness syndrome may be triggered by viral meningo-encephalitis and if treatment may influence neurodevelopmental outcome."
CD005253,0,16425000,0,[Effects of thyroid disorders on the bone].,"Interactions between thyroid hormones and the bone are complex and are still not fully understood. During development, thyroid hormone is essential for the recruitment and maturation of bone cells. A deficit of thyroid hormone during pregnancy and in the newborn leads to retardation of the skeleton. Hypothyroidism during later life causes a relevant decrease of bone turnover. Excessive amounts of thyroid hormone induce increased activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts leading to high bone turnover and a loss of BMD, as the activity of osteoclasts predominates over the activity of osteoblasts. In subclinical hyperthyroidism, premenopausal women show no significant BMD loss, whereas postmenopausal women face a significant BMD loss. Men seem to have a limited, but significant bone loss in subclinical hyperthyroidism. Therapeutic consequences focus on the normalization of thyroid function, which can lead to restoration of BMD and normalization of bone turnover. In particular, patients on long-term suppressive L-thyroxine therapy or anti-thyroid drug medication benefit from additional antiresorptive treatment. This article surveys the complex interactions between thyroid hormones and bone cells and their effects on bone turnover, BMD and fractures according to the different states of thyroid function."

CD005253,0,23327883,0,Levothyroxine treatment and pregnancy outcome in women with subclinical hypothyroidism undergoing assisted reproduction technologies: systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.,"BACKGROUND Previous meta-analyses of observational data indicate that pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Potential benefits of levothyroxine (LT4) supplementation remain unclear, and no systematic review or meta-analysis of trial findings is available in a setting of assisted reproduction technologies (ART). METHODS Relevant trials published until August 2012 were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases and bibliographies of retrieved publications without language restrictions. RESULTS From 630 articles retrieved, we included three trials with data on 220 patients. One of these three trials stated 'live delivery' as outcome. LT4 treatment resulted in a significantly higher delivery rate, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% confidence limits 1.20-6.44; P = 0.018; I(2) = 70%), a pooled absolute risk difference (ARD) of 36.3% (3.5-69.0%: P = 0.030) and a summary number needed to treat (NNT) of 3 (1-28) in favour of LT4 supplementation. LT4 treatment significantly lowered miscarriage rate with a pooled RR of 0.45 (0.24-0.82; P = 0.010; I(2) = 26%), a pooled ARD of -31.3% (-48.2 to -14.5%: P < 0.001) and a summary NNT of 3 (2-7) in favour of LT4 supplementation. LT4 treatment had no effect on clinical pregnancy (RR 1.75; 0.90-3.38; P = 0.098; I(2) = 82%). In an ART setting, no data are available on the effects of LT4 supplementation on premature delivery, arterial hypertension, placental abruption or pre-eclampsia. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analyses provide evidence that LT4 supplementation should be recommended to improve clinical pregnancy outcome in women with subclinical hypothyroidism and/or thyroid autoimmunity undergoing ART. Further research is needed to determine pregnancy outcome after close monitoring of thyroid function to maintain thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4 levels within the trimester-specific reference ranges for pregnancy."

CD005253,0,21932965,0,Stroke in pregnant and postpartum women.,"Ischemic infarcts and hemorrhages are uncommon but dangerous complications of pregnancy. Their etiology is related to physiological changes during pregnancy. The majority of strokes are seen in the third trimester and postpartum and are etiologically related to three conditions: reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, preeclampsia/eclampsia and cerebral venous thrombosis. The first two conditions are etiologically connected and can lead to ischemic and hemorrhagic events, whereas cerebral sinus thrombosis is mainly related to hypercoagulation and causes venous infarcts and brain hemorrhages. MRI and CT scans are safe to use for diagnosis of stroke in pregnancy, although use of iodine-based contrast may affect thyroid function of the neonate. Management of stroke in pregnancy is specific to cause and depends on management of blood pressure and delivery in preeclampsia/eclampsia, expected management or calcium channel blockers in reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and anticoagulation for cerebral sinus thrombosis."

Patients extracted from the Finnish Cancer Registry data base (5,180 patients with cancer diagnosis at the age of 0-15 years, and born after 1970) were linked with thyroxin reimbursement data (Drug Reimbursement Register) and with thyroxin purchase data (prescription database) maintained by the Social Insurance Institution. At the end of follow-up, the prevalence of HT (10,509/100,000) was found to exceed that in the general population (240/100,000) for those aged <35 years. Diagnostic group (p < 0.0001) and gender (p < 0.0025) had significant effect on the risk of developing HT. Males were less prone to the development of HT. Cumulative incidence rate of HT was highest in patients with thyroid cancer (TC), Hodgkin lymphoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumors and neuroblastoma. Except in patients with TC (4.5 months) and CNS tumors (19 months), the median time for the appearance of HT was quite long, varying between 2 and 4.5 years.

CD005253,0,15009914,0,The elimination of iodine deficiency in the Czech Republic: the steps toward success.,"The Czech Republic has a long history of iodine deficiency. Salt iodization was introduced in 1947, followed by a progressive correction of iodine deficiency. The present study reports the changes in the status of iodine nutrition and of thyroid function in the country from 1994 to 2002. The study included 29612 individuals, aged 0 to 98 years, including 5263 individuals randomly selected from the general population and 24349 individuals who attended the Institute of Endocrinology of Prague (hospital population). Urinary iodine was determined in all individuals. Measurements of serum thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and thyroglobulin (Tg), were taken in 8544 to 19060 individuals. The iodine content of table salt was measured in 1130 samples. The median urinary iodine in the general and hospital populations were not significantly different. They progressively increased with time, starting from values indicating mild iodine deficiency (88-95 microg/L) prior to 1997, reaching the critical threshold of 100 microg/L in 1998, and optimal values between 120-140 microg/L since 2000. There was only a low and not significant positive correlation between the iodine content of salt and the urinary iodine. In contrast, urinary iodine showed marked seasonal changes, with the highest values during winter, when livestock were supplemented by mineral tablets containing iodine. Variables exploring thyroid function were all situated within the normal range in adults but another study (results not reported) has shown the persistence of slightly elevated TSH in neonates. The correction of iodine deficiency was not accompanied by unfavorable side effects. In conclusion, the Czech Republic has achieved sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency. Salt iodization has been a determining, but not the only, factor responsible for the success. Iodine supplementation of livestock and increased consumption of milk rich in iodine have probably played a determining role. Neonatal thyroid screening could constitute the major monitoring tool in order to insure sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency in the Czech Republic."

In this study, 13 infants with congenital hyperthyroidism were examined between the ages of one week and 17 weeks in an attempt to evaluate the degree of developmental retardation and the influence of hormonal treatment. It was found that visual evoked responses were abnormal in 12 of the patients, the most common abnormality being an immature abnormal response pattern. Latency was increased significantly in 10 of the 11 patients who were diagnosed before the age of six months, but was normal in the remaining two who were diagnosed later. A significant reduction of photic driving occurred in only two patients; it was the sole abnormality in one of them. Both the response pattern and latency became normal during treatment. The authors conclude that recording visual evoked responses is a simple and useful method of evaluating cerebral function in congenital hypothyroidism, both before and during treatment."

Furthermore, the effectiveness of antenatal care in improving maternal or fetal and neonatal health has been questioned. However, reasonably compelling evidence from randomized trials shows that nutrition interventions can prevent both infant (iodine supplementation) and maternal (vitamin A and beta-carotene supplementation) deaths, and informal analysis suggests that the cost-effectiveness of nutrition interventions would be comparable and, in some cases, markedly superior to several standard antenatal interventions. Future efforts to establish the cost-effectiveness of nutrition interventions in developing countries will depend on conducting large, pragmatic clinical trials that use region- and resource-appropriate interventions with mortality or valid, incontrovertibly severe morbidity endpoints. If such trials establish effectiveness, credible cost-effectiveness analyses can then be performed."

We studied thyrotropin (TSH) levels in mothers of premature and low-birth-weight infants in Colombia, where iodized salt supplements the diet to correct iodine deficiency. The additional impact of salt restriction in mothers with hypertensive disorders was examined. Blood was spotted on filter paper from 404 mothers and their infants. Using radioimmunoassay (RIA), TSH was measured in the mothers, and TSH and thyroxine in their infants at three postpartum times. Initially, mothers had high TSH levels (i.e., TSH > 10 mU/L in half the mothers at the first assessment). Fourteen days later, only 9.3%, and at calculated term 7.5% were greater than 10 mU/L. Maternal TSH levels correlated with infant birth weight and gestational age (r = 0.47, and r = 0.49, p < 0.01). Initial TSH values were higher in salt restricted (20.1 +/- 2 mU/L, n = 76) versus control mothers (14.6 +/- 0.85, n = 328, p < 0.01), dropping dramatically in both groups 14 days later (to 3.4 +/- 0.7 mU/L vs. 2.8 +/- 0.4 mU/L) and at calculated term (2.8 +/- 0.4 mU/L vs. 2.3 +/- 0.6 mU/L).

CD005253,0,409097,0,Pituitary-thyroid responsiveness to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in preterm and small-for-gestational age newborns.,"A dose of 40 microgram TRH was injected intravenously in 12 preterm (PT) and 15 small-for-gestational age (SGA) babies (with advanced gestational ages) between 5 and 167 hours after birth. Serum-thyrotropin (TSH) was measured prior to and 30 and 180 min after TRH; serum-thyroxine (T4) and serum-triiodothyronine (T3) were measured prior to and 180 min after TRH. The percentage increase in serum-TSH in PT and SGA babies was comparable to that of fullterm newborns. The serum-TSH 30 min after TRH in SGA newborns was significantly correlated to basal TSH values, such a correlation could not be shown in the preterms. One SGA and four PT babies had a repeat TRH-test performed later in infancy: In all but one PT with a gestational age of 27 weeks the TSH rise was lower than in the neonatal period. The thyroid hormone responses after TRH were similar in the two groups of babies. The percentage increase above basal levels were: Median serum-T3 increase about 46% and median serum-T4 increase about 14%. It is concluded that in low-birth-weight newborn babies the pituitary TSH response to exogenous TRH was like that detected in fullterm newborns and more pronounced that later in infancy. The effect of endogenous TSH as measured by thyroid hormone increases was of the same magnitude as observed in fullterms and in adults."

At the time of admission, serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone and 1,25(OH)2D3 were found to be inadequately high, and those of calcitonin and 24,25(OH)2D3 too low, relative to the hypercalcemia. Treatment with calcitonin normalized serum calcium concentrations within 4 days, and a 3-week course of thiazides combined with a decreased dietary calcium:phosphorus ratio corrected the hypercalciuria. A repeat profile of the calcium-regulating hormones done at the age of 5.5 months was normal. Based on the clinical course and the hormonal profiles, we hypothesize that the idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia in this patient could have resulted from a generalized maturational delay of calcium homeostasis. Treatment with calcitonin, therefore, seems to be the most appropriate way to control the hypercalcemia."

Infants and children present with seizures and stroke-like episodes with focal neurologic deficits. Our previous investigations revealed that growth-hormone deficiency occurs with an increased prevalence in Sturge-Weber syndrome, presumably secondary to involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. We have continued to screen for hormonal abnormalities in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, specifically those from our multidisciplinary center for patients with this condition. We describe 2 children out of 83 (2.4%) with Sturge-Weber syndrome and brain involvement who were evaluated at our center and diagnosed with central hypothyroidism, based on clinical signs and laboratory findings. This prevalence is much higher than that of central hypothyroidism in the general population. Although it is well-known that anticonvulsants can lead to abnormalities in thyroid function tests, including central hypothyroidism, patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome carry the additional risk of developing hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, secondary to their central nervous system dysfunction. Therefore, it is important that patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome undergo routine thyroid-function testing, especially in the face of any clinical manifestations."

CD005253,0,11573130,0,Representative data of iodine intake and urinary excretion in Germany.,"To evaluate the iodine supply of the German population, 2500 representative subjects older than 13 years were elected for answering a specific food questionnaire. In addition spot urine samples in 3 selected risk groups for iodine deficiency (574 adults aged 50-70 years, 769 conscripts, 886 pairs of mothers and newborns) from 26 representative regions were collected. Furthermore the circadian iodine excretion was measured in 24 h urine samples collected in 6 fractions per day in 4 subgroups (young and older males and females) of 91 controls and this 24 h iodine excretion related to iodine/creatinine ratio in these subgroups. Mean estimated iodine intake was 119 microg/d in adults aged 50-70 years, 137 microg/d in conscripts, and 162 microg/d in mothers at still birth. The mean iodine concentration (iodine/creatinine ratio) was 9.4 microg/dl in 566 adults aged 50-70 years, 8.3 microg/dl in 772 conscripts and 5.6 microg/dl in 739 breast fed newborns. The mean daily iodine excretion was 134 microg/d in 278 men aged 50-70 years, 117 microg/d in 288 women aged 50-70 years, 125 microg/d in 772 conscripts and 74 microg/d in 53 breast-feeding mothers not using iodine tablets. These results show, that iodine intake in Germany has increased over the last years. The deficit in iodine intake with significant regional differences and defined risk groups for iodine deficiency (e.g. breast feeding mothers without iodine deficiency prophylaxis) is estimated to be about 30% of the recommended iodine intake."

CD005253,0,20412848,0,Comparative study of the effects of experimentally induced hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in some brain regions in albino rats.,"Thyroid hormones (THs) play a crucial role in the development and physiological functioning of different body organs especially the brain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to show the histopathological effects of the different thyroid states on some brain regions (cerebrum and cerebellum) and the skeletal features of their newborns during the postnatal development from the 1st to 3rd week. The female white albino rats were allocated into 3 groups as follows: the experimental hypothyroidism group is induced by 0.02% methimazole (MMI) (w/v) in drinking water, while the experimental hyperthyroidism group is performed by exogenous T4 [from 50 to 200microg/kg body weight intragastric administration beside adding 0.002% T4 (w/v) to the drinking water] from the gestation day 1 to lactation day 21 and control group which received tap water. As well, both maternal hypo- and hyperthyroidism caused some malformation and developmental defects in the cerebellar and cerebral cortex of their newborns along the duration of the experiment. These degenerative symptoms became more prominent and widely spread at the 3rd postnatal week. Concomitantly, there were some degeneration, deformation and severe growth retardation in neurons of these regions in both treated groups throughout the experimental period. Moreover, the skeletal features of these newborns were accelerated in hyperthyroid group while these maturations were delayed partially in hypothyroid ones during the examined periods. These alterations, on both treated groups, were age and dose dependent. Thus, further studies need to be done to emphasize this concept."

CD005253,0,24529002,0,"The association between prenatal exposure to organochlorine pesticides and thyroid hormone levels in newborns in Yancheng, China.","Organochlorine pesticides can interfere with the thyroid hormones that play an important role in early neurodevelopment. Although organochlorine pesticides have been banned in China since 1983, their residues are still detectable in the environment. However, few studies have investigated the adverse health effects of prenatal exposure to organochlorine pesticide residues on newborns in China. The present study, conducted in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, China, aimed to examine the association between the levels of organochlorine pesticides in maternal and cord sera and to assess the impact of prenatal exposure to organochlorine pesticides on thyroid hormone levels in cord serum. Eleven organochlorine pesticides in maternal and cord sera were measured in 247 mother-infant pairs recruited from Yancheng City between February 2010 and June 2010. The concentration of the thyroid hormones free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyrotropin (TSH) were determined in cord serum. Among the 11 tested organochlorine pesticides, the detectable levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), β-hexachlorocycolohexane (β-HCH) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) in both maternal and cord sera were above 50%. The levels of β-HCH and p,p'-DDE in maternal sera were positively associated with the levels in cord sera (r=0.421, P<0.01; r=0.288, P<0.01). After adjusting for confounders, the TSH level in cord serum samples was negatively associated with the HCB level (OR=0.535, 95% CI=(0.304-0.941)). Our data demonstrated that DDT, β-HCH and HCB residues bioconcentrate in maternal and cord sera. Moreover, the correlation analysis suggested that organochlorine pesticides in maternal blood can transfer through the placenta and affect newborn thyroid hormone levels."

Forty pregnant women with indications to preterm delivery were divided into two subgroups: A--30 patients suffering from insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, B--10 patients with other pathology of pregnancy. 500 micrograms L-thyroxine ""Henning"" was injected intraamniotically. The gestational age at the time of initiating the L-thyroxine therapy was: 31-37 weeks in subgroup A, 31-36 in subgroup B and at the time of delivery: 33-38 weeks, 33-36 weeks, respectively. The control group of prematures was selected according to gestational age. The frequency of respiratory distress syndrome and mortality for this reason in the study group of newborns was lower in comparison to the control group. Side effects of L-thyroxine were not observed. We conclude that L-thyroxine accelerates the maturation of fetal lung and is very useful in prenatal medicine."

This study evaluated whether estimated iodine-131 exposures were risk factors for infant mortality, fetal death, and preterm birth in the years of highest releases, 1945 and 1946. Data on births, fetal deaths, and infant deaths, during the period 1940 to 1950, were abstracted from vital records for an eight county area surrounding the Hanford facility. The analysis included 56,320 births, 1,656 infant deaths, and 806 fetal deaths. The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction project provided iodine-131 dose estimates for the 1,102 grid areas in the study area. The grid areas were collapsed into 4 exposure groups using estimated exposure to iodine-131 during 1945. Each birth and death record was assigned to one of the four grid groups based on mother's residence at the time of birth. Comparisons of preterm birth, infant death, and fetal death rates were made among the grid groupings for the primary exposure period (1945 to 1946) and for other years of the study period (i.e., 1940 to 1944 and 1947 to 1950). In the grid group with the highest estimated iodine-131 exposures, the mother's residence during the latter part of pregnancy was associated with preterm birth (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.09-2.72). An association with infant mortality (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.79-1.97) was suggested. No association was found for fetal deaths. This study found that iodine-131 exposure was associated with increased risk of preterm birth. This finding is biologically plausible because other studies have found that: (1) iodine-131 exposure can cause hypothyroidism, and (2) overt or subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy can increase a mother's risk of a preterm delivery."

The thyroid hormones, thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, are necessary for adequate growth and development throughout fetal and extrauterine life. The iodine intake of newborns is entirely dependent on the iodine content of breast milk and the formula preparations used to feed them. An inadequate iodine supply (deficiency and excess) might be especially dangerous in the case of premature babies. The minimum recommended dietary allowance is different depending on age groups. The iodine intake required is at least 15 microg/kg/d in full-term infants and 30 microg/kg/d in preterms. Premature infants are in a situation of iodine deficiency, precisely at a stage of psychomotor and neural development that is extremely sensitive to alterations of thyroid function."

CD005253,0,2229315,0,Transport of thyroid hormones by human erythrocytes: kinetic characterization in adults and newborns.,"The uptake of [125I]T3 and [125I]T4 by human erythrocytes was studied. The erythrocytes were obtained from adult subjects (28-41 yr old) and suspended in a protein-free medium. The half-times of equilibration for both T3 and T4 were 6 min. At equilibrium, T3 was concentrated 55-fold inside the cells, while T4 was concentrated 40 times, but these accumulations were not dependent on either cellular ATP or the transmembrane Na+ gradient. The amounts of cell-associated thyroid hormones were 20 times (T3) and 17 times (T4) higher than the amounts of free extracellular hormones at 5 X 10(9) erythrocytes/mL (the blood concentration). Oligomycin and phloretin inhibited T3-saturable transport (but not T4 transport) independently of cellular energy. We suggest that thyroid hormones are concentrated by intracellular trapping. The rates of T3 and T4 efflux from preloaded erythrocytes were similar to the influx rates. The initial velocities of T3 (but not T4) uptake and efflux were 70% saturable. The uptake was specific because the unlabeled analogs T4, triiodothyroacetic acid, rT3, D-T3, and D,L-thyronine inhibited [125I]T3 uptake 60, 125, 160, 190, and 1600 times less, respectively, than did unlabeled T3. The kinetic parameters of T3-saturable uptake, Km, and maximum velocity were determined for three groups of subjects: newborns, 28 to 41-yr-old adults, and 76 to 90-yr-old adults. The Km (67 nmol/L in 28 to 41-yr-old adults) was not age dependent, BUT the maximum velocity was significantly higher in newborns than in adults. We conclude that T3 transport across the human erythrocyte membrane is mediated mainly by facilitated diffusion, whereas T4 transport results from free diffusion. Human erythrocytes might act as a circulating pool of thyroid hormones, especially T3 in newborns."

Interference in binding of radioactive 3',5'-T2 to anti-3',5'-T2 by serum proteins was minimized by using 0.4 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) and merthiolate. The detection threshold of the RIA was 2.5 ng/100 ml. Recovery of nonradioactive 3',5'-T2 added to serum averaged 99%. T4, T3, and rT3 cross-reacted with 3',5'-T2-binding sites on anti-3',5'-T2 antibody only to the extent of 0.0025, less than 0.0004, and 0.22%, respectively. 3'-Monoiodothyronine cross-reacted 1.7%. Serum 3',5'-T2 concentrations were (mean +/- SD) 6.4 +/- 2.4 ng/100 ml in 53 normal subjects, 4.2 +/- 3.5 ng/100 ml in 7 hypothyroid patients, 14.9 +/- 7.7 ng/ml in 25 patients with hepatic cirrhosis, and 14.3 +/- 5.3 ng/100 ml in 31 newborns' cord blood sera. The values in each of the latter four groups were significantly different from normal. The mean serum 3',5'-T2 concentration of 7.7 +/- 2.5 ng/ml in eight subjects in the third trimester of pregnancy did not differ significantly from normal at a time when serum T4 and T3 were clearly elevated. Oral administration of 300 microgram rT3 to 9 normal subjects led to a mean maximal increase in serum 3',5'-T2 concentration of 45% at 1 h. Total fasting in 3 obese subjects was associated with a significant increase in serum 3',5'-T2 from 8.6 to 16.3 ng/100 ml at 6-8 days; serum rT3 increased similarly, while serum T3 decreased and T4 did not change. Administration of dexamethasone (2 mg also associated with nearly parallel increases in serum 3',5'-T2 and rT3 and a decrease in serum T3. 3',5'-T2 concentrations were also measured in amniotic fluids at different stages of gestation; the mean value of 15.2 ng/100 ml at 15-20 weeks gestation was significantly higher than that of 5.8 ng/ml at 33-40 weeks gestation. Pronase hydrolysates of 9 autopsy specimens of normal thyroid glands contained (mean +/- SD) 350 +/- 144 microgram T4 and 0.24 +/- 0.15 microgram 3',5'-T2/g wet wt. On the basis of these data and those available for MCRs of 3',5'-T2 and T4, it was estimated that thyroidal secretion contributes less than 1% of 3',5'-T2 measured in serum of normal man. The various data suggest that: 1) 3',5'-T2 is a normal component of human serum; 2) almost all 3',5'-T2 in human serum derives from extrathyroidal sources; and 3) changes in serum 3',5'-2 generally parallel those in rT3."

When prematurely delivered at 140 days (term gestation is 184 days), infant baboons developed hyaline membrane disease, had no surge in T3 and T4, temporarily developed hypothyroxinemia, and had extremely low T3 concentrations during the first 40 h of life. After 4 days, both plasma T4 and T3 levels progressively increased, but were still considerably lower at 16 days compared to those in normal term infants. Hepatic 5'-MDI activity was measured in the presence of dithiothreitol in fetal, premature, and infant baboons. Fetal baboons at 140 and 161 days gestation had 80% less 5'-MDI activity than term infants, but at 178-180 days gestation, near term, fetal hepatic 5'-MDI activity increased to levels similar to those in young adults. Interruption of in utero development by premature birth resulted in no change in hepatic 5'-MDI activity after 24 h, but within 6 days after delivery, hepatic 5'-MDI had significantly increased to levels observed in fetal baboons near term. Kinetic analysis revealed that fetal and premature 5'-MDI had different maximum velocities and similar apparent Km values. There was no significant difference in hepatic total, protein, or nonprotein sulfhydryl groups between 1- and 10-day-old premature (140 days gestation) baboons. These results suggest that premature birth does not limit the postnatal maturation of hepatic 5'-MDI activity."

CD005253,0,27086862,0,Pyridoxine-Responsive Seizures in Infantile Hypophosphatasia and a Novel Homozygous Mutation in ALPL Gene.,"Hypophosphatasia is a rare inherited disorder of bone and mineral metabolism caused by a number of loss-of-function mutations in the ALPL gene. It is characterized by defective bone and tooth mineralisation associated with low serum and bone alkaline phosphatase activity. The clinical presentation of this disease is extremely variable. For this reason, the diagnosis can be difficult and is often missed out or delayed. Hypophosphatasia is classified into subtypes based on the age of onset and clinical features. The clinical severity is associated with the age at diagnosis and the lack of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase activity; the severe forms of hypophosphatasia are primarily perinatal and infantile forms. Severe forms may present with many neurological problems such as seizures, hypotonia, irritability. Herein, we report the case of an infantile hypophosphatasia patient who presented with pyridoxine-responsive seizures and a novel homozygous mutation in the ALPL gene was detected. There is a limited number of hypophosphatasia patients with pyridoxine-responsive seizures in the literature, so early diagnosis of infantile hypophosphatasia in the clinically compatible patients allows more effective postnatal care/management and genetic counseling for further pregnancies."

A case-control study was conducted in Gadarif Hospital, eastern Sudan. Sociodemographic characteristics were gathered using questionnaires. Biochemical and hormones profiles were measured using appropriate laboratory methods. There was no significant difference in maternal and fetal anthropometrics parameters between anaemic (<11 g/dl) and non-anaemic groups. Maternal prolactin, cord serum albumin and cord serum ferritin were significantly higher in the anaemic group. No significant difference was observed in the other maternal and fetal parameters (total protein, growth hormone, cortisol, insulin, thyroid stimulating hormone, total thyroxine and triodiothyroxine). Thus, in this study there were some maternal and fetal endocrine modulations due to anaemia during pregnancy and further studies are needed."
CD005253,0,19279731,0,Differential effects of thyroid hormone manipulation and beta adrenoceptor agonist administration on uncoupling protein mRNA abundance in adipose tissue and thermoregulation in neonatal pigs.,"We have shown that there is significant disparity in the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCP) 2 and 3 between modern-commercial and ancient-Meishan porcine genotypes, commercial pigs also have higher plasma triiodothyronine (T(3)) in on the first day of life. T(3) and the sympathetic nervous system are both known to regulate UCPs in rodents and humans; their role in regulating these proteins in the pig is unknown. This study examined whether thyroid hormone manipulation or administration of a selective beta3 adrenoceptor agonist (ZD) influenced plasma hormones, colonic temperature and UCP expression in adipose tissue of two breeds of pig. To mimic the differences observed in thyroid hormone status, piglets from Meishan and commercial litters were randomly assigned to control (1 ml/kg water), T(3) (10 mg/kg) (Meishan only), methimazole (a commonly used antithyroid drug) (50 mg/kg) (commercial only) or ZD (10 mg/kg) oral administration for the first 4 days of postnatal life. Adipose tissue UCP2/3 mRNA abundance was measured on day 4 using PCR. T(3) administration raised plasma T(3) concentrations and increased colonic temperature on day 4. UCP3 mRNA abundance was higher in Meishan, than commercial piglets (p = 0.042) and was downregulated following T(3) administration (p = 0.014). Irrespective of genotype, ZD increased UCP2 mRNA abundance (Meishan p = 0.05, commercial p = 0.03). Expression of neither UCP2 nor 3 was related to colonic temperature, regardless of treatment. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a dissociation between thyroid hormones and the sympathetic nervous system in the regulation of UCPs in porcine adipose tissue. We have also suggested that expression of adipose tissue UCP2 and 3 are not related to body temperature in piglets."
CD005253,0,12574190,0,Hyperthyrotropinemia during iodide administration in normal children and in children born with neonatal transient hypothyroidism.,"The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of chronic iodide administration in pharmacological doses on thyroid function in children with a history of transient congenital hypothyroidism (TCH). We hypothesized that such children may carry a previously undisclosed intrinsic intrathyroidal defect, rendering them susceptible to TCH. We administered for this 60-65 mg iodide daily for 60 d in 13 individuals with TCH (group A), 8 of their siblings (group B), 8 healthy controls (group C), and 11 normal adults (group D). Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring serum T(3), T(4), free T(3), free T(4), TSH, and thyroglobulin concentrations and autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin at baseline at 15, 30, and 60 d during iodide administration, and 2 months after iodide withdrawal. Hyperthyrotropinemia greater than 4.2 mU/liter but not higher than 10 mU/liter with normal thyroid hormone concentrations was observed in one of the TCH group and in two of the group B siblings. During iodide administration, hyperthyrotropinemia was observed in 8 of 13 (62%) adolescents in group A, 4 of 7 (57%) in group B, and 6 of 8 (75%) in group C. None of the 11 adults (group D) developed hyperthyrotropinemia during iodide administration. Serum T(4) and free T(4) concentrations were decreased in all groups when compared with baseline values. The magnitude of the decrease of serum T(4) was identical in all groups (0.7-0.8 microg/dl). Thyroid enlargement was observed in all subjects and was more pronounced in children. There were no cases of subclinical and/or overt hyperthyroidism. After iodine withdrawal, serum TSH decreased in all groups and returned to baseline levels, as well as the thyroid volume. In conclusion, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis of adolescents with TCH responds to pharmacological doses of iodide similarly to that observed in normal children. The hyperthyrotropinemia observed in the adolescents exposed to iodides may reflect incipient transient hypothyroidism or simply a brisk TSH response to a small serum T(4) decrease. Whatever the mechanism, chronic use of excessive quantities of iodide should be avoided until the end of puberty."
CD005253,0,1987441,0,Iodine and thyroid disease.,"Iodine is a requisite substrate for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones, the minimum daily requirement being about 50 micrograms. An autoregulatory mechanism within the thyroid serves as the first line of defense against fluctuations in the supply of iodine and also permits escape from the inhibition of hormone synthesis that a very large quantity of iodine induces (Wolff-Chaikoff effect and escape therefrom). Environmental iodine deficiency continues to be a significant public health problem worldwide, compounded in some geographic regions by the presence of other goitrogens in some staple foods. The pathologic consequences of severe iodine deficiency include endemic goiter, endemic cretinism, increased fetal and infant mortality, and an increased prevalence in the community of cognitive and neuromotor disabilities. The implementation of an iodization program prevents endemic cretinism and reduces the frequency of the other pathologic consequences of iodine deficiency. Iodine excess results principally from the use of iodine-containing medicinal preparations or radiographic contrast media. The pathologic consequences of iodine excess will ensue only when thyroid autoregulation is defective, in that escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect cannot occur, or when autoregulation is absent. Defective autoregulation characterizes the fetal and neonatal thyroid, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, radioiodine or surgically treated Graves' hyperthyroidism, the thyroid of patients with cystic fibrosis, and the thyroid that has been exposed to weak inhibitors of the organic binding of iodine. In these circumstances, the provision of excess iodine may lead to iodide goiter with or without hypothyroidism. Absent autoregulation may be a feature of longstanding multinodular goiter, and the provision of excess iodine in this circumstance may induce thyrotoxicosis (Jod-Basedow disease). The pathologic consequences of iodine excess will resolve when the source of iodine has been dissipated. In addition to its role in reversing iodine deficiency, iodine is used as adjunctive therapy for hyperthyroidism. By inhibiting the proteolytic release of iodothyronines from thyroglobulin, it induces a prompt slowing of thyroid hormone secretion. This effect is exploited in the treatment of thyrotoxic crisis or severe thyrocardiac disease. Iodine also reduces thyroid cellularity and vascularity and therefore is used in the preparation of the patient for thyroidectomy. Finally, by exploiting the failure of escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect, iodine may also be used in the early management of radioiodine-treated Graves' hyperthyroidism."
CD005253,0,2239079,0,"Antithyroid drug treatment of Graves' disease in pregnancy: long-term effects on somatic growth, intellectual development and thyroid function of the offspring.","With regard to their thyroid function, somatic and intellectual development, we compared 17 children of 13 hyperthyroid mothers (group I) receiving antithyroid drug treatment during their pregnancies with 25 children of 15 mothers who were euthyroid without any antithyroid treatment during their pregnancy (group II). Mean duration of maternal treatment was 3.5 months in group I, using carbimazole or thiamazole (N = 12) and propylthiouracil (N = 1). Age at examination in group I was 7.2 +/- 6.2 years, in group II 8.7 +/- 7.1 years (mean +/- SD). Both groups showed no significant differences in the results of the clinical examination and in the degree of their mental and psychomotoric development at the time of study. We found the mean birth weight of the infants in group I significantly lower than in group II (3165 +/- 339 vs 3666 +/- 670 g, p less than 0.03). The individual birth weights, however, were normal for gestational age. The body weight difference between groups disappeared during the further somatic development of the children. The serum concentration of free thyroxine in group I was significantly higher than in group II (17.2 +/- 2.4 vs 14.9 +/- 1.9 pmol/l, p less than 0.003), but fell in both groups within the normal range. The evaluation of the psychomotoric and intellectual capacity of the children at different developmental stages showed no abnormalities detectable by our tests. Thus, in the children of the two groups we found no adverse effects of a maternal antithyroid drug treatment during pregnancy or of inactive maternal Graves' disease alone, neither on thyroid gland size and function nor on the physical or intellectual development, after the neonatal period."

CD005253,0,2191216,0,[Conservative strategies in treating thyroid diseases in children].,"In the Federal Republic of Germany disorders of the thyroid gland are among the most common chronic diseases of childhood and adolescence. In Munich 30% of schoolchildren, in Göttingen 16% of children 6 to 16 years of age have goiters. Iodine deficiency is the most important etiological reason for the development of euthyroid goiter, which is encountered in more than 80% of children and adolescents suffering from thyroid disorders. Lymphocytic chronic thyroiditis (Hashimoto) causes goiters which may be eu-, hypo- but also hyperthyroid. Thyrotoxicosis (M. Basedow, Grave's Disease) in childhood occurs mainly in pubertal girls. The frequency of congenital hypothyroidism in West Germany is 1:3,800 neonates. The postnatally acquired hypothyroidism in childhood is as rare as hyperthyroidism caused by toxic thyroid adenoma. 27% of nodular goiters in childhood are due to Thyroid carcinoma. The diagnostic procedure of evaluation of thyroid disorders in childhood includes family and past personal history, palpatory findings, ultrasonography and the determination of TSH and thyroid hormone plasma concentrations. The aims of conservative management of thyroid diseases during childhood and adolescence are 1st normalisation of size of the thyroid gland, 2nd achievement and maintenance of euthyroid function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Bromocriptine therapy during pregnancy had no effect on urinary oestriol excretion and plasma levels of unconjugated oestriol, progesterone, human placental lactogen, cystine aminopeptidase and heat-stable alkaline phosphatase. The maternal and foetal (cord )blood and amniotic fluid showed prolactin levels of 3.8, 6.5 and 1700 ng/ml, respectively, in the 39th week of pregnancy during bromocriptine therapy. Compared with data from normal pregnancies, these values demonstrated that bromocriptine or an active metabolite crossed the term placenta to suppress prolactin secretion from the foetal pituitary gland and that the prolactin level in amniotic fluid was scarcely affected by the drug. Maternal, foetal and amniotic fluid growth hormone levels were 27.0, 33.0 and 3.8 ng/ml, respectively, thus indicating that dopamine agonists suppress growth hormone only in acromegalic patients, and not in normal babies.

This was a monocenter retrospective study with prospective collection of data including all babies born during the study period. Those presenting infection risk factors had PCT measurement. Three groups were defined: certainly infected, probably infected, and non-infected. A total of 12,485 newborns were included, 2151 had PCT measurement, and 26 were infected. Receiver operating curves of PCT determined 0.6 ng/ml as the best cut-off, with an area under the curve of 0.96 (CI 95% 0.95-0.98). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and positive and negative likelihood ratios were 0.92 (range, 0.75-0.98), 0.97 (0.96-0.98), 0.28 (0.20-0.36), 0.99 (0.99-0.99), 32 (24-41) and 0.08 (0.02-0.3), respectively. Post-test probabilities were 28% (23-33) if the test was positive, and less than 0.001% (0-1.10(-5)) if the test was negative. Gestational age between 28 and 32 weeks (OR 4.4; range, 1.2-16.2) and pH at birth < 7.10 (OR 2.9; 1.1-7.4) were other independent factors of increasing PCT (p < 0.05).

A total of 968 samples comprising 121 foods were collected and analysed. Mean daily exposures were calculated from mean concentration levels of the selected nutrients in each food combined with simulated diets for a 25+-year-old male and female, a 19-24-year-old male, a 11-14-year-old boy and girl, a 5-6-year-old child, a 1-3-year-old toddler and a 6-12-month-old infant. Food concentrations and dietary exposures are reported and compared with nutrient reference values (for example, recommended daily intakes, adequate intakes or upper limits). Dietary iodine exposures for all age-sex groups were well below recommended levels and have steadily decreased since 1982, raising concern especially for the physical and mental development of infants and young children. Fe exposures meet the recommended daily intake for the average male and 11-14 year olds but are only about half that recommended for adult females. Se exposure is about 20 % less than optimal for females. Na exposures, excluding discretionary salt, are above the acceptable exposure level for all age-sex groups, and exceed the upper intake limits for 25+-year-old males, 19-24-year-old young males, and 11-14-year-old boys and girls by up to 125 % for an average consumer."
CD005253,0,1958833,0,Late effects of breast-feeding and early weaning: seven-year prospective study in children.,"The effect of breast feeding on some clinical and thyroid function parameters was studied in a prospective longitudinal study from birth up to 7 years of age. At the ages 1-7 years, the obesity rates observed in children breast-fed for less than 3 months were substantially higher than in children who had been breast-fed over longer intervals. Mean age when obesity was reported was similar in all groups (4-5 years). The rates of respiratory tract diseases were found to be highest in children which had been breast-fed for less than 2 weeks. Breast-feeding for more than 6 months had a protective effect against diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The longitudinal follow-up revealed biphasic changes of thyroid hormones and TSH in sera with a nadir at 2-3 years, followed by an increase at the end of preschool age. Duration of breast-feeding did not affect profoundly these parameters at the ages 1-7 years. Surprisingly, during late preschool age (5-6 years) total serum cholesterol increased with the age at weaning. The atherogenic index in 6-year-old children was most favourable in the group breast-fed over more than 1 but less than 3 months. This was due to the highest levels of HDL-cholesterol in this group. We conclude that the age at weaning may be important for the later development of children."

CD005253,0,8886320,0,Current food and nutrition situation in south Asian and south-east Asian countries.,"Food production in the countries of South and South-East Asia has shown a general upward trend during the last decade. Despite the considerable increase in population in many of these countries, food production per capita in 1988-90 was significantly higher as compared to 1979-81 figures, the increase being specially marked in such countries as Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Available daily calorie supply was adequate to meet the requirement. The overall pattern of food production however has shown little change, with cereal production continuing to account for a predominant part of food production. There is no evidence of a significant uptrend with respect to production of pulses, milk, horticultural products, poultry or meat production in most countries. A unique and unfortunate feature of the nutrition situation in South-Asian countries is that the incidence of low birth weight deliveries is as high as 34% (1990), ranging from 25% in Sri Lanka to 50% in Bangladesh (as against less than 7% in the countries of Europe and North America). Even in countries of Africa where the overall food and nutrition situation is worse than in South Asia, the incidence is well below 20%. This is a reflection of the poor state of maternal nutrition in pregnancy. Florid nutritional deficiency diseases have shown a steep decline over the last two decades, but goitre and iron deficiency anaemia continue to be major public health problems, though some headway has been made with regard to the control of the former. Severe forms of growth retardation in children have declined but the majority suffer from mild and moderate forms of growth retardation. Countries of the Region are in varying stages of developmental transition. Among the burgeoning middle classes in some of these countries there are evidences of escalation of degenerative diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease. With increasing life expectancy, geriatric nutritional problems will demand increasing attention."

CD005253,0,2633917,0,Euthyroid hypothyrotropinemia in children of short stature.,"Unique association of hypothyrotropinemia with euthyroidism was described in 2 children of short stature. Both had a history of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), but showed an appropriate growth rate after infancy (5 cm/y). Growth hormone secretion after provocation tests was normal, whereas TSH response to TRH was absent. With a highly sensitive TSH radioimmunoassay (RIA) and a specific RIA for TSH-alpha-subunit, both responded to a high dose of TRH stimulation. Serum thyroid hormones were within the normal range, while prolactin response to TRH was exaggerated. Exogenous thyroxine (T4) supplement in case 1 did not improve his growth rate, indicating absence of hypothyroidism. Case 2 was treated with stanozolol, which accelerated his growth velocity to 8 cm/y. During the treatment, serum T4 gradually decreased to 50% of the initial level, but blunted TSH response to TRH remained unchanged. These results indicate that their thyrotrophs are resistant to TRH stimulation and the pituitary setpoint of TSH release is unusually high. The exact mechanism involved in maintaining euthyroidism despite hypothyrotropinemia remains to be elucidated, but a common history of IUGR appears to play a role in producing this pituitary-thyroid state."

In addition, maternal thyroid disease can have substantial adverse effects on the fetus. Therefore, evaluating and treating women with thyroid disease during pregnancy requires careful observation and management to ensure favorable pregnancy outcomes. To evaluate thyroid hormone levels during gestation, gestational age-specific values should be used.

The study involved 74 preterm neonates who were born after PPROM. IL-6, CRP, complete blood count and leukocyte ratios, and PCT levels were measured in the 1st day of life, and CRP, PCT, and blood counts were repeated on the 3rd day of life. Seventy-four infants with PPROM were divided into two groups according to the development of sepsis and infection (Group 1: sepsis, n = 32; Group 2: no sepsis, n = 42). There were no significant differences between these groups with respect to gestational age, birthweight and duration of membrane rupture. There were significant differences between the two groups in the 1st day CRP (Group 1: 0.85 -/+ 1.36 mg/dl, Group 2: 0.23 +/- 0.25 mg/dl; p = 0.016), 1st day PCT (Group 1: 7.2 +/- 7.6 ng/ml, Group 2, 1.6 +/- 4.0 ng/ml; p < 0.001), and 3rd day PCT (Group 1: 9.01 +/-11.5 ng/ml, Group 2: 1.34 +/- 1.35 ng/ml; p = 0.001) and IL-6 (Group 1: 80.7 +/- 67.2 pg/ml, Group 2: 3.4 +/- 3.5 ng/ml; p < 0.001) levels. CRP levels were not significantly different between Group 1 (1.2 +/- 1.7 mg/dl) and Group 2 (0.58 +/- 1.1 mg/dl) on the 3rd day of life (p=0.059). CRP levels on the 1st day of life had a cut-off value of 0.72 mg/dl with a sensitivity and specificity of 56% and 58%, respectively. CRP levels on the 3rd day had a cut-off level of 0.78 mg/dl with 60% sensitivity and 63% specificity. PCT levels had a cut-off level of 1.74 ng/ml with 76% sensitivity and 85% specificity on the 1st day of life, and of 1.8 with 89% sensitivity and 86% specificity on the 3rd day of life. Statistical analysis revealed that the cut-off value of 7.6 pg/ml for IL-6 had a 93% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity. Interleukin (IL)-6 is the most reliable marker for the detection of early-onset sepsis in preterm neonates with PPROM. Early PCT levels seemed to be more sensitive than early CRP in this population."

Congenital hypothyroidism has several causes, the most common of which is thyroid dysgenesis. Most affected infants have no historical clues or physical findings to suggest diagnosis. Neonatal screening combining thyroxine and thyrotropin screening have resulted in increased detection, although false-negatives do occur, and the physician must carefully observe all newborns for the findings of congenital hypothyroidism. Early treatment improves the prognosis considerably. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,8286561,0,Transport of triiodothyronine by erythrocytes from premature and term infants.,"To analyze hypothyroxinemia in low birth weight (LBW) infants, the initial uptake of T3 into erythrocytes from term and premature infants was measured. Thirty-eight infants and 18 prepubertal children as controls were subjected in this study. The infants were divided into group 1 (premature infants; below 2,500 g, n = 12) and group 2 (term infants; 2,501-3,500 g, n = 26). Infants with LBW for gestational age were excluded from this study. Vmax for group 1 (mean +/- SE, 6.4 +/- 0.5 pmol/min/10(8) cells), having low thyroid hormone levels, was significantly less than in group 2 (9.0 +/- 0.7 pmol/min/10(8) cells; p < 0.05). Mean Vmax for both groups exceeded normal controls (3.9 +/- 0.3 pmol/min/10(8) cells; p < 0.01). Km in the perinatal period varied widely and was essentially the same as in the normal controls. These findings indicate that T3 uptake by erythrocytes of newborns may possibly be high regardless of maturation stage and blood levels of thyroid hormones may be reflected not by change in the affinity of the transport system but by that in the number of membrane carriers."

CD005253,0,1971773,0,Graves' disease in pregnancy: TSH receptor binding inhibiting immunoglobulins and maternal and neonatal thyroid function.,"We studied interrelationships between maternal and neonatal thyroid function, TSH receptor binding inhibiting immunoglobulins (TBII), and dose of thionamide antithyroid drugs in 44 women with active Graves' disease presenting during 46 pregnancies, and their 48 infants. The women were treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) or carbimazole (CBZ). In 30 pregnancies (30 infants) treatment was withdrawn from 3 to 18 weeks before delivery (Group A). Drug treatment (PTU, n = 10, dose 50-400 mg/day or CBZ, n = 6, dose 5-45 mg/day) was continued throughout pregnancy and delivery in 16 pregnancies producing 18 infants (Group B). The maternal TBII at delivery was well correlated with maternal free thyroxine index (FTI) averaged over the third trimester (r = 0.603, P less than 0.001) and umbilical venous serum TBII (r = 0.940, P less than 0.001). Neonatal FTI was independently related to umbilical vein TBII (t = 2.29, P = 0.03) and maternal dose of antithyroid drug (t = -2.21, P = 0.03). Neonatal thyrotoxicosis was seen in all four infants (8% of births) of women whose TBII levels at delivery exceeded 70%. No child was born with a subnormal FTI but 7/18 infants in group B had raised TSH at birth. This was more likely to occur (P = 0.05) if maternal TBII was less than 30% (6/10) than if maternal TBII was greater than 30% (1/8). Four Group B women with FTI in the lower half of the reference range delivered infants with raised TSH compared with 3/14 (21%) women whose FTI was in the upper half of the reference range or above (P = 0.05). In pregnant women with active Graves' disease TBII levels reflect stimulatory TSH receptor antibody activity. TBII measurements are of use in the prediction of neonatal thyrotoxicosis and impaired neonatal thyroid function in infants of women treated with antithyroid drugs."
CD005253,0,1342755,0,Nutrition situation in metropolitan Jakarta.,"Jakarta is the capital and biggest city of Indonesia with a total population of 10 million. The National Census Office revealed a rapid increase in population through 1985 to 1990. This rapid increase has brought many devastating effects on various aspects of life such as housing, food stock and food production, health and environmental conditions, education, socio-economic and cultural life and political stability. All of these factors contribute to malnutrition in the city as well as in the country as a whole.

Undernutrition among under-five children still is alarming with a prevalence of 27.91%. Anemia also afflicts a great number of pregnant mothers (70%) and preschool children (38.6%). Nutrition problems are worst in urban areas with their high population density; moderate and severe PEM is 5.63% in urban areas compared with 3.7% moderate PEM and no PEM in rural areas. Jakarta is experiencing rapid urbanization. The presence of slums, air and water pollution in city is a paramount factor leading to poor environmental conditions. The existing health system cannot keep pace with the increasing occurrence of infectious diseases brought about by these unfavorable conditions. Unemployment and underemployment as well as rising costs of foodstuffs cause inadequate food availability at the household level. Due to the grinding poverty experienced by the low socio-economic groups, female workers occupy almost one-third of Indonesia's labor force, hence inadequate care is given to children. All these are factors aggravating the nutritional problems in the country."
CD005253,0,11695630,0,Effects of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on thyroid function in infants born in Japan--the second report from research on environmental health.,"Dioxins (PCDD + PCDF) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) are potentially hazardous compounds and have structural similarity to thyroid hormones. Our research group on ""Dioxins and PCB in Human Milk"" was organized in 1997 and has been active for the past three years. We collected breast milk from 80 mothers living in Tokyo, Saitama, Ishikawa and Osaka Prefecture in Japan at 5, 30, 150, 300 postpartum days and measured PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs during 1998-1999. We added another 20 prefectures and cities during 1999-2000. Breast milk was obtained from 415 mothers at 30 postpartum days (breast-feeding group). Blood was taken from infants who were breast-fed at the age of 1 year for evaluation of thyroid and immune functions. Blood was also taken from 53 infants who were bottle-fed (bottle-feeding group) as a control. Serum T4, T3, FT4 and TSH levels in the breast-feeding (n = 337) and bottle-feeding (n = 53) groups were within normal ranges and were not significantly different between the two groups. Although there were a large geographic differences of dioxins and co-PCB content in breast milk, there were no differences in serum T4, T3, FT4, TSH levels and no significant correlation between the mean serum levels of TSH and TEQ in breast milk. There was a significant correlation between serum TSH at 1 year of age and that from blood on dried filter paper TSH at 5 days of age. We concluded that dioxin intake from breast milk in Japanese infants did not impair thyroid function. However, long-term effects remain to be evaluated."

Maternal and fetal complications due to the drug could not be observed. Despite a 39% premature incidence, IRDS and hyaline membrane disease were not observed. The administered T4 caused a positive change in the direction of the L/S ratio and the Clements test. The other amniotic fluid parameters did not change, except the T4 level. The extremely high T4 level obtained 48 hours later gradually became normal several days later. The T4 values obtained from the blood of the mother and the newborn on the 5th postnatal day were normal. In toxemic cases where the induction of labor is vital and there is a risk of IRDS and steroid application in contraindicated, intraamniotic thyroxin is recommended as prophylaxis for IRDS."

CD005253,0,3447940,0,Iodine in contrast agents and skin disinfectants is the major cause for hypothyroidism in premature infants during intensive care.,"In 51 sick newborns the influence of two different nonionic, iodine-containing contrast agents, Amipaque (group 1) and Omnipaque (group 2) and of long-term treatment with polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PVP-I) (group 3) on thyroid function was studied. In the dose given, freshly dissolved Amipaque releases roughly 100 micrograms 'free' iodide/kg body weight; this release may be even higher in the solubilized agent Omnipaque because of increased breakdown. Urinary iodine excretion was elevated in all groups on day 5 after iodine exposure. In group 1, which included 17 term newborns, the median TSH level was normal after 5 days and 2 weeks, only 1 case of transient hypothyrotropinemia was observed; T4 and T3 median levels were in the lower range of normal. In groups 2 and 3, which included 8 preterm infants of 15 newborns and 9 preterm infants of 19 newborns, respectively, the median TSH values were elevated and T4 and T3 levels were very low. Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 6 of the 8 preterm and in 1 of the 7 term newborns of group 2. In group 3, 7 of the 9 preterm and 3 of the 10 term newborns reacted with hypothyroidism. Eight preterm and 3 term newborns had to be substituted with thyroxine. The thyroid function of term newborns was less affected by Amipaque or Omnipaque than by PVP-I. The data show that preterm infants are very sensitive to an iodine load."

CD005253,0,7476285,0,Plasma levels of lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in congenital hypothyroidism: effects of L-thyroxine substitution therapy.,"Thyroid status in humans is an important factor in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism. There are several data on hypothyroidism in the adult population, but less information is available about congenital hypothyroidism. Since lipid metabolism at birth is substantially different from that of adults, it is not likely that the same abnormalities that occur in adult hypothyroidism are also present when this is diagnosed at early life. We studied 16 subjects with congenital hypothyroidism, seven at the time of diagnosis and also after normalization of thyroid hormone levels over a period of 2.0 +/- 1.0 months of substitution therapy with L-thyroxine (5.9 +/- 1.2 micrograms/kg/d) and nine already on L-thyroxine therapy for a period of 4.7 +/- 3.2 months. Thirty-nine apparently healthy subjects matched for age were selected as controls. In all subjects, total cholesterol (CHO), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and B, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] thyrotropin (TSH), (LDL-C), total and free thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) were determined. CHO, HDL-C, and apo A-I levels were significantly higher in patients at the time of diagnosis than in controls (respectively, P = .0079, .0007, and .0004), whereas TG, LDL-C, apo B, and Lp(a) levels were not significantly different. During L-thyroxine substitution therapy in these subjects, HDL-C and apo A-I levels significantly decreased (respectively, by a mean of -36.2% and -24.4%), with similar behavior in all subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD005253,0,22065940,0,Effect of a glutathione S-transferase inhibitor on oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion-induced apoptotic signalling of cultured cardiomyocytes.,"Oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury are crucial in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The antioxidant glutathione S-transferase (GST) is responsible for the high-capacity metabolic inactivation of electrophilic compounds and toxic substrates. The main objective of the present study was to examine the effect of GST inhibition (with the administration of ethacrynic acid [EA]) on the viability and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes when these cells are exposed to various stress components of I/R and mitogen-activated protein kinase (c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]) inhibitors. The primary culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was divided into six experimental groups: control group of cells (group 1), cells exposed to H(2)O(2) (group 2), I/R (group 3), I/R and EA (group 4), H(2)O(2) coupled with EA (group 5), and EA alone (group 6). The viability of cardiomyocytes was determined using a colorimetric MTT assay. The apoptosis ratio was evaluated via fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled annexin V and propidium iodide staining. c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, Akt/protein kinase B and ERK/p42-p44 transcription factors were monitored with flow cytometry. c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation increased due to GST inhibition during I/R. EA administration led to a significant increase in p38 activation following both H(2)O(2) treatment and I/R. ERK phosphorylation increased when GST was exposed to I/R. A pronounced decrease in Akt phosphorylation was observed when cells were cotreated with EA and H(2)O(2). GST plays an important role as a regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in I/R injury."

During the later part of the trial concentration of iodine was increased to 240 mg/ml for cases in which the dorsal region was of particular interest (69 patients) and to 300 mg/ml for 8 cervical studies. The total dose ranged up to 4.8 g and varied between 0.03 g and 0.51 gI/kg body weight. In all patients, neurological examinations were performed before and at 24 h and observations for adverse reactions continued over a period of 48 h. The contrast medium was run up to the foramen magnum or basal cisterns in 128 patients and to the upper dorsal region in the other 20. In the first 62 patients vital studies were performed over the period of the myelogram and for 24 h following, and an additional limited neurological examination was made at 6 h, and in the first 26 cases of the series EEG's were done before and at 24 h after the myelogram. Minor variations in pulse rate and blood pressure were observed but these were not of sufficient magnitude to be of clinical significance. In 7 patients there was minor, generally slow wave abnormality on the EEG taken after the procedure, but no spike or epileptogenic activity was observed. There were no unexpected or severe adverse reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The TGV of the infants and their mothers was determined sonographically in addition to their urinary iodine concentrations 5-7 days postpartum and 3 months later. In ten additional lactating mothers the breast milk concentrations of thyroid hormones and iodine were determined. It was shown that at 3 months of age an infant consuming about 1000 ml breast milk per day receives about 2 micrograms thyroid hormones and 55 micrograms iodine per day. At the end of their first week of life the infants showed a TGV between 0.28 and 1.5 ml (median 0.61 ml) and a urinary iodine concentration between 0.03 and 16.3 micrograms/dl (median 3.0 micrograms/dl). At 3 months of age the TGV of the breast-fed infants had decreased by a median of 0.24 ml (= -34%; median of percentage changes) whereas those fed a formula without iodine had increased by a median of 0.26 ml (= +50%; median of percentage changes). Those receiving an iodine-supplemented formula showed a TGV reduction of 0.14 ml (= +2%; median of percentage changes).

CD005253,0,18941435,0,Mechanisms related to the pathophysiology and management of central hypothyroidism.,"Central hypothyroidism (CH) is defined as hypothyroidism due to insufficient stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH, for which secretion or activity can be impaired at the hypothalamic or pituitary levels. Patients with CH frequently present with multiple other pituitary hormone deficiencies. In addition to classic CH induced by hypothalamic-pituitary tumors or Sheehan syndrome, novel causes include traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage, bexarotene (a retinoid X receptor agonist) therapy, neonates being born to mothers with insufficiently controlled Graves disease, and lymphocytic hypophysitis. Growth hormone therapy, which may be used in children and adults, is now also recognized as a possible cause of unmasking CH in susceptible individuals. In addition, mutations in genes, such as TRHR, POU1F1, PROP1, HESX1, SOX3, LHX3, LHX4 and TSHB, have been associated with CH. The difficulty in making a clear diagnosis of CH is that the serum TSH levels can vary; values are normal in most cases, but in some might be low or slightly elevated. Levels of endogenous T(4) in serum might also be subnormal. Appropriate doses of levothyroxine for T(4) replacement therapy have not been confirmed, but might need to be higher than presently used empirically in patients with CH and should be adjusted according to age and other hormone deficiencies, to achieve free T(4) concentrations in the upper end of the normal range."

She responded dramatically to the administration of cortisol. Initial endocrine evaluation disclosed prolactin (PRL), corticotropin, and thyrotropin (TSH) deficiencies. The patient recovered completely with cortisol and thyroid hormone therapy and was delivered of a healthy male child at term. Endocrine reevaluations one week and six months postpartum disclosed luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, PRL, corticotropin, and probable TSH deficiencies. The cause of this panhypopituitarism has not been determined. This case suggests that the appropriate initial treatment for spontaneous symptomatic hypoglycemia in pregnancy, while awaiting further endocrine evaluation, is the administration of cortisol."
CD005253,0,3640335,0,Serum thyroglobulin levels in preterm infants with and without respiratory distress syndrome. II. A longitudinal study during the first 3 weeks of life.,"Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured in 182 preterm and term infants. Samples were taken from cord blood, and at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after birth. The infants were divided into groups according to their perinatal characteristics: infants who were appropriate for gestational age, infants who were small for gestational age, and preterm infants who developed respiratory distress syndrome. These groups were subdivided according to gestation age. Tg serum levels showed a significant increase in the 1st day in all groups, and decreased significantly after about 1 wk. The highest Tg levels were found in the 1st wk of life in respiratory distress syndrome infants, and in infants with the lowest gestation ages. TSH levels increased at day 1 but only in appropriate and small for gestational age infants of more than 30 wk of gestation. TSH levels at day 1 in the groups with gestation ages of less than 30 wk and in respiratory distress syndrome infants of more than 30 wk were low, reflecting a low TSH surge. We conclude that the neonatal increase of Tg is not merely caused by the TSH surge. We suggest that the Tg increase is due to an impaired degradation of Tg, and/or to hemoconcentration, which are more pronounced in respiratory distress syndrome infants compared with appropriate for gestational age infants."

CD005253,0,8957746,0,Anemia in infants with congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed by neonatal screening.,"Although anemia is a common finding in adult hypothyroid patients, there are no studies on anemia in hypothyroid infants. The aim of this study, therefore, was to review the hematologic status during the first year of life in 50 infants with congenital hypothyroidism detected through the regional neonatal screening program. The mean age at diagnosis was 23.7 +/- 6.5 days and treatment was initially begun with a mean L-thyroxine dose of 6.8 +/- 1.3 micrograms/kg/day. Clinical and haematological assessments were performed at diagnosis, 3, 6 and 12 months of age. The patients were divided in 2 groups based on whether T4 serum concentration at diagnosis was < 3 micrograms/dl (Group A) or > or = 3 micrograms/dl (Group B). Data for hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), red cells count (RCC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), serum iron and ferritin were expressed as Standard Deviation Score (SDS). Although at diagnosis the mean value of Hb-SDS, Ht-SDS and RCC-SDS were in the low-normal range in both groups, at 3 months of age the values in Group A (Hb -1.9 +/- 0.79; Ht -2.34 +/- 1.02; RCC -1.56 +/- 1.25) were significantly lower than in Group B (Hb -1.14 +/- 0.78, p < 0.005; Ht -1.59 +/- 0.94, p < 0.05; RCC -0.55 +/- 1.32, p < 0.02). A rise of the Hb, Ht and RCC values was observed in both groups from 6 to 12 months. The mean values of MCV-SDS and MCH-SDS were in the normal range at diagnosis in both groups, decrease progressively at 3 and 6 months and returned to normal at 12 months of age; no differences were found between the 2 groups at any time. Mean Hb levels at 3 months of age were correlated with mean serum T4 at diagnosis (r = 0.30, p < 0.05). The present results indicate that anemia is a frequent finding in infants with congenital hypothyroidism and is depended on the degree of neonatal hypothyroidism and imply that hypothyroidism during development may produce persisting changes even after thyroid replacement has begun."
CD005253,0,3936914,0,Amniotic fluid thyrotropin (TSH) following maternal administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone.,"Cord blood and amniotic fluid thyrotropin (TSH), T4, T3, and rT3 concentrations were measured in 49 women who received 400 micrograms thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) iv during labor and in 16 control women who received saline. Cord blood serum TSH concentrations were elevated for as long as 4 hours after TRH administration and peak values (38.0 +/- 4.2 microU/ml) were observed from 61-120 minutes after TSH as compared to control values of 5.0 +/- 0.3 microU/ml. The elevations in fetal TSH concentration stimulated the fetal thyroid, resulting in a progressive increase in cord blood T4 and T3 but not rT3 concentrations. These TRH induced elevations in fetal cord blood TSH concentrations were not accompanied by increases in unconcentrated and 4 fold concentrated amniotic fluid TSH concentrations which were almost always below 0.6 microU/ml, the limit of assay sensitivity. Unconcentrated amniotic fluid T4 concentrations were barely detectable and no variation was observed between the TRH treated and saline treated mothers; amniotic fluid T3 was not detectable in any of the groups; and amniotic fluid rT3 concentrations ranged between 46.4 and 55.6 ng/dl and did not differ between groups. These findings suggest that term amniotic fluid TSH values do not reflect transient but marked elevations in fetal serum TSH concentrations and that amniotic fluid TSH determination is probably not useful in the detection of primary fetal hypothyroidism. It is possible, but unlikely, that long-term and even greater elevations in fetal serum TSH concentrations would result in increased amniotic fluid TSH concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Children were delivered after uncomplicated pregnancies (except hypothyroxinemia), had birth weights of at least 2,500 grams, and were excluded when postnatal insults intervened. At 8 months and 4 years progeny of inadequately treated hypothyroxinemic women had the lowest psychological scores. Now 246 7-year-old children have been examined psychologically and neurologically (earlier data on only 101). Definite trends and a few statistically lower psychological scores of progeny of inadequately treated hypothyroxinemic pregnant women are compared with better psychological scores of 7-year-old children born to euthyroid and adequately treated hypothyroxinemic women. In six sibling sets outcome was better when hypothyroxinemic women were treated with adequate thyroid replacement therapy.

CD005253,0,20435718,0,The impact of transient hypothyroidism on the increasing rate of congenital hypothyroidism in the United States.,"The reported incidence rate of primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) has been increasing in the United States over the past 2 decades. We have considered the possibility that the inclusion of cases of transient hypothyroidism has inflated the reported incidence rate of CH. Assessing the effects of cases of transient hypothyroidism on the incidence rate is problematic, because the definitions, diagnostic criteria, and differentiation from transient hyperthyrotropinemia vary widely among state newborn screening programs. Among the 4 etiologies for transient hypothyroidism (maternal thyrotropin receptor-blocking antibodies, exposure to maternal antithyroid medications, iodine deficiency, and iodine excess), there is little evidence of increases in the incidence rate from thyrotropin receptor-blocking antibodies. Exposure to antithyroid drugs could contribute significantly to the incidence rate of transient CH, given the high estimated incidence of active maternal hyperthyroidism. Iodine deficiency or excess in the United States seems unlikely to have contributed significantly to the incidence rate of CH, because the secular trend toward lower iodine intake among women of reproductive age in the 1980s and 1990s seems to have plateaued, and perinatal iodine exposure has presumably declined as a result of recommendations to discontinue using iodine-containing disinfectants. Although the female-to-male sex ratio among newborns with thyroid agenesis or dysgenesis (the most common causes of CH) is typically 2:1, analysis of the sex ratio of newborns diagnosed with presumed CH in the United States suggests that a substantial proportion might have transient hypothyroidism or hyperthyrotropinemia, because the sex ratio has been well below the expected 2:1 ratio. Combined ultrasonography and (123)I scintigraphy of the thyroid gland are effective tools for identifying cases of thyroid agenesis and dysgenesis and can help to differentiate cases of transient hypothyroidism from true CH. Imaging is also a vital component in evaluating children who, at 3 years of age, undergo a trial of discontinuation of levothyroxine treatment to test for persistence of hypothyroidism. Ultimately, thyroid gland imaging, in conjunction with long-term follow-up studies that appropriately assess and report whether there was permanence of hypothyroidism, will be necessary to address the true incidence rate of CH and any contribution to the observed rate by transient cases of hypothyroidism or hyperthyrotropinemia."

Vaginal infections, frequently observed in pregnancy, can led to maternal and fetal complications, thus Betadine should be used both for prevention and therapy. One can ask if iodine absorbed from the vagina can influence the fetal thyroid function? 64 pregnant women received 7 day Betadine suppository (200 mg polyvidonum-iodine PVP) treatment for colpitis on 37-40 gestational week with excellent therapeutic result. TSH levels were measured by immunoassay in the serum of newborns 4-5 days after delivery, no signs of hypothyroidism were observed. Authors recommended 7 day Betadine vaginal suppository regimen for the prevention of intrauterine infections, treatment of mixed (bacterial, mycotical) vaginal infections, and restoration of the normal vaginal equilibrium of bacterias, since the risk of hypothyroidism is negligeable in mature newborns. In case of prematurity hypothyroidism is more frequently found also without iodine treatment therefore TSH level control is recommended in each case."

Such limited progress is not attributed to a lack of scientific knowledge about the prevalence, causes or consequences of iron deficiency, but to limited implementation of effective interventions and ineffective communication tools. The challenge is to coordinate and balance research efforts more constructively with the implementation of practical and effective intervention programs. More attention must be paid to evaluating the operational feasibility of various intervention strategies to demonstrate their effectiveness under normal field conditions. Moreover, intervention efforts must be supported by substantially increased attention to communications to achieve effective advocacy for policy support and resource mobilization, foster partnerships and alliances, clarify priority target groups, including infants and young children, and support behavioral change. Through collaboration, researchers, program implementers and communicators can achieve substantial progress in reducing iron deficiency."

CD005253,0,8104016,0,Transient congenital hypothyroidism due to maternal thyrotrophin binding inhibiting immunoglobulin.,"Transient congenital hypothyroidism due to maternal thyrotrophin binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII), a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-receptor blocking antibody, is described in three male siblings born to a mother with autoimmune thyroiditis. These cases are believed to be the first described in Australia. The first child was found to have a serum TSH of 565 mU/L and had a negative thyroid scan when presented for neonatal screening. He was treated with thyroxine but became thyrotoxic at 3 months of age when he was on a dosage of 85 micrograms/m2 of body surface area. He was euthyroid 6 months after discontinuation of therapy. Nine years later a second hypothyroid sibling was born, with a serum TSH of 709 mU/L on day 4. Both mother and child were demonstrated to be strongly positive for TBII. Again this child was able to cease therapy by the age of 9 months. A third sibling, also TBII positive, was born 12 months after the second. His TSH was 90 mU/L and his serum thyroxine (T4) was 169 nmol/L. On this occasion, thyroid stimulation-blocking antibody was found to be present in the serum of both mother and child. Thyroxine therapy was ceased at 1 month. The family present a picture of varying degrees of transient neonatal hypothyroidism due to the transplacental passage of a maternal receptor blocking antibody. The condition is self-limiting, resolving when the immunoglobulin is cleared from the infant's circulation."
CD005253,0,3716756,0,Human foetal prolactin but not thyrotropin secretion is decreased by bromocriptine.,"In the adult, dopamine inhibits prolactin (Prl) secretion and less so thyrotropin (TSH) release. Little information is available concerning the role of dopaminergic stimuli in the regulation of TSH and Prl secretion in the term human foetus. The dopamine agonist, bromocriptine (5 mg), or placebo were randomly administered orally to 120 pregnant women during labour. Maternal and foetal cord blood was obtained at parturition and analyzed for Prl, TSH, T4, T3 and rT3 concentrations. Since the time of parturition is unpredictable, maternal and cord blood hormone values were grouped at intervals of time from the time of bromocriptine or placebo administration to delivery. Hormone values were compared between the bromocriptine and placebo groups by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Bromocriptine markedly inhibited maternal serum Prl concentrations compared to values in the placebo treated women (P less than 0.001) and this decrease was more marked as the time interval between bromocriptine administration and delivery increased (P less than 0.001, regression analysis). Cord blood Prl was also significantly lower in newborns whose mothers received bromocriptine (P less than 0.001). Bromocriptine significantly inhibited maternal serum TSH concentrations as compared to values in women treated with placebo (P less than 0.006). In contrast, bromocriptine administration did not affect cord blood TSH concentrations. These findings suggest that bromocriptine crosses the term human placenta and suppresses foetal Prl secretion. In contrast to the small inhibition of TSH secretion in pregnant women, bromocriptine does not affect foetal TSH secretion suggesting that regulation of TSH secretion in the term foetus may not be under dopaminergic control."

CD005253,0,16042141,0,[The thyroid as a model for molecular mechanisms in genetic diseases].,"Thyroid diseases constitute a heterogeneous collection of abnormalities associated with mutations in genes responsible for the development of thyroid: thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), thyroid transcriptions factor-2 (TTF-2) and PAX8, or in one of the genes coding for the proteins involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis such as thyroglobulin (TG), thyroperoxidase (TPO), hydrogen peroxide-generating system (DUOX2), sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), pendrin (PDS), TSH and TSH receptor (TSHr). Congenital hypothyroidism occurs with a prevalence of 1 in 4000 newborns. Patients with this syndrome can be divided into two groups: nongoitrous (dysem/bryogenesis) or goitrous (dyshormonogenesis) congenital hypothyroidism. The dysembryogenesis group, which accounts for 85% of the cases, results from ectopy, agenesis and hypoplasia. In a minority of these patients, the congenital hypothyroidism is associated with mutations in TTF-1, TTF-2, PAX-8, TSH or TSHr genes. The presence of congenital goiter (15% of the cases) has been linked to mutations in the NIS, TG, TPO, DUOX2 or PDS genes. The congenital hypothyroidism with dyshormonogenesis is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. Somatic mutations of the TSHr have been identified in hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas. Another established thyroid disease is the resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). It is a syndrome of reduced tissue responsiveness to hormonal action caused by mutations located in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) gene. Mutant TRbetas interfere with the function of the wild-type receptor by a dominant negative mechanism. In conclusion, the identification of mutations in the thyroid expression genes has provided important insights into structure-function relationships. The thyroid constitutes an excellent model for the molecular study of genetic diseases."

CD005253,0,19766503,0,"Influence of two perfusion strategies on oxygen metabolism in paediatric cardiac surgery. Evaluation of the high-flow, low-resistance technique.","Paediatric cardiac surgery is often performed under hypothermic conditions, that is, with a reduced core body temperature. Certain interventions even require the circulation to be stopped. This can only be done at a body temperature of 18 degrees C, with no risk of neurological damage and harm to the brain and other organs. Vasoconstriction is a natural reaction of the body to cold, causing the blood vessels to contract. Such a reaction would lead to a clear rise in blood pressure on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Since the blood pressure is regulated in the arteriolar loop of the capillary system, there is a marked increase in blood pressure and a suppression of free water into the surrounding tissue, which, in turn, may lead to the intra-operative development of oedemas. This study aimed to investigate whether the high-flow, low-resistance (HFLR) technique offers any benefits over conventional methods."
CD005253,0,9212042,0,L-thyroxine treatment of preterm newborns: clinical and endocrine effects.,"Preterm newborns have low serum thyroxine (T4) levels compared with late-gestational fetuses. Low thyroid hormone levels are associated with increased severity of neonatal illness and neurodevelopmental dysfunction. We assessed the endocrine and clinical effects of increasing serum T4 levels in preterm newborns with a gestational age <31 wk. Forty newborns were randomized in a double blind protocol: 20 infants received a daily dose of 20 microg/kg L-T4 for 2 wk, whereas 20 control infants received saline. Serum concentrations of T4, triiodothyronine (T3), reverse T3 (rT3), thyroglobulin (TG), and TSH were measured weekly as well as serum levels of GH, prolactin, and IGF-I. After 2 wk, a TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) test was performed. Neonatal illness and outcome was evaluated by noting heart rate, oxygen requirement, duration of ventilation, development of chronic lung disease, oral fluid intake, and weight gain; a Bayley score was done at the corrected age of 7 mo. L-T4 administration induced a marked increase in serum T4 without apparent change in T3 levels, whereas the postnatal decline in serum rT3 was more gradual. L-T4 treatment was associated with a decrease in serum TG and TSH levels. TRH injection induced a definite rise in serum TSH and T3 in controls, but not in L-T4 treated newborns. Neither L-T4 treatment, nor TRH administration appeared to alter circulating levels of prolactin, GH, or IGF-I. In contrast to the pronounced endocrine effects, no clinical effects of L-T4 administration were detected."
CD005253,0,15629961,0,Neonatal thyrotoxicosis and persistent pulmonary hypertension necessitating extracorporeal life support.,"We report a case of neonatal Graves' disease involving an infant with severe persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) associated with neonatal thyrotoxicosis that necessitated extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Hyperthyroidism, although uncommon in the newborn period, has been associated with pulmonary hypertension among adults. The exact mechanisms responsible for this effect on pulmonary vascular pressure are not well understood. Recent studies have provided evidence that thyrotoxicosis has direct and indirect effects on pulmonary vascular maturation, metabolism of endogenous pulmonary vasodilators, oxygen economy, vascular smooth muscle reactivity, and surfactant production, all of which may contribute to the pathophysiologic development of PPHN. Therefore, because PPHN is a significant clinical entity among term newborns and the symptoms of hyperthyroidism may be confused initially with those of other underlying disorders associated with PPHN (eg, sepsis), it would be prudent to perform screening for hyperthyroidism among affected newborns."
CD005253,0,2040919,0,Intellectual development in children with congenital hypothyroidism in relation to recommended thyroxine treatment.,"The relationship between the treatment serum thyroxine level and intellectual development at 2 and 6 years was investigated in 46 Norwegian children with congenital hypothyroidism identified by neonatal screening. The level of serum thyroxine during the first 2 years was positively correlated with the Mental Development Index at 2 years of age (Bayley Scales of Infant Development) and the Verbal IQ at 6 years of age (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence). Children with a mean serum thyroxine level greater than 180 nmol/L (14 micrograms/dl) during the first year had a significantly higher Mental Development Index at 2 years and Verbal IQ at 6 years than children with serum thyroxine values less than 129 nmol/L (10 micrograms/dl). Boys had a lower Mental Development Index at 2 years of age than girls (86.9 vs 105.1; p less than 0.001) and a higher frequency of elevated serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone during the first year (p = 0.001). No signs of toxic effects of a high hormone level at the time of IQ assessment were detected. However, high serum levels of thyroxine at ages 2 to 4 years in girls were related to lower Performance IQ at age 6 years. The results demonstrate that the serum level of thyroxine is of importance in relation to intellectual development. Thyroxine levels above the upper reference range during the first 2 years were related to best intellectual development at 2 and 6 years."

CD005253,0,2226557,0,Relationship between mode of delivery and neonatal calcium homeostasis.,"Serum levels of calcium (Ca), calcitonin (CT) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were determined in cord blood of 229 newborns. In 136 newborns the tests were repeated 24 h later. The probands were divided into four groups according to mode of delivery: (1) spontaneous; (2) elective caesarean section without labour; (3) elective caesarean section in labour; (4) emergency caesarean section with fetal distress. Newborns in group 2 had significantly lower Ca and CT levels and significantly higher PTH concentrations in cord blood than the other three groups. In all groups Ca and PTH concentrations were negatively correlated. At 24 h, mean Ca levels had decreased and mean CT and PTH concentrations had increased in all four groups. Newborns in group 2 still had lower Ca levels but higher CT and PTH concentrations. At that time there were negative correlations between Ca and CT levels in groups 1 and 2 and between Ca and PTH concentrations in group 1. These data demonstrate that without labour, cord blood Ca and CT levels are lower and PTH concentrations are higher. The low 24 h calcium in newborns delivered without labour is explained by the lower Ca levels at birth and a tremendous increase of CT. The PTH secretion in full-term newborns is very substantial and negatively correlated with Ca levels."

The drugs markedly depressed thyroxine (T4) concentration in maternal and umbilical cord sera, and partly depressed TSH in maternal and umbilical artery sera and GH in umbilical artery sera, but not triiodothyronine (T3) or reverse T3 (r-T3) concentration. The effect of antiepileptic drugs on T4 concentration in maternal serum was not influenced by pregnancy. Ratios of hormone levels in maternal serum compared with those in umbilical cord serum revealed a pattern similar to that seen in normal pregnant women. They suggest that transplacental passage of TSH, thyroid hormone, and GH are not markedly affected by antiepileptic drugs."

CD005253,0,9200277,0,Iodine nutrition in Sudan: determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone in filter paper blood samples.,"In this study we examined the technique of measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on filter paper blood samples for use in evaluating the iodine nutrition status of newborns and adults living in iodine-deficient areas. Filter paper blood samples were obtained between the 5th and 7th day after birth from 103, 43 and 103 term newborns living in Khartoum (mild iodine deficiency), Kosti (moderate iodine deficiency) and Darfur (severe iodine deficiency), respectively. TSH was measured with a commercial assay and the levels were compared with those obtained with the same method in 1147 samples from term Swedish newborns, obtained on the 3rd to the 5th day of life. The mean (95% confidence interval) TSH levels of the three Sudanese groups and the Swedish group were 7.1 (4.8-9.4), 8.3 (6.6-10.1), 11.9 (0.9-22.9) and 4.51 (3.8-5.3) mU l-1, respectively. The mean TSH for all three Sudanese groups was higher than the Swedish mean (p < 0.001). TSH levels determined in filter paper blood samples from adults living in an iodine-deficient area showed a correlation (p < 0.001; r = 0.55) to levels in corresponding serum samples (range 0.52-14.1 mU l-1, median 3.4 mU l-1). No significant correlation was found, however, between blood spot levels and serum levels within the reference range (< 5 mU l-1). A modification of the commercial procedure consisting in using three instead of two monoclonal antibodies did not sufficiently improve the assay for measurements of TSH within the reference range. Thus, there is a need to develop the filter paper technique further to make it a useful test for monitoring iodine deficiency in populations expected to have TSH levels close to the reference range. In the examination of neonates, however, with their birth-induced surge of TSH, the current assay promises to be a convenient tool for discovering iodine deficiency within a community."
CD005253,0,15839226,0,[Optimization of antibacterial therapy in operated neonates on the basis of early diagnosis of septic complications].,"The paper is based on the results obtained during examination and intensive care in 175 neonatal infants operated on for various malformations who were treated in the pediatric intensive care unit, Moscow Regional Research Institute of Clinical Studies, in 1998 to 2000. Analyzing the results has indicated that 24% of the patients have signs of early sepsis just within the first 24 postoperative hours. The marker procalcitonin was determined in 75 neonatal infants. The studies performed lead to the conclusion that procalcitonin is a highly sensitive and specific marker of sepsis by which postoperative septic complications can be diagnosed in the early periods. The early diagnosis of sepsis, by using the marker procalcitonin permitted timely rational correction of antibiotic therapy, which improved the basic parameters of treatment and reduced deaths from septic complications from 48 to 36%."
CD005253,0,20231136,0,[Severe circulatory insufficiency in a patient with neonatal hyperthyroidism].,"Authors describe a case of a premature infant whose mother had a history of thyroidectomy due to Graves' disease and her hormonal status was not controlled during pregnancy. She did not receive prenatal care and on 33rd week the premature infant was delivered by emergency cesarean section because of fetal tachycardia and imminent intrauterine asphyxia. The infant with a weight of 1350 gram (percentile <10) was dysmature and had a large struma. The newborn received both conventional and high frequency ventilation for respiratory insufficiency and was treated with beta-blocker, digoxin and dobutamine for severe tachycardia (>180/min) and cardiac decompensation. Further examinations proved cardiomegaly, pericardial fluid, severe pulmonary hypoplasia, mitral- and tricuspid insufficiency and hepatosplenomegaly. The level of free thyroid hormones was several times higher than normal (fT4: > 6 ng/dl, fT3 > 30 pg/ml), while TSH level was 0. Respiratory support was required for 7 days, inotropic support for 10 days; at the same time propranolol and K-iodide were administered. Eventually, the tachycardia settled and beta-blocker therapy was continued with reduced doses. Finally, the thyroid hormone levels became normal. Authors emphasize that newborns of women suffering from Graves' disease can significantly lag behind in weight increase, may have severe circulatory insufficiency and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. We also emphasize the importance of the monitoring maternal hormone levels and antibody titers."
CD005253,0,19142837,0,[Thyroid disorders during pregnancy].,"Thyroid disorders may not only be the cause infertility but also increases the incidence of miscarriages and the morbidity of the pregnancies. During pregnancy the demand of thyroid hormones increases to about 30 - 50 % and the thyroid has to cope with this increase. In Germany the iodine intake has improved significantly during the last 20 years, but still is borderline low with an mean intake of about 120 microg iodide per day. Therefore it is still recommended that pregnant women are supplemented with about 100 - 150 microg of iodide during pregnancy and the time of breast-feeding, to avoid hypothyroidism of the foetus with concomitant delay of the brain development. Not only women with subclinical hypothyroidism, but only elevated TPO antibodies have a significant increase in early miscarriage and preterm delivery. An early supplementation with Levothyroxin despite euthyroidism might reduce these risks. Those women also more frequently develop postpartum thyroiditis. This risk can be reduced by a supplementation with selenium during and after pregnancy. Graves' disease is a rare disorder and only about 0,1 - 0,4 pregnancies are affected. The course of the disease is biphasic, with an exacerbation within the first trimester and an improvement thereafter, but a recurrence after delivery. Overt thyrotoxicosis has to be treated with propylthiouracil, to maintain euthyroidism during pregnancy. The TSH receptor antibodies are transferred to the foetus with the risk of thyrotoxicosis. Special care of the foetus is therefore necessary. Transient mild hyperthyroidism may occur in women with very high HCG levels during the first three months of pregnancy. This often is associated with hyperemesis gravidarum. Subclinical hypothyroidism of the mother will disturb the normal development of the foetus and therefore has to be treated even when TSH is within the upper normal level. Special care is necessary in women with elevated TPO antibodies, because these more often develop postpartum thyroiditis."

CD005253,0,25288580,0,Diagnosis and management of subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy.,"In prospective studies, the prevalence of undiagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnant women ranges from 3% to 15%. Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with multiple adverse outcomes in the mother and fetus, including spontaneous abortion, pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and decreased IQ in the offspring. Only two prospective studies have evaluated the impact of levothyroxine therapy in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism, and the results were mixed. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised thyrotropin combined with a normal serum free thyroxine level. The normal range of thyrotropin varies according to geographic region and ethnic background. In the absence of local normative data, the recommended upper limit of thyrotropin in the first trimester of pregnancy is 2.5 mIU/L, and 3.0 mIU/L in the second and third trimester. The thyroid gland needs to produce 50% more thyroid hormone during pregnancy to maintain a euthyroid state. Consequently, most women on levothyroxine therapy before pregnancy require an increase in dose when pregnant to maintain euthyroidism. Ongoing prospective trials that are evaluating the impact of levothyroxine therapy on adverse outcomes in the mother and fetus in women with subclinical hypothyroidism will provide crucial data on the role of thyroid hormone replacement in pregnancy."
CD005253,0,19476565,0,A case of WHIM syndrome associated with diabetes and hypothyroidism.,"The WHIM syndrome is a rare immunological disorder characterized by warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis. We hypothesized that immunological or genetic mechanisms may link WHIM syndrome and type 1 diabetes. We report that the young girl with WHIM syndrome developed diabetes and transient hypothyroidism. A nonsense mutation (C-->T) truncating the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domain occurred at nucleotide position 1000(R334X) of the CXCR4 gene in one allele of the patient was identified, and the person was diagnosed as having WHIM syndrome. Recent observation suggested that the CXCR4, a G-protein-coupled receptor with a unique ligand, CXCL12, might be involved in the pathogenesis for type 1 diabetes. Taken into consideration the concurrent prevalence of the two disorders and the speculated common pathogenesis associated with the CXCR4, our patient may enable us to understand the genetic damage related to accelerated apoptosis."

The C-cells were concentrated in a zone in the upper two-thirds of the lateral lobes bilaterally, where they were identified individually and in small groups in both an intrafollicular and parafollicular distribution. In contrast to findings in the adult, C-cells were predominantly intrafollicular in the neonate. The relative numbers of C-cells counted per unit area of thyroid tissue correlated strongly with the calcitonin content of immediately adjacent tissue sections. In areas rich in C-cells, as many as 75 immunoperoxidase-stained cells per low-power field were counted, and the concentration of calcitonin was as high as 540 to 2100 mU/g fresh weight, values that were as great as 10 times those observed in the normal adult thyroid gland. The prominence of the C-cell population and increased tissue calcitonin content in the human neonatal thyroid gland may reflect an as yet undefined physiologic role for calcitonin in the newborn."

No significant variation in vital signs and neurologic status was recorded during and up to 72 hours after the examination. Psychic agitation was the major effect registered, being clearly related to the type of procedure used. A significant reduction of untoward side effects (about 50%) was observed using the lower concentrations of the medium. Iopamidol 150 mg and 200 mg represented the optimal concentration for CT enhancement, these concentrations reducing artifacts; the 300 mg I/ml concentration gave best results in conventional radiology. It seems that the lower concentrations of iopamidol (200 and 150 mg I/ml) can be usefully employed in pediatric neuroradiology, with preserved contrast and dramatically reduced untoward reactions."

However, the underlying physiological mechanisms for these ill-effects are not fully understood. Smoke exposure may affect various metabolic and biological processes, including hormone biosynthesis and secretion, interfere with thyroid hormone release, binding, transport, storage, and clearance, associated with adverse effects on the thyroid resulting in changes in circulating hormone concentrations. We measured and compared serum thyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in active, passive, and nonsmokers and determined their association with cigarette tobacco smoke exposure. We use a comprehensive approach to assess the interrelationships between active and passive tobacco smoke exposure and thyroid hormone levels by employing innovative hormone analysis techniques."

We selected 195 babies born between 1988 and 1996. TBII indices in the sera of these newborns and their mothers were tested at some time from Day 1 to Day 30 after birth, and followed up after that. The subjects were divided into four groups according to the TBII index. Group 1 consisted of 17 pairs of mothers and newborns who both had serum TBII indices greater than or equal to 15%, including four transiently hyperthyroid and 13 transiently hypothyroid newborns. Group 2 comprised 166 pairs who both had a TBII index less than 15%, including one euthyroid and 165 hypothyroid newborns. Eight of the 165 warranted permanent thyroxine therapy due to athyreosis or ectopic thyroid gland. Group 3 consisted of one pair in which the newborn's serum TBII index was 15% or higher but the mother's was less than 15%: the newborn was transiently hypothyroid. Group 4 comprised 11 pairs in which the newborns' serum TBII indices were greater than or equal to 15% but the mothers' were less than 15%. These 11 newborns were all transiently hypothyroid and nine of them warranted transient thyroxine replacement therapy. The results suggest that the long-term outcome of newborns is good when TBII indices are at least 15% in the mother and child because their thyroid dysfunction seems to be related to the transient presence of the transplacental TBII from the mother. When TBII indices in both mother and child are less than 15%, the newborns warrant further investigation due to the likelihood of permanent hypothyroidism."

In this study, concentrations of various iodothyronines were measured in sera from neonates of various postconceptional age (PA). Results obtained in cord sera at birth (PA, 24-40 weeks), reflecting the fetal pattern, were compared with those found during extrauterine life in newborns of 5 days or more of postnatal life (PA, 27-46 weeks). The main findings are: Starting at 30 weeks of PA, serum levels increase linearly during extrauterine life; and at 40 weeks, they are more than 200% of those measured in cord sera from newborns of equivalent PA. Serum reverse T3 (rT3) levels during fetal life are higher than those measured during extrauterine life; but they significantly decrease, starting at 30 weeks of PA.

It is known that PI is absorbed by the skin after application. Absorption is even greater in infants, as their skin is thinner and more permeable. Iodine absorption in the orbita, neck and during abdominal surgery has been previously investigated, but such a study has not been performed for the pleura, which has a greater area and capacity for absorption. In this study, we investigated the effect of intraoperative povidone-iodine lavage on thyroid hormones during thoracic surgery."

The thyroxine level decreased in the maternal serum and in the cord blood, and the thyrotropin level also became lower in the epileptic mother taking antiepileptic drugs. The growth hormone level in the umbilical vein sample of the epileptic mother was lower than that in the controls. The correlations between the head circumference of an infant at delivery and the decreased levels of the hormones seemed to indicate that a decrease in the thyroxine level, caused by antiepileptic drugs, produced the foetal head growth retardation."

The treated group had a T3/T4 ratio significantly higher than the control group (mean +/- SD: 124.10 +/- 23.70 vs. 96.09 +/- 18.11, p less than 0.005) and T3 slightly increased (mean +/- SD nmol/l 2.48 +/- 0.69 vs. 1.95 +/- 0.56). The mean serum values of the other parameters studied, TSH, T4, fT4, fT3, were not significantly different in either groups. Since beta-mimetics induces deiodinating activity of the liver and propranolol reduces extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3, it was suggested that ritodrine enhances deiondinating activity of fetal and neonatal liver."
CD005253,0,9768678,0,Low growth hormone-binding protein in infants with congenital hypothyroidism.,"We evaluated the circulating levels of GH, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), GH-binding protein (GHBP), and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) before L-T4 therapy in 19 infants with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), aged 12-29 days, diagnosed by neonatal screening and in a group of age- and sex-matched control infants. The same parameters were reevaluated after several months of treatment. Serum GHBP was measured by the high performance liquid chromatography-gel filtration method; serum GH, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 levels were determined by commercial kits. The hypothyroid patients, before beginning therapy, presented significantly lower GHBP values than controls (P < 0.0001); during treatment, these values increased significantly; however, after 6 months they were still significantly lower than control values (P < 0.01). The pretreatment levels of GH were not significantly different from control values; after 1 month of treatment, GH did not show the decrease observed in controls and, therefore, was significantly higher (P < 0.01). The pretreatment levels of IGF-I were not significantly different from control values, but were lower in patients with severe than in those with mild hypothyroidism. They decreased at about 4 months of life and became significantly lower than control values at about 7 months of age (P < 0.05). In conclusion, it may be hypothesized that the condition of CH induces a change in GHBP expression, perhaps beginning in fetal life. The intrauterine production of IGF-I seems to be independent of the levels of GHBP and partially affected by fetal thyroid function."
CD005253,0,15858112,0,Screening for thyroid disease in pregnancy.,"Although gestational hyperthyroidism is uncommon (0.2%), hypothyroidism (autoimmune disease or suboptimal iodine intake) occurs in 2.5% of women and is predictive of reduced neonatal and child neuropsychological development and maternal obstetric complications. Postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) occurs in 5-9% of women and is associated with antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (antiTPOAb) in 10% of women in early pregnancy. Therefore, screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy should be considered. T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone measurements could be used to screen for hypothyroidism, which would require levothyroxine intervention treatment. T4 supply is crucial to fetal nervous system maturation; currently, the recommended daily iodine intake is 200 microg, and this is not always achieved, even in the UK. At present, a randomised prospective trial is ongoing to provide the evidence base for this screening strategy. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to (a) optimise iodine nutrition during pregnancy; (b) ascertain women with known thyroid disease; (c) identify women at increased risk of thyroid disease-for example, those with other autoimmune diseases. PPTD can be predicted by measurement of antiTPOAb in early gestation."

CD005253,0,25231449,0,Iodine deficiency in children.,"Iodine is an essential trace mineral, required for the production of thyroid hormone. Iodine deficiency may result in goiter, hypothyroidism, miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, infant and neonatal mortality, and impaired growth. Adequate thyroid hormone is critically important for normal growth and neurodevelopment in fetal life, infancy and childhood. The population iodine status is most commonly assessed using median urinary iodine concentration values, but goiter prevalence (determined by palpation or by ultrasound), serum thyroglobulin levels, and neonatal thyroid-stimulating hormone values can also be used. Universal salt iodization programs have been the mainstay of public health efforts to eliminate iodine deficiency worldwide. However, in some regions targeted fortification of foods such as bread has been used to combat iodine deficiency. Iodine supplementation may be required in areas where dietary fortification is not feasible or where it is not sufficient for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women. Although international public health efforts over the past several decades have been highly effective, nearly one third of children worldwide remain at risk for iodine deficiency, and iodine deficiency is considered the leading preventable cause of preventable intellectual deficits."

Estimated intakes based on the mean and median (50th percentile) levels of the elements in the foods were similar, except for iodine for which intake estimates based on mean values exceeded those based on median values. The high concentration of iodine in some foods resulted in higher mean (than median) values. Estimated intakes of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, selenium, and iodine met or nearly met dietary intake standards set by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). Estimated intakes of copper were below NAS standards for all eight age-sex groups. Estimated intakes were below NAS standards for magnesium for six age-sex groups, calcium and zinc for five age-sex groups, iron for three age-sex groups, and manganese for one age-sex group. The diets of teenage girls had seven elements below NAS standards, the diets of adult women had five elements below NAS standards, and the diets of 2-year-olds and older men and women had four elements each below NAS standards. The estimated intake of sodium for 6-11-month-old infants showed a decreasing trend from 729 mg/day in 1982/83 to 632 mg/day in 1990/91.

Longitudinal study on urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in each trimester as well as comparison between women with iodine insufficiency (<150 mcg L(-1) ) and iodine sufficiency was conducted. Pregnant women without thyroid diseases who had not received iodine supplementation were recruited for UIC measurements in each trimester and were followed up for pregnancy outcomes. In the analysis of 384, 325 and 221 samples in the first, second and third trimester, the medians of UICs were 147.39, 157.01 and 153.07 mcg L(-1) , respectively. Of 399 women, 174 (43.6%) had a UIC less than 150 mcg L(-1) (suggesting iodine insufficiency) and 225 (56.4%) had a UIC greater than or equal to 150 mcg L(-1) (suggesting iodine sufficiency). Of 390 women with availability of the final outcomes, 171 and 219 in the insufficiency and sufficiency group, respectively, the rates of preterm birth and low birthweight were significantly higher in the insufficiency group, 17.5% vs. 10.0% (P = 0.031) and 19.9% vs. 12.3% (P = 0.042), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that iodine status was an independent risk of preterm birth and low birthweight. Finally, women with a UIC <100 mcg L(-1) had a significantly higher rate of fetal growth restriction, 13/68 vs. 30/322 (P = 0.031). In northern Thailand, a great number of pregnant women had a median UIC less than 150 mcg L(-1) and they had a higher risk of preterm birth and low birthweight.

CD005253,0,7527990,0,Thyroxine excess and pregnancy.,"Pregnancy is characterised by a physiological increase in bound thyroxine but normal values of free hormone. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG may stimulate the thyroid to produce hyperemesis gravidarum (with mild to moderate hyperthyroidism) or result in high thyroid hormone levels associated with gestational trophoblastic disease. Hyperthyroidism occurring during pregnancy is usually due to Graves' disease and must be treated to prevent congenital anomalies, low birth weight and premature labour. Thionamide drugs should be used with a preference for propylthiouracil (PTU) and continued in low doses up to labour. Breast feeding is possible in patients on low dose PTU. In the management of hypothyroidism during pregnancy thyroxine dose may require to be increased but excess dosage should be avoided because of its unwanted effects on foetal cerebral maturation. Neonatal hyperthyroidism due to transplacental passage of thyroid stimulating antibodies (TsAb) should be checked for in pregnant patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. As antithyroid drugs cross the placenta they may be used as therapy in this condition. Prevention of neonatal goitre is vital. Postpartum development of hyperthyroidism may be due to an exacerbation of pre-existing Graves' disease, development of new Graves' hyperthyroidism or postpartum thyroiditis with transient hyperthyroidism. Differentiation by measurement of TsAb and thyroidal iodine uptake is important because of therapeutic considerations."

CD005253,0,12585349,0,Transient neonatal hypothyroidism due to a maternal vegan diet.,"Iodine is an important constituent of thyroid hormones and deficiency can lead to a range of problems depending on the degree and at what stage of life the deficiency occurs. We report a 10 day-old infant with a goitre, who presented with raised TSH on dried blood spot screening. It was observed that her mother also had a goitre. The mother was a vegan and, on dietary assessment, her iodine intake was extremely low. Both mother and infant had abnormal thyroid function tests. Mother was given Lugol's iodine and her thyroid function tests normalised. Her baby was initially prescribed thyroxine on the basis of the raised screening TSH. This was subsequently withdrawn at the age of 2 weeks, following a normal plasma TSH. Thyroid function tests remained normal and the goitre disappeared by the age of 2 months. Iodine deficiency is uncommon in the Western World. However the incidence may be rising in otherwise iodine replete areas, particularly in those who adhere to restrictive and unusual diets. In the case of pregnant mothers their unborn child's health is in danger.

CD005253,0,23062035,0,The implications of iodine and its supplementation during pregnancy in fetal brain development.,"Iodine is an essential trace element for life. Its biological effects are a consequence of its incorporation to the thyroid hormones, which play a crucial role in fetal organogenesis, and in particular in brain development. This takes place during early gestation and involves delicate targeting throughout the central nervous system, including adequate neuronal growth, migration and myelinization at different sites, such as the cerebral cortex and neocortex, visual and auditory cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Pregnancy is characterized by an increased demand of thyroid hormones by the feto-placental unit in order to fulfill the necessary requirements of thyroid hormone action for normal fetal development. Up until week 20, the fetal thyroid is not fully active and therefore is completely dependent on the maternal thyroxine supply. Thus, the maternal thyroid has to adapt to this situation by producing about 1.5 fold more thyroxine. This requires that enzymatic gland machinery works normally as well as an adequate iodine intake, the principal substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis. Biological consequences of iodine related maternal hypothyroxinemia are currently very well known, by both experimental models and by clinical and epidemiological evidences. The associated disturbances parallel the degree of maternal thyroxine deficiency, ranging from increased neonatal morbi-mortality and severe mental dysfunction, to hyperactivity, attention disorders and a substantial decrease of IQ of an irreversible nature in the progeny of mothers suffering a deprivation of iodine during pregnancy. As a consequence, iodine deficiency is the leading preventable cause of mental impaired function in the world, affecting as many as 2 billion people (35.2% of the entire population). Prevention of fetal iodine deficiency - a problem of pandemic proportions- is feasible, provided that an iodine supply of 200-300 μg/day to the mother is ensured, before and throughout gestation as well as during the lactating period."
CD005253,0,1700036,0,[Thyroid disease].,"The incidence of pregnant women with thyroid dysfunction has been reported to be around 0.1-0.4%. Graves' disease accounts for more than half of these disorders. The main cause of thyroid disease in pregnancy and puerperium is autoimmune dysfunction. Whether there may be goitre or exophthalmus present, clinical signs as inappropriate weight gain, high systolic pressure, palpitation (greater than or equal to 110/min), emotional lability, fatigue, acceleration of suppression of the Achilles' tendon reflex should induce changes in the biochemical thyroid function tests. Parameters for the diagnosis and management for hyperthyroidism are serum levels of free T4 and TSH, while those of T3, reverse T3, and TSH are for hypothyroidism. Serum anti-microsomal antibodies and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies which have no effect on the fetus are also good markers for severity. The transplacental transfer of maternal TSH receptor antibodies consisting of stimulatory and inhibitory immunoglobulins and maternal thyroid-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins play roles in the development of transient neonatal hyper- or hypothyroidism. Fetal control is achieved by optimal maternal management. Untreated hyperthyroidism may be associated with fetal malformations. This risk may be reduced by antithyroid drug treatment of up to 150 mg/day of propylthiouracil which has less chance of placental passage and less secretion into the mother's milk than methyl-mercapto-imidazol. Maternal thyroid function should be kept in the upper limit of normal range, taking into consideration the fetal dysfunction induced by over-administration of the drug which passes through placenta. Children of hypothyroid women taking inadequate replacement therapy manifested lower IQ values compared to the progeny of euthyroid or hypothyroid women taking adequate therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Most of these trials had clinical short-term endpoints, while only one trial had a long-term neurodevelopmental endpoint. None of the trials reported changes in mortality and morbidities. A trend toward a lower occurrence of patent ductus arteriosus is found in thyroid hormone treated infants. A gestational age-dependent effect of thyroxine on neurodevelopmental outcome was found in post-hoc subgroup analyses up until the age of 10 years. Thyroxine treatment was associated with improved mental, motor, and neurological outcomes in infants <28 weeks gestation, but with worse mental and neurological outcome in infants of 29 weeks gestation. Future trials should focus on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Continuous administration of thyroid hormone may be more effective than bolus administration."

Reduced concentrations of adiponectin precede the onset of type 2 diabetes and the development of atherosclerosis. Our aim was to quantify adiponectin concentrations in small for gestational age (SGA) children. Fifty-one SGA children, 24 obese, and 17 short-normal children with birth weight appropriate for gestational age (short-AGA) were studied. The statures of the SGA children were corrected for their midparental height and subdivided into two groups according to their corrected height: catch-up growth group, children with corrected height of 0 z-score or greater (n = 17); and noncatch-up growth group, subjects with corrected height less than 0 z-score (n = 34). SGA children showed adiponectin levels significantly lower than short- normal children (35.2 +/- 3.5 vs. 80.4 +/- 26.6 micro g/ml; P < 0.0001) and obese children (77.5 +/- 39.4 micro g/ml; P < 0.0001). Catch-up growth children showed adiponectin levels significantly lower than noncatch-up growth subjects (29.4 +/- 10.3 vs. 38.1 +/- 11.5 micro g/ml; P = 0.01). Adiponectin concentrations were inversely related to height z-score, corrected stature, weight, and body mass index and were positively related to birth weight. Our results suggest that adiponectin levels are reduced in SGA children and are even lower in those with postnatal catch-up growth. Whether this finding implies a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis remains to be established."

Three percent of the women were hypothyroxinemic. Developmental, intellectual, and motor abilities of progeny born to (Group I) 210 euthyroxinemic, (Group II) 15 hypothyroxinemic given adequate thyroid replacement therapy, and (Group III) 21 inadequately treated hypothyroxinemic women were compared. The groups of mothers exhibited no significant differences in intelligence, years of education, or chronological age. Mean developmental and intellectual scores at eight months, four and seven years of Group II progeny evidenced remarkably consistent similarity to scores of siblings and controls. At each age, mean developmental and intellectual scores were lower for Group III progeny, and motor scores of the latter were lowest. Some progeny of Group II mothers, treated only after 12 or 29 weeks, failed the ball catch and line walk tests; some had strabismus and other ocular disturbances. Could these deficits have originated with maternal hypothyroxinemia during first semester weeks before the thyroid-pituitary axis matures? Now in 1990-1991, early findings fit into the modern concepts of significant maternal gestational transfer of thyroxine to the fetus.

CD005253,0,12778049,0,Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets.,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Approximately 2.5% of adults in the United States and 4% of adults in Canada follow vegetarian diets. A vegetarian diet is defined as one that does not include meat, fish, or fowl. Interest in vegetarianism appears to be increasing, with many restaurants and college foodservices offering vegetarian meals routinely. Substantial growth in sales of foods attractive to vegetarians has occurred, and these foods appear in many supermarkets. This position paper reviews the current scientific data related to key nutrients for vegetarians, including protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, vitamin A, n-3 fatty acids, and iodine. A vegetarian, including vegan, diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients. In some cases, use of fortified foods or supplements can be helpful in meeting recommendations for individual nutrients. Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits, including lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, fiber, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower body mass indices than nonvegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from ischemic heart disease; vegetarians also show lower blood cholesterol levels; lower blood pressure; and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer. Although a number of federally funded and institutional feeding programs can accommodate vegetarians, few have foods suitable for vegans at this time. Because of the variability of dietary practices among vegetarians, individual assessment of dietary intakes of vegetarians is required. Dietetics professionals have a responsibility to support and encourage those who express an interest in consuming a vegetarian diet. They can play key roles in educating vegetarian clients about food sources of specific nutrients, food purchase and preparation, and any dietary modifications that may be necessary to meet individual needs. Menu planning for vegetarians can be simplified by use of a food guide that specifies food groups and serving sizes."

The thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), are necessary for adequate growth and development throughout fetal and extrauterine life. The iodine intake of newborns is entirely dependent on the iodine content of breast milk and the formula preparations used to feed them. An inadequate iodine supply might be especially dangerous in the case of premature babies. The minimum recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for different age groups has recently been revised. The iodine intake required is at least 15 microg/kg/day in full-term infants and 30 microg/kg/day in preterms. The iodine content of many evaluated preparations for feeding premature infants appears to be inadequate. Premature infants are now in a situation of iodine deficiency, precisely at a stage of psychomotor and neural development which is extremely sensitive to alterations of thyroid function."

CD005253,0,15871231,0,Perchlorate and iodide in dairy and breast milk.,"Perchlorate inhibits iodide uptake and may impair thyroid and neurodevelopment in infants. Recently, we unambiguously identified the presence of perchlorate in all seven brands of dairy milk randomly purchased from grocery stores in Lubbock, TX. How widespread is perchlorate in milk? Perchlorate in 47 dairy milk samples from 11 states and in 36 human milk samples from 18 states were measured. Iodide was also measured in a number of the samples. Perchlorate was detectable in 81 of 82 samples. The dairy and breast milk means were, respectively, 2.0 and 10.5 microg/L with the corresponding maximum values of 11 and 92 microg/L. Perchlorate is present in virtually all milk samples, the average concentration in breast milk is five times higher than in dairy milk. Although the number of available measurements are few at this point, for breast milk samples with a perchlorate content greater than 10 microg/L, the iodide content is linearly correlated with the inverse of the perchlorate concentration with a r2 of >0.9 (n = 6). The presence of perchlorate in the milk lowers the iodide content and may impair thyroid development in infants. On the basis of limited available data, iodide levels in breast milk may be significantly lower than it was two decades ago. Recommended iodine intake by pregnant and lactating women may need to be revised upward."
CD005253,0,17642417,0,How should we be treating children with congenital hypothyroidism?,"Early detection by newborn screening and appropriate L-thyroxine treatment leads to normal or near-normal neurocognitive outcome in infants with congenital hypothyroidism. Many newborns with congenital hypothyroidism have some residual thyroid hormone production, and even in those with athyreosis, transplacental passage of maternal thyroid hormone offers some protection for a time. Given the serum T4 half-life of 6 days, the neonatal T4 level will fall and disappear over the first 2-3 weeks of life. Thus, there is a crucial 'window of opportunity' to correct the hypothyroidism and minimize the time the brain is exposed to hypothyroxinemia. While there are few truly prospective, randomized clinical trials investigating treatment parameters, studies measuring IQ outcome support a starting L-thyroxine dose of 10-15 microg/kg/day. Further, studies show that the most severely hypothyroid infants are at risk for a 5-20 point decrease in IQ. Such infants may benefit from a starting dose of 12-17 microg/kg/d, which has been shown to normalize T4 in 3 days and TSH in 2 weeks. Target serum T4 or free T4 levels appear to be higher in the first two weeks of treatment. Infants require more frequent laboratory monitoring, every 1-2 months in the first 6 months and every 3-4 months until age 3 years, as the developing brain has a critical dependence on thyroid hormone in the first 2-3 years of life."

Inappropriate treatment of CH is complicated by irreversible brain damage or low IQ score. Hormone replacement therapy with L-thyroxine (L-T4) is sufficient for a very large proportion of patients. However, during treatment, the patient needs to be carefully monitored for presence of factors which might affect the absorption or bio-availability of the drug as well as its dose. Herein, we report a preterm newborn with CH who presented with gastrointestinal problems mimicking necrotizing enterocolitis. The clinical course was also complicated by cholestasis. The L-T4 replacement treatment was switched from oral route to parenteral. After resolution of the cholestasis, L-T4 treatment was continued successfully by the oral route."

Cord blood mean T4 and free T4 index (FT4I) were not significantly different from controls and total T3 and free T3 index (FT3I), though significantly lower than the controls, were all within the normal range. In five babies in whom they were measured, FT3, FT4 and rT3 levels were not significantly different from controls. Cord TSH was significantly higher in the babies of thyrotoxic mothers than in the control babies. One baby had a goitre at birth which disappeared after a few days.

CD005253,0,21454178,0,[Current questions of thyroid diseases in childhood].,"In recent years our knowledge on thyroid diseases in childhood has been increased. Several forms of congenital hypothyroidism (dysgenesis, dyshormongenesis, thyrotropin resistance and some central forms) are consequences of gene mutations. Maternal hypothyroxinemia due to severe iodine deficiency leads to early neurological damage and congenital hypothyroidism. Neonatal screening of congenital hypothyroidism and early treatment with l-thyroxin ensure good prognosis. Differential diagnosis of the various forms of congenital hypothyroidism in newborns is not an easy task. The need for treatment of transient hypothyroxinemia is still controversial. Diagnosis of juvenile lymphocytic thyroiditis can be ascertained by the clinical status, ultrasound examination, detection of anti-peroxydase antibodies, evaluation of thyroid function, and fine needle aspiration cytology. L-thyroxin therapy is recommended in cases of subclinical and manifest hypothyroidism. The transient form of the rare newborn hyperthyroidism is the consequence of maternal Graves-Basedow disease. It can be a sever condition and its permanent form is caused by TSH-receptor gene mutation. In the pathogenesis of autonomic thyroid adenoma mutations of the TSH-receptor and the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G-protein are involved. Treatment of Graves-Basedow disease in childhood is a debated question. The first choice is medical treatment with antithyroid and beta-blocking drugs. However, remission rate is low under this therapy, and the disease is characterised by frequent relapses. For this reason, the necessity of definitive therapy frequently arises. In Europe subtotal thyroidectomy is used as second choice of therapy, but clinical experience in the United States showed that radioiodine treatment is a safe and effective therapy for children and adolescents. Iodine deficient goitre in childhood is a form of iodine deficiency disorder. It is the consequence of adaptation to iodine deficiency. It can be treated by iodine or/and l-thyroxin, and its development can be prevented by iodinated salt. In childhood, thyroid nodule needs for a detailed investigation because of the possibility of thyroid cancer. Medullar thyroid carcinoma indicates genetic screening in the patients and their family, and the presence of disease-causing RET-proto-oncogene mutation confirms the need for total thyroidectomy already in childhood."

CD005253,0,21903704,0,Hypothyroidism in preterm infants following normal screening.,"Congenital hypothyroidism is screened for in the UK using blood spot thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening at 5-8 d of age. Although standards are set by the UK Newborn Screening Programme Centre, there are variations in TSH cut-offs used. The introduction of repeat screening of preterm babies at 36 weeks' gestational age in 2005 was controversial in its utility and timing. Two cases of preterm babies are presented, who had normal blood spot TSH values on the first test and who became screen positive when re-tested at term. The first with Trisomy 21 was born at 29 + 6 weeks with an initial blood spot TSH of 3.3 mU/L rising to 263 mU/L at term-corrected gestational age (plasma TSH 476.5 mU/L). The second was born at 24 + 6 weeks' gestational age and on day 7, the heel prick blood spot TSH was <2 mU/L, rising to 6.4 mU/L at 36 weeks corrected gestational age. After a barium enema, the plasma TSH increased to 66.6 mU/L with a free thyroxine of 7.6 pmol/L at day 101. Both cases were treated with thyroxine until death due to complications of prematurity. These cases illustrate the difficulties in screening for congenital hypothyroidism in preterm infants, due to the immaturity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis, and the effect of intercurrent illness and drugs on thyroid function. Despite a reassuring published review of 2200 preterm infants, these cases suggest that it may be unwise not to re-screen ex-preterm infants for congenital hypothyroidism at term."

CD005253,0,10584424,0,Recurrent fetal thyrotoxicosis in a woman with Graves' disease: case report.,"The thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins are generally believed to be the cause of hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease. Placental transfer of these antibodies from a mother with autoimmune thyroid disease can result in fetal thyroid disorders. We report the case of a 31-year-old woman who had a history of Graves' disease. She received thyroxine therapy for post thyroidectomy hypothyroidism. Two years after the thyroidectomy, she became pregnant. Unfortunately, intrauterine fetal death occurred in midgestation. One year later, she became pregnant again. In the 26th week of gestation, fetal thyrotoxicosis was diagnosed using clinical pictures, including fetal tachycardia and cardiomegaly, and a hormonal evaluation of a periumbilical blood sampling (T4: 18 micrograms/dl, T3: 65.3 ng/dl, TSH: < 0.03 microU/ml) was performed. Antimicrosomal antibodies were not detectable in either the maternal or fetal blood. In this case, high levels of TBII were detected during pregnancy and crossed the placenta to result in a thyrotoxic fetus in the second pregnancy. We recommend that both the regular monitoring of the thyrotropin receptor antibodies of pregnant women with a history of autoimmune thyroid disease, and routine measurements of the fetal heart rate and intrauterine growth during gestation be mandatory for the early detection of fetal thyroid disorders. Cordocentesis for measuring fetal thyroid function is helpful in reaching a definite diagnosis and for guiding therapy."

Thirty-nine pregnancies in 38 patients were analyzed further. Twenty-six patients (27 pregnancies) were treated with antithyroid agents with (9) or without (17) supplemental thyroid hormone therapy and 5 were subjected to subtotal thyroidectomy. In these groups spontaneous abortion occurred in 4 patients (12.5%), prematurity in 3 (9.4%) and perinatal death in one whereas 25 pregnancies ended at term (78%). Two pairs of twins were born and the number of live children in these 32 pregnancies was 29. Hypothyroidism developed in one patient after operation. Thyroid crisis occurred at delivery in one patient in whom the antithyroid therapy was interrupted before labour. Seven patients were not treated with specific antithyroid therapy. In this group there was one twinbirth, one premature birth, one stillbirth and one child died shortly after birth. Thyroid crises developed at delivery in two mothers. The authors use subtotal thyroidectomy if usual indications for operation are present and antithyroid therapy when the thyroid gland is small and diffuse. Beta-receptor blocking agents are recommended only as adjuncts to the antithyroid therapy. A close surveillance of the patients and the free thyroid hormone level during therapy is important and after thyroidectomy treatment with thyroid hormone is recommended until after delivery."

CD005253,0,11940460,0,Pentachlorophenol and hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites in umbilical cord plasma of neonates from coastal populations in Québec.,"Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (HO-PCBs) and octachlorostyrene (4-HO-HpCS), and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were determined in umbilical cord plasma samples from three different regions of Québec. The regions studied included two coastal areas where exposure to PCBs is high because of marine-food-based diets--Nunavik (Inuit people) and the Lower North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence (subsistence fishermen)--and a southern Québec urban center where PCB exposure is at background levels (Québec City). The main chlorinated phenolic compound in all regions was PCP. Concentrations of PCP were not significantly different among regions (geometric mean concentration 1,670 pg/g, range 628-7,680 pg/g wet weight in plasma). The ratio of PCP to polychlorinated biphenyl congener number 153 (CB153) concentration ranged from 0.72 to 42.3. Sum HO-PCB (sigma HO-PCBs) concentrations were different among regions, with geometric mean concentrations of 553 (range 238-1,750), 286 (103-788), and 234 (147-464) pg/g wet weight plasma for the Lower North Shore, Nunavik, and the southern Québec groups, respectively. Lower North Shore samples also had the highest geometric mean concentration of sum PCBs (sum of 49 congeners; sigma PCBs), 2,710 (525-7,720) pg/g wet weight plasma. sigma PCB concentrations for Nunavik samples and southern samples were 1,510 (309-6,230) and 843 (290-1,650) pg/g wet weight plasma. Concentrations (log transformed) of sigma HO-PCBs and sigma PCBs were significantly correlated (r = 0.62, p < 0.001), as were concentrations of all major individual HO-PCB congeners and individual PCB congeners. In Nunavik and Lower North Shore samples, free thyroxine (T4) concentrations (log transformed) were negatively correlated with the sum of quantitated chlorinated phenolic compounds (sum PCP and sigma HO-PCBs; r = -0.47, p = 0.01, n = 20) and were not correlated with any PCB congeners or sigma PCBs. This suggests that PCP and HO-PCBs are possibly altering thyroid hormone status in newborns, which could lead to neurodevelopmental effects in infants. Further studies are needed to examine the effects of chlorinated phenolic compounds on thyroid hormone status in newborns."

In newborns with a birth weight between 1900-2500 g (gestational age 35.4 +/- 0.45 weeks) the responses of both hormones were essentially similar to those reported previously for mature newborns (a profound decrease during the procedure and an increase 24 h later). In a group of newborns with a birth weight below 1900 g (average 1673 +/- 55, gestational age 32.7 +/- 0.72 weeks), however, the secondary increase in plasma T4 at 24 h after the procedure was absent. At this time both T4 and TSH levels were significantly lower than in those in heavier newborns. It is concluded that the ability to respond to exchange transfusion by an increase in plasma thyroxine at 24 h after the procedure matures at the gestational age between 32 and 35 weeks."

CD005253,0,9329422,0,Topical iodine-containing antiseptics and subclinical hypothyroidism in preterm infants.,"The influence of topical iodine-containing antiseptics on thyroid function test results of premature infants was determined in two separate studies. Thyroxine and thyrotropin levels were measured on blood-spotted filter paper. Samples were obtained from 128 premature infants on their tenth day of life; the infants were treated in two neonatal intensive care units. Both units used similar treatment protocols; however, one routinely used topical iodinated antiseptic agents (n = 73), whereas the other used chlorhexidine-containing antiseptics (n = 55). There was no difference in the mean T4 levels between the two groups. The mean thyrotropin levels were elevated in preterm babies exposed to iodine (15.4 vs 7.8 mIU/L, p < 0.01). Among the iodine-exposed infants, elevated thyrotropin levels (> 30 mIU/L) were found in 13.7% of infants, compared with none in the chlorhexidine-treated group (p < 0.01). We then studied an additional 46 premature infants who were treated in one neonatal intensive care unit. Iodine-containing solutions were used in 24 infants and chlorhexidine was used in 22 infants. T4 and thyrotropin levels were measured weekly during the first 28 days, one every 2 weeks until the age of 60 days, and at the age of 90 days. Among iodine-exposed infants, 20.8% had thyrotropin values > 30 mIU/L, whereas none of the infants in the chlorhexidine group had elevated thyrotropin values (p < 0.05). The elevated thyrotropin levels correlated positively with the area of disinfection. Elevated urine iodine levels were present reflecting an abnormally high iodine absorption. This study suggests that iodine absorption from topical iodine-containing antiseptics may cause disturbances in thyroid function test results in premature infants. We recommend that caution be exercised in the use of iodine-containing antiseptics in premature infants."

The mean age at onset of thyroid hormone therapy was 33 days. The adequacy of replacement therapy was assessed by repeated TT4, FT4, T3 and TSH serum determinations. The high serum TT4 concentrations frequently observed were not accompanied by clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism. rT3 levels determined in 28 CH children with TT4 greater than 15 micrograms/dl were clearly higher than in the controls. The mean weight, length and head circumference remained always between the 50th and 75th centile. The radiological assessment of the knee, mainly the distal femoral surface, has been considered as an important clinical value in the initial diagnosis and in the evaluation of both severity and duration of disease. The psychomotor development was assessed using Brunet-Lezine's test until age 36 months, Stanford-Binet at 4 and 5 and WISC at 6 years of age. The mean global developmental quotients (GDQ) were always between 85 and 97 at 6 to 72 months of age, only eight children were below 85. A significant correlation was found between GDQ at 6 months and the bone age. The neurological examination showed an impairment of posture, coordination and subtle deficits in motor and perceptual abilities in a small percentage of children."

Sixty-three prospectively followed children with CH were assessed at age of 14 y with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and compared with 175 healthy controls. Median age at onset of treatment was 9 d (range 5-18 d) and median starting dose of levothyroxine (L-T4) was 14.7 microg/kg/d (range 9.9-23.6 microg/kg/d). Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) was significantly lower than in controls after adjustment for socioeconomic status (SES) and gender (101.7 versus 111.4; p < 0.0001). Children with athyreosis had a lower performance IQ than those with dysgenesis (adjusted difference 7.6 IQ scores, p < 0.05). Lower initial thyroxine (T4) levels correlated with poorer IQ (r = 0.27, p = 0.04). Lower SES was associated with poorer IQ, in particular in children with CH (interaction, p = 0.03). Treatment during childhood was not related to IQ at age 14 y. Adolescents with CH manifest IQ deficits when compared with their peers despite early high-dose treatment and optimal substitution therapy throughout childhood. Those adolescents with athyreosis and lower SES are at particular risk for adverse outcome. Therefore, early detection of intellectual deficits is mandatory in children with CH."

An additional seven mothers received saline solution and served as control subjects. There were no statistically significant differences in gestational age, birth weight, or Apgar scores between groups. At delivery, concentrations of maternal thyrotropin were elevated in the TRH group compared with the control group (12.0 +/- 1.6 vs 5.6 +/- 0.5 mU/L; p less than 0.005); however, maternal triiodothyronine (T3) values remained unchanged. Significant elevations of fetal thyrotropin and T3 were observed after maternal administration of TRH compared with control subjects (45.8 +/- 7.7 vs 8.4 +/- 0.9 mU/L (p less than 0.002) and 1.3 +/- 0.07 vs 0.7 +/- 0.04 nmol/L or 87 +/- 5 vs 49 +/- 3 ng/dl (p less than 0.001), respectively). Fetal thyroxine (T4) and prolactin values were also elevated after exposure to TRH (135 +/- 5 vs 86 +/- 10 nmol/L or 10.5 +/- 0.4 vs 6.7 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl (p less than 0.001) and 212 +/- 31 vs 105 +/- 28 micrograms/L (p less than 0.05), respectively). Two hours after birth, a significant increase in T3 but not T4 levels was observed in both groups of infants. These data indicate that fetal exposure to a single dose of TRH via maternal administration of this hormone results in marked stimulation of the preterm fetal pituitary-thyroid axis, as in the fetus at term, and that this treatment does not inhibit the early postnatal surge of T3."

CD005253,0,6666901,0,[Posologic equivalents of oral L-thyroxine in thyroid insufficiency (120 cases)].,"The effects of two successive courses of thyroid replacement therapy in the same patients can be compared by measuring plasma hormone levels at the steady state. This method was used to assess the effects of the two forms of oral L-thyroxine, the one in liquid drops 5 micrograms/drop and the other in 50 and 100 micrograms tablets, and to compare these preparations with other forms of thyroid replacement therapy: DL T4, LT3 + LT4 and thyroid extract. The bioequivalence of these drugs was determined by the logarithmic difference of the plasma TSH during successive treatment periods. In addition, this factor could be assessed by the ratios of circulating T4 to T3 when the two treatment periods were identical. One 100 micrograms tablet of L-thyroxine was equivalent to 20 drops of L-thyroxine (100 micrograms), i.e. the bioavailability of the two preparations was identical. This dose was equivalent to three drops of DL thyroxine (i.e. 100 micrograms of L-thyroxine): the D-thyroxine did not have any demonstrable hormonal properties. The same dose was equivalent to about 3/4 of a tablet of LT3 + LT4, and to about 12 cg of thyroid extract. Individual stabilisation with L-thyroxine in cases of peripheral thyroid deficiency was based on basal TSH levels and TSH levels after injection of TRH when the basal TSH was normalised. The plasma T3 and T4 levels could also be used for optimal equilibrium with L-thyroxine; the first should be within the normal range and the second in the normal or mildly hyperthyroid range. The optimal adult dose of L-thyroxine in this study was variable (115 +/- 40 micrograms/day). In young children, especially babies, the effective dose with respect to body weight, is much greater."

CD005253,0,9078538,0,Transient secondary hypothyroidism in children after cardiac surgery.,"Thyroid hormone status was assessed in 132 children with congenital heart defects undergoing cardiac surgery (median age 3.1 y; range 2 d to 16.2 y). Plasma TSH, thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), thyroglobulin (Tg), and urinary iodine excretion were measured before and every other day after cardiac surgery (d 1-21). After surgery we observed strikingly low plasma concentrations of TSH (0.4 mU/L; 0.2-1.3), T3 (0.6 nmol/L; 0.3-1.2), T4 (48.9 nmol/L; 12.9-82.4), IT4 (12.9 pmol/L; 5.1-19.3), and Tg (9.4 micrograms/L; 1.5-20.6), whereas rT3 plasma concentrations increased (0.13 pmol/L; 0.05-0.3; n = 40). The maximal post-operative changes of TSH and rT3 preceded changes of T3, T4, fT4, and Tg. Postoperative urinary iodine excretion increased significantly (n = 109). Thyroid hormone plasma concentrations were lowest after cardiopulmonary bypass operations and in patients treated with dopamine. In patients with postoperative T3 plasma concentrations less than 0.6 nmol/L (n =52) the period of mechanical ventilation and intensive care treatment was significantly prolonged. Furthermore, the cumulative doses of inotropic and vasoactive catecholamines and furosemide were significantly higher in this patient group. Our results demonstrate transient secondary hypothyroidism in children after cardiac surgery that may contribute to postoperative cardiac and respiratory dysfunction and may delay recovery. Possible benefits of thyroid hormone replacement therapy need to be thoroughly examined."
CD005253,0,11195231,0,Elevated serum creatinine levels in infants with congenital hypothyroidism: reflection of decreased renal function?,"The effects of hypothyroid status on renal function have been poorly studied in children. We assessed the renal function of hypothyroid infants detected during neonatal mass screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH). Eighty hypothyroid infants and 20 age-matched normal infants for controls were enrolled. The 80 patients, aged 1 mo, were divided into two groups based on the initial thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) values: a mild-moderately hypothyroid (MHT) group (n = 64, 31M and 33F) and a severely hypothyroid (SHT) group (n = 16, 3M and 13F). Serum creatinine (SCr), TSH, FT4 and other chemicals were compared before and 2 mo after L-thyroxine (LT4) substitution therapy. The following results were obtained: SCr levels were significantly higher in the SHT group (33.2+/-10.0 micromol/L, p < 0.001) compared with the MHT group (20.6+/-6.4 micromol/L) and normal control group (21.0+/-4.4 micromol/L). Two months after the LT4 replacement therapy, the elevated SCr levels in the SHT group decreased by 41.3% to the level (19.5+/-6.0 micromol/L) very close to that in the MHT group (18.8+/-5.1 micromol/L). No significant differences were noted among BUN levels in the three groups. Although serum creatinine kinase levels were significantly higher in the SHT group (230.3+/-102.3 U/L, p < 0.001) than in the MHT group (121.1+/-60.8 U/L), rhabdomyolysis was not considered to be responsible for the impaired renal function."

We investigated an adolescent who had developmental retardation because of an undiagnosed and novel cause of childhood hypothyroidism associated with normal circulating thyrotropin concentrations. Dynamic testing showed a hypersensitive pituitary-thyroid feedback axis with no evidence of other pituitary or hypothalamic disease, and sequence analysis of four candidate causative genes was negative. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose and treat this disorder to prevent the consequences of long-term hypothyroidism on development."

CD005253,0,860967,0,Nutrition and family practice.,"Where necessary, women should be counselled so as to understand that a slim, elegant figure is not the prerogative of all. An inherited large frame requires a corresponding body contour, and dieting to change this situation will be in vain. All weight reducing diets must provide an adequate amount of vitamins and minerals. Women on the contraceptive pill often have diminished serum levels of folic acid and vitamin B6, and there have been suggestions that vitamin supplementation may help overcome depression and diminished libido in some women. This has been partially successful. A well-balanced diet should be recommended prior to trial of supplements. During pregnancy and lactation there is an increased need for protein, calcium, iron, iodide and fluoride. Vitamin and iron supplementation may be required where deficiencies exist due to dietary neglect. Excessive alcohol and smoking should be discouraged--especially during pregnancy. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to diseases of nutritional deficiency for various reasons. The importance of foods providing protein, calcium and vitamins should be stressed, as these are the main nutrients lacking. The consumption of meat, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, fresh fruit and vegetables should be encouraged."
CD005253,0,17338115,0,Iodine excretion with urine and thyrotrophic hormone concentration in normal and complicated pregnancies in the industrial region of iodine deficiency.,"A sufficient amount of iodine in food is necessary for the thyroid gland to produce hormones during pregnancy. The aim of our work was to evaluate iodine and thyrotrophic hormone (TSH) concentration in urine, free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) in complicated pregnancies in Upper Silesia (region of iodine deficiency in Poland) in comparison with normal pregnancies. In both groups the iodine content in urine was evaluated by a quick test and serous concentrations of TSH, fT3 and fT4 were determined by a radioimmunological method. We found the iodine excretion with urine below 100 microg/L in 29.15% of all women under study, i.e. an insufficient supply of this element. The reduced iodine concentration in urine was found to be more often in women with imminent premature delivery. Moreover, it was found that in II trimester the concentration of iodine excreted with urine had been significantly lower comparing to the patients examined in III trimester. We found significantly higher concentration of thyrotrophic hormone in pregnant women with iodine excretion below 100 microg/L of urine. Evaluation of the iodine concentration in urine may be a simple screening test to determine the supply of this element in a diet. Moreover, our studies demonstrate the necessity for the iodine supplementation in pregnant women in the Silesian region--an area of iodine deficiency in Central Europe."
CD005253,0,15112912,0,Novel TSHbeta subunit gene mutation causing congenital central hypothyroidism in a newborn male.,"Newborn screening programs that use only high TSH levels as a marker for hypothyroidism may overlook neonates with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) due to TSH deficiency. We sought the cause of TSH deficiency in a neonate with low levels of thyroxine and TSH. The coding region of the TSHbeta gene was amplified and its sequence examined for mutations. Two mutations in exon 3 were identified: 1) a nucleotide deletion of T410 in codon 105 resulting in a frameshift in one allele, and 2) a previously unreported nucleotide deletion of T266 in codon 57, causing a frameshift and a premature stop at codon 62 in the other allele. We describe a compound heterozygous patient with TSHbeta mutations at codons 57 and 105 that interfered with a critical disulfide bond in the TSH molecule and caused CH. State screening programs that measure both T4 and TSH levels have the potential to detect newborns with congenital central hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,22019570,0,Procalcitonin measurement at 24 hours of age may be helpful in the prompt diagnosis of early-onset neonatal sepsis.,"The clinical signs of early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) are nonspecific and indistinguishable from those of noninfectious disorders. The early diagnosis of EONS is difficult, but is essential to improve outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of procalcitonin (PCT) at birth and at 24h of age in the prompt diagnosis of EONS."
CD005253,0,2603714,0,Monomeric calcitonin secretion in infants with congenital hypothyroidism.,"We have determined CT levels in whole serum (iCT) and by an extraction method (exCT) in 25 infants affected by congenital hypothyroidism (CH)--11 athyreotic and 14 dysgenetic--at age 25 days, before the institution of therapy, and at age 2 years. In hypothyroid patients at age 25 days the iCT and exCT levels were similar to those found in controls of the same age. At age 2 years the iCT and exCT levels decreased in both groups of patients. However, whereas the levels of iCT in hypothyroids were similar to those found in controls of the same age, the levels of exCT were significantly lower in hypothyroids than in controls; moreover they were significantly lower in athyreotic than in dysgenetic patients. At this age, after calcium infusion, exCT levels significantly increased in dysgenetic but not in athyreotic patients. We hypothesize that CT deficiency in CH is due to increased degradation of human CT by the substitutive therapy, which, stimulating proteolytic enzymes, destroys the biologic activity of CT. An extraction procedure improves the sensitivity and specificity of the CT assay and it must be used when CT deficiency is suspected. In addition we suggest that the measurement of exCT levels after Ca infusion might be useful to distinguish dysgenetic from athyreotic patients."
CD005253,0,11778912,0,Postnatal thyroid hormone replacement in very preterm infants.,"Transient hypothyroxinemia occurs frequently in very preterm infants and is caused by a combination of factors as immaturity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid system, loss of the maternal thyroxine (T4) contribution, immaturity of thyroid hormone metabolism, and neonatal illness. Thyroid hormone is important in maturation of the brain, but also of heart and lungs. Low neonatal T4 concentrations in plasma are related to worse clinical and neurodevelopmental outcome. Despite these relationships, only few randomized clinical trials have been performed to find out whether T4 supplementation can improve clinical and/or neurodevelomental outcome of preterm infants. The currently available evidence does not support use of supplemental T4 in all preterm infants. There are, however, indications that T4 might improve neurodevelopmental outcome in infants born before 27 to 29 weeks of gestation. Therefore, it is necessary that new trials are set up to further study the benefits of thyroid hormones given in the neonatal period of very preterm infants."
CD005253,0,18565420,0,Iodine requirements and the risks and benefits of correcting iodine deficiency in populations.,"Iodine deficiency has multiple adverse effects on growth and development due to inadequate thyroid hormone production that are termed the iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). IDD remains the most common cause of preventable mental impairment worldwide. IDD assessment methods include urinary iodine concentration, goiter, thyroglobulin and newborn thyrotropin. In nearly all iodine-deficient countries, the best strategy to control IDD is salt iodization, one of the most cost-effective ways to contribute to economic and social development. When salt iodization is not possible, iodine supplements can be targeted to vulnerable groups. Introduction of iodized salt to regions of chronic IDD may transiently increase the incidence of thyroid disorders, and programs should include monitoring for both iodine deficiency and excess. Although more data on the epidemiology of thyroid disorders caused by differences in iodine intake are needed, overall, the relatively small risks of iodine excess are far outweighed by the substantial risks of iodine deficiency."

CD005253,0,8591677,0,Outcome of lower L-thyroxine dose for treatment of congenital hypothyroidism.,"The appropriateness of the recommended L-thyroxine dose (10-15 micrograms/kg/day) for the treatment of congenital hypothyroidism has been questioned because of the risk of iatrogenic hyperthyroidism. We report the outcome of 23 newborns with congenital primary hypothyroidism treated with 25 micrograms L-thyroxine per day (5.3-9.2 micrograms/kg/day) and followed for an average of 59 months. Serum thyroxine (T4) values increased (X = 11.4 +/- 2.7 micrograms/dL) within 4 weeks posttherapy; eight infants had T4 levels > or = 13 micrograms/dL on only half the currently recommended dose. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values remained elevated in 18 of 21 patients for 2-21 months despite a high-normal T4. Psychometric tests were performed in 19 of the 23 patients. The mean Full Scale IQ for the congenital hypothyroid group (n = 16) was 101.4 +/- 13.2 with comparable Verbal and Performance IQ scores. Patients with a bone age (BA) of < or = 32 weeks or T4 < 2 micrograms/dL at initial evaluation had significantly Lower Verbal IQ scores. A standardized parent-report assessment of behavioral and emotional functioning revealed subgroup scale scores that were indistinguishable from nonclinical norms. We conclude that (1) average range IQ scores and positive behavioral adaptation are observed in congenitally hypothyroid children treated with L-thyroxine doses lower than currently recommended; (2) the L-thyroxine dose should be individualized to prevent iatrogenic hyperthyroidism; (3) TSH normalization should not be a primary objective of treatment, and (4) a prospective study comparing the advantages and risks of different doses of L-thyroxine is needed."

CD005253,0,3347589,0,Effect on growth of children with cardiac dysrhythmias treated with amiodarone.,"We report the results of treatment with amiodarone in nine children with dysrhythmias resistant to conventional drugs, namely, one with ventricular tachycardia, two with atrial tachycardia, one with junctional tachycardia, three with reciprocal rhythm tachycardia, and two with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The initial dose was 800 mg/1.73 m2, administered for two weeks, followed by half the dose for five days a week. The duration of the treatment varied from nine months to 19 months (mean duration, 13 months). Patients were followed up for a period ranging between nine and 33 months (mean period, 17 months). A complete remission was obtained in 56% of patients and partial success in 46%. The following side effects were detected: photosensitization in two; effect on weight, height, growth velocity, and thyroid hormones in three, six, five, and six, respectively; and acceleration in bone age in three. These effects were observed from two to nine months after the beginning of treatment. They persisted for 5-18 months after treatment had been suspended. The main side effect of amiodarone in children is presumably initial hypothyroidism, followed by a biological hyperthyroid reaction. For these reasons we suggest that amiodarone should be restricted as an alternative drug for resistant critical dysrhythmias and be used only for a limited period of two years."

CD005253,0,2492223,0,Factors influencing effectiveness of thyrotropin-releasing hormone therapy for severe epilepsy in childhood: significance of serum prolactin levels.,"Various factors possibly influencing responsiveness to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) therapy were studied in 38 children (20 M, 18 F) with severe epilepsy. Mean age at treatment was 4.7 years (range; 0-18 years). Seizure type was infantile spasms (IS) in 16, generalized tonic seizures in 8, secondarily generalized partial seizures in 4, generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 2, atypical absence in 5, myoclonic seizures in 1, and atonic seizures in 2 cases. All seizure types were classified by ictal EEGs documented by simultaneous EEG-VTR according to the International Classification of seizures, except for two with atonic seizures and one with IS. Factors analyzed were sex, age, etiology, neurologic abnormality, seizure types, seizure frequency, EEGs, duration of TRH therapy, and serum hormone [human growth hormone (HGH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)] levels before and after TRH therapy. We showed that: (a) serum PRL level was significantly correlated to effectiveness of TRH therapy (the higher the PRL, the greater the response rate); (b) serum basal PRL decreased significantly, especially in good responders; and (c) serum basal PRL was elevated especially in patients with IS, which responded more to TRH therapy. These interesting findings seen in severe epilepsy of childhood deserve further neuroendocrinologic study."

Thyrotropin, triiodothyronine and free thyroxine were determined with microparticle enzyme immunoassays (MEIA). Thyroxine was determined with a fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). The proband collective was divided into 9 age groups, and each age group into males and females. In accordance with the recommendations of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry, the 95% scatter range was taken as the reference range. In the different age groups, the ranges of some hormones showed significant differences between males and females. When no significant difference existed between the sexes, the results for males and females were evaluated statistically as a single group. Only a few reference groups showed normal Gaussian distributions. Therefore, in addition to the 50th percentile, the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were also calculated for all reference groups. Minimal and maximal values were also determined. The U-test of Mann & Whitney was used to test for significant differences between individual reference groups, and groups showing no significant differences were combined. The corresponding references ranges were then calculated."

Autoimmune thyroid disease is a frequent pathology in our iodine replete region. The aim of this study is to evaluate the occurrence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in cases with known autoimmune thyroid disease, which were in a euthyroid state prior to pregnancy, and to assess the association between supplemental treatments administered and the outcome of the pregnancy. The study is a prospective interventional controlled study. The two cohorts comprise the interventional group, consisting of 109 pregnant women with known autoimmune asymptomatic thyroid disease, without any levothyroxine (LT4) treatment and an aged-matched control group, with an unknown thyroid disease. After the pregnancy, a monthly evaluation of TSH, FT3, and FT4 was performed. Offspring evaluation was made at birth time. 88.8% of the women developed SCH in the first four weeks of pregnancy. Average LT4 doses increased as the pregnancy progressed. The monthly adjustment was 12.5 or 25 μg. All SCH cases developed in the first trimester of pregnancy. There was no significant difference regarding the gestational week, weight, or length at birth between the interventional group and controls, when TSH values were in the optimal range, during the whole pregnancy.

CD005253,0,8356023,0,Influence of treatment on the maturation of the somesthetic pathway in infants with primary congenital hypothyroidism during the first year of life.,"To assess the influence of treatment on the development of the somesthetic pathway in infants with congenital hypothyroidism receiving early treatment, median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials were measured during the 1st y of life. Twenty-nine infants were studied with six to seven somatosensory evoked potential tests per infant. The cervical latency (N13) divided by arm length and the first (N19) and second (N32) cephalic latencies as well as N13-N32 latency were measured. At diagnosis, all components showed a small but significant delay, which was not related to thyroxine (T4) levels before treatment. During treatment, T4 ranged from 50 to 290 nmol/L. At 12 mo, the cervical latency divided by arm length had normalized, whereas N19 and N13-N32 were more abnormal than at diagnosis. For N19, these abnormalities were related to a slow initial rise of T4 (< or = 100 nmol/L after 1 wk of treatment) and the initial N19 values. Abnormal N13-N32 values were associated with high T4 values during treatment (> 200 nmol/L) and the type of congenital hypothyroidism (partial or total deficiency in T4 production). Induction of therapy with l-triiodothyronine rather than l-thyroxine and the occurrence of low T4 values (< 100 nmol/L) after the 4th wk of therapy had no such effect. Our data suggest that, for normal CNS development, euthyroidism should be reached as soon as possible by adequate induction therapy. Thereafter, T4 supplementation should be strictly dosed, keeping the serum T4 values within narrow limits around the mean normal for age, because overtreatment, like initial undertreatment, may lead to CNS abnormalities at the end of the first year."

CD005253,0,1868639,0,Pharmacologic induction of fetal lung maturity.,"The consequences of a preterm birth are usually not secondary to a developmental abnormality but rather due to the immaturity of one or more organ systems. Because neonatal RDS is the most common and the most severe complication of a preterm delivery, a major emphasis has been placed on its prevention and/or treatment. Despite intensive research efforts directed at preventing or inhibiting preterm labor, to date there is no universally effective method that can be used in most patients. As a result, preterm birth will continue to occur and continue to challenge the health care provider. Several medications and hormones have been shown to stimulate endogenous surfactant production in the fetus. Their administration to women at risk of delivering preterm can decrease both the incidence and severity of neonatal RDS. The primary limiting factor with most agents is the need to delay birth for 48 to 72 hours to achieve maximum therapeutic effect. This mandates the obstetric health care provider not only identify parturients who will deliver preterm but also manage their intrapartum course to achieve maximum value from these pharmacologic agents. Lastly, in those patients in whom labor can be neither inhibited nor safely delayed, exogenous surfactant therapy offers real hope particularly to the very low birth weight baby. To obtain maximum benefit in the very premature infant, i.e., less than 30 weeks' gestation, therapy ideally should begin immediately after birth and before the first breath. However, to offer such therapy, patients need to be identified during the intrapartum period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

However, most of these trials examine only short-term outcomes during the initial hospital stay. To determine whether a common neonatal intervention does more good than harm, it is important to study its long-term efficacy and safety. This review summarizes randomized trials of neonatal therapies published between October 2000 and September 2001. Only trials that examine outcomes beyond the initial hospital discharge were considered. Four beneficial interventions were identified: promotion of breast-feeding, comprehensive follow-up care for high-risk, very low birthweight infants, cryotherapy for threshold retinopathy of prematurity, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for mature infants with severe respiratory failure. Indomethacin prophylaxis in extremely low birthweight infants is of questionable use.

CD005253,0,6822634,0,Plasma thyroglobulin measurements help determine the type of thyroid defect in congenital hypothyroidism.,"Plasma thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements were conducted in infants with congenital hypothyroidism to determine their value in the classification of the thyroid defect. Twenty hypothyroid patients were examined before 50 days of age. Plasma T4, T3, TSH, and Tg were measured and a thyroid scan was performed on all the infants. On the basis of clinical evaluation and the thyroid scans, patients were divided into three groups: group I, ectopic or eutopic hypoplastic glands (n = 11); group II, goiters (n = 3); group III, athyreosis (n = 6). There were no differences among the mean (+/- SD) TSH values of the three groups (377 +/- 291, 402 +/- 202, and 757 +/- 421 microU/ml for group I, II and III respectively). The mean (+/- SD) plasma T4 and T3 levels were lower in group III patients than in the other groups [T4, 0.55 +/- 0.12 vs. 5.0 +/- 3.5 micrograms/100 ml (group I) and 2.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/100 ml (group II); T3, 29.3 +/- 23 vs. 165 +/- 83 ng/100 ml (group I) and 220 +/- 150 ng/100 ml (group II). Plasma Tg was undetectable in all six infants with athyreosis, and varied from 15-600 ng/ml in group I patients (mean +/- SD, 125 +/- 171 ng/ml). Tg was undetectable in one infant with congenital goiter. We conclude that tg measurements are of value in the classification of infants with congenital hypothyroidism to help clarify the nature of the thyroid abnormality once hypothyroidism has already been diagnosed."

CD005253,0,14671180,0,Central congenital hypothyroidism due to gestational hyperthyroidism: detection where prevention failed.,"Much worldwide attention is given to the adverse effects of maternal Graves' disease on the fetal and neonatal thyroid and its function. However, reports concerning the adverse effects of maternal Graves' disease on the pituitary function, illustrated by the development of central congenital hypothyroidism (CCH) in the offspring of these mothers, are scarce. We studied thyroid hormone determinants of 18 children with CCH born to mothers with Graves' disease. Nine mothers were diagnosed after pregnancy, the majority after their children were detected with CCH by neonatal screening. Four mothers were diagnosed during pregnancy and treated with antithyroid drugs since diagnosis. Another four mothers were diagnosed before pregnancy, but they used antithyroid drugs irregularly; free T(4) concentrations less than 1.7 ng/dl (<22 pmol/liter) were not encountered during pregnancy. All neonates had decreased plasma free T(4) concentrations (range 0.3-0.9 ng/dl, 3.9-11.5 pmol/liter); plasma TSH ranged between 0.1 and 6.6 mU/liter. TRH tests showed pituitary dysfunction. Seventeen children needed T(4) supplementation. Because all mothers were insufficiently treated during pregnancy, it is hypothesized that a hyperthyroid fetal environment impaired maturation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system. The frequent occurrence of this type of CCH (estimated incidence 1:35000) warrants early detection and treatment to minimize the risk of cerebral damage. A T(4)-based screening program appears useful in detecting this type of CCH. However, the preferential and presumably best strategy to prevent CCH caused by maternal Graves' disease is preserving euthyroidism throughout pregnancy."

Of 27 patients who had isotope scans before treatment was started, 11 (40%) were athyrotic, 10 (38%) had an ectopic gland, and six (22%) probably had dyshormonogenesis. Treatment was started with thyroxine at 100 micrograms/m2/24 hours at a mean age of 26 days (range 14-45). Serum TSH concentrations remained increased in 26 (81%) at 3 months, 20 (62.5%) at 6 months, and nine (28%) at 1 year and beyond.

CD005253,0,10403191,0,Hormone synthesis and storage in the thyroid of human preterm and term newborns: effect of thyroxine treatment.,"Iodine and thyroglobulin concentrations, as well as iodine, T3, T4 and sialic acid contents of thyroglobulin, were measured in thyroid glands collected postmortem from 42 human premature or term newborns and infants. Three groups were considered: very preterm newborns (24-32 postmenstrual weeks, < 5 days postnatal life), preterm and term newborns (34-41 postmenstrual weeks, < 5 days postnatal life) and infants (born at term, postnatal age 1-8 months). Five very preterm and seven preterm newborns received a daily dose of 10 microg/kg L-T4 for at least 3 days. Thyroid weight and sialic acid content of thyroglobulin progressed with maturation. Intrathyroidal concentrations of iodine and thyroglobulin did not increase significantly before the 42nd week of postmenstrual age. The level of thyroglobulin iodination increased during the postnatal life, except in the very preterm neonates. T4 and T3 content of thyroglobulin was directly proportional to its degree of iodination and positively related to its sialic acid content. L-T4 treatment of preterm newborns increased thyroglobulin iodination and T4-T3 content, without increasing thyroglobulin concentration in the thyroid. It was concluded that the storage of thyroglobulin and iodine in the thyroid develops around term birth. This, associated with the resulting rapid theoretical turnover of the intrathyroidal pool of T4 in Tg, could be an important factor of increased risk of neonatal hypothyroxinemia in the premature infants. The L-T4 treatment of preterm newborns does not accelerate the maturational process of the thyroid gland."

The purpose of the current article is to summarize and briefly discuss a list of research and resource needs developed with the input of workshop participants. This list is composed of the basic, clinical, translational, and population studies required for characterizing the benefits and risks of iodine supplementation, along with related data, analyses, evaluations, methods development, and supporting activities. Ancillary studies designed to use the participant, biological sample, and data resources of ongoing and completed studies (including those not originally concerned with iodine) may provide an efficient, cost-effective means to address some of these research and resource needs. In the United States, the foremost question is whether neurobehavioral development in the offspring of mildly to moderately iodine-deficient women is improved by maternal iodine supplementation during pregnancy. It is important to identify the benefits and risks of iodine supplementation in all population subgroups so that supplementation can be targeted, if necessary, to avoid increasing the risk of thyroid dysfunction and related adverse health effects in those with high iodine intakes. Ultimately, there will be a need for well-designed trials and other studies to assess the impact of maternal supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. However, 2 basic information gaps loom ahead of such a study: the development of robust, valid, and convenient biomarkers of individual iodine status and the identification of infant and toddler neurobehavioral development endpoints that are sensitive to mild maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy and its reversal by supplementation."
CD005253,0,2603715,0,Ectopic thyroid: residual function after withdrawal of treatment in infancy and later childhood.,"Plasma thyroxine (T4) and thyrotrophin (TSH) were estimated in 34 children identified by neonatal hypothyroid screening and subsequently found to have ectopic thyroid tissue on isotope scan. Before treatment plasma T4 ranged from 8-143 nmol/l and TSH from 39-1,230 mU/l. After one week off treatment during their second year, repeat T4 in 26 of these cases showed a significant correlation with the pre-treatment values (r = 0.57). However, only 3 of the 5 children with pre-treatment T4 levels over 100 nmol/l at diagnosis had normal T4 values when retested. Similarly, when 10 children with pre-treatment T4 values over 65 nmol/l were retested off treatment at the ages of 5.8-8.2 years, only 4 had plasma T4 levels in the normal range. These results illustrate the wide range of thyroid function which can occur in children with ectopic thyroid tissue and indicate that some continue to have near-normal thyroid function for considerable periods. However, pre-treatment T4 results do not allow accurate identification of these latter cases."

Increasing L-T4 dosage we have got a significant increase of FT4 levels, a significant decrease of TSH levels, but no variations of FT3 values, indicating an individual capability in regulating FT3 disposal. FT3 and TSH are the most valuable indexes of therapy adequacy, since their normality reflects an euthyroid status; we should achieve an individually adequate dose of L-T4, based on clinical judgment and hormonal findings."

Only two cases (7.7%) had already been diagnosed on clinical grounds before the results of screening became available. In two other babies the diagnosis was delayed. The programme thus resulted in the early treatment of 22 babies, eight of whom already had pronounced features of hypothyroidism that had not been detected on routine clinical examinations. Although definitive evidence will not be available for some years, the results suggest that the prognosis for most of these babies is likely to be improved by early diagnosis; thus the introduction of national screening should be delayed no longer."

For the conditions of high bone turnover--osteoporosis in which osteoclastic resorption is increased--efficacious treatment options include hormone replacement therapy, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates. Osteoporosis with low bone turnover results from deficient osteoblastic bone formation and responds to the experimental drug programs of fluoride, parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone related peptide analogues.

Graves' disease is the most common thyroid disorder in our pregnant patients. Thyroid disease is suspected if a significant goitre is detected during pregnancy. Confirmation by thyroid function tests is necessary but their interpretation requires an understanding of changes in the maternal thyroid physiology. Pharmacotherapy with the thionamides is the treatment of choice. Changes in dosage are influenced by the effect of pregnancy on the disease and the optimal level of control for the mother and the foetus. The dose is best titrated against the free thyroxine index or free thyroxine level. The outcome of pregnancy depends on early diagnosis and skillful manipulation of antithyroid drugs.

Serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations were raised in 22 of the infants (52%) at 2 to 4 months, in 16 (38%) at 5 to 11 months, in 14 (33%) at 12 to 18 months, and in eight (19%) at 2 to 4 years. Serum thyroxine and the dose of L-thyroxine/kg/body weight were significantly lower in those infants with raised thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations. Thyroid stimulating hormone was appropriately suppressed when the dose of L-thyroxine was increased, and only one child had delayed maturation of the hypothalamic/pituitary/thyroid axis.

CD005253,0,17076354,0,[Central congenital hypothyroidism due to Graves' disease in the mother].,"Two male twins were born at a gestational age of 30 weeks. Five days after delivery, the mother was diagnosed with Graves' disease. The thyroid function in the neonates was therefore evaluated, which led to the detection of central congenital hypothyroidism (central CHT), even though the neonatal CHT-screening had been reported to be normal. Both boys were treated with thyroxine up to the age of nine months. It was then established that their development had been uneventful. Maternal Graves' disease can, due to the presence of anti-thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies and the maternal use of anti-thyroid drugs, result in thyroid dysfunction in the neonate. Neonates born to mothers with Graves' disease are at risk of developing central CHT. This occurs especially in children of mothers who are not treated or are inadequately treated during pregnancy. In view of the importance of thyroid hormone for brain development, children with central CHT are at risk for neurodevelopmental problems if thyroid dysfunction is not detected and treated early. The Dutch screening for congenital hypothyroidism is based on thyroxine (T4), TSH and thyroid-binding globulin. This makes it possible to detect central CHT. However, in prematurely born infants this disease may be missed because in this subgroup, referral is only based on increased TSH levels, which may not be present."

CD005253,0,27395336,0,Prenatal exposure to perfluorinated compounds affects thyroid hormone levels in newborn girls.,"Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are ubiquitous in the environment and have been detected in humans and wildlife. Exposure to PFCs has decreased in the United States recently, while exposure to PFCs continues in Asian countries, which represents a public health concern. Various mechanisms by which PFCs affect fetal growth have been proposed, such as activation of peroxisome proliferators, disruption of thyroid hormones and changes in lipid metabolism. However, the overall evidence for an association with thyroid hormones is not strong. Therefore, we examined the effect of various prenatal PFCs on cord blood thyroid hormones: triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, and explored the endocrine disrupting effect of these PFCs on thyroid hormone levels in children according to gender. Two hundred and seventy-nine study participants were selected from among the enrolled participants in the Ewha Birth & Growth Retrospective Cohort, a retrospective birth cohort study conducted at Ewha Womans University Hospital, Seoul, Korea between 2006 and 2010. A generalized linear model was constructed to explore the association of PFCs and thyroid hormones. Further, an analysis stratified by gender was conducted. Our study shows that cord blood perfluoro n-pentanoic acid (PFPeA) was positively associated with cord blood T4 (p=0.01) level. Gender-specific analysis showed that prenatal PFCs: PFPeA and Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) exposure significantly increased T4 (p<0.01) and T3 (p=0.03), respectively, while perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) decreased TSH (p=0.04) concentration in newborn girls. Thus, prenatal PFC exposure may disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis. Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in fetal development and may have gender specific action. Hence, these results are of utmost importance in high-risk groups, such as pregnant women and children."

CD005253,0,7829623,0,A randomized trial for the treatment of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy: maternal and neonatal effects.,"One hundred and eighty euthyroid pregnant women were selected at the end of the first trimester of gestation on the basis of biochemical criteria of excessive thyroid stimulation, defined as supranormal serum thyroglobulin (TG > 20 micrograms/L) associated with a low normal free T4 index (< 1.23) and/or an increased T3/T4 ratio (> 25 x 10(-3)). Women were randomized in a double blind protocol into three groups and treated until term with a placebo, 100 micrograms potassium iodide (KI)/day, or 100 micrograms iodide plus 100 micrograms L-T4/day. Parameters of thyroid function, urinary iodine excretion, and thyroid volume were monitored sequentially. Neonatal thyroid parameters, including thyroid volume by echography, were also assessed in the newborns from mothers of the three groups. In women receiving a placebo, the indices of excessive thyroid stimulation worsened as gestation progressed, with low free T4 levels, markedly increased serum TG and T3/T4 ratio. Serum TSH doubled, on the average, and was supranormal in 20% of the cases at term. Urinary iodine excretion levels were low, around 30 micrograms/L at term. The thyroid volume increased, on the average, by 30%, and 16% of the women developed a goiter, confirming the goitrogenic stimulus associated with pregnancy. Moreover, the newborns of these mothers had significantly larger thyroid volumes at birth as well as elevated serum TG levels. In both groups of women receiving an active treatment, the alterations in thyroid function associated with pregnancy were markedly improved. The increase in serum TSH was almost suppressed, serum TG decreased significantly, and changes in thyroid volume were minimized (group receiving KI) or almost suppressed (group receiving KI combined with L-T4). Moreover, in the newborns of the mothers in the two groups receiving an active treatment, serum TG was significantly lower, and thyroid volume at birth was normal. The effects of therapy were clearly more rapid and more marked in the group receiving a combination of T4 and KI than in the women receiving KI alone. The differences could be partly attributed to the slightly higher amount of iodine received by women in the combined treatment. However, the main benefits of the combined treatment were almost certainly attributable to the hormonal effects of the addition of L-T4. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the administration of T4 did not hamper the beneficial effect of iodine supplementation. In conclusion, the present work emphasizes the potential risk of goitrogenic stimulation in both mother and newborn in the presence of mild iodine deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD005253,0,3724623,0,Management and outcome of children with congenital hypothyroidism detected on neonatal screening in South Australia.,"Thirty-eight congenitally hypothyroid children who were detected in a neonatal screening programme have been treated for a mean period of 3.8 years (range, 0.5-8.5 years) by the maintenance of the free thyroxine index in the upper normal range as the main determinant of the dose of thyroxine. Only excessive elevation of, or serial rises in, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level influenced the dose of thyroxine. This treatment strategy, which aims to avoid the potentially adverse effects of thyroxine overdosage, has often resulted in delayed return of TSH levels to normal, especially in athyrotic children (mean TSH +/- SD at one year of age in athyrotic children, 72 +/- 90 mU/L; in children with ectopic thyroid glands, 24 +/- 16 mU/L; normal range, 0-7 mU/L). The mean thyroxine dose of about 100 micrograms/m2 did not change significantly with age, and is lower than the doses that are sometimes quoted in the literature; athyrotic children require significantly more thyroxine (P less than 0.05) than those with ectopic thyroid glands. Symptoms and signs of congenital hypothyroidism, although subtle, were significantly more common (P less than 0.05 for symptoms and P less than 0.001 for signs) in athyrotic children compared with those with ectopic glands. No physical or developmental abnormality related to congenital hypothyroidism has been demonstrated on follow-up; mean height and weight percentiles approximate the 50th percentile at ages one to six years and mean developmental scores +/- SD at about two years of age by the Griffiths Mental Development Scale and at 4.5-6.5 years by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale are 102.4 +/- 10.4 and 111.2 +/- 12.2, respectively.

Cancer patients aged 0-18 years who experienced febrile neutropenia attacks were included in the study. Adrenomedullin, CRP, and PCT were analyzed at admission, day 3, and days 7-10 later. Fifty episodes of febrile neutropenia that developed in 37 patients were analyzed in this study. The mean age of the patients was 7.5 ± 4.7 (1-18) years. The patients had leukemia (73%), solid tumors (19%), and lymphoma (8%). The percentages of the patients in the clinically documented infection (CDI), fever of unknown origin (FUO), sepsis, and microbiological documented infection (MDI) categories were 34%, 34%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During the study period, four patients were lost. In the MDI group, adrenomedullin levels on day 3 were significantly higher than those in the CDI and FUO groups. PCT levels were significantly higher in the sepsis group than those in the CDI group at admission, day 3, and days 7-10. In the sepsis group, PCT levels on days 7-10 days were significantly higher than those in the sepsis group. PCT values from the deceased patients on days 7-10 were significantly higher than those from patients who survived. CRP levels did not differ significantly among the febrile neutropenia groups. First, in our study, adrenomedullin was used as a biomarker in the febrile neutropenia episodes of children with cancer. Among adrenomedullin, CRP, and PCT, procalcitonin demonstrates the highest correlation with the severity of infection."

Thirteen articles were studied to determine the role of PCT in CAP management, specifically its usefulness for distinguishing pneumococcal infections from viral and unknown infections, for predicting severity and the correct antibiotic treatment. This paper focuses on the studies performed to identify the best inflammatory biomarker for CAP management. Although there is an increase in studies confirming the usefulness of PCT in CAP management in children, further studies are needed to have better understanding of its role for pediatric CAP management."

Although salt sold in Bangladesh is intended to contain iodine, much of the salt does not contain iodine, and iodine deficiency continues to be common. Anaemia similarly is common among all population groups and has shown no sign of improvement even when iron-supplementation programmes have been attempted.

CD005253,0,4029879,0,Free thyroxine measurement by one-step method in the plasma of treated and untreated hypothyroid infants.,"The one-step radioimmunoassay of free thyroxine (f-T4) using a gamma-coated kit was used in this study. In controls the mean plasma levels (pmol/l) were 20.8 (range 13.5-37) during the first days of life, 17.4 (11.5-27) from 1 week to 1 year, and 17.0 (10-24.5) after 1 year. In preterm newborns it was correlated with the length of gestation. Among 23 untreated hypothyroid infants aged 15-22 days, f-T4 was undetectable in those with athyreosis, while in cases with dysgenetic thyroid it was variable, correlated to the width of the gland (r = 0.77, p less than 0.01). In 44 hypothyroid patients treated with l-T4, a highly significant positive correlation was found after the 1st month of treatment between plasma f-T4 and the daily l-T4 dose (r = 0.46, p less than 0.01), and a negative one between f-T4 and plasma TSH (r = -0.59, p less than 0.001). It is concluded that measurement of f-T4 offers a valuable means for control of diagnosis and treatment in congenital hypothyroidism, especially useful for avoiding both under- and overtreatment. Its correlations suggest that it is the most reliable hormonal measurement in the follow-up of thyroid children."
CD005253,0,22232309,0,Panhypopituitarism presenting as life-threatening heart failure caused by an inherited microdeletion in 1q25 including LHX4.,"Clinical presentation of hypopituitarism in the neonate may be variable, ranging from absent to severe nonspecific symptoms and may be life-threatening in patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency. The LIM homeobox gene 4 (LHX4) transcription factor regulates early embryonic development of the anterior pituitary gland. Autosomal dominant mutations in LHX4 cause congenital hypopituitarism with variable combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). We report on a neonate with unexplained heart failure and minor physical anomalies, suggesting a midline defect. She was diagnosed with complete CPHD. Cardiac function was rescued by replacement with hydrocortisone and thyroxine; hypoglycaemia stopped under growth hormone therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a dysgenetic pituitary gland suggesting an early developmental defect. Array comparative genomic hybridization showed a maternally inherited 1.5-megabase microdeletion in 1q25.2q25.3, including the LHX4 gene. Haploinsufficiency of LHX4 likely explains the predominant pituitary phenotype in the proposita and we suggest variable intrafamilial penetrance of the inherited microdeletion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report on heart failure as a rare nonspecific symptom of treatable CPHD in the newborn. Variably penetrant pituitary insufficiency, including this severe and atypical presentation, can be correlated with LHX4 insufficiency and highlights the role of LHX4 for pituitary development."

Thyroid hormone deficiency in utero and in the first neonatal months is responsible for permanent damage. While foetal hypothyroidism is at present unavoidable, earlier diagnosis and initiation of treatment in neonates with CH is important and highly recommended. At the moment, the Italian screening program for CH allows diagnosis and treatment within the first month of life. In Italy, screening programs became obligatory only a short time ago. In some regions, they started a few years ago, whereas in others they have been carried out only in an irregular way and only a part of the population has been investigated. Therefore CH was diagnosed just on the basis of clinical signs, with a consequent delay in the initiation of substitutive therapy. We describe the case of a little girl with CH diagnosed when she was three years old. We report the results of this case follow-up study and we describe the features of her neuropsychological development to point out her improvement and permanent disorders.

Her decapacitating symptoms subsided after the first course of chemotherapy by etoposide, methotrexate, and actinomycin D-cyclophosphamide and vincristine (EMA-CO) regimen. The serum hCG level, which reflects the quantification of host tumor burden, returned to the reference range after the fifth course of chemotherapy and the thyroid function reached euthyroid status before the third course of chemotherapy; two final courses were administered after the hCG level became undetectable.

All but one patient had very low levels of endogenous T4 (below 1.0 mug/100 ml) before treatment. However, based on clinical signs and serum T4-1 values, all were judged to be euthyroid or sub-clinically hyperthyroid by L-T4 replacement during the observation period. L-T4 dosage was increased or decreased by 25 or 50 mug/day at 2-12 mo. intervals, and the TSH response to exogenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was tested sequentially at each dose of L-T4 until a normal or slightly suppressed TSH response was obtained The L-T4 dosage which was associated with normal TSH responsiveness to TRH (the adequate L-T4 dose) was high in infancy (10 mug/kg/day), decreasing with age to a level of 3-4 mug/kg/day in pubertal children (correlation coefficient r=-0.820, P less than 0.01). The adequate L-T4 dose observed between 4 and 12 yrs of age was lower than the usually recommended dose (4-6 vs. 7-8 mug/kg/day). On these L-T4 doses, serum T4I concentrations were significantly higher in patients under 5 yrs of age than in older patients (8.3+/-1.5 vs. 6.5+/-0.7 mug/100 ml, P less than 0.02). Serum triiodothyronine (T3) values were also elevated in young children, decreasing with age to the normal range. TSH responses to TRH were completely suppressed at the serum T4-I levels of 9 mug/100 ml and T3 of 250 ng/100 ml or less in 7 patients over 4 yrs of age, but not in 2 younger patients. Although the number of patients examined was limited, these results suggest that the pituitary threshold for feedback regulation of TSH secretion by T4 decreases with age in children with cretinism and the usually recommended replacement doses of L-T4 between 4 and 12 yrs of age are probably overestimated."

Corresponding cord-blood samples were obtained from all the neonates of the two groups. Twenty-three urinary samples in the former and 14 in the latter group were analysed for iodide levels to ascertain the degree of iodine deficiency. The results demonstrate that compared to the values seen in the Jos group the maternal serum T4, T3 and FT4I levels were significantly reduced in the iodine-deficient group, while TSH, TBG and thyroxine binding capacity were elevated. Cord serum samples showed a corresponding fall in T4 and FT4I levels in the group from the iodine-deficient region, while the T3 levels were significantly elevated with a concurrent significant rise in TSH and TBG levels. Significant correlations were found between the maternal and cord serum T4, TSH, TBG, thyroxine binding capacity and FT4I levels, but not T3. From these findings we suggest that fetal T3 plays an important defensive role against the danger of long-standing environmental iodine deficiency."

CD005253,0,9109607,0,Infant survival is improved by oral iodine supplementation.,"Although reports suggest that infant mortality is increased during iodine deficiency, the effect of iodine supplementation on infant mortality is unknown. A double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of oral iodized oil was conducted in Subang, West Java, Indonesia to evaluate the effect of iodine supplementation on infant mortality. Infants were allocated to receive placebo or oral iodized oil (100 mg) at about 6 wk of age and were followed to 6 mo of age. Six hundred seventeen infants were enrolled in the study. Infant survival was apparently improved, as indicated by a 72% reduction in the risk of death during the first 2 mo of follow-up (P < 0.05) and a delay in the mean time to death among infants who died in the iodized oil group compared with infants who died in the placebo group (48 days vs. 17.5 d, P = 0.06). Other infant characteristics associated with reduced risk of death included weight-for-age at base line, consumption of solid foods, female gender and recent history of maternal iodine supplementation. Oral iodized oil supplementation had a stronger effect on the mortality of males compared with females. This study suggests that oral iodized oil supplementation of infants may reduce infant mortality in populations at risk for iodine deficiency."

CD005253,0,15876159,0,The thyroid and pregnancy: a novel risk factor for very preterm delivery.,"The major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity is preterm delivery in general (< 37 completed weeks), and especially very preterm delivery (< 32 completed weeks). The objective of this study is to determine if either thyroid hormonal dysfunction and/or the presence of thyroid autoantibodies in the mother are associated with an increased risk of preterm and/or very preterm delivery. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed as a nested-case control study. There were 953 delivered gravidas enrolled between 1996 and 2002. Samples were collected at entry to care and stored at -70 degrees C. Cases included all women with preterm delivery (n = 124). Controls (n = 124) were randomly selected from among the 829 women who delivered at term (> 37 completed weeks). All samples were assessed for thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroperoxidase antibody, and thyroglobulin antibody. Gravidas with high thyrotropin (TSH) levels had a greater than threefold increase in risk of very preterm delivery. In some analyses, gravidas who tested positive for thyroglobulin antibody at entry to prenatal care also had a better than twofold increased risk of very preterm delivery. There were no significant associations between TSH level or thyroglobulin antibody positivity and the risk of moderately preterm delivery."

CD005253,0,16885714,0,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacotherapy of thionamides in pregnancy.,"Hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately 1 in every 1000 to 2000 pregnancies. Although the signs and symptoms of the disease are similar in the pregnant and nonpregnant patient, the complications of hyperthyroidism can have even more profound consequences for the mother and fetus during gestation. These include maternal heart failure, preeclampsia, miscarriage, and preterm labor; as well as fetal loss and low birth weight. Furthermore, thyroid function and laboratory testing for hyperthyroidism are altered in pregnancy. The gestational increase in thyroid size, increased thyroid-binding globulin levels, increased serum total T4 and total T3 levels, and decreased thyroid stimulating hormone levels often confuses the evaluation of the thyroid status in pregnancy. Worldwide, the thionamides-propylthiouracil, methimazole, and carbimazole-have been used in pregnancy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. However, propylthiouracil has been the drug of choice in the United States because it is believed to have less potential to induce fetal/neonatal hypothyrodism, to cross the placenta and into breast milk to a lesser degree, and to be less teratogenic than methimazole or carbimazole. None of the above have been substantiated in more recent studies. The pharmacokinetics of the thionamides in the pregnant and nonpregnant states, as well as the pharmacotherapeutic recommendation for hyperthyroidism will be reviewed."
CD005253,0,19106244,0,Time to reconsider nonsurgical therapy of benign non-toxic multinodular goitre: focus on recombinant human TSH augmented radioiodine therapy.,"The treatment of benign multinodular goitre (MNG) is controversial, but surgery is recommended in large compressive goitres. While some patients decline surgery others may have contraindications due to comorbidity, since MNG is prevalent in the elderly. Therefore, non-surgical treatment alternatives are needed. Until recently, levothyroxine therapy was the preferred non-surgical alternative, but due to low efficacy and potential side-effects, it is not recommended for routine use in recent international guidelines. Conventional radioiodine ((131)I) therapy has been used for two decades as an effective and safe alternative to surgery in the treatment of symptomatic non-toxic MNG. Since much higher activities of (131)I are employed when treating non-toxic rather than toxic MNG, there has been reluctance in many countries to use this treatment modality. Frequently, the (131)I -uptake in a non-toxic MNG is low, which makes (131)I therapy less feasible. Another challenge is the negative correlation between the initial goitre size and goitre volume reduction (GVR). With its ability to more than double the thyroid (131)I-uptake, recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) increases the absorbed radiation dose and thus enhances the GVR by 35-56% at the expense of up to fivefold higher rate of permanent hypothyroidism. An alternative strategy is to reduce the administered (131)I-activity with a factor corresponding to the rhTSH induced increase in (131)I-uptake. Hereby, the extrathyroidal irradiation can be reduced without compromising efficacy. Thus, although in its infancy, and still experimental, rhTSH-augmented (131)I therapy may profoundly alter the non-surgical treatment of benign non-toxic MNG."
CD005253,0,8099821,0,Clinical characteristics of congenital hypothyroidism detected by neonatal screening.,"Various clinical features have been prospectively evaluated in 18 infants with congenital hypothyroidism detected by the National Taiwan University Hospital screening program from January 1990 to May 1991. During the same period of time, 24 suspected cases with normal thyroid function at referral were similarly evaluated and used as controls. Among the various clinical features evaluated, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups for the following five items: feeding problems, constipation, dry skin, umbilical hernia and enlarged posterior fontanel. However, these findings were subtle and nonspecific. Even when the neonatal hypothyroid index (Quebec) was used for evaluation, only one-half of these hypothyroid babies had scores of more than two. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant difference in the thyroid function test between the two groups whether it was determined from the filter paper spot or the serum. Our observations clearly demonstrate the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism on clinical grounds only at an early age of life. This study also emphasizes the importance of biochemical screening in the early detection and treatment of hypothyroid infants."

CD005253,0,2634614,0,Postnatal triiodothyronine replacement and respiratory distress syndrome of the preterm infant.,"Improvements in the management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) include pre- and postnatal stimulation of pulmonary maturity, and triiodothyronine (T3) is believed to influence directly surfactant production. Its circulating levels are low in premature infants with RDS probably due to a low thyroxine T4-T3 hepatic conversion mechanism. While a state of hypotriiodothyroninemia exists at birth, we studied the influence of postnatal intravenous T3 administration on the course of RDS in preterm infants of less than 32 weeks' gestation. Fifty preterm infants with RDS were studied (mean gestational age 30.4 +/- 1.2 weeks and birth weight 1,180 +/- 220 g). They were at random assigned to treatment with 50 micrograms L-T3 (Thyrotardin) or to the control group. Mortality rate, peak oxygen concentrations, duration of artificial ventilation and development of major complications of RDS were the criteria to estimate the influence of T3 treatment on RDS. We failed to detect a statistically significant difference between the two groups in all of the mentioned criteria except for FiO2 concentrations required to maintain PaO2 between 50 and 60 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). These observations suggest a relative beneficial effect of T3 replacement on the course of RDS in preterm infants of less than 32 weeks of gestation."

Owing to the high reactivity of aryl calcium halides, low temperatures have to be maintained throughout the preparative procedures in order to avoid side reactions.

CD005253,0,10524565,0,Special features of Graves' disease in early childhood.,"Graves' disease (GD) is extremely rare in children younger than 4 years of age, but if not recognized and treated it can seriously interfere with growth and development. We report three unrelated children, all females, in whom GD occurred before the age of 3. These children presented with goiter, exophthalmos, tachycardia, and hyperactivity. Moreover, one showed a severe psychomotor delay, and had previously undergone surgery due to craniosynostosis; the other two manifested a language delay. All had high thyroid hormones and thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) serum levels that clearly indicated autoimmune hyperthyroidism. In all of them, the disease presumably had developed during the first or second year of life. No maternal history of GD was present in two. The third child was born to a mother affected with GD during pregnancy, but it is likely that her GD began to develop after 6 months of life. These children are being treated with methimazole, and treatment is still necessary after 32 months. TRAb levels were persistently high at follow-up. Psychological evaluation including language development at follow-up was appropriate for age in two children; the third child improved, but severe mental retardation is still evident. GD assessment in early childhood also needs to focus on psychological evaluation. Pediatricians should be aware of the possibility of permanent brain damage and craniosynostosis due to hyperthyroidism in infancy."

CD005253,0,18506207,0,Perchlorate exposure from food crops produced in the lower Colorado River region.,"The Colorado River shows low levels of perchlorate derived from aerospace- and defense-related fuel industries once located near the Las Vegas Wash. At sufficiently high dosages perchlorate can disrupt thyroid function by inhibiting uptake of iodide. The Colorado River is the primary source of irrigation water for most food crops grown in Southern California and Southwestern Arizona. The objective of this study was to evaluate potential perchlorate exposure from food crops produced in the lower Colorado River region (LCRR). The major food commodities produced in the region were sampled and perchlorate levels were determined by ion chromatography followed by detection using either conductivity or tandem mass spectrometry, depending on analyte levels. The Monte Carlo module of the Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model (DEEM) was used to derive an estimate of the 2-day average perchlorate intakes. Data were derived assuming that individuals residing in the LCRR get their fruits and vegetables from within the LCRR as well as from other areas in the United States, or assuming individuals living in the LCRR get their fruits and vegetables from the LCRR only. Perchlorate exposure estimates derived in this study are comparable to exploratory estimates by the US Food and Drug Administration. For infants and children, over 50% of the estimated perchlorate exposure was from milk. The relative impact of vegetables and fruit toward perchlorate exposure increased by age through adulthood. Cumulative perchlorate exposure estimates based on this hypothetical analysis could approach or exceed the NAS reference dose (RfD) for some population groups as drinking water levels exceeded 6 microg/l. However, few individuals are exposed to perchlorate in drinking water at levels above 4 microg/l in the United States and very few would be exposed to perchlorate levels exceeding the RfD, whether consuming food crops from within or outside the LCRR."

CD005253,0,2255574,0,Postnatal surge in serum calcitonin concentrations: no contribution to neonatal hypocalcemia in infants of diabetic mothers.,"It has been suggested that hypercalcitoninemia may contribute to neonatal hypocalcemia in infants of diabetic mothers (IDM). Because the role of calcitonin (CT) in Ca metabolism in humans is questionable, we hypothesized that serum CT peaks similarly after birth in IDM and controls and that serum Ca concentrations do not correlate with serum CT. Forty-seven term IDM (White classes B-RT) were compared with 31 controls. Controls were born after normal pregnancies, labors, and deliveries. Blood samples (cord and 24 h) were analyzed for Ca, Mg, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and CT. Repeated measures analysis showed increasing serum Mg, PTH, and CT, and decreasing Ca over time. The incidence of hypocalcemia was significantly higher in the diabetic group (p less than 0.01) and the incidence of hypomagnesemia was borderline significantly higher (p less than 0.06). There were no differences in cord or 24-h serum concentrations of CT between groups. In multiple regression analysis, serum Ca and PTH were correlated (p less than 0.02, R2 = 0.33), but not serum Ca and CT; the increase in serum PTH in relation to serum Ca at the nadir (24 h) correlated directly with serum Mg concentrations (R2 = 0.31, p less than 0.05). Thus, serum CT increases after birth irrespective of the rate of decrease of serum Ca in both IDM and controls; high CT concentrations observed after birth (as compared with adult norms) do not seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of neonatal hypocalcemia in IDM; and responsiveness of parathyroid gland at birth is adversely affected by hypomagnesemia, which supports the theory of functional hypoparathyroidism in Mg deficiency."

CD005253,0,26631051,0,"Iodine Status in Pregnant Women, Lactating Mothers, and Newborns in an Area with More Than Two Decades of Successful Iodine Nutrition.","Pregnant women, lactating mothers, and their newborns constitute the target population for prevention and control of iodine deficiency. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the iodine nutrition status among these vulnerable groups in an area with more than two decades of successful elimination of iodine deficiency. In this cross-sectional study conducted in health care centers of Tehran, 100 pregnant women and 84 lactating mothers and their newborn were randomly selected. Urinary iodine concentration and iodine content of salts were measured using the Sandell-Kolthoff and titration methods, respectively. Urinary iodine concentration <150 μg/L for pregnant women and <100 μg/L for lactating mothers and newborns was considered as iodine nutrition inadequacy, respectively. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was 103 (59-155) μg/L in pregnant women, 77 (42-194) μg/L in lactating mothers, and 198 (84-260) μg/L in newborns. Median (IQR) iodine content of salt was 26 (21-30) ppm and 25 (18-28) ppm in pregnant women and lactating mothers, respectively (P = 0.462). Iodine content of salt was significantly correlated with UIC of pregnant women (r = 0.24, P = 0.019), but no correlation was found among lactating mothers (r = 0.12, P = 0.316). Neonatal UIC was significantly correlated with iodine content of salt consumed by their mothers (r = 0.49, P = 0.001). Despite suboptimal iodine status among subgroups of Tehranian pregnant and lactating women, iodine nutrition status of newborns was within optimal levels, which may be explained by a compensatory mechanism in the mammary glands."

CD005253,0,6548082,0,Graves' disease in pregnancy years after hypothyroidism with recurrent passive-transfer neonatal Graves' disease in offspring. Therapeutic considerations.,"Symptoms and signs of severe hypothyroidism developed in a young woman at age 15. These symptoms progressed for a year; at age 16, she was found to have a firm goiter, thyroid autoantibodies, very low serum thyroxine and high thyrotropin values, indicating autoimmune thyroiditis with hypothyroidism. She received L-thyroxine, 0.20 mg per day, and was well until age 24 when she became pregnant. In the first trimester, manifestations indicative of hyperthyroidism developed; these were only ultimately recognized immediately after delivery of a 32-week still-born goitrous baby. Despite the discontinuation of thyroxine therapy, the hyperthyroidism persisted and was confirmed as Graves' disease by elevated thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and radioactive iodine uptake values, a diffuse scanning result, and the presence of thyroid-stimulating antibody. The patient was treated with propylthiouracil and became pregnant while receiving that regimen. Later, several months after delivery, the patient was treated with radioactive iodine, ultimately became hypothyroid, and has been treated ever since with thyroxine. She became pregnant again and, because of the continuing high titers of thyroid-stimulating antibody, received propylthiouracil, 100 mg daily, commencing in the third trimester of pregnancy, to avoid probable fetal hyperthyroidism due to the transplacental transfer of thyroid-stimulating antibody. In each of the last two pregnancies, when the infants were born, they seemed normal (because of the transplacental effect of propylthiouracil), but passive-transfer neonatal hyperthyroidism developed in each within 10 days after delivery, ultimately requiring treatment by conventional means. This case illustrates the following points: (1) Hyperthyroidism occasionally develops years after hypothyroidism. (2) In young women, high titers of thyroid-stimulating antibody may produce fetal and neonatal passive-transfer hyperthyroidism even at a time when the mother herself is no longer hyperthyroid; transplacental treatment of the fetus by maternal propylthiouracil ingestion may thus be necessary during the last trimester, but only when there is a high degree of probability that the fetus is at risk. (3) Because the infants had been protected in utero by the placental transfer of propylthiouracil, neonatal hyperthyroidism did not develop until several days after delivery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD005253,0,16648804,0,Congenital hypothyroidism in one of monozygotic twins: comparison of their long-term psychosomatic development.,"Authors present the long-term development of two monozygotic twin sisters. One of them was detected by newborn screening as athyreotic (gemelus A) and healthy gemelus B sister. Therapy in athyreotic girl started at 4 weeks after birth and was monitored in order to maintain serum thyroxine and TSH in normal range. Both sisters spent their chilhood and adolescence together in the same family, school and work together as tailors in the same factory. Their development was very similar. In order to detect subclinical difference of their development, the school achievements were tested using their school certificates. Studies were divided to testing mechanical memory, logical thinking and skills. The evaluation of all classes of school attendance (13 years) reveals subtle differences - deficit of patient at approximately 6-15% level, mainly in studies demanding skills. However, dynamic evaluation after years reveals that the worse results of the patient (gemelus A) occurred during the first years of basic school whereas during adolescence having attended the special school tailor, she attained better results than her healthy sister. It seems that mental deficit in early treated hypothyroid patient is not severe and varies even during the life. Problem of the fetal hypothyroidism is probably more related to the iodine deficiency, which assures necessity of thyroid hormones for athyreotic child from mother's or twin's normally supplemented thyroid glands."
CD005253,0,27534631,0,Assessing infant cognitive development after prenatal iodine supplementation.,"Little information is available on infant behavioral development outcomes of prenatal iodine supplementation in regions of mild to moderate iodine deficiency. Studies performed to date, all of which relied on global developmental assessments, have yielded inconsistent findings with regard to psychomotor development, negative findings with regard to mental development, and no information as to the development of specific cognitive functions. Our review of these studies leads us to suspect that the use of global developmental assessments might partially explain the negative and inconsistent findings. To identify cognitive processes that might be sensitive to prenatal iodine supplementation, we examined the timing of thyroid hormone action on specific brain systems. The development of infant visual attention is sensitive to thyroid hormone during the early prenatal period, when the fetus is entirely dependent on maternal thyroid hormone. For this reason, infant visual attention has the potential to be a sensitive measure of infant outcomes in prenatal iodine supplementation studies. We suggest the assessment of infant visual attention, with follow-up examination of childhood executive functions, as a means of capturing the effects of maternal iodine deficiency and prenatal iodine supplementation on specific cognitive processes. In particular, we propose comparison of infant performance on global developmental tests and specialized tests of visual attention in pilot trials of prenatal iodine supplementation in regions of mild to moderate iodine deficiency. Only by comparing the 2 types of tests side by side will it be possible to establish whether the use of a sensitive measure of infant visual attention will increase the reliability of such supplementation studies. Recognizing that exposure misclassification may also provide a partial explanation for the inconsistent neurodevelopmental outcomes in previous studies, we suggest that urinary iodine concentration or creatinine-corrected iodine excretion be monitored regularly in such trials throughout the prenatal period."
CD005253,0,21342119,0,The optimal treatment of thyroid gland function disturbances during pregnancy.,"Thyroid disorders are quite a common health problem in pregnant women, thus adequate treatment in this period is very important in order to decrease maternal and fetal morbidity. The prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated to be present in approximately 0.2-0.4% of all pregnancies and the most common is Graves disease. Untreated hyperthyroidism is connected with disturbed fertilisation, recurrent miscarriages, preeclampsia development, hypotrophy of the fetus, and haemorrhage in the postpartum period. Hypothyroidism is found in pregnant women in 0.3-0.7% of all cases. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism in pregnancy can lead to preterm birth, low birth weight and mental retardation. The goal of the treatment of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism is to reach a stable euthyroid state by applying thyroid hormones or antithyroid drugs, respectively. It seems that well-controlled management of thyroid diseases does not pose any problem for pregnancy. However, the most important is to avoid any neurological abnormalities in the fetus in hyperthyroid women resulting from antithyroid drugs exposure. Moreover, it is also crucial to abstain from subclinical hypothyroidism and hypothyroxinaemia in the mother and its effect on the fetus's development which merits exact screening and intense monitoring. In this paper we described the complex pharmacology of the drugs that are used in pregnant women suffering from thyroid disorders, considering the clinical application, practical recommendation, and side effects in pregnancy and lactation. This systematic analysis could contribute some pharmacological knowledge which will be helpful in the clinical management of thyroid disorders during pregnancy."
CD005253,0,12046751,0,Transfer of 131I into human breast milk and transfer coefficients for radiological dose assessments.,"Data on transfer of radioiodine into human milk are rare in the literature. Data from sixteen publications were reviewed and analyzed to estimate the transfer coefficient (f(hm)*, having units of d L(-1)). The data on the radioiodine concentration in breast milk were analyzed by two methods: direct numerical integration and integration of a fitted exponential model. In general, the integrated fitted functions were greater. The fitted functions likely better describe the transfer into milk since few data sets sampled mothers' milk near the time of maximum excretion. The derived transfer coefficient values seem to represent two populations. The first group was those individuals who had very low excretions, including those where thyroid and mammary uptake was impaired by the administration of stable iodine or iodinated compounds. The second group included those with much higher excretions. The second group, termed the ""normal-excretion"" group, had transfers of iodine to milk that were more than ten-fold higher than in the ""low-excretion"" group. The derived milk transfer coefficient data for the low- and normal-excretion groups fitted to lognormal distributions gave geometric means, (geometric standard deviations), of 0.043 d L(-1) (2.1, n = 14) and 0.37 d L(-1) (1.5, n = 12), respectively. Estimates of the effective half-time (time from maximum concentration to half the value) were determined for the low- and normal-excretion groups separately. There was evidence that the effective half-time was longer for the normal- than for the low-excretion group; the geometric mean (and geometric standard deviation) were 12 (1.7) and 8.5 (2.6) h, respectively, though the difference was not statistically significant. The geometric mean times to maximum milk concentration in the low- and normal-excretion groups were nearly identical, 9.4 (3.1) and 9.0 (1.6) h, respectively. The data show that administration of large doses of stable iodine (commonly used to block uptake of iodine into the thyroid) is also an effective means to block radioiodine transfer into milk. Thus, protecting the mother's thyroid also protects the nursing infant. Despite inadequacies of available data describing the transfer of radioiodine to human milk within a healthy population of women, the values of f(hm)* provided here are believed to be the best available for use in radiological assessments. These values are particularly applicable to lactating women having normal diets and availability to stable iodine, as in the United States."

The region of Göttingen is known to be an iodine-deficient one. Sixteen goitrous, hypothyroid neonates with a low total thyroxine, and raised serum TSH concentration were first diagnosed through this screening programme. As a result of the intra-uterine iodine deficiency, serum triiodothyronine concentration was elevated while urinary iodine excretion was reduced compared with euthyroid neonates. During iodine treatment the size of the thyroid became normal within eight days, TSH after 3.8 days and serum thyroxine after three days. Serum triiodothyronine concentration remained elevated for several weeks, presumably as a result of the persisting iodine deficiency.

The studies were performed on days 1, 7 and 14 and the results compared to those obtained in 13 healthy neonates with the gestational age of 39.2 weeks (range: 38-41 weeks) (Group III). Asphyxiated neonates had significantly higher plasma uric acid, xanthine, hypoxanthine and creatinine levels (p < 0.05), while their GFR proved to be markedly reduced (p < 0.01) when compared to the values of healthy controls. Moreover, there was a significant elevation of urinary excretion of NAGA (p < 0.001), urine osmolality (p < 0.05), PENa, FECa, RFI (p < 0.05) in infants presenting with perinatal asphyxia. Renal tubular responsiveness to aldosterone measured as TTKG was also found to be depressed (p < 0.025). In response to thyroxine therapy renal functional recovery appeared to be accelerated as indicated by the lower plasma creatinine level, lower rate of fractional electrolyte and urinary NAGA excretion and improved reactivity to aldosterone on days 7 and/or 14 as compared to those obtained in neonates presenting with asphyxia but without thyroxine therapy. The results seem to suggest that thyroid hormones may have an important role in the recovery of renal functions in newborn infants suffering from perinatal asphyxia."

This process does not allow normal maturation into compact lamellar bone. Two cases of severely affected children are presented which demonstrate that the condition can be diagnosed in early infancy by abnormalities in the long bones. At this stage the skull may appear normal and the characteristic thickening of the calvarium appears later. The disease is treatable with human thyrocalcitonin; these and previously reported cases have responded favorably.

There is substantial evidence that reduced breast-feeding, small-for-gestational-age birth weight, Fe and I deficiency, and protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) are associated with long-term deficits in cognition and school achievement. However, all these conditions are associated with poverty and poor health, which may account for the association. It is difficult to establish that the long-term relationship is causal, as it requires a randomized treatment trial with long-term follow-up. Such studies are only available for I deficiency in utero and early childhood PEM. Results from these studies indicate that I deficiency has a long-term effect and PEM probably has a long-term effect."

The male infant who was born by spontaneous delivery at 35 weeks of gestational age presented with fever, tachycardia and tachypnea at rest on day 11 after birth, and developed severe apnea on day 14. Thyroid function studies revealed hyperthyroidism in the infant, and his mother was confirmed to have Grave's disease during pregnancy. Literature review showed that among the 33 infants with similar conditions, tachycardia, tachypnea and poor weight gain were the most distinct clinical features of congenital hyperthyroidism. Accurate diagnosis of Graves' disease in the mother during pregnancy and awareness of the clinical presentations of neonatal hyperthyroidism are key to reducing missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis of neonatal hyperthyroidism."
CD005253,0,21877603,0,Role of serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.,"This cross sectional observational study was done in the division of neonatology, department of pediatrics, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) in the year 2007. The study population was 50 newborns in total who needed evaluation of sepsis on clinical suspicion. The main objective of this study was to assess serum procalcitonin (PCT) as a better diagnostic marker than C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in neonatal sepsis. The total study populations were classified into 4 groups like highly probable, probable, and possible and no sepsis group according to the clinical and blood parameters. PCT and CRP were assessed and compared by statistical analysis. For the estimation of PCT and CRP, venous blood was drawn and centrifuged and stored at - 20 degrees C in the refrigerator. Later on PCT was measured by rapid semi quantitative immunochromatographic test. Level of CRP was determined by semi quantitative method (latex). All data were analyzed by SPSS version 10 windows. For statistical analysis appropriate tests were done. In all observations sepsis was found to be more common in male newborns and in those who were delivered by caesarean section. In low birth weight and preterm newborns sepsis was more prevalent. Premature rupture of membrane (PROM) was found to be the commonest maternal clinical condition as a risk factor of sepsis. There was positive correlation between serum PCT and CRP and values of serum PCT as well as CRP differed significantly in the different categories of sepsis indicating relation to the severity of sepsis. PCT is a useful, sensitive and independent biomarker of neonatal sepsis. CRP measurement along with PCT measurement may increase the specificity. Though PCT measurement is comparatively expensive but an easy bed side promt convenient procedure for sick neonates in addition to CRP for rapid evaluation of neonatal sepsis rather than waiting for the report of blood culture."
CD005253,0,17214193,0,Newborn screening for certain treatable inborn errors of metabolism in Alexandria.,"The study was conducted on two groups of newborn infants: Group A; a random sample of 3000 infants attending different Health offices in Alexandria for BCG vaccination. Their ages ranged from 5-120 days with a mean age of 39.9 days. Group B; included all the infants born to high risk families attending the clinic of Human Genetics Department, Medical Research Institute (9 infants; 7 with family history of PKU and 2 with family history of congenital hypothyroidism). Their ages ranged from 7 to 60 days with a mean age of 18 days. The newborn infants of the two groups were screened for three treatable inborn errors of metabolism, phenylketonuria ""PKU"", galactosemia and congenital hypothyroidism with the aim of early detection and therapy to prevent mental retardation. In group A; one baby with transient hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (0.33%) and one presumptive case of galactosemia (0.33%) were found. Initial positive results were found in eleven infants they had high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). On reevaluation of nine infants of them they were all euthyroids. In Group B, four infants were detected among the infants of PKU families. After confirmation of these results breast feeding was stopped at once and the infants started their dietary management and were kept on it with follow up and periodic evaluation of the adequacy of treatment."

Goiters appearing during childhood are the result of distinct diseases and should be investigated rather than attributed to ""physiologic hyperplasia."" The etiology of the diffuse goiter can often be established by clinical evaluation, performing thyroid function tests, and measurement of serum thyroid antibodies. Unlike diffuse goiters, thyroid nodules frequently require tissue examination to exclude malignancy. The goal in evaluating children with nodular goiters is to be as selective as possible in submitting children to surgery without missing cases of cancer. The decision to perform an open biopsy should be based on detecting increased risk for cancer in the medical history, physical examination, or laboratory tests as outlined in Figure 1. Ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration of nodules are two new methods that aid in the selection of patients for surgery or a trial of thyroid hormone suppression."

CD005253,0,3584857,0,Cord blood iodothyronine and thyrotropin concentrations in newborns of mothers exposed to povidone iodine in the last trimester.,"In the present study, we have evaluated thyroid function in neonates at delivery and in their mothers who used vaginal povidone-iodine (PVP-I) during the last trimester of pregnancy. Newborns and their mothers without a history of iodine exposure, admitted to the same department and residing in the same geographical area served as controls. Maternal serum thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations at delivery were not significantly different between the two groups of pregnant women. Cord blood thyroid hormone concentrations in the newborns of iodine exposed mothers were not significantly different from those in control newborns. In contrast, cord blood TSH concentrations in the neonates of mothers exposed to PVP-I during the last trimester of pregnancy were significantly higher than values in control neonates (p less than 0.05). These data confirm that the fetal thyroid gland, even in the last trimester of pregnancy, does not adapt completely to the inhibitory action of iodine on thyroid hormone synthesis and/or release."

Also, the concentration of thyroid hormones in this group differs from that of neonates full term with the adequate body weight. In 1998, in southeastern Poland, a repeated screening for TSH level in blood spots on filter paper was introduced among neonates with low and very low birth-weight. The purpose of this work was the exclusion of late appearing transient hypothyroidism, as well as the verification of falsely positive results in the basic test. Newborns with low and very low birth-weight comprise nearly 5% of live births in the region. During 1998-2001, 4,445 children with body weight below 2500 g were tested. Tests for TSH level in blood on filter paper were carried out in neonates between three and six days of age and also at the end of the first month of life. TSH levels in blood on filter paper were estimated using the LIA method (Byk Sangtec Diagnostica). The results were divided into two groups: those with correct TSH, that is < 15 mIU/L, and those with a raised level 3 15 mIU/L. The repeated test confirmed the correct result in nearly 100% of the neonates, while in 20 (0.5%) showed the increase of TSH level above 15 mIU/L. TSH and fT4 monitoring followed by serum determinations during treatment showed primary hypothyroidism in 10 children and hyperthyrotropinemia in 5 cases."
CD005253,0,8777662,0,Endocrine and metabolic adaptation following caesarean section or vaginal delivery.,"The endocrine profile (umbilical venous plasma) of three groups of infants was compared.

Mean umbilical plasma concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly higher and cortisol concentration were lower after elective caesarean section compared with the two labour groups. Mean umbilical plasma thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration was significantly lower after vaginal delivery compared with elective caesarean section. These results suggest that labour reduces plasma thyroid hormone concentrations at birth in association with a rise in cortisol. These adaptations may be the stimulus for the subsequent surge in triiodothyronine previously reported to occur over the first few hours after birth in vaginally delivered infants."

These mothers continued taking propylthiouracil after delivery and breast-fed exclusively (two mothers supplemented their breast milk with a small amount of baby food). The cord free T4 level was slightly but uniformly below the normal range in all eight infants, and the cord TSH level was above the normal in seven infants. The dose of propylthiouracil after delivery ranged from 50 to 300 mg daily, which was equal to, or higher than, that before delivery. All these abnormal values normalized in the infant after birth. Serum samples, from seven of the eight mothers, taken at delivery were examined for TSH receptor antibodies; all were positive. The antibody titre, however, was too low, and/or free T4 and TSH levels were examined too long after delivery, for the antibodies to be the cause of the restoration of the infants' thyroid function. These results assure the safety of breast-feeding for the infants of mothers with Graves' disease taking propylthiouracil."

Treatment with 1-thyroxin was initiated at the age of 10.4 +/- 2.5 days and supervised by T4 and TSH monitoring in 3-6 monthly intervals. Although clinical signs were mild or missing, skeletal maturation was prenatal in more than half. Developmental testing was carried out at 1, 4 and 7 years by the Brunet-Lezine (n = 60), the non-verbal Snijders-Oomen (n = 40), and the german version of the Wechsler intelligence test (n = 20), respectively. The global DQ/IQ in all but a few children at each age group are within the 3rd and 97th percentile of the DQ/IQ distribution in a control group tested during the same period of time. The mean values of all global and subscores, however, are lower than that one in the control group, differences being highly significant at 1 year. In 21 of our 60 children, associated findings and/or risk factors were present. The DQ/IQ in children without risk factors are identical to that of the control group. There are no significant DQ/IQ differences neither between athyroidism and ectopic thyroid glands, nor between prenatal bone age and normal skeletal maturation at diagnosis. We assume that the favourable results in our children with C.H. may be ascribed to the early onset of thyroid hormone replacement and the strictly controlled compliance."

Furthermore, thyroid autoimmunity per se seems to be associated with complications such as miscarriage and preterm delivery. While strong evidence clearly demonstrates that overt dysfunctions (hyper- or hypothyroidism) have deleterious effects on pregnancy, subclinical disease, namely subclinical hypothyroidism, has still to be conclusively defined as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. Additionally, other conditions, such as isolated hypothyroxinemia and thyroid autoimmunity in euthyroidism, are still clouded with uncertainty regarding the need for substitutive treatment."

The elevated blood pressure was associated with metabolic alkalosis and urinary chloride wastage. The family history was unremarkable. Her urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine concentrations were all normal. A renal ultrasound was normal. A technetium-99m diethylenetriaminopentoacetic acid (DTPA) renal scan with captopril showed normal blood flow bilaterally. The head ultrasound and echocardiogram were normal. Blood epinephrine, norepinephrine, catecholamines, thyroxine, and steroid levels were also normal. Treatment with various combinations of labetalol, hydralazine, captopril, methyldopa, nifedipine, and spironolactone, all at high doses, failed to control the elevated blood pressure. Serum aldosterone level and peripheral plasma renin activity were low. The lack of therapeutic response to spironolactone, with a good response to amiloride and recurrence of hypertension and metabolic alkalosis after amiloride cessation that was subsequently treated with amiloride, established the diagnosis of Liddle syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient with Liddle syndrome that has been reported in the literature."
CD005253,0,7649523,0,The importance of thyroglobulin levels in monitoring the treatment of congenital hypothyroidism.,"We have previously reported on high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in clinically euthyroid children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) undergoing appropriate treatment. Whether this TSH is biologically active or not is still unclear. It has been shown that ectopic thyroid tissue does not involute during thyroxine (T4) therapy and thus can continue to secrete thyroglobulin (Tg). This study was undertaken to determine whether the Tg levels in ectopic CH infants represent residual thyroid tissue stimulated by biologically active TSH and whether this Tg can be used to help monitor CH treatment. Among the 51 primary CH children (age 2-14 years) diagnosed and followed up by us, 28 had measurable Tg values (> 2 pmol/l) several years after the T4 treatment had been started. In 8 of the children, Tg was measured as early as the time of diagnosis and followed up for at least 3 years. The Tg levels decreased much more slowly than the TSH levels did, and secondary Tg rises were observed. By 5 months of age, all children had Tg levels less than 25 pmol/l. Although in some infants the Tg levels paralleled TSH behavior, in others the TSH-Tg correlation was not so obvious. In another group of 8 children who had high TSH values despite normal T4, the LT4 replacement dosage was increased by 60% for 1 week (from 3.5 +/- 0.2 to 5.5 +/- 0.5 micrograms/kg/day) in order to examine the TSH-Tg dependence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD005253,0,1492430,0,Assessment of the iodine status in children aged 2-3 years.,"In 22 healthy toddlers (age: 2.5 +/- 0.06 years; from families living in Dortmund, FRG) measurements of iodine and creatinine concentrations were carried out in spontaneous urine samples collected in the afternoon (U1), as well as during the night (U2). Median iodine-creatinine ratios found in the ""afternoon specimens"" U1 were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) compared to U2 (181.3 vs. 119.5 micrograms/g). Higher values in U1 than in U2 were also obtained when total daily iodine excretion (under the assumption of an average creatinine excretion of 15 mg/kg/d for infants) was calculated and the corresponding data were related to body surface area (BSA). The results of the specimens collected during the night were (after expressing as iodine-creatinine ratio as well as after correcting for BSA) comparable with the excretion data of accurately timed 24-h urine collections obtained in a separate group of toddlers (n = 23) of nearly the same age. When the iodine-creatinine ratios established by the WHO--after standardizing with BSA--were taken as criteria for iodine deficiency, then in both study groups (spontaneous urine samples at night (U2) and timed 24-h urine collections) about half of the infants would fall in the deficiency state II with an elevated risk for iodine-deficiency goiter. It is suggested that the nutritional status of iodine can be reliably monitored (in infants) by determining iodine and creatinine concentrations in overnight urine samples and relating the data to BSA."

At the present time, of all biological interventions in these developmental disorders, drug treatment alone remains a valuable addition or an essential treatment modality of the total treatment. Experience has shown that a therapeutically effective potent drug can make the autistic child more amenable to other therapies, including special education. However, knowledge is lacking about the effect of various psychoactive agents on cognition in this patient population as well as their influence on growth, weight, endocrine systems, and organs. Drugs currently in use treat symptoms, not diseases. A great need for classification in this area persists. The same symptoms may be caused by a variety of etiologic factors, and autism may or may not be the earliest expression of childhood schizophrenia. It is suggested that clinical distinctions be correlated or even improved by certain biochemical, neuroendocrine, and physiological criteria; this also may be of considerable value in predicting whether a child can benefit from a specific drug."

However, concern still exists about central nervous system sequelae which may persist due to a period of untreated intrauterine hypothyroidism. Presence of polyhydramnios led to the ultrasound diagnosis of a fetal goiter. Hypothyroidism was confirmed at 34 weeks gestation by percutaneous fetal blood sampling, which revealed an elevated TSH (186 mU/L) and a low T4 (19.3 nmol/L). Intraamniotic fluid injections of 500 micrograms levothyroxine sodium (T4) every 10-14 days increased fetal serum T4 (59.2 nmol/L), decreased fetal serum TSH (14 mU/L), decreased amniotic fluid TSH, and decreased the size of the fetal goiter. The infant was born at term without perinatal complications. Thyroid function studies on cord blood were normal (T4, 109.4 nmol/L; TSH, 1.3 mU/L), and the infant was discharged on oral T4. Follow-up examination at age 6 weeks revealed that the infant was developmentally normal and clinically and chemically euthyroid. Intrauterine T4 therapy can suppress fetal TSH and treat fetal hypothyroidism despite hypothyroid levels of serum T3. Highly sensitive TSH assays may allow the use of amniotic fluid TSH as a marker for fetal hypothyroidism."

Intra-amniotic injection of l-thyroxine (T4) was performed with a weekly dose of 150 microg four times between 33 and 36 weeks' gestation. In response to this in utero treatment, the goiter was reduced and polyhydramnios was improved. The mother gave birth to a healthy live male infant with normal thyroid function. From our case report and review of previous literature, we recommend that the amount of l-thyroxine start as low as 150 microg, and that repeat cordocentesis be avoided as long as other clinical and laboratory parameters indicate improvement of the fetal conditions."

With screening, developmental prognosis is considerably improved, but follow-up studies still report developmental delay compared to controls. To explain the delay, most studies have focused on effects of CH severity, supposedly caused by prenatal hypothyroidism. Nonoptimal treatment could also be an explanatory factor. Treatment guidelines have changed; now, a higher levothyroxine starting dose is recommended. In this review, we first summarize outcome studies in CH versus controls and in mild versus severe CH. Second, we report results on the association between levothyroxine treatment variables and developmental outcome. Six research groups have reported results on the association between levothyroxine starting dose and intelligence, and eight groups on the association between circulating thyroid hormones and intelligence. Most studies found a positive association between a high level of treatment, primarily treatment during the first year and later intelligence. However, negative associations between high-dose treatment and outcome have been reported, and the question of optimal treatment in relation to developmental outcome has not been answered. Effects of high levothyroxine dosage should be documented in samples that have been treated according to recent recommendations."
CD005253,0,10204155,0,Use of brachytherapy to preserve function in children with soft-tissue sarcomas.,"Pediatric soft-tissue sarcomas are managed with a multimodality treatment program that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and external-beam radiotherapy (teletherapy). The use of teletherapy in young children can result in significant long-term toxicities (especially growth retardation of bones and organs). Brachytherapy, if feasible, is an attractive alternative for the treatment of pediatric soft-tissue sarcomas, since it irradiates small volumes and, thus, may potentially minimize complications. Aggressive chemotherapy is used to achieve systemic control and tumor shrinkage, thereby facilitating conservative surgery and brachytherapy. The brachytherapy techniques used in children are similar to those employed in adults. Low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy with manually afterloaded removable iridium-192 is commonly used, although it is associated with some radiation exposure hazards. Low-energy radionuclides (e.g., iodine-125) and remote afterloading technology have been used to reduce radiation exposure hazards. Brachytherapy, in conjunction with chemotherapy and surgery but without supplementary teletherapy, has produced good local control with acceptable late complications in selected patients with localized tumors. Brachytherapy can also be used as a boost to moderate dose external-beam radiotherapy for more extensive tumors. The use of newer modalities, such as high-dose-rate, pulsed-dose-rate, and intraoperative brachytherapy, has allowed brachytherapy to be given to younger children and infants, but the long-term morbidities of these modalities need to be established."

CD005253,0,19874948,0,Iodine: it's important in patients that require parenteral nutrition.,"Iodine deficiency has multiple adverse effects on growth and development because of inadequate thyroid hormone production. Four methods are generally recommended for assessment of iodine nutrition: urinary iodine concentration, thyroid size, and blood concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroglobulin. Iodine intakes < or = 1 mg/d are well tolerated by most adults, because the thyroid is able to adjust to a wide range of intakes. A daily dose of 1 microg iodine/kg body weight is recommended for infants and children receiving parenteral nutrition (PN), but this is far below their requirement. Daily iodine requirements in adults receiving enteral nutrition or PN are estimated to be 70-150 microg, but most PN formulations do not contain iodine. Despite this, deficiency is unlikely because absorption from iodine-containing skin disinfectants and other adventitious sources can provide sufficient iodine. However, if chlorhexidine replaces iodine-containing disinfectants for catheter care, iodine deficiency may occur during long-term PN, and periodic testing of thyroid functions may be prudent. Infants may be particularly vulnerable because of their small thyroidal iodine store, but available data do not yet support routine supplementation of preterm infants with iodine. Adults may be less vulnerable because thyroidal iodine stores may be able to support thyroid hormone production for several months. More studies to clarify this issue would be valuable."
CD005253,0,12585338,0,Effect of hypothyroidism and its treatment on the IGF system in infants and children.,"We performed a study on infants and children with hypothyroidism to determine the effect of hypothyroidism and its correction on components of the IGF system. A total of 35 patients were subdivided into four groups based on age and severity of the disease. Serum concentrations of immunoreactive IGF-I, free IGF-I, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 were measured before and after treatment and compared to controls matched for age, sex and puberty. Baseline total IGF-I (TIGF-I) concentrations were significantly lower prior to treatment in the infants with severe hypothyroidism and increased significantly after thyroxine therapy. Baseline free IGF-I (FIGF-I) concentration was significantly lower prior to treatment in infants with severe hypothyroidism when compared to controls but did not increase significantly after treatment. In infants with severe and compensated hypothyroidism, IGFBP-3 concentrations prior to treatment were lower when compared to controls. These concentrations increased during treatment. Baseline IGFBP-2 levels did not differ from the control values in both these groups but decreased significantly after correction of the hypothyroidism. Although these changes appeared to occur with thyroxine therapy, multiple regression analysis suggested that age was a more important determinant of the changes observed in these parameters than serum thyroxine concentration. In children with acquired hypothyroidism no difference in any of these parameters was noted between hypothyroid patients and controls. TIGF-I increased significantly on thyroxine therapy, but the difference was small. No significant differences were noted in other measured parameters with thyroxine therapy. In older children with compensated hypothyroidism no significant differences were noted in any of the measured parameters in the pretreatment, post-treatment and control groups. In conclusion, although changes appear in TIGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2 in infants with congenital hypothyroidism when they are treated with thyroxine, age appears to be the more important determinant of these changes than does thyroxine concentration. In older children with acquired hypothyroidism, TIGF-I and FIGF-I levels were not significantly lower than in age- and sex-matched controls. After treatment only TIGF-I levels increased."

There are several reasons why infants are missed in the screening program. We report on three patients with congenital hypothyroidism, who had a pathological screening result and initiation of therapy was delayed. The first patient had an increased TSH level, but she was missed because of mistakes in the confirmatory serum test. During the follow-up the patient showed typical symptoms of hypothyroidism and got a thyroxine supplementation not before the age of three years. The second patient did not get a therapy before the age of six months because of the noncompliance of the parents and physicians. The third patient had a central hypothyroidism. The neonatal screening-program revealed no measurable TSH activity. Although the child had clinical signs of a severe hypothyroidism diagnosis was not made before the age of 5.5 months. Although different reasons are known for screening errors, all these 3 patients were missed because of failures in the follow-up of a pathological screening result, indicating a poor quality in the follow-up procedure."

Two hundred fifty-three infants were randomized to receive either 6 micro g.kg(-1).d(-1) of T(3) with 1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) of hydrocortisone or 5% dextrose (placebo) as a continuous i.v. infusion for 7 d. The dose was halved on d 5. Our first primary outcome was death or ventilator dependence at 1 wk, and the second was death or oxygen dependence at 2 wk. The overall mortality rate for both groups was 11.4%. Relative risk of death or ventilator dependence at 1 wk, treated versus placebo, was 0.87, p = 0.2, and death or oxygen dependence at 2 wk, 1.00, p = 0.9. We examined the relationship between free T(3) (FT(3)) and free thyroxine (FT(4)) levels in the first 7 d and the primary outcome death or ventilator dependence at 1 wk in all 253 babies. We found significant positive correlations of p = 0.05 for FT(3) and p = 0.002 for FT(4). Thus the higher the FT(3) and FT(4) levels, the better the outcome. No beneficial effects of T(3) and hydrocortisone were shown. In this study, although FT(3) levels were doubled by the treatment infusion, FT(4) levels were significantly suppressed. The lack of any beneficial effect of T(3) in our study may be explained by suppression of FT(4) in the treatment group."

The radiographic appearances include widening of the diaphyses, vertebral osteoporosis, acetabular protrusion, and thickening of the skull vault. There is considerable variability in phenotype, with some cases diagnosed in infancy and others in later childhood. Most cases appear to arise from inactivating mutations in the gene encoding osteoprotegerin, a product of osteoblasts that is critically involved in osteoclastogenesis.

Analysis of nutritional causes and study of their consequences].,"Randomized subjects (n = 294), (35 young children, 6-30 months old--91 children 8.6 +/- 0.7 years, 116 teenagers 13.2 +/- 1.9 y--52 young women 28.5 +/- 6.1 y) leaving in a mountainous area of Reunion Island (Cirque de Salazie) were evaluated according to the following: a questionnaire related to food intake, cervical palpation for thyroid size evaluation and collections of urine and foods (natural and mineral water, breast and commercial milk and salt) for iodine measurement. Neonatal TSH of 308 new borns in Salazie were compared to TSH of 300 new-borns of Lille (France). The prevalence of goiter increases with age (0% in young children, 12.1% in children, 23.3% in teenagers, 38.4% in women) whereas median urinary iodine (microgram/dl) decreases in the same groups (12-7.8-5.6-4.2). The intake of milk and dairy products significantly decreases from children to adults. Neonatal TSH values are significantly higher in Salazie than in Lille (p < 0.005). Natural and mineral water, breast milk and salt contain little iodine. In conclusion iodine deficiency is present in this area of Reunion Island with a significant increment of neonatal TSH values."

CD005253,0,11238503,0,Maternal isodisomy for chromosome 2p causing severe congenital hypothyroidism.,"Severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) due to a total iodide organification defect (TIOD) is usually due to mutations in the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene located at chromosome 2p25. A homozygous deletion [DeltaT2512 (codon 808)] in exon 14 was identified in a patient with classical TIOD. The transmission pattern of the TPO gene in this family was anomalous; the mother was heterozygous for the deletion; and the mutation was absent in the father. Polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) markers confirmed paternity and demonstrated on chromosome 2 that the propositus was homozygous for most markers on chromosome 2p and that these were identical to one of the maternal 2p homologs. A normal karyotype was found in the propositus, his parents and sister. We conclude that the homozygosity in the patient is due to partial maternal isodisomy of the short arm of chromosome 2, carrying a defective TPO gene. The patient, born small for gestational age, develops and grows well and appears healthy (while being treated with thyroxine) and has a normal phenotype except for a unilateral preauricular skin tag. This shows that partial maternal isodisomy for chromosome 2p (2pter - 2p12) is compatible with a minimal influence on normal development."

CD005253,0,18426362,0,A novel homozygous missense mutation of the dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) gene in an adult patient with large goiter.,"To describe the first adult case of large goiter associated with a novel R1110Q mutation in the dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) gene. She was initially euthyroid, and developed hypothyroidism later in her forties. DUOX2 is an essential enzyme in iodine organification of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Only infant cases of congenital hypothyroidism due to mutations of the DUOX2 gene have been reported. Biallelic mutation of DUOX2 is thought to lead to total iodine organification defect. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENT: This 57-year-old woman became first aware of goiter around the age of 20 years. Since the goiter had enlarged gradually, she consulted us at the age of 32 years. Goiter was soft, and thyroid function was normal. Antithyroid antibodies were negative. Both physical and mental development was normal. Three of her nine siblings and her mother had large goiters. At the age of 44 years, thyroid function demonstrated subclinical hypothyroidism. She started to take levo-thyroxine at a dose of 100 mug/day to reduce goiter. At the age of 56 years, goiter size remained the same. The perchlorate discharge rate was 72.8%, suggesting partial iodine organification defect. Thus, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene and DUOX2 gene were analyzed."

At the age of 30 days when all infants were fed only with breast milk (BM) serum iCT and iPTH levels were normal. During the second month 7 infants were fed with BM only (control group) and 6 infants were supplemented with formula (supplemented group). At the age of 66 days, mean +/- S.D. serum iPTH concentration was higher in the supplemented group than in the control group: 169 +/- 79 vs. 60 +/- 33 microliterEq/ml (p less than 0.01). Serum iCT levels remained undetectable (less than 150 pg/ml) in both groups. Plasma 25-OH-CC concentrations were normal and similar in both groups. Serum iPTH concentrations were positively correlated with phosphorus intake and negatively correlated with calcium intake from BM only. The results suggest that secondary hyperparathyroidism can be detected in very low birthweight infants supplemented with a formula, probably because of a phosphorus load or decreased intestinal absorption of calcium."

CD005253,0,12832032,0,Human iodine requirements determined by the saturation kinetics model.,"Iodine plays a decisive role in metabolism and the process of early growth and development of most organs, especially of the brain. Effects of iodine deficiency include goiter, stillbirth and miscarriage, neonatal and juvenile thyroid deficiency, dwarfism, mental defects, deaf mutism, spastic weakness and paralysis. In this study, the application of a mathematical model (derived from Machaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics) to iodine measured in urine samples from a randomly selected group derived from the Egyptian village of West El-Mawhoub in the Dakhlah Oasis resulted in the conclusion that iodine excretion parameters can be used to characterize iodine utilization and accurately predict the level of salt iodination required to maintain proper physiological functions. The four parameter saturation kinetics model analysis indicated that a salt iodination level of 63 mg/kg reduced the severity of IDD, with 83% of the studied subjects having urinary excretion levels of 1.18 micromol/L. This gives a convenient mechanism for providing adequate dietary iodine with a non-invasive index for the avoidance of IDD. Commercially available salt was analyzed using standard iodiometric titration methods to determine iodination levels. Analysis revealed that only 20% of the commercially available salt complied with the manufacturer's label and revealed the presence of large individual variability between batches amounting to -95 to +150% of the claimed iodine level. Therefore, salt iodination requires careful supervision to ensure that promised iodine levels are being delivered and consumed."

Prior to the application of povidone-iodine cream, the isolation rate of S. aureus from the nasal cavity was 30% for the physicians and nurses in contact with NICU patients (contact group), not significantly different from the 33.3% rate for other hospital staff (control group). The isolation rate for the contact group decreased to 10.5% after application of the cream. Although MRSA was not isolated from the nasal cavity of those in the control group, it was isolated from 13.3% of those of the contact group before application of the cream. Nasal MRSA disappeared after use of the cream. No adverse reactions or abnormalities in serum levels of thyroid hormone-related substances were observed in any of the subjects. These results indicated that the nasal application of povidone-iodine cream is safe and effective for eradicating MRSA in the nasal cavity."

CD005253,0,7879999,0,[The therapy of congenital hypothyroidism].,"In congenital hypothyroidism precocious diagnosis and consequent replacement therapy are necessary to prevent neurological irreversible damage caused by postnatal thyroid hormone deficiency. Synthetic L-thyroxine is the useful drug, that has to be administered in fasting condition to have the best absorption. Some points about the treatment are still discussed, such initial L-thyroxine dosage, biochemical control parameters and psycho-intellectual outcome in treated patients. The mean initial dosage in Italy increased from 7.5 +/- 2.2 micrograms/kg/day in 1987-90 period to 8.5 +/- 2.5 micrograms/kg/day in 1991, at a mean starting age of 34 and 26 days respectively. Therefore the dosage is modulated on the basis of serum levels of thyroid hormones and clinical signs. Some patients, in spite of a correct dosage of L-thyroxine, show a deficient suppression of TSH circulating level. In our experience this finding is sometimes due to the non-observance of the fasting condition when the drug is administered. Patients precociously identified by neonatal screening and correctly treated have a good mental and statural prognosis. In these patients, the psycho-intellectual development is better than in those diagnosed later clinically."

CD005253,0,1493368,0,Outcome of thyroid function in newborns from mothers treated with amiodarone.,"Amiodarone, a drug extensively used as an antiarrhythmic agent, contains 37% iodine and causes several thyroid abnormalities. The transplacental passage of amiodarone occurs with chronic therapy; we describe in this report the outcome of 9 pregnant women who used amiodarone (200 mg/day) for treatment of resistant tachycardia and the follow-up of their newborns. All women were clinically euthyroid at the 3rd trimester and showed expected values of thyroid hormones (mean +/- SD: total T4, 228 +/- 45 nmol/L; total T3, 4.0 +/- 0.65 nmol/L; TSH, 4.0 +/- 1.8 mU/L; negative thyroid antibodies). At birth all newborns were normal on routine examination with no goiter or corneal changes. T4 and TSH, measured on dried umbilical blood spots were normal or borderline-normal in 8 of 9 babies. Only 1 neonate presented clearly abnormal values of T4 and TSH (96 mU/L); on clinical grounds the baby was normal, without signs of hypothyroidism. At 1 month of life, T4 and TSH were normal. Follow-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months were normal. We conclude that is not necessary to discontinue treatment with amiodarone in pregnant women with resistant tachycardia, but it is imperative to evaluate the thyroid function of the newborn, since transient hypothyroidism may occur."

Elevated plasma levels of TCT occur in patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Asymptomatic relatives of these patients harboring microscopic foci of tumor may have abnormal plasma levels of TCT in the basal state or after provocative stimuli. In both instances the plasma levels of TCT can be used in the diagnosis and management of this thyroid neoplasm. Elevated plasma levels of TCT have also been described recently in subjects with certain extrathyroidal neoplasms or renal failure. Moderate elevations are seen during normal pregnancy and in the neonatal period. Although exogenous TCT has actions on several organs, including bone, the kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract, its physiological role in man, if any, is still unknown. The recently reported measurements of TCT in normal subjects should facilitate the clarification of this issue. TCT has been used as a therapeutic agent in Paget's disease of bone, hypercalcemia of diverse etiologies, osteopenia and several other skeletal disorders. The dramatic improvement of patients with Paget's disease has been a unique therapeutic action of TCT. The therapeutic responses in hypercalcemic subjects given TCT are encouraging but more information is needed about the pharmacology of the hormones in these subjects before conclusions can be formed. At present the therapeutic role of TCT in osteopenia is hypothetical and the results of ongoing and future studies are needed to determine its effects."

CD005253,0,26486478,0,[Thyroid gland and pregnancy - summary of important findings].,"Thyroid hormones play fundamental role in conception and pregnancy and are essential for normal adult health, fetus and childhood development. Many studies have shown an association between maternal thyroid diseases esp. hypothyroidism with obstetric problems and/or psychomotoric impairment in the offspring. The prevalence of undiagnosed lower thyroid function in pregnancy is present in about 4-8 % of pregnant women, and euthyroid women with thyroid autoimmunity (6-8 %) are further candidates for thyroid disorders in pregnancy. The thyroid gland needs to produce 50 % more thyroxine in pregnancy to maintain an euthyroid state to keep TSH ideally 2.5 mIU/l in the first trimester of pregnancy and TSH 3.0 mIU/l in the second and third trimester. Consequently, there is a need to start the substitution therapy as soon as diagnosis of subclinical and /or overt hypotyroidism is established, and in majority of euthyroid women with autoimmune thyroid disease there is a need to start therapy as well. Most women on levothyroxine therapy before pregnancy require an increase in dose when pregnant. As maternal thyroid disease is a quite prevalent condition and often asymptomatic, but easily diagnosed and for which an effective, safe and cheap treatment is available, endocrinological societies including ČES ČLS JEP worldwide are suggesting the need of thyroid dysfunction screening as a simple prevention attitude. Hormone determination of TSH and TPOab antibodies should be performed early during the first trimester, using trimester-specific reference values. Furthermore, adequate iodine supplementation during pregnancy is critical and if feasible it should be initiated before the woman attempts to conceive."

CD005253,0,24622373,0,The role of thyroid hormone and brown adipose tissue in energy homoeostasis.,"The presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adults has become increasingly well defined as a result of functional imaging studies of thermogenically active BAT. Findings from these studies have created a surge of scientific interest in BAT, because it represents a potential therapeutic target for obesity--a condition with profound health consequences and few successful therapies. BAT contributes to overall energy expenditure in small mammals and neonates through adaptive thermogenesis. Thyroid-hormone signalling, particularly through induction of type II deiodinase, has a central role in brown adipogenesis in vitro and BAT development in mouse embryos. Additionally, because of high intracellular expression of type II deiodinase, adult BAT has enhanced thyroid-hormone signalling with several thyroid-hormone-dependent thermogenic pathways, including expression of the genes Ppargc1a and Ucp1. BAT thermogenesis explains the essential part played by thyroid hormone in energy homoeostasis and adaptation to cold. Stimulation of BAT in adults, specifically through thyroid-hormone-mediated pathways, is a promising therapeutic target for obesity."

Seven term healthy newborns (group 1)increased their free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations significantly after delivery from a mean +/- SD baseline of 0.94 +/- 0.13 ng/dl in cord blood to a mean +/- SD peak of 2.6 +/- 0.6 ng/dl 48 h after delivery (p less than 0.001 at 3, 24, and 48 h), while their free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels increased from a mean +/- SD baseline level of 2.3 +/- 0.5 pg/ml in cord blood to a mean +/- SD peak of 3.7 baseline level of 2.3 +/- 0.5 pg/ml 48 h after delivery (p less than 0.001 at 24 and 48 h). Seven term newborns with transient low Apgar scores at birth (group 2) and seven term neonates born to mothers with toxemia or hypertension (group 3) failed to increase their FT4 and FT3 concentrations above baseline during the first 48 h of life. FT4 and FT3 values at 3, 24, and 48 h were significantly higher in the control group than in groups 2 and 3. Cord blood thyroid-stimulating hormone, FT4, and FT3 levels were not statistically different in the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD005253,0,26950151,0,"Median Urinary Iodine Concentrations Are Indicative of Adequate Iodine Status among Women of Reproductive Age in Prey Veng, Cambodia.","Iodine deficiency disorders are estimated to affect over 1.9 million people worldwide. Iodine deficiency is especially serious for women during pregnancy and lactation because of the negative consequences for both mother and infant. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) as a population-level indicator of iodine status among rural women farmers of reproductive age (18-45 years) in the province of Prey Veng, Cambodia. A total of 450 women provided a spot morning urine sample in 2012. Of those women, 93% (n = 420) were non-pregnant and 7% (n = 30) were pregnant at the time of collection. UIC was quantified using the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction with modifications. The median UIC of non-pregnant (139 μg/L) and pregnant women (157 μg/L) were indicative of adequate iodine status using the WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD epidemiological criteria for both groups (median UIC between 100-199 and 150-249 μg/L, respectively). We conclude that non-pregnant and pregnant women in rural Prey Veng, Cambodia had adequate iodine status based on single spot morning urine samples collected in 2012. More research is warranted to investigate iodine status among larger and more representative populations of women in Cambodia, especially in light of recent policy changes to the national program for universal salt iodization."

CD005253,0,28295509,0,Measuring TSH receptor antibody to influence treatment choices in Graves' disease.,"TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease (GD), and its levels correlate with the clinical course. The second- and third-generation TRAb assays have >95% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of GD and have improved the utility of TRAb to predict relapse. TRAb levels decline with antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy and after thyroidectomy. Its level increases for a year following radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, with a gradual fall thereafter. TRAb level >12 IU/l at diagnosis of GD is associated with 60% risk of relapse at 2 years and 84% at 4 years. The prediction of risk of relapse improves further to >90% with TRAb >7·5 IU/l at 12 months or >3·85 IU/l at cessation of ATD therapy. TRAb tests are not expensive, and hence, TRAb measurements at presentation, after 12 months and/or 18 months (at cessation) of ATD therapy, could potentially guide treatment choices in GD. Elevated TRAb favours definitive treatment in the form of RAI or thyroidectomy, depending on the presence or absence of moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) and the ability to comply with radiation protection requirements. Use of ATDs in early pregnancy is associated with increased risk of congenital anomalies; early ablative treatment (RAI/surgery) should be considered in women of childbearing age at higher risk of relapse of GD. TRAb ≥5 IU/l in pregnant women with current or previously treated GD is associated with increased risk of foetal and neonatal thyrotoxicosis, and hence needs close monitoring. TRAb levels parallel the course of GO, and elevated TRAb is an indication for steroid prophylaxis to prevent progression of GO with RAI therapy."

CD005253,0,6170289,0,Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin in Graves' disease.,"There is excellent presumptive evidence that an IgG plays an aetiological role in the development of hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease but available methods for detecting thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) are still far from satisfactory. They show considerable variation in specificity, sensitivity and precision, and comparison of the experimental data, obtained with these various methods, is difficult. A need exists for an in vitro TSI assay which is based upon the propensity of IgG molecules to stimulate the thyroid gland. Because a complex chain of biochemical events is involved, including binding to IgG to the cell membrane receptor, release of cyclic AMP, organification of iodide, hydrolysis of iodoproteins and secretion of thyroid hormones, it is not yet clear which step should be monitored to obtain the best index of thyroid stimulating activity. Although TSI and related assays appear to be of limited value in the primary diagnosis of Graves' disease, they offer some assistance to the clinician in the following situations: 1. Prediction of relapse in Graves' disease patients who have been rendered euthyroid with antithyroid drugs. 2. Identification of patients with ophthalmic Graves' disease. 3. Prediction of neonatal hyperthyroidism in thyrotoxic pregnancies."
CD005253,0,26171232,0,Increased efficacy of VX-809 in different cellular systems results from an early stabilization effect of F508del-CFTR.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common recessive autosomal disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The most common mutation, F508del, leads to CFTR impaired plasma membrane trafficking. Therapies modulating CFTR basic defect are emerging, such as VX-809, a corrector of F508del-CFTR traffic which just succeeded in a Phase III clinical trial. We recently showed that VX-809 is additive to two other correctors (VRT-325 and compound 4a). Here, we aimed to determine whether the differential rescuing by these compounds results from cell-specific factors or rather from distinct effects at the early biogenesis and/or processing. The rescuing efficiencies of the above three correctors were first compared in different cellular models (primary respiratory cells, cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial and baby hamster kidney [BHK] cell lines) by functional approaches: micro-Ussing chamber and iodide efflux. Next, biochemical methods (metabolic labeling, pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation) were used to determine their impact on CFTR biogenesis / processing. Functional analyses revealed that VX-809 has the greatest rescuing efficacy and that the relative efficiencies of the three compounds are essentially maintained in all three cellular models tested. Nevertheless, biochemical data show that VX-809 significantly stabilizes F508del-CFTR immature form, an effect that is not observed for C3 nor C4. VX-809 and C3 also significantly increase accumulation of immature CFTR. Our data suggest that VX-809 increases the stability of F508del-CFTR immature form at an early phase of its biogenesis, thus explaining its increased efficacy when inducing its rescue."

CD005253,0,10569217,0,Dietary supplements for the lactating mother: influence on the trace element content of milk.,"Milk production is a complex process where nutritional factors interact with structural hormonal and behavioural influences. In recent years important advances have been made in understanding the role of the nutritional status of lactating women on the outcome of breastfeeding. Many questions remain unanswered about the exact requirement of trace elements for lactating mothers. The effect of dietary zinc, copper and iodine supplements on the milk concentration of these micronutrients was studied. The supplementation trial employed a specific balanced nutritional supplement prepared for the nursing mothers. The study was carried out on women living in Ferrara and its surrounding area. The population under study was healthy Italian mothers, of good socioeconomic status, and their normal infants. In total, 32 women were enrolled in the study and 22 completed it. The infants (9F, 13M) were full-term, healthy singletons and were put to breast within 12 h of birth. All women who finished the study completed a 3 d dietary record. Nutrient analysis revealed the following mean daily dietary trace element intake in the lactating mothers: zinc = 12 mg, copper = 1.4 mg and iodine = 145 microg. The zinc and copper dietary intake was in agreement with the daily intake proposed for nursing Italian mothers, while the daily intake of iodine was below the recommended intake of 200 microg. The breastfeeding mothers were placed in 2 groups, with 7 primiparas and 4 multiparas per group: lactating women eating a traditional Italian diet without vitamin and mineral supplements, and lactating women enrolled in the nutrification programme and given a nutritional supplement to their traditional diet. The supplement (PerMamma Abbott) provided 20mg zinc sulfate, 2mg copper sulfate and 116 microg potassium iodide. These quantities cover about 60-90% of the recommended intake for nursing Italian mothers. Samples of 10 ml of milk were collected at 3, 30, 90d postpartum. Zinc milk concentrations declined significantly over the study period for all lactating subjects, without differences in the rate of decline between the women who started supplementation during lactation and those who did not. Copper did not change during the first month of lactation, then declined at day 90 in supplemented and unsupplemented women, without significant differences between the two groups. An early sharp decline in milk iodine occurred in all lactating subjects, independently of iodine supplementation. After the first month of lactation breast milk iodide levels remained stable in all subjects under study. No significant differences between the two study groups were observed. The lack of correlation between the iodide level in breast milk and maternal dietary intake of iodine is not in agreement with previously published reports. The present results indicate that in healthy, well-nourished lactating Italian women, whose diet is adequate, the levels of zinc, copper and iodine in milk are not influenced by short-term supplementary intakes and that the milk levels of the trace elements studied are maintained over different levels of intake. Further research and examination by longitudinal studies are needed to establish the exact relationship between the amount of iodine furnished to the nursing mother and the iodine content of human milk. The role of compensatory homeostatic mechanisms which act during lactation needs further consideration and closer scrutiny."
CD005253,0,3081294,0,"Congenital hypothyroidism: diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.","Congenital hypothyroidism is a common but preventable cause of mental retardation. The incidence of congenital hypothyroidism in the newborn population is about 1:3500 to 1:4000. Infants with Down's syndrome are at a special risk. Fort et al. reported an incidence of persistent primary congenital hypothyroidism in infants with Down's syndrome of 1:141 or 28 times higher than the general newborn population. Premature infants have varying degrees of immaturity of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system and are at a special risk for a variety of thyroid disorders. These patients need adequate understanding and interpretation of their laboratory values before institution of replacement hormonal therapy. Screening programs are available in 48 states and have led to prompt diagnosis and recognition of most cases that would otherwise be missed. Prevention of mental retardation depends on early and adequate treatment. This requires close cooperation between the program and the physicians involved in the care of the infant. Many state screening programs maintain a list of experts who are available for consultation, if necessary."
CD005253,0,10779139,0,Neuropsychological follow-up in early-treated congenital hypothyroidism: a problem-oriented approach.,"Screening programs for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) dramatically improved the neuropsychological prognosis in affected children. However, mild impairments in cognitive performances, poorer motor skills, defective language abilities, and learning problems have been reported in some studies of early-treated CH children. The occurrence of these defects makes neuropsychological follow-up mandatory. The aim of the present study was to identify those neuropsychological functions that are more frequently affected in early-treated CH children and that might require prompt rehabilitation treatment to prevent permanent defects. The study group involved 24 CH children. Levothyroxine (LT4) treatment (initial dose 8-10 microg/kg per day) was started at mean age of 28 days (range 15-45) and was then adjusted with the goal to keep thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroid hormone levels in the normal range. Cognitive evaluation was performed at 3, 5, and 7 years of age and did not significantly differ from that of controls. Mean neurological scores were lower in children 5 years of age than in controls. Children with severe neonatal hypothyroidism (serum thyroxine [T4] < 2 microg/dL) had significantly lower neurological scores compared to less affected CH children and normal controls. The most affected functions were balance, extremity coordination, fine motricity, quality of movements, associated movements, and head movements. Language disorders were observed in half of CH children at 3 and 5 years of age, but moderately severe defects were restricted to those with severe neonatal hypothyroidism. In conclusion, a problem-oriented, simplified neuropsychological follow-up of early-treated children with CH should not systematically include the frequent repetition of time-consuming and expensive psychometric tests because individual IQ scores are in the normal range of tests in almost all CH children and can be differentiated from those of normal controls only on a population-statistic basis. Selected tests of motor proficiency are indicated at 3 and 5 years of age to detect those defects in motor skills that appear to be more specifically affected in CH children. Language performances are at particular risk in CH children, and should be always checked at 3 and 5 years of age. Children with even mild language disorders or delayed language achievements should be regularly reevaluated at 6-month intervals and, if no spontaneous improvement is observed, they should receive specific rehabilitation treatment. No further motor and language evaluation is warranted in CH children with normal tests at age 5 years."
CD005253,0,12192543,0,Thyroid disorders in children from birth to adolescence.,"Thyroid hormones play a crucial role as a regulator of growth, of nervous system myelination, of metabolism, and of organ functions. Disorders affecting the thyroid gland represent the most common endocrinopathies in childhood. The etiology and clinical presentation of thyroid disorders in children and adolescents substantially differ from that in adults. Thus, pediatric medical care requires an appreciation of distinct characteristics of thyroid function and dysfunction in childhood and adolescence. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent irreversible and permanent nervous system damage and developmental delay, especially in infants as they are extremely vulnerable to thyroid dysfunction. Therefore, as well as reviewing distinct features of disorders with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and normal thyroid function in childhood and adolescence, this article will also focus on important aspects of pre- and postnatal thyroid development and physiology."

CD005253,0,21882364,0,Are thyroid hormone concentrations at birth associated with subsequent autism diagnosis?,"Thyroid hormones substantially influence central nervous system development during gestation. We hypothesized that perturbations of early thyroid profiles may contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Thyroid pathways could provide a mechanism by which environmental factors that affect the thyroid system may impact autism occurrence or phenotypic expression. We investigated whether thyroxine (T4) levels at birth are associated with subsequent ASD, using two existing California study groups in multivariate analysis. One study group included children born in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1994, with cases identified through the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and/or the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California (244 cases, 266 controls); the other included children born in California in 1995, with cases identified through DDS (310 cases, 518 controls). Matched controls were selected from birth certificate records. This exploratory analysis suggested that infants with very low T4 (<3rd percentile) may have higher ASD risk, although results reached statistical significance only for the 1995 study group (1995: OR = 2.74 (95% CI 1.30-5.75; 1994: OR = 1.71 (95% CI 0.57-5.19). A variety of alternate analyses were conducted with available data, without further resolution of the difference between the two study groups. The results of our study indicate that further studies are warranted to investigate whether thyroid hormone perturbations play a role in the development of ASD by evaluating additional potential confounders and genotype or phenotype in larger studies."

The infants were subdivided into gestational age groups: 24-27 wk (n = 22); 28-30 wk (n = 26); and 31-34 wk (n = 24). The TSH surge in the first hour of postnatal life was markedly attenuated in infants of 24-27 wk gestation [8 compared with 20 (28-30 wk) and 23 mU/liter (31-34 wk)]. T4 levels in the most immature group declined over the first 24 h, whereas levels increased in the more mature groups [mean cord and 24-h levels: 65 and 59 (NS) vs. 70 and 84 (P < 0.002) vs. 98 and 125 (NS) nmol/liter]. Free T4 and T3 showed only small, transient increases in the most immature group and progressively larger and sustained increases in the other gestational groups. rT3 and T4 sulfate levels in cord serum were higher in the most immature infants, and in all groups levels decreased initially and then variably increased. The features of a severely attenuated or failed hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid response to delivery critically define this 24- to 27-wk group as distinct from more mature preterm infants."

CD005253,0,979989,0,[More recent aspects of treatment for hypothyroidism and goitre in children and adolescents (author's transl)].,"According to more recent knowledge L-thyroxine alone is recommended for thyroid hormone replacement therapy, no longer the combination of L-thyroxine and triiodothyronin, since L-thyroxine is converted to triiodothyronine in the periphery of the body. Additional application of triiodothyronine causes unphysiological elevations of blood levels of triiodothyronine. When changing from the combined thyroid hormone therapy to treatment with L-thyroxine alone it is enough in most cases to replace the previous amount of L-thyroxine only; previous recommendations for the dosage of thyroid hormone were rather high. Average requirements of adults for L-thyroxine are around 170 mug per day. Children need about 90--100 mug per m2 body surface per day. -- When hypothyroidism is suspected in newborns or infants no protracted diagnostic procedures are justified with respect to brain development and its requirement of thyroid hormone during this period of life. Replacement therapy should be started within 1--2 days. The exact diagnosis can be established later, for instance during the third day of life when a temporary interuption of treatment for diagnostic purposes has no longer such negative effect on normal brain development. As long as physiological doses of L-thyroxine are used no side effects are to be expected for patients who later turn out to be euthyroid. -- Following exclusion of hyperthyroidism goitres in children and adolescents equally need thyroid hormone replacement therapy to reduce the size or prevent further enlargement or even the development of nodules within the gland. The dosage for this is about half to three quarters of the full replacement dose. The nature of thyroid nodules should be investigated, even surgically, since malignancies can develop in children and juveniles as well as in adults."

A principle of the assay was the competitive method and used a double antibody solid phase technique. TSH-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate and TSH-beta-D-galactosidase (beta-Gal) conjugate were used, and a fluorometry was introduced for measuring the activity of the enzyme. The substrates for determining the enzyme activities were 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside for beta-Gal, and 3-p(hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid for HRP. A polyacetal bead coated with a purified double antibody was used for the separation of Bound and Free. With the assay methods, TSH in two of 3mm discs of dried blood on filter paper was measurable. The whole process was completed within 24 hours. TSH standards containing 0.05 microU/tube showed 80 approximately 90% of B/Bo, and the containing 0.25 microU/tube showed about 50% of B/Bo. As a routine method for mass screening of primary congenital hypothyroidism, the EIA method using TSH-beta-Gal was adopted. A variation resulting from day to day experiments was 4.7 approximately 9.4% at B/Bo during a seven day trial. From April of 1980, 12357 samples of newborn blood on filter paper were measured, and a distribution of the value of TSH in dried blood was almost the same as that obtained by RIA. Three cases of cogenital hypothyroidism were detected, and about 0.15% of the total samples showed a TSH concentration higher than 20 microU/ml of whole blood. All the samples were determined by RIA too, and the TSH values obtained from the EIA method were compared to that obtained from the RIA method. The correlation of both EIA and RIA methods was analyzed. Although there were slight discrepancies between EIA and RIA, the samples having high TSH values with the RIA method were all detected by the EIA method. Therefore, the EIA method will be usable as a tool for the mass-screening for the detection of primary congenital hypothyroidism."

CD005253,0,2423874,0,Antithyroid drug therapy for Graves' disease during pregnancy. Optimal regimen for fetal thyroid status.,"We compared fetal and maternal serum indexes of thyroid status at delivery in 70 patients with Graves' disease who required therapy with thionamides (such as propylthiouracil) during pregnancy. Forty-three mothers required thionamides until delivery (Group 1), whereas the drugs were discontinued during pregnancy after remission in 27 mothers (Group 2). Maternal free thyroxine levels were closely correlated with cord levels in both groups, being essentially identical in Group 2 but slightly lower in fetuses than in mothers in Group 1. Normal maternal free thyroxine levels did not preclude fetal hypothyroidism. The mothers and fetuses in Group 1 had a significantly higher incidence of antibodies that inhibit thyrotropin binding than did those of Group 2. However, a significant correlation between maternal levels of these antibodies and cord levels of free thyroxine or triiodothyronine was found only in Group 2, in which some maternal and cord thyroxine levels were in the thyrotoxic range at delivery, presumably because therapy was discontinued. These findings indicate that high free thyroxine levels and the presence of antibodies that inhibit binding of thyrotropin are useful indexes of the fetal need for antithyroid treatment, and that the thionamide dosage that maintains maternal free thyroxine levels in a mildly thyrotoxic range seems appropriate for maintaining euthyroid status in the fetus."

The data on its efficacy and side effects in humans are not yet as many as those of corticosteroids. We found that in 24 premature labor patients ambroxol reduced the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome when compared with the control group, consisting of 58 patients. There was no concomitant disorder in any patient that would have contributed to the fetal lung maturation. We also observed septic morbidity to be less frequent in the ambroxol group.

Maternal liver and renal function test results did not differ significantly throughout the treatment."
CD005253,0,18598585,0,Methods to assess iron and iodine status.,"Four methods are recommended for assessment of iodine nutrition: urinary iodine concentration, the goitre rate, and blood concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroglobulin. These indicators are complementary, in that urinary iodine is a sensitive indicator of recent iodine intake (days) and thyroglobulin shows an intermediate response (weeks to months), whereas changes in the goitre rate reflect long-term iodine nutrition (months to years). Spot urinary iodine concentrations are highly variable from day-to-day and should not be used to classify iodine status of individuals. International reference criteria for thyroid volume in children have recently been published and can be used for identifying even small goitres using thyroid ultrasound. Recent development of a dried blood spot thyroglobulin assay makes sample collection practical even in remote areas. Thyroid stimulating hormone is a useful indicator of iodine nutrition in the newborn, but not in other age groups. For assessing iron status, haemoglobin measurement alone has low specificity and sensitivity. Serum ferritin remains the best indicator of iron stores in the absence of inflammation. Measures of iron-deficient erythropoiesis include transferrin iron saturation and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, but these often do not distinguish anaemia due to iron deficiency from the anaemia of chronic disease. The serum transferrin receptor is useful in this setting, but the assay requires standardization. In the absence of inflammation, a sensitive method to assess iron status is to combine the use of serum ferritin as a measure of iron stores and the serum transferrin receptor as a measure of tissue iron deficiency."

Concerns are based primarily on in vitro research, animal studies, and older reports of goiter in infants fed soy formula not fortified with iodine. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effect on thyroid function of a daily supplement containing 90 mg (aglycone weight) of total isoflavones/day versus placebo in 38 postmenopausal women, 64-83 years old, not on hormone replacement therapy. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) were measured at baseline and after 90 and 180 days. In the supplement group, at baseline and 6 months, TSH (micro U/ml), T4 (nM), and T3 (nM) levels (mean +/- SE) were 3.00 +/- 0.44, 149.00 +/- 5.04, and 1.53 +/- 0.13, respectively, and 3.49 +/- 0.52, 154.52 +/- 2.09, and 1.78 +/- 0.12, respectively. In the control group, levels at baseline and at 6 months were 3.35 +/- 0.51, 145.39 +/- 6.69, and 1.55 +/- 0.18, respectively, and 3.63 +/- 0.57, 153.77 +/- 6.64, and 1.75 +/- 0.10, respectively. Intragroup differences for all three measures were statistically indistinguishable at 6 months, and levels were similar between the isoflavone supplement and placebo groups at each measurement. These results indicate that in this group of healthy iodine-replete subjects, soy isoflavones do not adversely affect thyroid function."
CD005253,0,11228603,0,[Congenital hypothyroidism].,"Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most common diseases in paediatric endocrinology. Thyroid hormones are essential in brain development, which takes place during foetal life and early postnatal life up to the 2nd year of age. The main etiologic factors of congenital hypothyroidism are anomalies of development, function and regulation of the thyroid gland. Clinical signs of thyroid hormone deficiency in infants are non-specific. Early diagnosis is based on newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism, which was started in Poland in 1977. Treatment within the first days of life with appropriate dosage of thyroxine prevents mental retardation. This paper summarises current knowledge on congenital hypothyroidism in children."

Autopsy protocols of the years 1949/50 adn 1978/79 were reviewed for thyroid weights as well as for age and sex of patients. Average thyroid weights and goiter incidence were determined separately for both sexes and for different age groups. The values for both periods (1949/50) and 1978/79) were compared and related to results reported in the literature. Thirty years ago the mean thyroid weights were very high, although as an effect of goiter prophylaxis with iodized salt, introduced in 1923, the thyroids of younger adults were significantly lighter than those of older groups. 30 years later the thyroids were only half the weight of those in the years 1949/50. Goiter incidence decreased to the same degree. In addition, some preexisting goiters were found to have decreased in size within the 30 year span. The average thyroid weights of adults up to 40 years of age are now largely the same as in regions without endemic goiter. The few remaining goiters may be explained by a still insufficient iodination of table salt. However, other pathogenic factors, e.g. disturbances of hormone synthesis, must also be considered."
CD005253,0,1445136,0,Hypothyroidism complicating pregnancy.,"In this report we describe 26 pregnancies complicated by hypothyroidism cared for over 6.5 years at AIIMS, New Delhi. In 2 women hypothyroidism was diagnosed during pregnancy; others were diagnosed before pregnancy and continued to receive thyroxine replacement therapy throughout pregnancy. The thyroxine treatment needed readjustment in 7 (26.9%) pregnancies to maintain euthyroidism. Maternal complications included anaemia (23.0%), pregnancy induced hypertension (26.9%), postpartum haemorrhage (7.7%), intrauterine growth retardation (15.4%), postdatism (30.8%), and deficient lactation (19.2%). Perinatal mortality was 3.9%. No case of stillbirth occurred probably because of intensive fetal monitoring and timely termination of pregnancies on evidence of intrauterine fetal compromise. One neonatal death occurred due to fetal thyrotoxicosis. In these cases close surveillance during pregnancy is needed to maintain optimum thyroid hormone concentration, and intensive fetal monitoring is required to achieve a good perinatal outcome."
CD005253,0,4018101,0,Calcium homeostasis in the first days of life in relation to feeding.,"Determinations of serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), calcitonin (CT) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were carried out in full term newborn infants during the first 168 h of life. The infants were randomly assigned to two different diets: glucose and breast feeding (BF) only or early formula feeding (F). The Ca serum levels decreased from birth to the 24th h; after that time they increased until the 72nd h. The values of serum Ca at the 48th and 72nd h were significantly lower in the F than in the BF group. In contrast, the P serum levels increased from birth to the 48th h and then they decreased; the values of serum P at the 48th h were significantly higher in F than in the BF group. The CT serum levels increased from birth to the 24th h and then they decreased. No difference between the F and BF groups was found during the first 48 h, while at the 72nd h the F group demonstrated significantly higher values of serum CT. PTH serum levels also increased from birth to the 24th h with significantly higher values at the 72nd h in the F group. The results of this investigation demonstrate that the difference in feeding in the first hours of life affects the calcium homeostasis and the secretion of hormones involved in the regulation of serum Ca levels."

We measured the concentrations of AM and its major metabolite desethylamiodarone (DEA) in maternal plasma, cord plasma, infant plasma, placental tissue and breast milk and the thyroid hormones were measured in maternal and neonatal serum. Also, the neonates were examined for AM-associated adverse effects over a period varying from 8 months up to 5 years. We observed a limited maternal-fetal transfer of AM and DEA, while the concentration of DEA in placental tissue is relatively high. Considerable amounts of AM and DEA were present in breast milk. One infant appeared to be hypothyroid, detected by the neonatal thyroid screening. He was treated with triiodothyronine for weeks, until it was clear that the thyroid dysfunction was resolved. The other infants had normal screening results. No effect of the AM medication was observed on growth, liver function or cornea and skin."
CD005253,0,7350783,0,Elevated threshold for thyrotropin suppression in congenital hypothyroidism.,"Five infants with congenital hypothyroidism were found to have persistently elevated levels of serum thyrotropin (TSH) for six to 24 months after administration of adequate doses of thyroxine. In these infants, the hypothalamic-pituitary threshold for TSH suppression by thyroxine seems to be unusually high. These observations suggest that serum TSH levels should not be the sole criterion for evaluating adequacy of thyroid hormone replacement during the initial months of therapy for congenital hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,16682838,0,Treatment of post-partum thyrotoxicosis.,"Thyrotoxicosis occurs more frequently during the post-partum period than at other times in women of childbearing age. Graves' disease and post-partum thyroiditis are two major causes of thyrotoxicosis in this period. The major task lies in differentiation of these two diseases in the post-partum period; since throtoxicosis caused by post-partum thyroiditis usually does not require treatment. The radioiodine uptake is elevated or normal in Graves' disease and low in post-partum thyroiditis, and TSH-receptor antibodies are positive in Graves' and negative in post-partum thyroiditis. Post-partum thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease may be treated with radioiodine but it requires radiation safety measurements for infant and is contraindicated if the mother is breast-feeding. Antithyroid drugs are the mainstay of the treatment of post-partum thyrotoxicosis. Recent investigations conclude that neither propylthiouracil nor methimazole cause any alterations in thyroid function and physical and mental development of infants breast-fed by lactating thyrotoxic mothers, and both can be safely administered in moderately high doses during lactation."

Defining congenital hypothyroidism is particularly complex in premature neonates because prematurely born infants often have a low free thyroxine value and low or normal TSH value, termed as transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity. In a multicenter (n=11 sites) trial, we randomly allocated premature neonates with a gestational age of 23 to 29 and 6/7 weeks to one of two parenteral nutrition approaches. The primary objective of our trial was to measure the effect of two distinct strategies of parenteral nutrition on neonatal growth and blood amino acids. A protocol defined secondary aim of our clinical trial was the evaluation of the influence of gestational age, time and the degree of amino-acid supplementation on total thyroxine levels. We hypothesized that an increase of amino-acid supplementation would be associated with the normalization of serum amino acids and that this would improve thyroxine synthesis."

Psychomotor development in patients detected by clinical signs and symptoms.,"Thirty-nine children at 7 to 9 years of age with congenital hypothyroidism have been studied with respect to their intellectual, neurological and social functions. Their intellectual achievement as assessed by the WISC test, was significantly lower than in a reference population (mean IQ 88, range 50-113). In children who showed signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism during their first four weeks of life, there was a negative correlation between the age when therapy was started and intellectual development. No such correlation was found in children who showed signs and symptoms after the first four weeks of life. Nine children of 26 with signs of hypothyroidism in the neonatal period, were found to have neurological abnormalities consisting of fine and gross motor disturbances. The neurological abnormalities seriously affected daily life in only the two most severely mentally retarded. No correlation was found between the age when the therapy was started and neurological abnormalities. Three children attended special schools because of mental retardation and six attended normal schools but required additional teaching assistance for learning disabilities. Our results suggest that the risk of future intellectual handicaps may be reduced by early treatment in children with hypothyroidism presenting during the neonatal period."
CD005253,0,18416220,0,Effects of zero-balanced ultrafiltration on procalcitonin and respiratory function after cardiopulmonary bypass.,"The abnormal conditions to which blood is subjected during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) trigger an activation of the inflammatory response and cause pulmonary dysfunction. It has been suggested that high-volume, zero-balanced ultrafiltration (ZBUF) facilitates clearance of inflammatory mediators and improves post-operative pulmonary function. Procalcitonin, a newly discovered inflammatory mediator, has been found to be increased after CPB and has been proven to be an appropriate parameter for predicting pulmonary dysfunction secondary to CPB. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zero-balanced ultrafiltration (ZBUF) on procalcitonin (PCT) and respiratory function of infants with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) after CPB. Twenty infants with TOF undergoing open-heart total surgical correction were randomly assigned to two groups. The trial group was given ZBUF (50 ml/kg) and conventional ultrafiltration (CUF), while the control group was given CUF only. Plasma PCT and pulmonary function were monitored and compared between the two groups before the operation (T1), before rewarming (T2), at the end of the operation (T3), and at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after the operation (T4-T6). PCT was decreased in the trial group between 12 h and 48 h post-operatively, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. The trial group's pulmonary compliance was higher at 12 h post-operatively (p < 0.05). Oxygenation index was increased in the trial group at the end of the operation and 12 h post-operatively (p > 0.05). Intubation time was shorter in the trial group (P < 0.01). A positive correlation was found between peak PCT concentration and intubation time. ZBUF appeared to improve ventilation and shorten intubation time. The improved respiratory function may be due to the lower plasma PCT."

To test this hypothesis, we performed standard psychological tests (Gesell, Stanford-Binet, or Wechsler) in three groups of children with treated hypothyroidism: 14 were discovered by neonatal screening and 24 (15 with thyroid agenesis and 9 with ectopic thyroid) were diagnosed prior to institution of screening. Age (weeks) at initial treatment differed among the three groups (mean values +/- SE: screened 4.6 +/- 0.8, thyroid agenesis 19.3 +/- 4.0, ectopic thyroid 46.4 +/- 8.0). Age at testing averaged 3.3 years in all three groups. The global developmental quotient (DQ) or IQ score was lowest in the thyroid agenesis group (82 +/- 6, range 52 to 142), intermediate in the ectopic thyroid group (93 +/- 10, range 56 to 141) and highest in the screening group (104 +/- 4, range 75 to 127).

CD005253,0,15481705,0,Radioiodine and thyroid carcinoma: KI prophylaxis in children.,"The Chernobyl disaster was followed by a large increase in the incidence of thyroid carcinoma in children. It has been proved that KI prophylaxis may prevent such a heavy consequence. Italy has no more nuclear power plants in activity but is surrounded by the several ones of the neighbouring countries; moreover, relevant amounts of nuclear material are still present in the territory. Therefore a nuclear risk is present in Italy as well as in other close countries and a KI prophylaxis should be organized for our children, at least for those living within 200 miles from a possible source of radioiodine pollution. Guidelines concerning KI prophylaxis exist and are internationally shared in their general outlines. Guidelines we recommend for italian children are summarized in part II (""theory""). However, to be timely and effective, KI prophylaxis must be organized long before the nuclear alarm, and the coordination of its several steps needs to be checked through a mock trial. We suggest a model of organization and describe the practical aspects of carrying out a KI prophylaxis for 82.000 subjects aged 0-18 years living in the Province of Parma (Progetto Sperimentale Parma, PSP).

Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxine, and thyroxine is essential for normal brain development in utero and for the first 2-3 years of life. The recommended iodine intake in parenteral nutrition regimens is 1 μg/kg/day and commercially available parenteral solutions for infants reflect these recommendations. In the absence of other iodine sources, infants are vulnerable to negative iodine balance and insufficiency.

CD005253,0,2085992,0,Human mesor-hypertensive chronorisk.,"Twelve endocrine variables in blood from a small number of clinically healthy adult women were sampled systematically around the clock and the seasons. Pattern discrimination methods singled out certain hormone values in certain seasons as classifiers for a high vs low risk of developing diseases associated with a high blood pressure. Further evidence in support of such classifiers is obtained on data from adolescent, menstrually cycling young adults and post-menopausal women, here analyzed as pool of series, with the scope of the data from any one age group greatly extended by a resampling procedure, namely, by bootstrapping. This mathematical approach was carried out on data series around the clock and seasons on several hormones as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Classifier roles were strongly supported for plasma aldosterone and thyroid stimulating hormone, originally by an analysis of variance and, in the case of aldosterone, by circannual cosinor analysis and by numerical resampling. Circannual bootstrapping, a procedure recommended for broad routine use as a safeguard for hypothesis testing, was also done for plasma cortisol, dehydro-epi-androsterone sulfate and prolactin, variables for which (parametric) analyses of variance and cosinors did not reveal any difference between groups at high and low cardiovascular risk. In these instances, bootstrapping results are tentative and await further analyses. Results show the ability of circannual bootstrapping to detect outliers. Identification of classifiers provides cost-effective endocrine checks complementing the targeted automatic monitoring of blood pressure. Circannual indices for risk evaluation are, however, costly in several ways since it takes at least a year and quite a few samples to estimate them reliably. Accordingly, we also extended the scope of previous results by the application of an added procedure for circadian bootstrapping. With circadian as well as circannual bootstrapping, we here illustrate a major potential component of a system of chrono-engineering for health maintenance. This system should start with focus on the newborn. The results on adults here analyzed are likely to be more prominent in the neonate, to the extent that they are genetic in origin, yet amenable to modification by the extra-uterine environment."

The TSH cutoff level was 10 mU/L blood. A total of 215,077 newborns were screened (94.76 %). Out of 254 recalled newborns (a recall rate of 0.15 %), 83 newborns with CH were detected, yielding a CH prevalence at screening of 1/2,591 (female to male ratio, 1.86:1).

CD005253,0,17962990,0,Effects of levothyroxine therapy on left and right ventricular function in neonates with congenital hypothyroidism: a tissue Doppler echocardiography study.,"Cardiac function is impaired in adults or children with hypothyroidism and it can be reversed by levothyroxine (L-T(4)) substitution therapy. However, only a few studies are available on left and right ventricular function in neonates with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), most of which were performed with standard echocardiography. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of L-T(4) substitution therapy on left and right ventricular function in neonates with CH, measured with tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) and conventional echocardiography. Fifty neonates (27 females and 23 males) with CH and 35 normal neonates (19 females and 16 males) underwent conventional echocardiography and TDE. On TDE, peak mitral and tricuspid annular systolic (Sa) velocity, peak early (Ea) and late (Aa) mitral and tricuspid annular diastolic velocity were measured, and the Ea/Aa ratio was calculated. All the biochemical tests and echocardiographic evaluations were reevaluated after 1 month of replacement therapy. In CH neonates, TDE showed that CH neonates had significantly lower Sa, Ea, and Ea/Aa of both left and right ventricles (P<0.001, respectively). However, Aa of left and right ventricles did not differ significantly. After 1 month of substitutive therapy, CH neonates showed a significant increase of Sa and Ea and a subsequent increase of the Ea/Aa ratio (P<0.001, respectively). Our findings suggest that neonates with CH suffer from right ventricular subclinical systolic and diastolic dysfunction in addition to left ventricular dysfunction.

In the control group, gestational age correlated positively with PRL and inversely with reverse T3, whereas birth weight correlated positively with PRL, T4, and T3, but inversely with reverse T3 levels. Thus, larger, more mature neonates tended to have higher cord levels of PRL, T4, T3 and lower concentrations of reverse T3. The data also suggest that, in the premature neonate, various obstetric complications and exposure in utero to beta-mimetic drugs and glucocorticoids may be important determinants of the concentrations of E2 and thyroid hormone in cord blood."

CD005253,0,19665328,0,Polysomnographic features in infants with early diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism.,"Thyroid hormones play a major role in the maturation process of the brain. Currently, congenital hypothyroidism is detected by mass screening. The impact of this early hormonal deficiency on the organization of the sleep pattern is not known. In this study, the polysomnographic features in children diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism were analyzed. Children were detected by mass population screening and the hormonal replacement therapy starts immediately. Children's age ranged between 1.5 and 18 months of age. The duration of hormonal treatment before sleep recordings varied between 8 days and 17 months. Children were polysomnographically recorded in the morning, for at least 2h, obtaining more than one sleep cycle. Results showed a high prevalence of females (5/1) in the group studied. A high proportion of infants (43%) displayed central apnea in different degrees (mild, moderate and severe) as well as hypopnea (83%), mainly in subjects around 4 and 8 months of age. The proportion of infants displaying central apnea decreases as age increases. In addition, indeterminate (light) sleep increase and quiet (slow wave) sleep decrease significantly regardless of age and treatment. The percentage of REM sleep correlated positively with the age of the child at the beginning of the treatment, and negatively with their age at the time of the study. These data indicate that congenital hypothyroidism facilitates the presence of central sleep apnea. The decrease of these respiratory alterations correlates with the increase of the hormonal replacement therapy. It seems that sleep respiratory alterations in congenital hypothyroidism are linked to brain maturation processes in which thyroid hormones play a major role."

CD005253,0,12621885,0,[Flame retardants--use and hazards for human].,"Flame retardants (FRs) are chemicals which added to materials during or after manufacture, inhibit or even suppress the combustion process due to their thermal stability. Large quantities of FRs are added to the plastic material (resins) in variety of electrical and electronic appliances including television and computer casing. The other uses of these compounds include production of building materials, upholstered furniture, textiles, wall covering, carpets, hydraulic fluids as well as vehicles and aircraft. Taking into account the chemical structure, there are five main groups of FRs: brominated, chlorinated, phosphorous-containing, nitrogen-containing (i.e. melamines) and inorganic compounds. Halogenated compounds, especially polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a class of brominated flame retardants, due to their lipophilic characteristics and persistence have become ubiquitous environmental contaminants. There are indications that PBDEs may affect hormone function acting as endocrine disruption and may be toxic for developing brain. These compounds have been associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in humans, a variety of cancers in rodents and disruption of thyroid hormones balance. Similarly to other persistent halogenated compounds they are also able to affect the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes activity. PBDEs are now found as residues in sediments, wildlife and human (milk, serum adipose tissue) samples. The predominant congeners in environmental samples, including human specimens are two congeners: 47 and 99. Currently, the estimated daily intake of PBDEs by adult humans is equal 51 ng x day-1 while by breast-fed infants equals 110 ng x day-1."

In cases with neonatal respiratory distress and to a lesser extent in prematures, low T4 due to a decrease of TBG was found, TSH being identical in all groups. The positive correlation between TBG and transferrin suggests a disturbance in hepatic synthesis. The authors conclude that, in cases with neonatal respiratory distress, low T4 does not mean hypothyroidism and does not require a treatment, provided TSH remains within normal limits."

A standardized development test (Griffiths) was given to a group of CH infants and to healthy controls at the ages of 5-7, 11-13, 17-19, and 23-25 months. Thirty-three infants with CH were also studied at the age of 35-37 months.

CD005253,0,17454166,0,Prospective evaluation of pregnant women with hypothyroidism: implications for treatment.,"Pregnancy is characterized by a series of maternal hormonal and metabolic changes which can affect thyroid function and the course of thyroid dysfunction in different ways. Moreover, hypothyroidism is also associated with obstetric complications and morbidity to the fetus. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of hypothyroidism during the course of pregnancy and the necessity of adjusting the dose of levothyroxine. We prospectively followed 16 patients with previous diagnosis of hypothyroidism. In ten patients (62.5%) it was necessary to raise the dose of levothyroxine, with a median increase of 20.7%. One pregnancy was complicated by premature amniorrhexis and two by pre-eclampsia. The screening for congenital hypothyroidism was negative in all newborns. We conclude that it is very important to offer screening to high-risk patients who wish to become pregnant. Dose adjustment based on serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is essential. In patients in whom TSH is not measured during the first weeks of pregnancy, a good approach could be to increase the dose of replacement therapy by 20-25% to avoid hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,17917306,0,Successful intrauterine therapy for fetal goitrous hypothyroidism during late gestation.,"We experienced a case of fetal goitrous hypothyroidism in an infant delivered by a 33-year-old woman receiving 300 mg/day of propylthiouracil (PTU) for hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. A large fetal goiter (maximum diameter, 60 mm) was detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 36 weeks of gestation. Initial fetal blood sampling revealed hypothyroidism with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 99 microIU/mL, free triiodothyronine (T(3)) of 1.97 pg/mL, and free thyroxine (T(4)) of 0.29 ng/dL. Consequently, a diagnosis of fetal goitrous hypothyroidism due to transplacental passage of maternal PTU was made. To reduce the risk of perinatal complications, 300 microg of levothyroxine sodium (L-T(4)) was administered into the maternal amniotic fluid twice between 37 and 38 weeks of gestation. Subsequent fetal MRI showed that the size of goiter had decreased. At 38 weeks and 5 days of gestation, a 3042-g male infant was born by cesarean section. There were no severe complications at delivery, although mild tachypnea was observed and the infant's thyroid gland was slightly enlarged. He was treated with L-T(4) for two weeks. At present, his growth and neurological development are normal. This case indicates that intrauterine therapy by the intraamniotic administration of L-T(4) can be effective in treating fetal goitrous hypothyroidism even during late gestation."
CD005253,0,2381635,0,Fetal blood sampling in the management of intrauterine thyrotoxicosis.,"Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (Igs) which result in an excess production of thyroid hormones. These Igs are passively transferred to the fetus and may produce intrauterine thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxic fetuses are at risk for preterm delivery, intrauterine growth retardation, and perinatal death. Our patient had markedly elevated thyroid-stimulating Igs and had given birth to a preterm thyrotoxic infant in a previous pregnancy. We managed her third pregnancy with serial assessment of fetal thyroid hormones by funipuncture to identify the hyperthyroid fetus and modulate propylthiouracil therapy. We believe that this approach in selected patients with Graves disease may improve the outcome of these pregnancies."
CD005253,0,3714096,0,[Iodine and delayed immunity].,"Iodine was and is sometimes used therapeutically in various pathologies where the immune mechanism is known to play a dominant role. It has in fact been administered to patients with tubercular granulomatous, lepromatous, syphilitic and mycotic lesions where it facilitates cure. This effect does not depend on iodine's action on the micro-organism responsible. Iodine may also be used in Villanova-Panol Panniculitis, in erythema nodosum, in nodular vasculitis, erythema multiforme and Sweet's syndrome. Oral iodine is also very effective in the lymphatic-cutaneous form of sporotrichosis. In order to establish a relationship between dietary iodine and immune response, 607 infants residing in an area of endemic goitre were studied: 215 were given Lugol solution (2 drops a week for about 8 months) and 392 not. The immune response was assessed by the skin test method using tetanic toxoid and a clear correlation was shown between this and lymphocyte stimulation and monocytic chemotaxis tests. The test was considered positive when an infiltration of at least 5 mm in diameter was shown after 48 hours (in the U.S. 80% of paediatric cases aged 2-10 years old were positive). A significant difference was noted in the average diameter of the infiltrations after the tetanic toxoid skin test in the two groups considered (P less than 0.001). The results appear to indicate that an adequate iodine intake is necessary for normal retarded immune response. The molecular mechanism by which iodine increases immune response is still to be decided."

CD005253,0,23458048,0,Prenatal diagnosis and treatment perspective of fetal hypothyroidism with goiter.,"We describe two cases of fetal goiter in women with no history of thyroid disease. Diagnosis of fetal goiter during antenatal care was made by ultrasound and MRI. Congenital hypothyroidism was confirmed by fetal blood sampling that was treated with weekly intra-amniotic injections of L-thyroxin. One fetus was initially treated with four weekly intra-amniotic injections of 200 μgms of L-thyroxin, later increased to 400 μgms. The other fetus was treated with only three weekly intraamniotic injections of 400 μgms of L-thyroxin. Therapeutic response was monitored by repeated ultrasound and MRI along with fetal blood sampling. At birth, none of the babies had goiter and were put on oral thyroxin. Post-natal studies were suggestive of congenital hypothyroidism due to dyshormogenesis. No abnormality was detected at follow-up. These cases highlight the role of intra-amniotic thyroxine in management of fetal hypothyroidism with goiter."

Normal feedback control axis data were developed by Quest Diagnostics, Inc. - Nichols Institute Diagnostics and Loma Linda University, from free T4 and TSH measurements in 589 healthy subjects, 2 months to 54 yr of age; 83 untreated hypothyroid patients; and 116 untreated hyperthyroid patients. Twenty-four of the 42 CH infants and 57 of the 63 CH children manifested serum TSH concentrations appropriate for the measured free T4 level. In the remaining 18 infants and 6 children, serum free T4 values were increased 0.2-1.4 ng/dL (2.6-18.0 pmol/L) for the prevailing TSH level, suggesting a state of mild to moderate pituitary-thyroid hormone resistance. In the treated children, the mean T3 concentration was lower (by 32%, 102 vs. 150 ng/dL; 1.57 vs. 2.31 nmol/L) than in normal children, in agreement with earlier data in hypothyroid adults treated with exogenous T4. Serum Tg concentrations were normal or elevated in 90% of the 19 children with ectopic glands and 93% of 27 children with eutopic glands in whom measurements were available. There was a positive correlation between serum TSH and Tg concentrations (P < 0.001), suggesting significant endogenous thyroid hormone production in these children. Our results suggest that the majority of infants and children with CH have a normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid negative feedback control axis during treatment and that the measurement of serum TSH is a useful marker complementing the free T4 measurement in the management of children with CH. A minority have variable pituitary-thyroid hormone resistance, with relatively elevated serum TSH levels for their prevailing serum free T4 concentration. The prevalence of resistance is greater (43%) in young infants (< 1 yr of age) than in older children (10%), indicating that, in most children, the resistance improves with age."

Of the various thyroid hormone derivatives tested, only 3,3'-diiodothyronine (3,3'-T(2)) cross-reacted significantly (10%) with rT(3)-binding sites on the antiserum, while thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(3)) cross-reacted by less than 0.1%. The antiserum was used in a simple, sensitive, precise, and reproducible radioimmunoassay (RIA) for measurement of rT(3) in ethanolic extracts of serum. The dose-response curves of inhibition of the binding of [(125)I]rT(3) to antibody obtained by serial dilutions of serum extracts were essentially parallel to the standard assay curve. Recovery of nonradioactive rT(3) added to serum before extraction averaged 93%. Serum rT(3) concentrations were found to be (mean+/-SD) 41+/-10 ng/100 ml in 27 normal subjects, 103+/-49 ng/100 ml in 22 hyperthyroid patients, 19+/-9 ng/100 ml in 12 hypothyroid patients, and 54+/-7 ng/100 ml in five subjects with elevated serum thyroxine-binding globulin: the values in each of the latter three groups of individuals were significantly different from normal. Reverse T(3) was detected regularly in normal or supranormal concentrations in serum of 12 hypothyroid patients rendered euthyroid or mildly hyperthyroid by treatment with synthetic T(4). It is suggested that serum rT(3) values noted here should be taken to reflect the relative changes in serum rT(3) rather than its absolute values in health and thyroid disease. True serum rT(3) may be somewhat different because: (a) D.L-rT(3) employed in the standard curve and L-rT(3) present in human serum may react differently with anti-D,L-rT(2). (b) Even though 3,3'-T(2), which cross-reacted 10% in rT(3) RIA, has been considered unlikely to be present in human serum, it may circulate in low levels. (c) Cross-reaction of T(4) in rT(3) RIA of 0.06% although small, could contribute to RIA estimates of rT(2); the effect of T(4) would be particularly important in case of serum of hyperthyroid patients. Thus, serum rT(3) concentration in hyperthyroid patients averaged 89+/-48 mug/100 ml after correction for cross-reaction effects of T(4): this value was about 14% lower than that before correction (see above). Serum rT(3) concentration in cord sera of seven newborns averaged 136+/-19 ng/100 ml; it was clearly elevated and within the range of values seen in hyperthyroid patients. This was the case when the mean T(4) concentration in the newborn cord sera was moderately higher than normal and about one-half that in hyperthyroid patients, whereas serum T(3) was markedly below the normal adult level. A Pronase hydrolysate of thyroglobulin prepared from pooled normal thyroid glands contained 0.042, 3.0, and 0.16 mug/mg protein of rT(3), T(4), and T(3), respectively. The various data suggest that: (a) rT(3) is a normal component of human serum and thyroglobulin: (b) peripheral metabolism of T(4) is an important source of the rT(3) present in serum: (c) peripheral conversion of T(4) to T(3) and rT(3) may not necessarily be a random process."
CD005253,0,23332130,0,Non-autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism due to a mutation in TSH receptor: report on two brothers.,"Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is a condition characterized by a mild persistent thyroid failure. The main cause is represented by autoimmune thyroiditis, but mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in TSH pathway are thought to be responsible for SH, particularly in cases arising in familial settings. Patients with the syndrome of TSH unresponsiveness may have compensated or overt hypothyroidism with a wide spectrum of clinical and morphological alterations depending on the degree of impairment of TSH-receptor (TSH-R) function. We describe the case of two brothers with non autoimmune SH carrying the same heterozygous mutation in the extracellular domain of TSH-R and presenting with different clinical, biochemical and morphological features. The first one had only a slight persistent elevation of TSH, a normal thyroid ultrasound and did never require l- thyroxine (L-T4) replacement treatment. The second one had a neonatal persistent moderate TSH levels increase associated with a thyroid gland hypoplasia and was treated with L-T4 since the first months of life.These two cases support the recent association of TSH-R mutations inheritance as an autosomal dominant pattern with variable expressivity and suggest that the decision to start replacement therapy in patients with persistent SH due to TSH resistance should be individualized."
CD005253,0,12192540,0,Iodine deficiency in Europe and its consequences: an update.,"This paper updates the information on the prevalence of the disorders induced by iodine deficiency (IDD) in Europe. Thirty-two European countries were still affected by mild to severe iodine deficiency in the late 1990s. The most severely affected countries were in Eastern Europe, including Central Asia, but Western Europe was also still affected. National surveys recently conducted in 11 of these countries show that, with the exception of the Netherlands, none has yet reached a state of iodine sufficiency, though very significant improvement in the situation has been evidenced in many of them, e.g. Poland, Bulgaria and Macedonia. The consequences of persisting iodine deficiency are goitre, hyperavidity of the thyroid for iodide (which increases the risk of thyroid irradiation in the event of a nuclear accident) and subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy and early infant (with a concomitant risk of minor brain damage and irreversible impairment of the neuropsychointellectual development of offspring). Access to iodised salt at the household level in European countries affected by IDD increased from 5%-10% in 1990 to 28% in 1999. This constitutes encouraging progress. However, in terms of access of iodine-deficient countries to iodised salt, Europe remains the worst region in the world, as shown by the fact that the mean figure worldwide in 1999 was 68%. In Latin America it even reached 90%. Salt iodisation has to be further implemented in Europe. Until that goal is achieved, iodine supplementation in those groups most sensitive to the effects of iodine deficiency (pregnant and lactating women and young infants) will have to be considered in the most severely affected areas."

The majority of these people live in low-income settings and are typically deficient in more than one micronutrient. However, micronutrient deficiency among breastfeeding mothers and their infants also remains an issue in high-income settings, specifically among women who avoid meat and/or milk, women who may lack sufficient supplies of vitamin B12 and vitamin D, and/or women who are iron-deficient. Young children, pregnant and lactating women are particularly vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies. They not only have a relatively greater need for vitamins and minerals because of their physiological state, but are also more susceptible to the harmful consequences of deficiencies. Multiple-micronutrient supplementation might be an option to solve these problems."

Based on the TSH levels, the goats could be divided into three groups: a euthyroid group of eight goats with TSH levels between 28 and 55 mU/liter, a hypothyroid group of six goats with TSH levels higher than 199 mU/liter, and an intermediary group of two goats with TSH levels of 120 and 124 mU/liter, respectively. The euthyroid and intermediate animals had normal T4 levels (less than 49 nmol/liter), except for three newborn goats, which had T4 levels above 250 nmol/liter. The hypothyroid goats had T4 levels below 43 nmol/liter. The mean numbers of strands composing the tight junctions were negatively correlated with TSH levels. Hence, the tight junctions of the glands of hypothyroid goats are narrower and are composed of fewer strands than those of normal thyroids. This reduction in tight junction complexity may provide an explanation for the leakage of proteins into the follicles of goitrous glands."
CD005253,0,7880000,0,[Transient changes in thyroid function in the neonatal period].,"Transient neonatal hypothyroidism (TH) is a state biochemically characterized by altered TSH and T4 values at screening and subsequently confirmed by serum analysis. TH can go or not go along with clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism and evolves to the normalization of the thyroid functional capacity independently of substitutive therapy. In addition to the complete TH the application of screening programs for congenital hypothyroidism has enable to acknowledge partial changes of the thyroid functional capacity in the neonatal age characterized by isolated anomalies of the individual hormonal parameters. Since the incidence of neonatal TH in Italy is remarkably high (the forms of complete TH being not less than 20% of the hypothyroidism cases diagnosed at the screening) we want to provide an overview of the latest acquisitions regarding TH. Finally the indications for treatment of the various forms of TH, a still controversial matter, are considered, in consideration of the primary role played by thyroid hormones on the development of central nervous system in the perinatal age."

Few data are available about the appropriate dose during childhood and early adolescence; therefore, we performed a multicenter observational study in a large population of patients with CH to assess the required levothyroxine dose to obtain euthyroidism. We recruited 216 patients with permanent CH classified into three groups (agenesia, ectopia, and in situ gland) on the basis of the thyroid imaging. The levothyroxine dose was recorded at 6 and 12 months and then yearly until 12 years of age. The daily levothyroxine requirement progressively decreased during the follow-up, irrespective of etiology. It was significantly lower in patients with in situ gland than in patients with athyreosis during the entire study period and with ectopic gland from the age of 1 year. The levothyroxine requirement at 6 months of age was correlated with the requirement at each later time-point. The daily dose was modified less frequently in patients with in situ thyroid (36 %) than in patients with ectopic gland (41.4 %) or with athyreosis (43.6 %). Patients with in situ gland required a lower dose than the other two subgroups. The dose at 6 months seems predictive of the requirement until 12 years of age. Euthyroidism may be achieved in pre-school and in-school patients by 3-4 and 2-3 µg/kg/day (70-90 and 60-80 µg/m(2)/day) of levothyroxine, respectively."

This 19-year-old man was diagnosed as having astrocytoma in the right temporal lobe by CT scan and angiography at the age of 6 months. After total tumor resection and whole brain irradiation (60Co 60 Gy), he showed profound psychomotor retardation, endocrinologic dysfunction including hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency, and sleep-wake rhythm disturbance. At the age of 19, brain MRI revealed asymmetrical low intensity in the hypothalamic region. On endocrinological examination panhypopituitarism due to primary hypothalamic lesion was evident. His S-W rhythm was disturbed showing a dispersed type sleep, i.e., sleep periods were dispersedly distributed throughout the 24 hours. So he showed a lethargic tendency in the daytime. All-day polysomnography revealed abnormal sleep structure such as the absence of sleep spindle and hump, peripheral apnea, snoring and low oxygen saturation. After L-thyroxine supplementation his daily activity improved gradually. The decrease in short time sleep and tendency of a free-running rhythm were observed and oxygen saturation improved remarkably. Peripheral apnea and snoring disappeared. The wakening effect of L-thyroxine administration may be due to improvement of hypothyroidism symptom such as myxoedematous pharynx. In addition, it seems related to the alteration of the central S-W rhythm regulation, because free-running rhythm appeared after L-thyroxine administration. Vitamin B12 (VB12), which has been reported to be effective for sleep-wake rhythm disorders, was not effective for our patient's free-running rhythm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Mean basal plasma T4 was 8.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms/dl (mean +/- SD) and remained constant during the study while mean serum FT4 increased significantly from 1.64 +/- 0.50 ng/dl to a maximum of 2.08 +/- 0.63 ng/dl 4 h after medication. Plasma T3 decreased significantly from 241 +/- 48 ng/dl to 202 +/- 36 ng/dl 6 h after drug administration. Finally, plasma TSH decreased significantly from a mean of 24.2 +/- 18.8 microU/ml to 14.8 +/- 10.5 microU/ml 6 h later. Therefore during treatment of congenital hypothyroidism with L-T4 no specific schedule for T4 sampling is required. However, TSH determination 4 to 8 h after medication could slightly underestimate mean levels. In addition, any attempt to monitor treatment by FT4 determination should take into consideration variations of plasma values in the hours following L-T4 absorption."

Medications containing iodide may induce hypothroidism in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 131I or surgically treated Graves' disease, or following hemithyroidectomy for nodules; and they may induce hyperthyroidism in patients with endemic iodine-deficient goiter, autonomous nodules or nontoxic nodular goiter, or in patients recently treated with antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease. Rarely, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may develop in patients with completely normal thyroid function during administration of iodide. The etiology of iodide-induced goiter and hypothyroidism in patients with cystic fibrosis remains obscure. Iodide-induced myxedema may also occur in patients receiving drugs which alter thyroid function, such as lithium, phenazone, and sulfisoxazole. Finally, iodides do have a role in the treatment of hyperthyroidism but their use should probably be restricted to thyroid storm, preoperative preparation of the hyperthyroid patient, and following 131I treatment."

Thyroid hormone supplementation appears to be safe in neonatal and pediatric post-operative cardiac patients, but the benefits have been modest and inconsistent. Glucocorticoids appear to decrease the inflammatory response associated with cardiopulmonary bypass in children, but have little effect on clinical outcomes. The role of AVP in pediatric shock remains limited due to inconsistent trial results and its potential side effect profile. Although mineralcorticoids are commonly used to treat neurocardiogenic syncope, little to no benefit has been demonstrated in controlled trials. GH normalizes altered cardiac function in children who are GH deficient, but its effectiveness in the treatment of heart failure has been variable. Overall, the use of these hormones in a variety of pediatric cardiac conditions generally appears to be safe, but their efficacy for relieving symptoms, improving cardiac function, and improving clinical outcomes remains unclear."

CD005253,0,3315407,0,Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism in children.,"Congenital hypothyroidism is a relatively common endocrine disorder, affecting one in 4000 newborn infants. Undiagnosed and untreated congenital hypothyroidism will result in un-toward consequences, including mental retardation and other significant neurologic sequelae. For these reasons, programs to screen newborns were developed to detect congenital hypothyroidism before clinical features become obvious enough to suggest the diagnosis. The most common clinical features include prolonged jaundice, skin mottling, hypotonia, umbilical hernia, constipation, and macroglossia. Congenital hypothyroidism may be caused by several different disorders; ectopic thyroid glands represent the most common cause. There is accumulating evidence that autoimmune thyroid disease as manifested by TBII may be the cause of thyroid dysgenesis in some cases. The diagnosis is easily confirmed by finding a low serum free T4 or total T4 and elevated serum TSH concentration. The treatment of choice is levothyroxine; these infants must be followed carefully to ensure normal growth and development and maintenance of serum T4 and TSH within the normal ranges. With appropriate treatment and follow-up, the large majority of these infants have an excellent prognosis, with an IQ no different from comparison populations. However, it appears that there is still a small percentage of infants who are the most severely affected, who manifest the lowest serum T4 levels, thyroid aplasia, and retarded bone ages, and who may run the highest risk for some degree of retardation and other neurologic sequelae. Acquired hypothyroidism is also a relatively common disorder, occurring in one in 500 to one in 1000 school-age children. These children most commonly have a slowdown in growth, short stature, a goiter, and a drop in school performance. Other clinical features may be subtle or absent except in more severe or long-standing cases. The most common cause is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. The diagnosis is easily established by finding low serum-free T4 or total T4 and elevated serum TSH concentrations. Again, levothyroxine is the treatment of choice. With appropriate treatment and follow-up, all clinical features that develop after age 3 should be reversible and the prognosis should therefore be very good."

However, severely hypothyroid newborns remain at risk of cognitive problems that may be avoided if they are treated within two weeks of birth, hence the importance of a quick turnaround time of the screening programme. This also applies to screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency based on the measurement of 17-hydroxy-progesterone from dried blood; this was primarily designed to prevent neonatal deaths from acute adrenal insufficiency. This goal can be achieved by a high degree of clinical awareness of the diagnosis, but this has only been reported in a few jurisdictions. Furthermore, biochemical screening allows earlier treatment. On the other hand, there are many false positives, mostly in premature infants, so screening for 21-hydroxylase deficiency has not been universally adopted."

In the present report the first child born to a mother with Graves' disease developed transient hyperthyroidism during the newborn period. The mother underwent radioactive iodine treatment and was maintained euthyroid on l-thyroxine. Two subsequent children were detected by newborn thyroid screen to have low thyroxine and markedly elevated serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Technetium 99 metastable and iodine 123 scans at 22 days of age showed the second child to be athyreotic. The third child was not scanned. All three children were nongoitrous at birth. Patients 2 and 3 had continuous TSH suppression with thyroxine therapy for 3 and 4 years. Thyroid function measurements after discontinuation of therapy for 8 weeks were normal, and both children had normal 123I thyroid scans. The mother was found to have potent TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) levels in her serum (85.5%). A fourth child with low thyroxine and elevated TSH was born to a mother on a regimen of l-thyroxine for hypothyroidism. 99mTc scan at 26 days of age showed no thyroid tissue and was normal at 3 months. TBII activity was 35% in the maternal serum and absent in the infant's serum. The above laboratory and clinical data are compatible with the blocking nature of TBII, resulting in transient newborn hypothyroidism and an athyreotic appearance on scan.

CD005253,0,23235188,0,Deiodination in cancer growth: the role of type III deiodinase.,"Thyroid hormone (TH) is a pleiotropic agent that has widespread biological functions, i.e., it controls cellular growth, tissue development and homeostasis and neoplastic transformation. Suitable TH levels are critical for the development of various types of tissues and are essential for the regulation of metabolic processes throughout life. The serum concentrations of TH affect its biological activity. Moreover, at tissue level, TH action is regulated by the expression and activity of deiodinases, i.e., the enzymes that mediate the metabolic pathways by activating and/or inactivating TH. The type I and II deiodinases (D1 and D2) initiate TH action by converting thyroxine (T4) into the active TH form (T3), whereas type III deiodinase (D3) mediates the local attenuation of TH by converting T4 and T3 into the inactive metabolites rT3 and T2, respectively. The deiodinase system is a potent mechanism of pre-receptoral control of TH action; it is often altered in such pathological conditions as cancer. D3 is widely expressed in embryonic tissues and in placenta, where it blocks excessive maternal-to-fetal transfer of TH. In contrast, during late neonatal and adult life, D3 is expressed mainly in the central nervous system and skin. Interestingly, D3 expression is re-activated in various types of human cancers. Here we review recent evidence that D3 expression plays a crucial role in human carcinogenesis, and speculate as to its complex role in the regulation of cell proliferation in several neoplastic contexts. It is conceivable that the local modulation of TH action via deiodinases is a powerful molecular tool to manipulate the intracellular TH status, thus influencing the growth and maintenance of selected hormone-dependent cancers."

At that time, TSH plasma levels were normal (less than 6 micro UI/ml) in 47% of cases. After 1.7 month of treatment, 22% of patients had TSH levels greater than 10 micro UI/ml despite normal FT4 and FT3. This group of patients, despite being given an identical L-T4 dose, had a significantly lower FT4. They were not different from those who normalized TSH levels in terms of etiology, delayed bone maturation and levels of FT4 or FT3 at diagnosis. In conclusion, an initial dose of 7.5 micrograms/kg of L-T4 normalized FT4, FT3 and TSH in 80% of our patients. Twenty percent of patients seem to need more L-T4 to bring TSH levels back to normal at the end of the second month of treatment."
CD005253,0,596245,0,The possible relation between postpartum exacerbation of hyperthyroidism and neonatal thyrotoxicosis.,"Hyperthyroidism is generally considered to be ameliorated during pregnancy, and there appears to be a high incidence of postpartum exacerbation. These phenomena have to our knowledge not been related to neonatal thyrotoxicosis, a transient hyperthyroidism seen only in newborns of previous or current hyperthyroid mothers. The first of two siblings of a previously thyrotoxic mother had marked symptoms of neonatal thyrotoxicosis and high levels of thyroid hormones. The mother had not received antithyroid treatment during her first pregnancy. During her next pregnancy she was treated with propylthiouracil from the second trimester. This infant had only minimal thyrotoxic signs but almost as high levels of thyroid hormones during the neonatal period as the elder. The mother had no signs of postpartum exacerbation but her thyroid hormones were significantly elevated in the postpartum period analogous to the infants. Neither the mother nor the infants presented any increase in thyroid-stimulation hormone and long-acting thyroid stimulator during the hyperthyroid periods. The possibility is discussed, that postpartum exacerbation of hyperthyroidism and neonatal thyrotoxicosis may be related. They could be the result of a changed balance between a thyroid stimulator and an inhibitor after birth."

CD005253,0,3681579,0,"Lowered serum Ca, blood ionized Ca, and unresponsive serum parathyroid hormone with oral glucose ingestion in infants of diabetic mothers.","Oral glucose ingestion may lower serum Ca in infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs). Six metabolically stable IDMs were studied following ingestion of 1.7 +/- 0.1 g/kg (mean +/- SE) of glucose over 20 min and serum Ca, Mg, P, blood iCa, serum PTH, and CT were measured at 0, 1/2, 1, and 2 h. Data obtained in IDMs were compared with previously reported findings in 10 normal neonates. In IDMs as in normal neonates, serum Ca, Mg, P declined significantly after oral glucose ingestion. Blood Ca2+ was significantly lower at +1/2 h in IDMs versus normal neonates, and by analysis of covariance, trends in blood Ca2+ were significantly different in IDMs versus normal neonates, (p less than 0.05). Serum PTH concentrations were unaltered in IDMs versus a significant rise in serum PTH noted in normal neonates. The difference between the two groups was significant statistically (p less than 0.05). Baseline serum CT was elevated in both groups and did not change. Thus, in IDMs responses to oral glucose ingestion differs from that seen in normal neonates as follows: blood Ca2+ is lowered in IDMs versus normal neonates, and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) does not respond to a decline in blood Ca2+ in IDMs, whereas in normal neonates serum PTH rises and blood Ca2+ is maintained. We speculate that relative parathyroid gland unresponsiveness occurs in IDMs, which may result in lowered blood Ca2+ after oral glucose ingestion in these infants."

The purpose of this article is to suggest that transient hypothyroxinemia is defined by postnatal serum T(4) levels, which are cord levels corrected to an equivalent gestational age had the fetuses remained in utero, and that those levels are adjusted for the significant prenatal and intrapartum factors. Lowered serum FT(4) levels are not a consistent pathognomonic feature of transient hypothyroxinemia as postnatal FT(4) levels in this large series of preterm infants are within or above the cord values of equivalent gestational age, irrespective of severity of illness. Although serum T(3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels do not contribute to the diagnosis of transient hypothyroxinemia, measurement of their levels is nevertheless required for trial monitoring involving thyroxine substitution to avoid inadvertent suppression of the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis by excess T(4) substitution."

The efficacy and safety of postnatal steroids have yet to be demonstrated.

Rat tests indicate a teratogenic risk and published epidemiological studies are of restricted size. Delivery outcome was studied in 16,536 women who reported the use of meclozine in early pregnancy and was compared with all 540,660 women who gave birth. Information on drug usage was obtained prospectively in early pregnancy. Risk factors for using meclozine were young maternal age, to have had a previous child, not to smoke, to have a low body mass index. The use of some other drugs (antihypertensives, thyroxine, anticonvulsants) decreased the use of meclozine. Maternal diagnoses of preeclampsia or diabetes were less frequent when the woman had used meclozine. The twinning rate was increased and the sex distribution of the infants low (female excess). Preterm birth, low birth weight, short body length, and small head circumference occurred at a reduced rate after meclozine use, notably for boys. Also the rate of congenital malformations was reduced. If anything, delivery outcome is better than expected when the mother used meclozine. These beneficial effects are probably secondary to NVP. Meclozine can apparently be used without risk at this condition."

The goal of the study was to determine the dosage of vitamin D necessary to prevent rickets without inducing hypercalcemia. There was a 23% prevalence of hypercalcemia at the time of the diagnosis of hypothyroidism by screening whereas it was 21% in the children who were not given vitamin D during the first 3 months of LT4 treatment. This figure was significantly higher in those who were given vitamin D during the first 3 months of treatment and reached 70%. However, one of the 19 children not given vitamin D presented with biological signs evoking vitamin D deficiency. In conclusion, in hypothyroid infants, vitamin D should be administered carefully during the first 6 months of treatment and restricted to children at risk for developing vitamin D deficiency."

Current information regarding its etiology and pathogenesis has allowed classigying NeH in three major groups: endemic, transient, and sporadic hypothyroidism. The later corresponds to congenital hypothyroidism and encompasses a broad spectrum of hereditary disorders causing hypothyroidism in newborns and young children. These congenital disorders include hypothalamic-pituitary or thyroid dysgenesis and/or dyshormonogenesis, as well as hyporesponsiveness or resistance to either TRH, TSH or to thyroid hormones. The introduction of national screening programs for NeH have overcome the difficulties in the early diagnosis thus helping to prevent its serious and irreversible consequences on intellectual and physical development. Concomitantly, an increase in the need for complementary etiologic and molecular diagnosis has risen. The current capability to perform a fine and precise diagnose is crucial both for treatment of the affected infant and for genetic counseling of the family. Although incomplete, available epidemiological information in Mexico indicates that NeH prevalence can be as high as twice that in other developed world countries. On these bases, national public health policies and epidemiological surveyance must be strengthen not only to identify. diagnose and timely treat, but to prevent and eradicate endemic NeH."

CD005253,0,9803444,0,Plasma thyroid hormones in premature infants: effect of gestational age and antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone treatment. TRH Collaborative Trial Participants.,"Thyroid hormones are important for both perinatal adaptation and long-term psychomotor development; however, there is limited information on the effects of extreme prematurity and antenatal TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) treatment on pituitary-thyroid function. In this study we assayed plasma triiodothyronine (T3) and TSH in infants who were part of a collaborative trial of antenatal maternal TRH therapy. Within the control population (n = 166), infants of 24-28-wk and 28-32-wk gestational age had comparable levels of T3 (0.94 and 1.06 nmol/L, respectively) and TSH (5.7 and 7.2 mU/L) at birth, but the increases at 2 h and subsequent T3 levels were less in the 24-28 wk versus 28-32-wk gestation infants. In the TRH-treated group (n = 131), T3 was lower in the first day for infants delivered 7-72 h after antenatal TRH compared with control infants. TSH at birth was approximately 3.5-fold greater for infants delivered at 0-6 h after the last TRH dose compared with the control group and was suppressed in infants delivering at 7-36 h. T3 and TSH levels were not different between control and TRH-treated groups at 3-28 d of age. In TRH stimulation tests on d 28, control and TRH-treated groups had similar peak levels of TSH and incidence of exaggerated response (TSH > or = 35 mU/L). We conclude that extremely premature infants have a reduced postnatal surge in TSH and T3 and maintain lower T3 concentrations, probably reflecting tertiary hypothyroidism. The stimulatory and suppressive effects of antenatal TRH treatment observed at birth are transient and do not affect pituitary-thyroid responsiveness at 28 d of age."

CD005253,0,26799350,0,Graves' Disease Pharmacotherapy in Women of Reproductive Age.,"Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder in which inappropriate stimulation of the thyroid gland results in unregulated secretion of thyroid hormones resulting in hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease is the most common cause of autoimmune hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. Treatment options for Graves' disease include thioamide therapy, partial or total thyroidectomy, and radioactive iodine. In this article, we review guideline recommendations for Graves' disease treatment in women of reproductive age including the recent guideline from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Controversy regarding appropriate thioamide therapy before, during, and after pregnancy is reviewed. Surgical and radioactive iodine therapy considerations in this patient population are also reviewed. In patients who may find themselves pregnant during therapy or develop Graves' disease during their pregnancy, consideration should be given to the most appropriate treatment course for the mother and fetus. Thioamide therapy should be used with either propylthiouracil or methimazole at appropriate doses that target the upper range of normal to slightly hyperthyroid to avoid creating hypothyroidism in the fetus. Consideration should also be given to the adverse effects of thioamide, such as agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity, with appropriate patient consultation regarding signs and symptoms. Individuals who wish to breastfeed their infants while taking thioamide should receive the lowest effective dose. Surgery should be reserved for extreme cases and limited to the second trimester, if possible. Radioactive iodine therapy may be used in nonpregnant individuals, with limited harm to future fertility. Radioactive iodine therapy should be withheld in pregnant women and those who are actively breastfeeding. Clinicians should keep abreast of developments in clinical trials and evidence-based recommendations regarding Graves' disease in reproductive-age women for any changes in evidence-based practice."

CD005253,0,11825323,0,Amiodarone -- waxed and waned and waxed again.,"Amiodarone has been used as an anti-arrhythmic drug since the 1970s and has an established role in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although considered to be a class III anti-arrhythmic, amiodarone also has class I, II and IV actions, which gives it a unique pharmacological and anti-arrhythmic profile. Amiodarone is a structural analogue of thyroid hormone and some of its anti-arrhythmic properties and toxicity may be attributable to interactions with nuclear thyroid hormone receptors. The lipid solubility of amiodarone gives it an exceptionally long half-life. Oral amiodarone takes days to work in ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but iv. amiodarone has immediate effect and can be used in life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Intravenous amiodarone administered after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation improves survival to hospital admission. Many survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) die during the subsequent year, probably due to ventricular arrhythmia. Amiodarone reduces sudden death after MI and this benefit is predominantly observed in patients with preserved cardiac function. Sudden cardiac death, predominantly due to ventricular arrhythmias, is also commonly seen in patients with heart failure. The Grupo de Estudio de la Sobrevida en lsuficiencia Cardiaca en Argentina (GESICA) and Estudio Piloto Argentino de Muerte Subita y Amiodarona (EPAMSA) trials showed survival benefit of amiodarone in heart failure, whereas Congestive Heart Failure-Survival Trial of Anti-arrhythmic Therapy (CHF-STAT) did not. Subsequent meta-analysis established a survival benefit of amiodarone in heart failure. Implanted Cardioverter Def ibrillators (ICDs) also give survival benefit to patients at risk of sudden death. In patients with a history of ventricular fibrillation or haemodynamically-compromising ventricular tachycardia, ICDs have been shown to be superior to anti-arrhythmic drugs, principally amiodarone. Further analysis has been undertaken to ascertain which patients are most likely to benefit from ICDs, as these are more expensive than treatment with amiodarone. Patients with severely depressed ejection fractions should be the first to be considered for ICDs. A new indication for amiodarone is atrial fibrillation or flutter. Amiodarone is effective in chronic and recent onset atrial fibrillation and orally or iv. for atrial fibrillation after heart surgery. In atrial fibrillation amiodarone is more than or equi-effective with flecainide, quinidine, racemic sotalol, propafenone and diltiazem and therefore should be considered for first line therapy. Amiodarone is also safe and effective in controlling refractory tachyarrhythmias in infants and is safe after cardiac surgery."

Propylthiouracil (PTU; 200 mg daily) was prescribed to her and four weekly follow ups by the endocrinologist and obstetrician were ensured. At each examination TSH, FT4 and FT3 levels were normal and she became symptom free. Repeated ultrasound examination throughout the pregnancy did not reveal any fetal abnormality. The lady normally delivered heterozygotic twins. Umbilical cord blood of the baby boy twin showed a high TSH (541 µU/ml; reference range 0.270 - 4.20 μU/ml). He was started on thyroxine therapy (50 µg once daily). Ultrasound reported the absence of the thyroid gland. One month later TSH was within normal range and thyroxine dose was adjusted to 25 µg once daily. Repeated ultrasound confirmed the absence of thyroid gland. TSH was repeatedly normal. The boy is currently doing well on thyroxine replacement therapy. The other non-identical twin was a healthy girl with normal thyroid function tests and always thereafter.

CD005253,0,24053146,0,Increased concentration of iodide in airway secretions is associated with reduced respiratory syncytial virus disease severity.,"Recent studies have revealed that the human and nonrodent mammalian airway mucosa contains an oxidative host defense system. This three-component system consists of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-producing enzymes dual oxidase (Duox)1 and Duox2, thiocyanate (SCN(-)), and secreted lactoperoxidase (LPO). The LPO-catalyzed reaction between H2O2 and SCN(-) yields the bactericidal hypothiocyanite (OSCN(-)) in airway surface liquid (ASL). Although SCN(-) is the physiological substrate of LPO, the Duox/LPO/halide system can generate hypoiodous acid when the iodide (I(-)) concentration is elevated in ASL. Because hypoiodous acid, but not OSCN(-), inactivates respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in cell culture, we used a lamb model of RSV to test whether potassium iodide (KI) could enhance this system in vivo. Newborn lambs received KI by intragastric gavage or were left untreated before intratracheal inoculation of RSV. KI treatment led to a 10-fold increase in ASL I(-) concentration, and this I(-) concentration was approximately 30-fold higher than that measured in the serum. Also, expiratory effort, gross lung lesions, and pulmonary expression of an RSV antigen and IL-8 were reduced in the KI-treated lambs as compared with nontreated control lambs. Inhibition of LPO activity significantly increased lesions, RSV mRNA, and antigen. Similar experiments in 3-week-old lambs demonstrated that KI administration was associated with reduced gross lesions, decreased RSV titers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and reduced RSV antigen expression. Overall, these data indicate that high-dose KI supplementation can be used in vivo to lessen the severity of RSV infections, potentially through the augmentation of mucosal oxidative defenses."

Importantly, the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a key role in cell apoptosis, growth and proliferation. Thus, our present study aims to investigate the effect of miR-19b on the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during WT cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. WT tissues and adjacent normal tissues from WT patients were collected. qRT-PCR was applied to detect miR-19b expression in both the WT tissues and the adjacent normal tissues, immunohistochemistry was applied to detect the protein expressions of PTEN, P13K, and p-Akt, SK-NEP-1 cells were divided into the blank, negative control (NC), miR-19b mimics and miR-19b inhibitors groups. MTT assay, propidium iodide (PI) staining, Annexin-V/PI double-staining, Transwell assay and Western blotting were performed to examine cell proliferation, cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion, and the protein expressions of PTEN, P13K, Akt, and p-Akt. Increased miR-19b expression, positive expression rates of P13K and Akt, decreased PTEN expression rate, a negative correlation between PTEN expression and tumor lymph node metastasis, and a positive correlation between the expression of P13K and Akt and the clinical stages were observed in the WT tissues. The miR-19b inhibitors group exhibited decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion, and protein expressions of PI3K and p-Akt but increased PTEN protein expression compared with the blank and NC groups. Thus, inhibition of miR-19b suppresses the progression of WT by modulating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 3424-3434, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Women are mainly affected (94.2%), most often with euthyroid goiters (54.7%), followed by Graves disease (13.1%), hypothyroidism (8.8%), thyroiditis (6.6%), toxic multinodular goiters (6.6 %) and unclassified goiters (10%) [Gabon]. The paucity of laboratories specializing in endocrinology and of nuclear medicine facilities, the delay in diagnosis that results in compressive or recurrent goiters, and endemic goiters are all typical in Africa. In children and adolescents, death rates increase with congenital or acquired thyroiditis as with delayed physical or mental development. In this environment, thyroiditis can also be pregnancy-related. Very recent surveys show a prevalence of endemic goiters of 28.6% in the community of Sekota, Ethiopia, 64-70% in Sahel-Sudan (population aged 10-20 years), 20-29% in KwaZulu-Natal (school children), 14.3-30.2% in Namibia (school children), 0.21% (congenital hypothyroidism or cretinism) in Plateau State, Nigeria, 55.2% at Zitenga, Burkina Faso (210 persons 0-45 years), and 10% in Hararé and Wedza, Zimbabwe (newborn TSH >10.1 microIU/mL). The prevalence of goiters is 43.6% in children emigrating from Ethiopia to Israel. Millet from semi-arid zones contains apigenin at a concentration of 150 mg/kg and luteolin at 350 mg/kg, both of which can interfere with thyroid function. The harmful effects of cassava (also known as manioc) are better known: milling cassava reduces its goitrogenic potential. In addition to iodine deficiency, selenium deficiency, and the effect of the thiocyanates in cassava, ion concentrations in soil and drinking water appear to play a role. The proportion of thyroid surgery indicated for hyperthyroidism has tripled, now accounting for 18.5% of all such operations. This disorder is found today in subjects older than 50 years, mainly from rural areas, and caused most often by Graves disease (25 of 51 cases). Graves disease in young women can cause serious problems during pregnancy; in such cases assessment of the minimal effective dose of antithyroid agents is essential. Carbimazole leads to remission in 61% of cases of Graves disease. Hypothyroidism can be auto-immune and often in patent forms because of insufficient screening in Africa: 24 cases in Dakar (1984) and 37 others noticed by us (1998). Single-nodule tumors were assessed in 89 patients in Khartoum: they were found to be simple goiters in 72% of cases, follicular adenoma in 13.5%, cancer in 13.5% (with 6 of the 12 cases follicular, 5 papillary, and 1 anaplastic). The sex ratio for thyroid cancer in Ouagadougou is 0.22, thus mainly women. It affects mainly women in their 30s. Thyroid cancer at Ibadan was found to be papillary carcinoma in 45.3% of cases; follicular forms were seen in 44.5% and this series includes 5% of medullary cancers (7 cases), with a mean age of 34 years. Already 4 other cases from Francophone sub-Saharan Africa have been noticed. Iodine deficiency is suggested to play a role because follicular cancer in southern Africa accounts for up to 55% of thyroid cancers. Thyroid cancers in Algeria are associated with low socioeconomic status and characterized by a high prevalence of cancers discovered at an advanced stage and of anaplastic carcinomas. Oral potassium iodate is recommended: 30 mg of iodate a month or 8 mg every two weeks. Iodized oil has been recommended by some authors, as well as a combination of iodine and sugar, and the iodation of drinking water; these are in addition to the proposed methods of opening up areas by new infrastructure). In conclusion, thyroid disease is due predominantly to iodine deficiency and goitrogenic products, but we also note the increasing emergence of hyperthyroidism, especially Graves disease, atrophic auto-immune hypothyroidism, and thyroid cancer. The insufficiency of infrastructure in transportation, endocrinology, and nuclear medicine are a public health challenge for the third millennium."

This study examined the in vitro effects of allopregnanolone, the active progesterone metabolite, in models of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced necrosis and apoptosis. Cultured NT2 neurons were exposed to 1 mM NMDA. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was measured 24 h later. NMDA at a concentration of 1 mM produced a 39 +/- 19% release of total LDH. Exposure to 10 microM allopregnanolone prior to NMDA exposure reduced LDH release by 51% (P = 0.0028). NMDA stimulated apoptotic cell changes defined by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and 5,5', 6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1,3,3'-tetra ethlybenzimidazolycarbocyanide iodide staining were reduced to baseline values by both 10 microM allopregnanolone and 100 microM MK-801. Pretreatment with allopregnanolone (0-10 microM) reduced the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) = 2.7 +/- 0.1 nM). Physiologic concentrations of allopregnanolone provided protection against both necrotic and apoptotic injury induced by NMDA excitotoxicity."

CD005253,0,8290457,0,Genital antisepsis--test methodology and efficacy of povidone-iodine.,"Indications for antiseptic prophylaxis include use prior to urinary catheterization and other transurethral instrumentations, diagnostic or therapeutic instrumentation of the cavum uteri, and operations on the external genitalia and the vagina. Indications for antiseptic therapy include treatment of wounds and of infections of the genital tract and also include treatment of the vaginas of pregnant women to prevent infection in the newborn. For prophylactic antisepsis the aim is the optimal reduction of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. In some fields of application, e.g. before urinary catheterization, an immediate effect on the mucous membrane is required, but on other occasions, such as transvaginal operations, an additional sustained effect is desired. Testing the efficacy of mucous membrane antiseptics, especially for the genital tract, necessitates the establishment of standardized test methods. The variability in vaginal flora at various ages makes it reasonable to study women aged 20-50 years. Studies presented in this paper indicate that microorganism sampling using a cotton swab moistened with neutralizing fluid can be favoured compared to using a rinsing technique and that anaerobic culture techniques enable the measurement of the high reduction factors achieved by very efficient antiseptic procedures. Test methods validated for hand disinfectants are used for calculations and statistical evaluation. The antimicrobial efficacy of six vaginal antiseptic procedures were compared in patients prior to vaginal surgery. Three minutes after treatment, the highest mean reduction (log RF) of the normal vaginal flora as well as of potentially pathogenic microorganisms was obtained by povidone-iodine solution undiluted and povidone-iodine solution 1:10 (log RF 3.60 and 2.68, respectively). Out of three detergents with antimicrobial efficacy, octenidine 0.1% was the most effective preparation (log RF 2.32). Chlorhexidine 0.1%, hexetidine 0.1% and chlorhexidine 0.05% led to lower reduction factors (log RF 1.80, 1.62 and 1.02, respectively). After 30 minutes the log reduction factors were approximating each other in nearly all procedures (log RF 2.79-3.25) except the log RF derived from the procedure performed using chlorhexidine 0.05% (log RF 2.07). Povidone-iodine solutions seem to be the method of choice for mucous membrane antisepsis where an immediate effect is required. If a long period of action is needed all procedures examined, except chlorhexidine 0.05%, are acceptable."

Mortality rates are elevated and can rise to 50%. Therapy consists in conservative treatment based on thoracic drainage combined with total parenteral nutrition or use of low-fat high-protein diet supplemented with medium chain triglycerides. In case of failure surgical intervention may be considered. During the last years some authors have experienced the use of octreotide with doubtful results. In no case the drug impact on insulin, GH and cortisol secretion in neonatal age has been investigated and only in one case the effect on thyroid hormones has been assessed. We report the case of a 36-week baby with congenital chylothorax treated with octreotide for 42 days. The drug was well tolerated but hormonal level measurements showed a deep depression of insulin secretion unaccompanied by alterations of glucose levels. Levels of GH and TSH showed only a transitory decrease. ACTH and cortisol remained normal. At 5 months, the measurements of hormonal levels did not show significant alterations. It is not possible to determine if such a drug played an essential role in the solution of the pleural effusion, but it is important to emphasize that a prolonged treatment with octreotide has not caused, in our case, persistent hormonal alterations."

CD005253,0,12109618,0,Thyroid function in breast-fed infants whose mothers take high doses of methimazole.,"Recently, a few studies have shown the safety of methimazole (MMI) therapy of thyrotoxic lactating mothers on thyroid function of their infants. However, it is not known whether the effect of moderately high doses of MMI therapy on lactating mothers can be dangerous for breast-fed infants. Eighty-eight thyrotoxic lactating mothers and their infants were studied. 46 received 20 mg MMI and 42 were given 30 mg MMI during the first month, 10 mg for the second and 5-10 mg for additional 10 months of therapy. Serum T4, T3 and TSH concentrations and in hyperthyroid MMI treated mothers and their RT3U were measured in hyperthyroid MMI treated mothers and their infants, before and at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months after initiation of therapy. Serum MMI was measured in the infants of thyrotoxic mothers taking 20-30 mg MMI. Mean+/-SD of free T4 index (FT4I) in thyrotoxic mothers treated with 20 and 30 mg MMI for one month decreased from 20.1+/-4.2 to 9.7+/-1.5 (p<0.001) and from 20.6+/-4.8 to 8.6+/-3.0 (p<0.001), respectively. Values for free T3 index (FT3I) decreased from 587+/-53 to 180+/-39 (p<0.001) and from 610+/-49 to 151+/-31 (p<0.001) in those treated with 20 and 30 mg MMI, respectively. By the end of one month 5 had elevated FT4I or FT3I or both and 12 had elevated TSH. The dose of MMI was adjusted and thyroid function remained normal up to 12 months of MMI therapy in thyrotoxic lactating mothers. Serum T4, T3 and TSH concentrations of breast-fed infants were normal before and up to 12 months of MMI therapy of their breast-feeding mothers. The lowest T4 and T3 and the highest TSH values were 101 nmol/l, 1.8 nmol/l and 4.1 mU/l, respectively. Serum MMI levels were <0.03 in 7 and 0.03, 0.034 and 0.035 microg/ml in the other 3 infants. We conclude that the treatment of hyperthyroid lactating mothers with doses of 20-30 mg MMI day does not cause deleterious effects on thyroid function of their breast-fed infants."

GW2016 is a potent inhibitor of the ErbB-2 and EGFR tyrosine kinase domains with IC50 values against purified EGFR and ErbB-2 of 10.2 and 9.8 nM, respectively. This report describes the efficacy in cell growth assays of GW2016 on human tumor cell lines overexpressing either EGFR or ErbB-2: HN5 (head and neck), A-431 (vulva), BT474 (breast), CaLu-3 (lung), and N87 (gastric). Normal human foreskin fibroblasts, nontumorigenic epithelial cells (HB4a), and nonoverexpressing tumor cells (MCF-7 and T47D) were tested as negative controls. After 3 days of compound exposure, average IC50 values for growth inhibition in the EGFR- and ErbB-2-overexpressing tumor cell lines were < 0.16 microM. The average selectivity for the tumor cells versus the human foreskin fibroblast cell line was 100-fold. Inhibition of EGFR and ErbB-2 receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the downstream modulator, AKT, was verified by Western blot analysis in the BT474 and HN5 cell lines. As a measure of cytotoxicity versus growth arrest, the HN5 and BT474 cells were assessed in an outgrowth assay after a transient exposure to GW2016. The cells were treated for 3 days in five concentrations of GW2016, and cell growth was monitored for an additional 12 days after removal of the compound. In each of these tumor cell lines, concentrations of GW2016 were reached where outgrowth did not occur. Furthermore, growth arrest and cell death were observed in parallel experiments, as determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and propidium iodide staining. GW2016 treatment inhibited tumor xenograft growth of the HN5 and BT474 cells in a dose-responsive manner at 30 and 100 mg/kg orally, twice daily, with complete inhibition of tumor growth at the higher dose. Together, these results indicate that GW2016 achieves excellent potency on tumor cells with selectivity for tumor versus normal cells and suggest that GW2016 has value as a therapy for patients with tumors overexpressing either EGFR or ErbB-2."
CD005253,0,9262225,0,The mechanisms of transient hypothyroxinemia in infants born to mothers with Graves' disease.,"Transient hypothyroxinemia in infants born to mothers with Graves' disease is a unique disorder first reported by us in 1988. Most mothers of these infants have had no treatment, are diagnosed as having thyrotoxicosis during the last trimester, or were not well controlled during pregnancy. These infants are believed to have transient central hypothyroidism, the mechanisms of which have not been elucidated. We measured TSH-receptor antibody activities in maternal serum and blood thyroxine (T4) (free thyroxine, FT4) and TSH levels in blood dried on filter paper at 1, 3, and 5 d of age in 114 infants born to mothers with Graves' disease. The 114 infants were retrospectively divided into three groups according to the clinical course and thyroid function data: group G, neonatal thyrotoxicosis; group T, transient hypothyroxinemia; and group E, euthyroid. In group T, the dried blood T4 (FT4) level from cord blood and/or 1 d of age blood was 6.0 +/- 2.3 microg/dL (0.92 +/- 0.52 ng/dL), a value significantly higher than that at 5 d of age (3.6 +/- 1.0 microg/dL; 0.38 +/- 0.18 ng/dL) (p = 0.025 in T4, p = 0.042 in FT4). In contrast, these levels were significantly lower at birth relative to 5 d in group G (p = 0.0001 in T4) and not significantly changed in group E. The TSH level of cord blood and/or 1-d-old blood in group T was significantly lower than that of group E (p = 0.0006). Moreover, the TSH levels in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone were blunted in most infants in group T. Bone maturation was not delayed in group T, compared with euthyroid infants. The higher blood T4 (FT4) levels at birth, relative to 5 d in group T, suggested that the fetal T4 level was higher than that of the newborn period. The fetal T4 level might have been elevated owing to transfer of T4 from mother to fetus during the last trimester when the mother's thyroid function was elevated and consequently the fetal pituitary-thyroid axis was suppressed. Although the serum T4 (FT4) levels were decreased after birth, TSH levels were not elevated, probably because the pituitary-thyroid axis was suppressed. This may be the reason for the transient hypothyroxinemia with a normal TSH level in infants born to mothers with poorly controlled Graves' disease. Weak maternal thyroid-stimulating antibody activities and differences in sensitivity of the thyroid gland to TSH-receptor antibodies may contribute to this unique disorder."
CD005253,0,8550756,0,Outcome of severe congenital hypothyroidism: closing the developmental gap with early high dose levothyroxine treatment.,"We have previously reported that despite neonatal screening, children with severe congenital hypothyroidism treated at 5 weeks of age with 6 micrograms/kg.day levothyroxine have clinically significant intellectual impairment, whereas those with the moderate form of the disease are indistinguishable from controls. The developmental outcome of children with severe congenital hypothyroidism treated earlier with higher initial doses of levothyroxine remained to be determined. In the present study, 45 infants with permanent congenital hypothyroidism detected by neonatal screening are described. For the group, the median age at starting treatment was 14 days, and the median initial dose of levothyroxine was 11.6 micrograms/kg.day. Based on the area of their knee epiphyses at diagnosis, the patients were divided into 2 subgroups: severe (< 0.05 cm2; n = 10) and moderate (> or = 0.05 cm2; n = 35). The psychomotor development of 8 patients in each subgroup, matched for the socioeducational level of their families, was assessed at 18 months. Mean plasma free T4 levels were supraphysiological during the first few months of life, but mean plasma T3 levels remained within the normal range, and there were no signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The mean plasma TSH concentration was less than 4.5 mIU/L 4 weeks after starting treatment. Bone maturation remained delayed at 12 months in the severe cases and was not unduly advanced in the moderate cases. The mean (+/- SD) developmental quotients at 18 months were similar in severe and moderate cases (107 +/- 10 and 110 +/- 5, respectively). We conclude that with earlier treatment and a higher initial dose of levothyroxine, the early developmental outcome of infants with severe congenital hypothyroidism is now indistinguishable from that of infants with the moderate form of the disease who were used as controls."
CD005253,0,11838730,0,Effect of different starting doses of levothyroxine on growth and intellectual outcome at four years of age in congenital hypothyroidism.,"To evaluate the effect of different initial levothyroxine (LT4) replacement doses on growth and intellectual outcome in patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) detected by neonatal screening program, the longitudinal growth and intelligence quotient (IQ) were assessed and compared at 4 years of age in 83 patients with CH. The patients were divided into three groups according to the initial LT4 dose used: (1) group 1 (n = 42) received the previously recommended dose of 6.0-8.0 microg/kg per day; (2) group 2 (n = 21) received a dose of 8.1-10.0 microg/kg per day; (3) Group 3 (n = 20) a dose of 10.1-15.0 microg/kg per day. The IQ, evaluated by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence test at 4 years of age, was significantly higher in group 3 (IQ 98 +/- 9) compared to group 1 (IQ 88 +/- 13; p < 0.05) but not compared to group 2 (IQ 94 +/- 13). However, the IQs were below the normal range (< 85) in six patients from group 2 (28%), but in none of the patients from group 3 (p = 0.03). Patients from group 3, with severe CH at diagnosis, had an IQ (97 +/- 9) at 4 years of age, which was not different from that of patients from the same group with moderate CH at diagnosis (IQ 99 +/- 9). Similar results were also observed in patients from group 2 however, mean IQ scores in these patients (93 +/- 12) were several points lower than those observed in patients from group 3 (95 +/- 15). After the first month of treatment, optimal serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and free thyroxine (FT4) were achieved in all groups, however, only patients from group 3 were able to normalize thyrotropin (TSH) (group 1, 16.0 +/- 12.0; group 2, 9.2 +/- 10.0; and group 3, 2.4 +/- 3.3 mU/L; p < 0.0001). Twelve patients from group 2 treated with an initial LT4 dose above 9 microg/kg per day were able to normalize TSH levels within the first 3 months of life and this resulted in a better IQ (97 +/- 16) compared to the remaining patients from the same group (IQ 90 +/- 9). In the whole group of 83 patients the IQ at 4 years of age was positively correlated to both initial LT4 dosage (r = 0.27, p < 0.02) and FT4 concentrations after the first month of treatment (r = 0.29, p < 0.02), and negatively correlated to TSH concentrations after the first month of treatment (r = -0.27, p < 0.02). No significant differences were observed in height, weight, head circumference, and bone age maturation among the three groups of patients. No clinical signs or symptoms of overtreatment were observed during follow-up in patients receiving the higher LT4 dosage. Our results indicate that high LT4 starting doses rapidly normalize serum TSH concentrations resulting in an improvement of the IQ at 4 years of age, even in patients with severe CH at diagnosis. Growth and bone age maturation are not affected by such a high dose."

CD005253,0,27197737,0,Critical Dietary Habits in Early Childhood: Principles and Practice.,"The adequacy of a diet is usually evaluated based on nutrient intake. As people eat foods but not nutrients, food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) are needed. To evaluate dietary habits in infants and young children, the following stepwise approach is suggested: (1) develop country-specific FBDG to identify the potential of common nonfortified foods to ensure adequate nutrient intake and (2) examine potential 'critical' dietary patterns if main food groups are excluded, such as in vegetarian diets or if a family's precarious social status leads to food constraints. The German FBDG for infant and child nutrition demonstrate that a well-designed mixture of common foods results in an adequate supply of nutrients, except for vitamin D, iodine and iron. The following solutions are feasible to address deficiencies in these critical nutrients: routine supplementation (vitamin D), fortified complementary food consumption or supplementation for infants as well as inclusion of table salt in the family diet for children (iodine), and individual pediatric care for infants at risk (iron). In the exclusion of food groups of animal origin from vegetarian diets, several nutrients are at risk of becoming deficient if not substituted. Existing studies characterizing vegetarian children are rare. These were mainly published in the 1980s and 1990s and were biased towards a high social status. Thus, firm conclusions on today's dietary practices and health statuses of European vegetarian children cannot be drawn. A social gradient exists for food patterns and dietary quality in children, but energy intake need not necessarily be affected. Scenarios in Germany suggest that families on unemployment assistance can afford to eat a diet compliant with German FBDG only if they restrict food selection to basic food. Yet, the question of how families cope with financial constraints in everyday life remains. In conclusion, well-designed FBDG provide various opportunities to identify critical nutrients and critical food habits in early childhood and beyond."

CD005253,0,11332254,0,[Pregnancy (conception) in hyper- or hypothyroidism].,"Pregnancy is accompanied by changes in thyroid function. Due to the increased synthesis of thyroid binding globulin and the thyroid-stimulating effect of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), serum concentrations of thyroid hormones will increase in the first trimester of pregnancy (total T4, T3). Free T4 levels decrease during the latter half of pregnancy. Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is usually due to Graves' disease. Definitive therapy may be considered for cases prior to pregnancy, although a medical management as would be given during pregnancy is an equally good option. The medical management of hyperthyroidism consists of a monotherapy with thyreostatics in which the recommended dose needs to be adjusted on the basis of free T4 in the high-normal and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the low-normal area so as to minimise the risk of foetal hypothyroidism. The transplacental passage of maternal TSH receptor stimulating antibodies may cause foetal hyperthyroidism. Another cause of maternal hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is 'gestational transient thyrotoxicosis', which is associated with high hCG levels during the first trimester of pregnancy. It is nearly always accompanied by hyperemesis gravidarum. Hypothyroidism in pregnancy has negative consequences for the foetus. If the hypothyroidism is apparent prior to pregnancy, it should be corrected before conception (target TSH value of 1 mU/l). If discovered during pregnancy, treatment with levothyroxine should be started as soon as possible. In the case of a pre-existing hypothyroidism a 25-50% increase in the levothyroxine dosage is often needed during the first trimester of pregnancy. This is possibly due to an increased requirement. An adequate serum concentration of T4 is necessary for foetal brain development."
CD005253,0,1501934,0,Sonographic imaging of the thyroid gland in congenital hypothyroidism.,"We have attempted to facilitate differential diagnosis of etiological types of congenital hypothyroidism using real-time ultrasonography. Sonography of the thyroid gland was performed on 418 normal children, and 23 patients with congenital hypothyroidism and hyperthyrotropinemia. The thyroid gland was imaged by transverse scanning at the neck; the maximum thickness and the maximum width of the right and left lobe were measured. On the basis of the normal thyroid gland size obtained from normal children, the thyroid gland image of the patients were classified into 4 types: large image, normal image, small image, and no image of the thyroid gland at the neck: no image of the thyroid gland indicated agenesis or ectopia; large thyroid gland image indicated goitorous hypothyroidism. On the other hand, normal or small thyroid gland image probably included mild or transient forms of hypothyroidism, and transient hyperthyrotropinemia; these 2 types required further examination to complete the diagnosis. We concluded that real-time ultrasonography of the thyroid gland was a useful diagnostic imaging technic for patients who revealed elevated serum thyrotropin on neonatal mass-screening."
CD005253,0,9183486,0,Linear growth in early treated children with congenital hypothyroidism.,"Length/height was studied from birth to 6 years of age in 103 children with congenital hypothyroidism identified by the Norwegian or Swedish screening programs. We used the ""infancy-childhood-puberty (ICP) growth model"". This model describes normal linear growth during the first 3 years of life by an infancy component with the addition of a childhood component, the latter acting from the second half of the first year. In comparison with reference children, children with hypothyroidism had reduced growth from 6 to 12 months, and increased growth after 12 months of age. Mean onset of the childhood component of growth was delayed from 8.1 months (SD 1.9) to 10.4 months (SD 2.2) in girls, and from 8.9 months (SD 2.0) to 11.0 months (SD 2.1) in boys. Age at onset of the childhood component was correlated with age at start of treatment (r = 0.24), and in children with more severe hypothyroidism (pretreatment serum thyroxine < 40 nmol/l) inversely correlated with the L-thyroxine dose at start of treatment (r = -0.40). Change in height standard deviation score from 1 to 3 years of age was correlated with the serum thyroxine concentration at age 1 year (r = 0.30). The delay in the onset of the childhood component of growth and the association with age at start of treatment and initial L-thyroxine dose indicate that thyroid hormones during the first months of life are essential for normal onset of the childhood component of growth, which otherwise is assumed to be growth hormone-dependent."

CD005253,0,11291787,0,Micronutrient malnutrition--present status and future remedies.,"Micronutrient deficiency is a serious public health concern in most of the developing countries which leads to malnutrition syndromes. The micronutient deficiencies which are of greatest public health significance include iron deficiency, vitamin A deficiency and iodine deficiency disorder. National Pilot Programme on Control of Micronutrient Malnutrition was launched in 1995 and the department of biochemistry and nutrition of the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Calcutta was entrusted to co-ordinate the activities. It presently covers five eastern and north-eastern states. Baseline situation analysis was conducted mainly on iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorder and vitamin A deficiency. Comparing with WHO cut off figures, point prevalence of anaemia in various age groups was found to be high. Bitot's spot was mainly noted in the age group of 6-71 months. Nightblindness was found in the children of the age group of 24-71 months. High prevalence of nightblindness in pregnant women is a point of concern. Action needed to control micronutrient deficiency includes: Intervention strategies, extensive nutrition and health education, to support the problem specific programmes, to stregthen various state government programmes and strengthen role of NGOs."
CD005253,0,2758010,0,Longitudinal manganese and copper balances in young infants and preterm infants fed on breast-milk and adapted cow's milk formulas.,"1. Mn and Cu intake and retention in twenty full-term infants and six preterm infants were studied on the basis of 72 h balances. The age of the infants was 2-16 weeks and the gestational age of the preterm infants (triplets) 34 and 36 weeks. Three nutrition schemes were pursued: breast-fed, formula-fed with unsupplemented adapted formula and formula-fed with trace element supplementation. 2. The mean Mn concentration of all breast-milk samples (n 2339) was 6.2 micrograms/l. The two formulas had similar Mn concentrations (77 and 99 micrograms/l) but had different Fe, Cu (121 and 619 micrograms/l), Zn and I contents. The mean Cu concentration in mother's milk was 833 micrograms/l. 3. The following mean daily Mn intakes and retentions (micrograms/kg) respectively were measured: breast-fed full-term 1.06 (SD 0.43) and 0.43 (SD 0.65), formula-fed full-term 14.2 (SD 3.1) and 2.8 (SD 4.8), formula-fed preterm 15.0 (SD 2.2) and 0.06 (SD 5.87). The results for Cu were 114.5 (SD 22.3) and 88.0 (SD 46.5) micrograms/kg in breast-fed, 19.8 (SD 4.2) and 4.6 (-11.5-9.6) in the unsupplemented formula-fed and 106.4 (SD 18.9) and 55.5 (SD 20.3) in the supplemented formula full-term infant group. No significant influence of the trace element contents of the formulas on the relative retention of Mn or Cu was found. 4. Young preterm infants, and to some degree young full-term infants, often had negative Mn balances caused by a high faecal excretion. The formulas with a Mn concentration below 100 micrograms/l gave a sufficient supply of Mn. Preterm infants fed on the unsupplemented formula had a marginal Cu supply and their first balances were negative (-3.8 (SD 1.8) micrograms/kg). 5. In accordance with the estimated safe and adequate daily dietary intakes (recommended dietary allowances), formula-fed infants receive much more Mn than breast-fed infants and their absolute retention is higher. 6. Cu from breast-milk had a significantly better biological availability than that from cow's milk formula. If retentions similar to those in breast-fed infants are intended, we conclude, therefore, that cow's milk formula should be fortified with Cu up to a level of at least 600 micrograms/l."

CD005253,0,2110411,0,Thyrotropin releasing hormone does not stimulate prolactin release in the preterm human fetus.,"Previous studies have suggested that fetal PRL secretion does not respond to stimuli such as TRH, metoclopramide, and cimetidine. It was postulated that the lack of response to TRH could be due to the possibility that, in the term fetus, lactotropes secrete PRL maximally and would be unresponsive to further stimulation. In order to study this hypothesis, 200 micrograms TRH or saline were administered to preterm pregnant women in labor. Maternal blood was obtained before TRH and saline administration. Maternal and cord blood were obtained at parturition. PRL, TSH, T4 and T3 concentrations were measured in all sera. TRH administration induced a significant increase in maternal serum PRL, TSH and T3 concentrations. In the cord blood of newborns whose mothers received TRH, serum TSH, T4 and T3 concentrations were significantly higher than in cord blood of newborns whose mothers received saline. Cord blood serum PRL concentrations were unchanged after TRH administration. This latter finding suggests that fetal lactotropes do not respond to TRH in the preterm fetus. Desensitization of fetal PRL secreting cells to TRH stimulation and/or the inhibitory effect of elevated fetal circulating corticosteroids on TRH-induced PRL secretion may explain the absent PRL response to TRH during fetal life."

Therefore it was our aim to establish reference intervals for serum triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (fT3), thyroxine (T4), free T4 (fT4), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) and thyrotropin (TSH) which are applicable from birth to adulthood by using the non-isotopic automated chemiluminescence immunoassay system, Immulite (DPC Los Angeles, USA). Serum samples from 762 euthyroid newborns, children and adolescents (369 female, 393 male; age 1 day to 19 years) were examined; of these, 381 were classified as pubertal. Due to non-normal distribution, the 2.5th, 50th and 97.5th percentiles (the central 95% interval) were calculated for each group. The median concentrations of T4, fT4 and TSH were up to 3.2-fold higher during the first 2 weeks, while T4 increased during the first month of life. The concentrations in all age groups showed no sex differences. From 1 year onwards, the concentration of all parameters tended to decrease until adult age, with the exception of TBG which increased by >60% (p<0.02) and reached a maximum at approximately 5 years of age. The findings underscore the fact that thyroid hormones are not associated with sexual development, except for TBG, which decreased slightly (p<0.04) between Tanner stages 1 and 5. However, the reference intervals established here demonstrate that marked changes occur in concentrations of thyroid hormones after the neonatal period. Our findings complement these of earlier studies. The developed reference intervals can be used to assess the thyroid status of patients, particularly if the measurements are done on the Immulite/Immulite 2000 system."

The UNICEF Mongolia Country Program and the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office (UNICEF/EAPRO) realized that Mongolian children are likely to suffer the most as reduced income and food availability aggravate problems associated with malnutrition. Hence, from 16 June-7 July 1992, a team from the Institute of Nutrition at Mahidol University, Thailand, collaborated with local UNICEF personnel and government health officials in designing and initiating the 1992 Mongolian Child Nutrition Survey. This paper presents the preliminary survey data of 342 randomly selected children aged 0-48 months in Ulaanbaatar. Results indicate that the four major health and nutrition problems are protein energy malnutrition (PEM), iodine deficiency disorders, vitamin D deficiency, and an unusually high rate of acute respiratory infections. Also requiring more in-depth study are low birth weight, iron deficiency anemia and vitamin A deficiency."
CD005253,0,9245878,0,Risk assessment of the nuclear medicine patient.,"Two types of risk are identified following the administration of a radiopharmaceutical to a patient: the risk to the patient, and the risk to critical groups exposed to the patient. The method for quantifying the risk to the patient is described in terms of estimating the effective dose. The main limitations in these estimates for adult and paediatric patients are uncertainties in the biokinetic data, and the assumption of a uniform distribution of activity in each organ. Effective doses from most nuclear medicine procedures will not exceed twice the annual dose from natural background radiation in the UK. Lack of human placental transfer data is now the main limitation to estimating fetal doses. The characteristics of two methods which can be used to derive the dose to critical groups exposed to nuclear medicine patients are reviewed. It is shown that studies using either method have indicated that the current recommendations in the UK for restricting the exposure of these groups and the recommendation recently proposed for restricting the exposure of pregnant members of staff are not appropriate. Revised recommendations for restricting the behaviour of patients administered iodine-131 should await the results of a current multicentre trial. The method to estimate the dose to a breast-fed infant from a mother administered a radiopharmaceutical is outlined, and the recently revised guidance for interrupting breast feeding is summarised. When a recommendation for controlling risk is to be derived from dosimetry data obtained from a number of individuals, an outstanding issue to be resolved is the value (e.g. 95% upper confidence limit) on which it should be based."

CD005253,0,2577304,0,Prevention and treatment of fetal lung immaturity.,"In the last 10 years the strategy for the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has been directed towards the acceleration of fetal lung maturity in utero by means of drugs administered to the mother, the most thoroughly investigated being glucocorticoids (GC), and to the development of surfactant substitutes for the treatment of surfactant deficiency at birth or following the development of RDS. GC decreases the incidence of RDS in the neonate delivered between 28 and 32 weeks and weighing less than 1,500 g. The type of GC and the drug-delivery interval are critical. Harmful potential side effects of GC have led to the testing of other drugs capable of accelerating fetal lung maturity, among which are ambroxol and aminophylline. Ambroxol has been shown to significantly reduce RDS compared to placebo without causing important adverse effects in either mother or baby. Our experimental studies on aminophylline have shown that the drug exerts only minor beneficial effects on fetal lung maturation and surfactant production. We have evaluated the association of GC with inositol. The sugar alcohol administered to the mother dramatically affected fetal lung mechanics, reducing GC adverse effects such as the decrease of lung protein content. More recently supplementary surfactant instilled into the trachea has been shown to improve oxygenation of premature babies and to reduce the severity of RDS."

While this paradigm has been extensively used in adults with and without clinical conditions, it has not, to our knowledge, been studied in a clinical pediatric population. Children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) identified by newborn screening and treated early in life have normal intelligence but demonstrate residual cognitive deficits including selective memory problems that are attributed to their loss of thyroid hormone during hippocampal formation. Since the hippocampus is integral for recognition memory, we hypothesized that children with CH would perform atypically on the repetition paradigm. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during word and face recognition in nine children aged 11 to 13 years with CH and nine typically developing children matched for age. Results revealed that while the groups did not differ in accuracy or reaction time, they did differ significantly on selective ERP components. Like normal adults, the comparison children showed a positive elevation in P3 amplitude for repeated relative to new words at the parietal electrodes, whereas children with CH did not. Both groups produced weak repetition effects when viewing faces, although the amplitudes of children with CH were somewhat smaller. It is proposed that the dampened neurophysiological response to repeated verbal stimuli by children with CH may explain some of their clinically observed difficulties in short-term recognition memory."

While the ""textbook picture"" does occur, the clinical findings in patients with mild to moderate disease are often nonspecific, particularly in the neonate and in the elderly. Diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism depends on showing that the serum TSH is elevated. Effective treatment, unchanged in principle since the 1890's, is best done with oral L-thyroxine. By using the serum TSH as well as the clinical findings as end-points, one can treat each patient individually."
CD005253,0,27534632,0,Consequences of iodine deficiency and excess in pregnant women: an overview of current knowns and unknowns.,"Severe iodine deficiency during development results in maternal and fetal hypothyroidism and associated serious adverse health effects, including cretinism and growth retardation. Universal salt iodization is the first-line strategy for the elimination of severe iodine deficiency. Iodine supplementation is recommended for vulnerable groups in severely iodine-deficient regions where salt iodization is infeasible or insufficient. A recent clinical trial has informed best practices for iodine supplementation of severely iodine-deficient lactating mothers. Because of successful programs of universal salt iodization in formerly severely iodine-deficient regions around the world, public health concern has shifted toward mild to moderate iodine deficiency, which remains prevalent in many regions, especially among pregnant women. Observational studies have shown associations between both mild maternal iodine deficiency and mild maternal thyroid hypofunction and decreased child cognition. Iodine supplementation has been shown to improve indexes of maternal thyroid function, even in marginally iodine-deficient areas. However, no data are yet available from randomized controlled trials in regions of mild to moderate iodine insufficiency on the relation between maternal iodine supplementation and neurobehavioral development in the offspring; thus, the long-term benefits and safety of such supplementation are uncertain. Although it is clear that excessive iodine intake can cause alterations in thyroid function in susceptible individuals, safe upper limits for iodine intake in pregnancy have not been well defined. Well-designed, prospective, randomized controlled trials that examine the effects of iodine supplementation on maternal thyroid function and infant neurobehavioral development in mildly to moderately iodine-deficient pregnant women are urgently needed. In addition, clinical data on the effects of iodine excess in pregnant and lactating women are needed to inform current recommendations for safe upper limits on chronic iodine ingestion in general and on iodine supplementation in particular."

Apart from the degrees of severity of the iodine deficiency, the frequencies and symptomatologies of cretinism and the other IDD are influenced by other goitrogenic factors and trace elements. Thiocyanate overload originating from consumption of poorly detoxified cassava is such that this goitrogenic factor aggravates a relative or a severe iodine deficiency. Very recently, a severe selenium deficiency has also been associated with IDD in the human population, whereas in animals, it has been proven to play a role in thyroid function either through a thyroidal or extrathyroidal mechanism. The former involves oxidative damages mediated by free radicals, whereas the latter implies an inhibition of the deiodinase responsible for the utilization of T4 into T3. One concludes that: 1. Goiter has a multifactorial origin; 2. IDD are an important public health problem; and 3. IDD are a good model to study the effects of other trace elements whose actions in many human metabolisms have been somewhat underestimated."

Treatment should be started promptly with an adequate dose of levothyroxine. Clinical and biochemical monitoring should be frequent during the first 3 years of life, when the brain can suffer irreversible damage from hypothyroidism. Except in patients with thyroid ectopy or with true athyreosis, permanence of hypothyroidism should be confirmed after 3 years of age by withholding treatment for at least 4 weeks and measuring serum TSH and T4 off therapy. Growth, psychomotor development and school progression should be documented, especially in children from socially disadvantaged families.

Other causes include hypothalamic and pituitary stalk lesions, neurogenic stimulation, thyroid disorders, and chronic renal failure. Patients with the latter conditions may have irregular menses, infertility, and osteopenia or osteoporosis if they have associated hyperprolactinemia. Tests for pregnancy, serum prolactin level and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and magnetic resonance imaging are important diagnostic tools that should be employed when clinically indicated. The underlying cause of galactorrhea should be treated when possible. The decision to treat patients with galactorrhea is based on the serum prolactin level, the severity of galactorrhea, and the patient's fertility desires. Dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice in most patients with hyperprolactinemic disorders. Bromocriptine is the preferred agent for treatment of hyperprolactin-induced anovulatory infertility.

Thus it is likely that the composition of thyroid extract is homogeneous and that the metabolism of thyroid hormones in the patients is similar. Thyroxine (T4) was the most reliable parameter for monitoring treatment as T3 levels were elevated in patients who were otherwise euthyroid. T3 uptake was rather insensitive but the free thyroxine index agreed well with the T4 level. A negative linear semilogarithmic correlation was demonstrated between TSH and T4 but not with T3. In some cases TSH was still raised although the T4 had returned to normal. It is postulated that this could be due to thyrotropic cells hyperplasia. TRH tests did not provide any further information. The recommended dose of thyroid extract which is needed to raise the T4 above the lower limit of normal for age (-2 SD) can be calculated from the regression of T4 and dose of thyroid extract.

CD005253,0,23746772,0,Maternal and child undernutrition and overweight in low-income and middle-income countries.,"Maternal and child malnutrition in low-income and middle-income countries encompasses both undernutrition and a growing problem with overweight and obesity. Low body-mass index, indicative of maternal undernutrition, has declined somewhat in the past two decades but continues to be prevalent in Asia and Africa. Prevalence of maternal overweight has had a steady increase since 1980 and exceeds that of underweight in all regions. Prevalence of stunting of linear growth of children younger than 5 years has decreased during the past two decades, but is higher in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere and globally affected at least 165 million children in 2011; wasting affected at least 52 million children. Deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc result in deaths; deficiencies of iodine and iron, together with stunting, can contribute to children not reaching their developmental potential. Maternal undernutrition contributes to fetal growth restriction, which increases the risk of neonatal deaths and, for survivors, of stunting by 2 years of age. Suboptimum breastfeeding results in an increased risk for mortality in the first 2 years of life. We estimate that undernutrition in the aggregate--including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, and deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding--is a cause of 3·1 million child deaths annually or 45% of all child deaths in 2011. Maternal overweight and obesity result in increased maternal morbidity and infant mortality. Childhood overweight is becoming an increasingly important contributor to adult obesity, diabetes, and non-communicable diseases. The high present and future disease burden caused by malnutrition in women of reproductive age, pregnancy, and children in the first 2 years of life should lead to interventions focused on these groups."

Postnatal T4, T3 and TSH concentrations were stable over this age range; there were no significant differences between male and female infant samples. However, there was a significant decrease in serum rT3 concentrations from 8 to 50 days of age. For the Group I infants, there were significant positive correlations between cord serum T4 and postnatal serum T4 levels, cord serum TSH and postnatal serum TSH levels, and cord serum rT3 and postnatal serum rT3 concentrations. For Group II infants, a significant positive correlation was found for cord T4--postnatal T4 serum concentrations."

CD005253,0,23002999,0,Intrauterine diagnosis and treatment of fetal goitrous hypothyroidism.,"We present two cases of fetal hypothyroidism with goiter which were successfully diagnosed and treated in utero. In both cases, ultrasonographic examination demonstrated a bilobed solid anterior neck mass with increased vascularity compatible with enlarged thyroid gland. Fetal blood sampling revealed hypothyroidism. Intra-amniotic injection of L-thyroxin caused a reduction in thyroid gland size and enabled vaginal delivery without complication. In the first case, maternal thyroid hormone levels and autoantibodies were normal and the neonate had hypothyroidism suggesting the diagnosis of dyshormonogenesis. In the second case, the fetus had transient hypothyroidism, which resolved spontaneously after delivery. Maternal thyroid function tests and autoantibodies were normal and both the mother and neonate had normal urinary iodine, excluding the diagnosis of iodine deficiency or excess. Thus, we believe that transplacental transfer of undetermined factors might be a cause of transient congenital hypothyroidism. Also, we reviewed the literature and described controversial issues regarding the management of fetal goiter."

CD005253,0,6848724,0,Preliminary results on the mental development of hypothyroid infants detected by the Quebec Screening Program.,"A prospective study of the mental development of hypothyroid infants detected by the Quebec Network for Genetic Medicine began in January, 1976. The mean age at initiation of thyroid hormone therapy was 27 days. Forty-five hypothyroid infants and 37 normal control subjects were assessed at age 12 months with the Griffiths mental development test; 77 and 41, respectively, were assessed at age 18 months, and 59 and 40, respectively, at 36 months. There were no statistically significant differences in the various test scores between the two populations at age 12 months, but at age 18 and 36 months the hypothyroid infants had lower scores in hearing-speech performance scales and practical reasoning (36 months) which also decreased their global quotient. The mean scores were still above 100 and only nine were below 85. Further assessment of the influence of early therapy on mental development at age 6 years is needed before definitive statements can be made about the long-term mental development in these subjects."
CD005253,0,16284447,0,An infant case of Graves' disease with ophthalmopathy.,"Graves' disease is a rare disorder in children, particularly in infants. Ocular manifestations of Graves' disease in children are even more rare and are mild compared to adults. We report a 3-year-old girl with Graves' ophthalmopathy who visited our clinic because of lacrimation. Her family had also noticed exophthalmos, goiter, irritability and increased appetite for more than 3 months. The ophthalmologist noted bilateral proptosis, eyelid erythema, lacrimation, entropion of the lower eyelid, and superficial keratitis. Her serum concentrations of free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine were high, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was low. Serum samples were markedly positive for antibodies to TSH receptor (TRAb) and thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb). Although hyperthyroidism was controlled with propylthiouracil within 3 weeks, her eye signs did not improve. We administered methylprednisolone pulse therapy for ophthalmopathy, but the effect was limited and the lacrimation due to entropion and superficial keratitis persisted. Titers of both TRAb and TSAb decreased slightly and transiently with the pulse therapy. One year later, both titers remained high and eye signs did not improve any more though she was clinically euthyroid. This might indicate that both TRAb and TSAb levels correlate with the clinical course. Therefore, TRAb or TSAb might be good indicators of progress of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Ocular manifestations of Graves' disease should be followed closely with measurements of both TRAb and TSAb even in infant cases."
CD005253,0,14552059,0,"[Frequency of subclinical hypothyroidism among healthy children and those with neurological conditions in the state of Mérida, Venezuela].","The purpose of this study was to investigate and to compare the frequency and possible aetiology of subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) in healthy and sick children developing neurological disorder changes. One hundred and eighty-seven male and female children between 1 month and 4 years old, 64 with and 123 without neurological disorders, were studied in the state of Mérida, Venezuela. Serum levels of thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and urinary iodine were measured by immunofluorescence and by the Sandell-Koltoff's method. Children were diagnosed as having SH if they had high levels of TSH and normal levels of FT4. Antithyroglobulin and antiperoxidase antibodies were measured in children with SH. To establish the frequency of SH, the TSH reference levels on the commercial kit (> 3.8 uU/mL) and the TSH reference levels of our group of healthy children were used. The latter was calculated (X + 2SD) from the values of TSH in the 123 healthy children (> 4.98 uU/mL). The frequency of SH in all children was of 15% when the TSH level from the commercial kit was used and of 6.4% when it was of our group of children (p < 0.001). The frequency of SH value was of 17.2% in children with neurological disorders and of 13.8% in healthy children when the commercial kit's TSH level was used. The frequency of SH in children with neurological disorders was of 7.8% and of 5.7% in healthy children, according to our TSH reference level. This difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences were found in the urinary iodine levels or in the presence of thyroid autoantibodies among the two groups of children with or without SH. There was no association between iodine urinary levels, presence of SH and neurological disorders. We conclude that: 1. In order to make suitable SH level diagnosis in children, we must establish our own levels of reference for TSH. 2. The frequency of SH in children from Mérida state is high, being slightly higher in children with neurological disorders. 3. The aetiology of SH is not due to iodine deficiency or immunological factors."
CD005253,0,15579797,0,"Altered thyroid and adrenal function in children born at term and preterm, small for gestational age.","Intrauterine growth retardation may permanently influence the endocrine system by affecting its programming during development. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid and adrenal function together with insulin sensitivity in a group of children born small for gestational age (SGA). Forty SGA children (mean age, 6.7 +/- 1.7 yr) and 35 children born appropriate for gestational age (mean age, 6.5 +/- 2.2 yr) were selected for the study. TSH, free T4, free T3 (fT3), rT3, antithyroid antibodies, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were assessed. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated with the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). A thyroid ultrasound was also performed in the SGA children. We found that TSH was significantly higher in SGA than in children born appropriate for gestational age [2.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.7 microU/ml (mIU/liter); P < 0.001]; furthermore, eight SGA children (20%), seven born preterm and one at term, had TSH levels above the upper limit of normality. fT3 was also higher in SGA children (4.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.6 pg/ml; 6.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.9 pmol/liter; P < 0.0001), whereas no difference was found for free T4, rT3, and the fT3/rT3 ratio. Urinary iodine was normal, and antithyroid antibodies were absent. Thyroid ultrasound showed a normal echographic pattern with a normal volume in SGA children. Serum cortisol was similar in both groups, whereas DHEAS was significantly lower in SGA subjects (43 +/- 18 vs. 65 +/- 50 microg/dl; 1.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.7 +/- 1.3 micromol/liter; P < 0.05). There was no difference in insulin sensitivity between the two groups. Birth length and birth weight were the main determinants of TSH and DHEAS serum levels, respectively. In conclusion, functional thyroid and adrenal changes have been found in children who suffered from intrauterine growth retardation. A larger survey with an appropriate follow-up is, however, required to confirm these findings and to assess their natural evolution."

Prevention of fetal hyperthyroidism by administration of antithyroid drug (ATD) and levothyroxine (LT(4)) to pregnant patients who previously received ablative therapy has been reported. We administered iodine and LT(4) to a patient during gestation, because she had a severe adverse reaction to ATD. Although gestation proceeded normally, the infant showed transient neonatal hyperthyroidism right after birth. We believe that the fetus would have developed hyperthyroidism if we had not administered iodine to the mother. Administration of iodine and LT(4) to a pregnant patient with Graves' disease showing a high TBII after ablative therapy should be considered in rare patients with allergy to ATD."

Until present, a clinical scoring system combined with leucocyte count, urine analysis and determination of CRP are recognised as being helpful to identify patients at risk of serious bacterial illness. In this study we asked the question whether the determination of procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL- Ra) was superior to these commonly used markers for the prediction of a serious bacterial infection (SBI). Children, 7 days to 36 months of age, with a rectal temperature above 38 degrees C and without localising signs of infection were prospectively enrolled. For each infant, we performed a physical examination, a clinical score according to McCarthy, a complete white cell count, an urine analysis and a determination of CRP. We further determined PCT, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1Ra concentrations and compared their predictive value with those of the usual management of fever without localising signs. Each infant at risk of SBI had blood culture, urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures when indicated, and received antibiotics until culture results were available. A total of 124 children were included of whom 28 (23%) had SBI. Concentrations of PCT, CRP and IL-6 were significantly higher in the group of children with SBI but IL-8 and IL-1Ra were comparable between both groups. PCT showed a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 78% for detection of SBI and CRP had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 75%."

We have determined an effective way to put this idea into practice. During the first phase of our study, neonatal serum TSH levels were obtained from umbilical cord blood of neonates born in Chiangmai and Nan provinces, where several districts were areas of severe iodine deficiency, and were compared with those of neonates born in Bangkok, which was a control area. The median and (95% CI [confidence interval]) of serum TSH level of neonates born in Chiangmai 5.8 (5.7-5.9) microU/mL was significantly higher than in Nan 5.1 (5.0-5.2) microU/mL, and in Bangkok 3.7 (3.7-3.8) microU/mL. Neonatal serum free thyroxine (FT4) concentration in Bangkok was higher than in Nan; while the reciprocal was true for neonatal TSH concentration in randomly selected samples (FT4 1.6 [1.6-1.7] ng/dL vs. 1.5 [1.5-1.6] ng/dL and TSH 3.5 [3.3-3.9] microU/mL vs. 5.5 [5.2-5.9] microU/mL, respectively.) When odds ratio of the likelihood of having neonatal TSH level higher than in Bangkok was calculated using 95th percentile value of neonatal TSH level in Bangkok as a cut-off point, the odds ratio of TSH profile in all districts in Chiangmai and Nan were greater than unity. In the second phase of our study, data were collected from 32 district and 10 provincial hospitals. The optimum number of samples in each hospital derived from the first phase of our study was at least 178. Discrepancy between goiter rate and odds ratio of TSH profile was observed, but there was a significant correlation between the two indices (r = 0.67, p < .001). Our study confirmed the practical utility of neonatal TSH profile as a biological index for assessment and monitoring and surveillance of an iodine prophylactic program at a district hospital in a developing country."

However, there remain questions concerning whether these drugs, especially methimazole (MMI), may be associated with aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) and how best to avoid impairment of fetal thyroid function during their use. We report an example of ACC and review the relevant literature. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence either to establish or eliminate a direct causal relationship between ACC and MMI use. Since propylthiouracil is an equally effective antithyroid agent and has not been associated with ACC, it is the preferred thioamide for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. Our review also indicates that impairment of neonatal thyroid function may be minimized by using a thioamide dose that is just sufficient to maintain the maternal serum free thyroxine concentration in the high normal or slightly thyrotoxic range."

All preterm infants received beginning with day 7 vitamin D3 1000 IU/day. In all preterms mean concentrations of 25-OH-D3 were normal and increasing with age. Concentrations of parathyroid hormone and calcitonine were first of all increased and decreased with age, especially in supplemented infants. Light metabolic bone disease without fractures occurred in 4 infants of supplemented groups. Non-supplemented group contains 5 infants with severe metabolic bone disease without fractures. Results indicate intact metabolism and secretion of 25-OH-D3, parathyroid hormone and calcitonine.

CD005253,0,8910812,0,Hyperthyroidism in children: an Indian experience.,"During the period 1986-1993, 24 children with hyperthyroidism were referred to us for management. Two of them had factitious hyperthyroidism, one toxic nodular goiter and another neonatal Graves' disease. Twenty children (6M, 14F) had Graves' disease. Their age at presentation was 10.86 +/- 2.02 years and duration of symptoms ranged from 2.5 months to 7 years. Neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as hyperkinesis, irritability, excitability and behavioral problems, were the most common initial presenting symptoms (90%). Goiter of varying grades was present in 18 children. Eye involvement of mild or moderate intensity was present in 85% and cardiac involvement in 30%. Serum free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were high and radioactive iodine uptake was elevated. All of them received carbimazole 0.5-0.7 mg/kg in three divided doses. Seventeen responded to therapy over a period of time while three did not. On withdrawal, six of the responders relapsed. Hyperthyroidism in children is rare and when it occurs it is almost always due to Graves' disease. The prominence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, insidious onset and absence of severe infiltrative ophthalmopathy differentiates it from the adult type of disease. Prolonged medical therapy is needed to induce good continued remission."

We report our experience in five children with congenital NS in whom thyroid supplementation was discontinued following bilateral nephrectomy and initiation of renal replacement therapy. Immediately after nephrectomy, thyroid function tests normalized, except serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration, which initially rose, but normalized later. This observation supports the hypothesis that hypothyroidism in these patients is secondary to the chronic massive proteinuria and is not the result of a defect intrinsic to the thyroid gland itself. Abatement of massive proteinuria enables discontinuation of thyroid supplementation, and a transient rise in TSH in the early post-nephrectomy stage should be potentially expected."

Results show that economic status and social affiliation of the households were the important predictors of non-iodized salt usage. Moreover, results from the multinomial logit model show that use of inadequately iodized salt is significantly associated with lower weight-for-age Z score, after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Nonuse of adequately iodized (15+ parts per million) salt is statistically associated with moderate underweight (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.11) and with severe underweight (RRR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.15-1.21).

SRIF infusion did not affect cord blood iodothyronine and thyroglobulin concentrations.

These hormone values were compared with the corresponding histological thyroid findings in 43 cases (11 SIDS, 32 controls). Nearly identical T4 and FT4 mean values were found in both groups which were within the norms. In contrast to the average values of the control group, the T3 and FT3 concentrations of the SIDS group showed an increase of 3.7-fold and 1.9-fold. Accordingly, histological examination of the SIDS group showed highly activated and extensively released follicles whereas normal colloidal-containing follicle structures were observed in nearly all control cases. The present findings indicate that neither postmortem T4 T3 conversion nor intensified agonal hormone secretion is likely to be the only cause of the increasing T3 and FT3 values. In SIDS cases chronic or recurring chronic stress situations are supposed to be the cause for the hormonal and histological thyroid findings. Some differential diagnoses are discussed. Within 18 h after death, increased concentrations of T3 and FT3, together with simultaneous colloid release, represent a diagnosis of SIDS."
CD005253,0,16842128,0,New inotropic pharmacologic strategies targeting the failing myocardium in the newborn and infant.,"Pharmacologic support of the failing neonatal heart to maintain cardiac output, which is vital for sufficient end organ perfusion, is a challenging task for the pediatric intensivist, especially since strategies which have been proven to be effective in adults cannot necessarily be extrapolated to neonates. The unique biochemical properties and structure of the neonatal heart, including the increased non-contractile tissue mass, a lower responsiveness to beta adrenergic agents and the heart rate dependent cardiac output with a limited ability to increase stroke volume, favor some of the new inotropes of the Ca+ sensitizer family. Focusing on the after load reduction, inodilators as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and human brain natriuretic peptide offer treatment options for the neonatal myocardium. Additionally, thyroxine and steroids have been investigated in neonates with low cardiac output after surgery for congenital heart disease.

Group I consisted of normal term newborns (20 females and 19 males), whose mean +/- SD gestational ages (40.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 40.1 +/- 0.5 weeks) did not differ, but whose mean birth weights (3299 +/- 282 vs. 3757 +/- 447 g) differed significantly (P less than 0.005). In female infants, serum Tg levels (r = -0.401; P less than 0.05) and the log of TSH levels (r = -0.576; P less than 0.005) correlated negatively with birth weight, while Tg levels correlated positively with the log of TSH levels (r = 0.401; P less than 0.05).

Both the Tg levels and the log of the TSH levels correlated negatively with birth weight in female (Tg, r = -0.891 and P less than 0.005; log TSH, r = 0.600 and P less than 0.005) and male (Tg, r = -0.849 and P less than 0.005; log TSH, r = -0.660; P less than 0.005) infants. Also, Tg levels correlated positively with the log of the TSH levels in female (r = 0.554; P less than 0.01) and male (r = 0.412; P less than 0.05) infants. Free T4 index levels correlated positively with free T3 index levels in female (r = 0.443; P less than 0.05) and male (r = 0.570; P less than 0.01) infants. Group III consisted of 12 normal female term newborns whose mean birth weight (3685 +/- 623 g) was not significantly (P less than 0.2) different from that of the males of group I, and 12 normal male term newborns whose mean birth weight (4104 +/- 248 g) was significantly (P less than 0.005) greater than that of the males of group I. Unlike in lower weight female or male infants, serum Tg levels did not correlate with birth weight or the log of TSH levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD005253,0,6508493,0,[Direct assay of free thyroxine in children. Application to the monitoring of the treatment of hypothyroidism].,"A direct measurement of free thyroxine (FT4) by a radio-immunologic method using an analogue of thyroxine as tracer allowed to establish the normal values in 341 children from birth to puberty. These values were used as reference for the determination of free T4 in the diagnosis and management of treatment for congenital hypothyroidism. In 44 treated hypothyroid children, there was a positive correlation between the serum concentration of free T4 and the amount of levothyroxine given daily (r = 0.46, p less than 0.01). There was also a negative correlation between free T4 and serum TSH (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001). Thus, the measurement of free thyroxine seems to be a more reliable, more accurate and more sensitive parameter than that of total thyroxine or TSH for controlling the treatment of congenital hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,19845125,0,Cinacalcet for hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy and puerperium.,"The efficacy and safety of various modes of medical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in pregnancy is largely unknown. This report describes two cases of PHPT in pregnancy that were temporarily treated with the calcimimetic cinacalcet. The first case was diagnosed in the 31st week of pregnancy. The patient was asymptomatic and had an albumin-corrected total calcium level (Ca(corr)) of 3.24 mmol/l. As serum calcium was only mildly elevated it was decided to postpone surgery to the postpartum period. Cinacalcet was started immediately after delivery to prevent a postpartum surge in serum calcium. The second patient presented with hypertension and symptomatic hypercalcemia (Ca(corr) 3.96 mmol/l) in the 32nd week of pregnancy. Surgery was postponed because of suspected pheochromocytoma. Treatment with a combination of cinacalcet and calcitonin reduced serum Ca(corr) to 3.0 mmol/l. This report describes the monitoring of mother and child, and explores the pros and cons of the use of calcimimetics during pregnancy and puerperium."
CD005253,0,9829229,0,Measurement of urinary iodine excretion to reveal iodine excess in neonatal transient hypothyroidism.,"This study was undertaken to confirm the importance of iodine excess in neonatal transient hypothyroidism. In 30 transient hypothyroid newborns at screening we measured urinary iodine excretion and TSH. They were divided into two groups: group A consisted of 21 newborns who had been exposed to iodine; group B of 9 non-exposed newborns. The two groups were significantly different only for median urinary iodine excretion (p = 0.001). In 61.5% of newborns of group A, iodine exposure caused iodine excess (urinary iodine excretion higher than 185 micrograms/l); this correlated with a higher prevalence of prematurity and a lower mean gestational age. Clinical records should reveal iodine exposure, but only urinary iodine excretion shows iodine excess. We suggest that evaluation at birth of urinary iodine excretion in every newborn with high TSH could help in predicting a good prognosis, since hypothyroidism due to the Wolff-Chaikoff effect is always spontaneously reversible, even if treatment may be suggested."
CD005253,0,9388818,0,Recombinant human growth hormone in short children born small for gestational age. German Study Group.,"The effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment in 69 prepubertal, non-GH deficient children born small for gestational age (SGA) were evaluated over 2 years. At start of the study mean age was 5.1 years, mean bone age was 3.8 years and mean height SDS was -4.0. The children were randomly allocated to 3 groups receiving no treatment or daily subcutaneous injections of rhGH at a dose of 0.1 IU/kg body weight (group 0.1 IU) or 0.2 IU/kg body weight (group 0.2 IU). At start of the study mean height velocity SDS was -1.4 in the control group, -0.7 in group 0.1 IU and -1.4 in group 0.2 IU. After 2 years there was a significant increase in height velocity SDS in children treated with rhGH as compared to untreated children. Mean height velocity SDS after the first year of treatment was -1.2 in the control group, 2.8 in group 0.1 IU and 5.5 in group 0.2 IU. Corresponding values during the second year were -0.9, 1.6 and 2.9. A statistically significant difference was observed between the groups receiving 0.1 IU/kg/day and 0.2 IU/kg/day during the first year of treatment, whereas no difference between the treatment groups was found during the second year. Catch-up growth, i.e. a height velocity 1 SD above the mean, was achieved for 86% of group 0.1 IU and 95% of group 0.2 IU during the first year of treatment and was maintained for 65% and 79% of the patients in group 0.1 IU and 0.2 IU respectively in the second year. GH treatment was associated with a distinct acceleration of bone age. Tolerance of treatment was good. No clear trends were seen in any of the laboratory variables. In conclusion, this study shows that daily rhGH given at a dose of 0.1-0.2 IU/kg/day for 24 months is an effective and safe therapy to increase linear growth and induce catch-up growth in short SGA children."

CD005253,0,3557439,0,Thyrocalcitonin-containing cells in the Di George anomaly.,"The Di George syndrome is an anomaly characterized by the complete or partial absence of derivatives of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches often associated with defective development of the third, fourth, and sixth aortic arches leading to absence or hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands and to cardiovascular anomalies. The fifth pharyngeal pouch, often considered a part of the fourth pouch, gives rise to the ultimobranchial body (UB), which becomes incorporated into the thyroid gland and is thought to be the source of thyroid C cells. Robinson suggested that complete or partial absence of the UB should be considered a part of the Di George anomaly. To substantiate this theory, the thyroid glands of 11 patients with the Di George syndrome and 11 age-matched control infants were examined immunohistochemically using the immunoperoxidase technique for presence or absence of thyrocalcitonin (TC)-containing cells. Only three of 11 patients with the Di George syndrome had TC-containing cells in their thyroid glands (27 per cent), and nine of 11 control infants had these cells (82 per cent). It is concluded that thyroid C cell deficiency is present in most patients with Di George anomaly, suggesting a relationship between these cells and development of derivatives of the third through fifth visceral pouches. Furthermore, there is a spectrum of deficiency of thyroid C cells in these individuals comparable with the spectrum of partial to complete absence of third and fourth pharyngeal pouch derivatives regarding thymus and parathyroid glands. Immunostaining for TC of the lungs of all infants with the Di George syndrome and control infants revealed similar numbers of thyrocalcitonin-containing cells in both groups. Asynchronous development of thyroid and lung thyrocalcitonin-containing cells in those with the Di George syndrome favors the theory that the latter develop independently of derivatives of the third through fifth visceral pouches. This study further supports a neural crest origin of the Di George anomaly and strengthens the concept that the Di George anomaly is a neurocristopathy."

The major contributors of each element were grain products for sodium, iron, manganese, and iodine; vegetables for potassium; milk and cheese for calcium; milk and cheese and animal flesh for phosphorus; vegetables and grain products for magnesium; and animal flesh for zinc, copper, and selenium. For the infant diet, the milk and cheese group (which includes infant formula) was the major contributor to the estimated intakes of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, copper, and iodine. Grain products were the primary sources for iron, manganese, and selenium in the infant diet. The diet of 2-year-olds, which includes a considerable amount of milk, contains larger percentages of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, and iodine from milk and cheese than do the diets of older age-sex groups. For teenagers, milk and cheese make a greater contribution to potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, manganese, and iodine intakes than they do for the adult age-sex groups."
CD005253,0,11525269,0,Effects of thyroid hormone deficiency on electrocardiogram findings of congenitally hypothyroid neonates.,"Hypothyroid status is believed to cause various metabolic changes in infants. However, it is interesting that even severely hypothyroid neonates, detected during mass neonatal screening, rarely show bradycardia, hypothermia, or inactivity. To study cardiac functions of screen-detected neonates with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), we recorded the electrocardiograms (ECG) of 53 screen-detected CH neonates before levothyroxine (LT4) replacement therapy, and 15 age-matched normal neonates for controls. The 53 CH neonates were divided into two groups according to initial serum thyroid hormone levels: a mildly hypothyroid group (n = 37), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) less than 100 microIU/mL and free thyroxine (FT4) 0.6 ng/dl or more; and a severely hypothyroid group (n = 16), TSH 100 microIU/mL or more and FT4 less than 0.6 ng/dL. TSH, FT4, and other blood chemicals were measured on an autoanalyzer (Hitachi 7170). After blood sampling, the ECG was recorded during induced sleep by oral administration of triclofos sodium syrup. ECG parameters, including HR, PR, QRS, QT time and corrected QT time (QTc) were automatically obtained, using an auto-ECG analyzing system. The following results were obtained. No CH patients showed abnormal ECG findings. There was no significant difference of the mean heart rates (HRs) between the mildly hypothyroid (147.5 +/- 16.3 beats per minute) and the control group (148.3 +/- 12.1 beats per minute). The mean HR in the severely hypothyroid group (134.0 +/- 17.9 beats per minute, p = 0.007) was significantly low compared with the normal control group. However, all values were within normal ranges. QTc in the severely hypothyroid group (0.414 +/- 0.015, p = 0.033) was significantly shorter than in the control group (0.440 +/- 0.052). No statistical differences of PR, QRS, and QT time were noted among the three groups. All ECG parameters were within normal ranges. HR positively correlated with FT4 and log (FT4), and negatively with TSH and log (TSH). From these results we conclude that the deficiency of thyroid hormones does not affect ECG findings of congenitally hypothyroid neonates. This may be consistent with the unexpectedly mild signs and symptoms of screen-detected hypothyroid neonates."

In addition, the degree of neurodevelopmental delay in preterm infants become severe according to the decreasing gestational age (GA). Because of the crucial role of thyroid hormones in brain development, hypothyroxinemia has the potential to cause developmental delay; however, the effectiveness of thyroxine (T4) supplementation on developmental outcomes remains controversial. To resolve these issues, we evaluated the clinical course of transient hypothyroxinemia and the effects of levothyroxine (LT4) supplementation in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants."

FT4 concentrations were lower in the LBW infants than in the FT infants. Percent FT4 values in the infants with BW less than 1000 g were the highest in the groups studied, so that FT4 concentrations in those infants did not fall proportionally with the marked T4 decrease. TBG concentrations were lower in the VLBW infants (less than BW 1350 g) than in the FT infants, and were positively correlated with BW and GA. This study suggests that in infants with lower birth weight there is a mechanism to prevent a decrease in FT4 concentrations associated with total T4 decrease. This fact may be a reason for euthroidism in small premature infants with low T4. Measurements of FT4 may be a useful adjunct to assessment of thyroid function in the VLBW infants with low T4."

The average concentration of PBDEs in congenital hypothyroidism (median: 22.16 ng/g lipid) was higher than in normal controls (median: 14.76 ng/g lipid), but there was no statistical difference between the two groups. The BDE congeners were dominated by penta- to hepta-BDEs, but the greater brominated congeners (e.g., BDE 197, 196, 207, and 208) were relatively abundant in congenital hypothyroidism. BDE 138 was only observed in the congenital hypothyroidism cases. The maternal transfer and transport ratio of individual BDE congeners was shown for BDE 28 (0.588, p < 0.001), BDE 47 (0.564, p < 0.001), BDE 49 (0.712, p < 0.001) and BDE 119 (0.477, p = 0.002). The thyroid hormones were most obviously influenced by the internal exposure to PBDEs in normal mothers, showing a positive relationship with TSH (0.641 with BDE 154; 0.591 with BDE 153) and FT4 (0.584 with BDE 49; 0.572 with BDE 66) and a negative relationship with T3 (-0.577 with BDE 154) in the normal infants group.

This entity has been described 27 times under various names, including juvenile Paget's disease, but only two case reports have described the condition in adults. In the present report two siblings and an unrelated individual are described with features resembling hereditary bone dysplasia. In all three the condition developed in infancy but was first recognized in middle age. Clinical and radiographic features of short stature, extensive thickening of the calvarium with areas of ""cotton wool sclerosis"", and bowed deformities of the long bones were present. The serum alkaline phosphatase was elevated in one case and normal in two. One patient demonstrated a marked clinical and biochemical response to a six month course of disodium etidronate after failing to respond to a trial of salmon calcitonin. There were significant differences between these three cases and classic hereditary bone dysplasia as described in infants and children. The patients themselves also had variable features. These observations suggest that either hereditary bone dysplasia is indeed variable, especially as afflicted children pass into adulthood, or different skeletal diseases are presently being included under the general term hereditary bone dysplasia with hyperphosphatasemia."

The family studies identified other affected members with a pattern indicating autosomal dominant inheritance. Clinical and laboratory findings in the neonates were consistent with normal thyroid function and no treatment was given. In one neonate, fibroblast nuclear receptor studies failed to detect decreased affinity for triiodothyronine, a finding reported in most previously published cases; the mutation in this patient was different from the one described in 1989 by Sakurai et al., consistent with the known genetic heterogeneity of this syndrome. It has been suggested recently that treatment of affected neonates with large doses of thyroid hormones is safe and effective in ensuring normal growth. The neurodevelopmental effects of this treatment are unknown. Early treatment is possible when the syndrome is detected neonatally. We therefore advocate routine T4 assays in neonates with moderately elevated TSH levels."

As some of the secretory products of these postulated airway chemoreceptors are known to adversely affect pulmonary vasomotor and bronchomotor tone, the present study was undertaken to determine if similar changes occur in the lungs of older pediatric patients with chronic respiratory disease. Immunoreactive cells were identified using the antibody-peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique and expressed as immunoreactive bronchioles/cm2 of lung tissue. In subjects dying an accidental or noncardiopulmonary death (control group: n = 48, zero to 24 yr of age), the total number of bombesin, calcitonin, and serotonin immunoreactive bronchioles/cm2 was greatest at birth, then decreased rapidly to extremely low levels after the first year of life. In the cystic fibrosis (n = 55, 3 days to 29 yr of age) and prolonged ventilation (n = 24, 4 months to 18 yr of age) groups, there was a significant increase (p less than 0.035) in bombesin, calcitonin, and serotonin immunoreactive bronchioles/cm2 from 1 to 11 yr of age. In the cystic fibrosis group, there was a sixfold increase in the number of serotonin immunoreactive bronchioles/cm2 lung tissue (p less than 0.015) compared with that in the other 2 groups during the first decade of life, suggesting a response to specific factors present only in the lungs of patients with this disease. In all 3 groups, immunoreactive cells were infrequently identified after 11 yr, implying a fundamental change in neuroendocrine cell biology coincident with the termination of lung growth and/or the onset of puberty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Diagnosis was confirmed by serum thyroid hormone measurements by 4 weeks of age in 38 infants and between 40 and 80 days of age in the remainder. This group of infants was divided by radionuclide thyroid imaging into 34 infants with thyroid dysgenesis and nine with dyshormonogenesis. The group with thyroid dysgenesis was subdivided into 21 infants with athyreosis and 13 with residual thyroid tissue (11 ectopic and 2 hypoplastic glands). L-Thyroxine therapy, at an average dose of 10 to 14 micrograms/kg/day, was begun immediately after diagnosis, and serum concentration of total thyroxine, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, reverse triiodothyronine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were determined serially. Serum concentration of total and of free thyroxine became normal within 1 week of the start of therapy in all groups. Despite a similarly mild degree of hypothyroidism at diagnosis observed in infants with dyshormonogenesis or with ectopia or hypoplasia, those with dyshormonogenesis had a more sensitive response to initial thyroid hormone replacement than did patients with thyroid dysgenesis, as judged by L-thyroxine does and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression. We conclude that the prompt restoration of clinical and biochemical euthyroidism during early infancy with doses of L-thyroxine between 10 and 14 micrograms/kg/day is a safe and effective method of therapy for children with congenital hypothyroidism."

CD005253,0,26499787,0,Preparation and Characterization of Ultrarapidly Dissolving Orodispersible Films for Treating and Preventing Iodine Deficiency in the Pediatric Population.,"Iodine deficiency is a public health problem that is easily prevented in many countries through having a salt iodization program. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that particular population groups including infants and young children have a sufficient level of daily iodine intake, while also reducing salt consumption in their diet. While many iodine supplements are available, swallowing tablet supplements is physically difficult for young children; thus, there is a need for the development of novel iodine delivery systems for pediatric patients. In this study a novel, ultrarapidly dissolving, nanofiber-based orodispersible film formulation containing iodine which is constructed from nanofibers was manufactured using an electrospinning technique. The potassium iodate (KIO3)-loaded poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) fiber orodispersible films dissolve within seconds on wetting (applying on the tongue) without the need for the consumption of water. The electrospinning process and KIO3 loading did not alter the crystallinity and conformation of PEO. With high loading, KIO3 nanocrystals are present in the fibers. This formulation design allows easy administration of iodine for preventing childhood iodine deficiency. We have also described a novel and easy method for producing and harvesting nanocrystals of inorganic salts that can be potentially adopted for use in other relevant fields."

Thyroid antibodies have been associated with an increased (double) risk of miscarriage and postpartum thyroiditis. Frequent (22-44%) pregnancy-induced hypertension leading to preterm delivery, and prematurity is the main complication observed in those still hypothyroid near term. Proper therapy eliminates or reduces the risk. No congenital anomalies have been reported in the most recent studies, and the data available shows that both physical and mental development have been normal until children are 10 years old. However, one study reported lower IQs in children of euthyroid women with positive TPO-ab than in children of TPO-ab negative mothers. Levothyroxine is the treatment of choice. Euthyroidism must be reached and maintained in a timely fashion. Many women need more thyroxine during pregnancy, and surveillance of thyroid function is needed throughout gestation to make dose adjustments when needed. During the postpartum periods the thyroxine requirements decrease to preconception levels."

Neonatal screening for CH was performed using blood specimens collected onto filter paper. Thyrotropin [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)] was measured by radioimmunoassay, and a value >20 microU/ml was considered as cut-off point for re-examining. Venous serum was obtained to measure TSH, thyroxin (T4), free T4 (FT4) and thyroglobulin (TG). To determine the iodine status of the study area, median urinary iodine was measured in 212 randomly selected neonates and their mothers. A total of 18606 neonates were screened from three cities (Bolu, Düzce, and Zonguldak) between 2000 and 2002. With a cut-off point of TSH value >20 microU/ml, the recall rate was found 1.6%. Eight cases of CH were diagnosed (incidence 1/2326). There were three cases of transient hypothyroidism, with an incidence of 1/6202. Twenty-six percent of the TSH values was greater than 5 microU/ml. Median urinary iodine concentrations in neonates and their mothers were 85 microg/l and 40 microg/l, respectively. The incidences of CH, transient hypothyroidism and the recall rate were higher in our study area than many countries in Europe. The study area has been affected by mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. Neonatal screening for CH should be introduced in Turkey without delay. A national comprehensive infantile hypothyroidism and iodine prophylaxis policies should be developed."

The National Register of infants with congenital hypothyroidism was established in 1987 as a project of the Health Ministry. The results of the Register provided valuable epidemiological information about congenital hypothyroidism in Italy and evidenced some aspects in the screening organization which had to be improved. Discussion of Register data during annual national meetings has recently allowed an improvement of the screening program with particular regard to the beginning of therapy with L-thyroxine and its dose.
CD005253,0,24755928,0,"Prevalence of neonatal hypothyroidism in Kangra Valley, Himachal Pradesh.","Iodine deficiency (ID) is an endemic health problem in Kangra District, Himachal Pradesh (HP). ID in pregnant mothers leads to neonatal hypothyroidism (NH), mental retardation, deaf mutism, squint, dwarfism, spastic dysplasia, neurological defects and congenital anomalies. NH can be assessed by estimating the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in cord blood samples. The present study was conducted with an objective to assess the prevalence of NH in district Kangra, HP. In district Kangra, all the hospitals providing obstetric services were enlisted. Three hospitals conducting more than 100 deliveries per year were selected randomly. A total of 613 umbilical cord blood samples of neonates were collected on filter papers and analyzed for TSH. TSH was estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Neonates with TSH levels ⩾20 mIU/l were recalled for reassessment of TSH for confirmation of NH. Prevalence of NH was found to be 4.4%. This finding suggests the need for the implementation of a neonatal screening program for early detection of children with ID."

CD005253,0,1891279,0,Somatosensory evoked potentials in neonates with primary congenital hypothyroidism during the first week of therapy.,"At the present, the influence of intrauterine hypothyroidism on the fetus is estimated by bone age (BA). BA is also used as a predictor of later neuropsychologic development. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the neurophysiologic maturation of neonates with congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) is delayed at the start of therapy and, if so, whether this delay is comparable to that in BA. Twenty-seven infants with CHT were examined with median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) before or within 1 wk after initiation of therapy. The effect of neonatal jaundice, a potential confounder of neonatal SEP, was also evaluated. Cervical (N13), first cephalic (N19), and second cephalic (N32) peak latencies were measured, as well as N13-N19 interval (central conduction time) and N13 latency divided by arm length. The SEP data of 103 normal infants were used as reference values. In the CHT newborns, a maturational delay was found for all SEP parameters. Preterm infants (n = 3) were conspicuously less affected than term patients. In term CHT infants, jaundice during the first postnatal week, but not late jaundice, had an additional adverse effect. SEP delay was not related to initial or actual T4 levels. BA delay exceeded SEP delay by several weeks. Our data suggest that the depressed T4 levels of the hypothyroid fetus and neonate affect the nervous tissue to a lesser degree than bone tissue and, further, that SEP is superior to BA as parameter for the evaluation of neurologic maturation of infants with CHT."

Multiple studies have investigated the relationships between thyroid function, thyroid antibodies, fertility, and pregnancy. Thyroid autoimmunity is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient locations.

Like in other disorders of the parathyroid gland, the recognition of primary hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy and lactation may be difficult, as clinical symptoms are not specific, while laboratory findings may be masked by some typical pregnancy-induced changes in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. If remains untreated, the disease may result in serious clinical implications for the mother and fetus.

CD005253,0,23901895,0,The use of PBPK models to inform human health risk assessment: case study on perchlorate and radioiodide human lifestage models.,"Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are often submitted to or selected by agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, for consideration for application in human health risk assessment (HHRA). Recently, U.S. EPA evaluated the human PBPK models for perchlorate and radioiodide for their ability to estimate the relative sensitivity of perchlorate inhibition on thyroidal radioiodide uptake for various population groups and lifestages. The most well-defined mode of action of the environmental contaminant, perchlorate, is competitive inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). In this analysis, a six-step framework for PBPK model evaluation was followed, and with a few modifications, the models were determined to be suitable for use in HHRA to evaluate relative sensitivity among human lifestages. Relative sensitivity to perchlorate was determined by comparing the PBPK model predicted percent inhibition of thyroidal radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) by perchlorate for different lifestages. A limited sensitivity analysis indicated that model parameters describing urinary excretion of perchlorate and iodide were particularly important in prediction of RAIU inhibition; therefore, a range of biologically plausible values available in the peer-reviewed literature was evaluated. Using the updated PBPK models, the greatest sensitivity to RAIU inhibition was predicted to be the near-term fetus (gestation week 40) compared to the average adult and other lifestages; however, when exposure factors were taken into account, newborns were found to be populations that need further evaluation and consideration in a risk assessment for perchlorate."

One patient with low serum FT3 and FT4 had a normal TSH level. T4 replacement therapy lowered TSH to normal levels in all four patients and normalized FT4 in three of them. There were no significant changes in serum FT3 levels. Adrenal function was studied in three patients, none had adrenal calcification or hypoadrenocorticism. This study supports the existence of a hypothyroid state in some infants with nephrotic syndrome. Routine thyroid screening and early replacement therapy is recommended."
CD005253,0,2265016,0,Neonatal sepsis and infection control policies in Australia.,"The pattern of neonatal bacterial infection, its management and the types of infection control policy were ascertained in 20 neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Australia by questionnaire survey. Group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli were the predominant organisms responsible for perinatally acquired infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was Penicillin and Gentamicin. Staphylococcus epidermidis and aureus (majority Methicillin resistant) were the predominant organisms responsible for nosocomial infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was Vancomycin and Cefotaxime. A Serratia epidemic was experienced in four NICU. Lumbar and suprapubic punctures were frequently done as part of the diagnostic workup in nosocomial infections but not with perinatally acquired infections. Haematological indices considered useful as a diagnosis aid varied between NICU and acute phase reactants were rarely relied upon for diagnosis or for monitoring treatment response. Granulocyte transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulins were infrequently used in therapy. No consensus was found on infection control policies. Eight NICU required routine gowning on entry, two restricted sibling visiting and four restricted visiting by relatives and friends. Although routine bacteriological surveillance on staff or equipment was uncommon, serial cultures were carried out in infants from the body surface in six NICU and from the endotracheal aspirate in 17 NICU. Antiseptics used with technical procedures included iodine, chlorhexidine and alcohol used singly or in combination. Skin and umbilical cord care also varied between NICU. The literature was reviewed to determine the effectiveness or otherwise of some of the existing policies in the prevention or management of neonatal infection to encourage consensus towards a more rational approach to neonatal infection in Australia."

Lowering of the screening TSH cutoff and changes in birth demographics have been associated with an approximate doubling of the incidence of CH, from 1:3500 to 1:1714. The additional cases detected by lowering of the TSH cutoff tend to have milder hypothyroidism, with imaging often demonstrating a eutopic, ""gland in-situ"", and some cases turn out to have transient CH. Based on our search for current screening programs, approximately 71 percent of babies worldwide are not born in an area with an established NBS program, despite the existence of screening for over five decades in developed countries. Thus, the majority of babies with CH worldwide are not detected and treated early, such that the economic burden of retardation owing to CH remains a significant public health challenge."

In addition, 10-20% of children born small for gestational age (SGA) do not achieve a normal final height. The purpose of this study was to investigate insulin sensitivity and endocrine status in SGA children, compared with that in children born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Furthermore, within the SGA group, we aimed to relate postnatal growth to anthropometric, biochemical, and endocrine parameters. Eighty-two SGA children (with a mean age of 8.6 +/- 3.5 yr) and 53 short-AGA children (with a mean age of 9.3 +/- 3.3 yr) were studied. A case-control study was carried out in 26 SGA and 26 short-AGA subjects. For each SGA subject, we selected a short-AGA child matched for sex, age (within 1 yr), pubertal status, body mass index (within 0.5 kg/m(2)), and height (within 0.25 z-score). Children's statures were corrected for their midparental height, and SGA children were subdivided into 2 groups: catch-up growth (CG) group (children with corrected height with at least 0 z-score); and non-CG (NCG) group (subjects with corrected height with less than 0 z-score). Comparing SGA with short-AGA subjects, no significant differences in fasting insulin, fasting glucose/insulin ratio, homeostasis assessment model for insulin resistance, and homeostasis assessment model-beta-cell values were observed. SGA children showed significantly reduced levels of glucose (4.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.6 mM, P < 0.0001), total cholesterol (160.1 +/- 28.8 vs. 171.8 +/- 28.5 mg/dl, P = 0.02), and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (53.3 +/- 12.1 vs. 58 +/- 11.4 mg/dl, P = 0.02). The analysis of the subjects selected for the case-control study confirmed that SGA children did not have significant differences in the indices of insulin sensitivity but showed significantly lower glucose levels (4.4 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.4 mM, P < 0.005). Subdividing the SGA group into CG (n = 25) and NCG (n = 57) children, we found that NCG children showed significantly higher levels of TSH (2.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.6 mU/liter, P = 0.002). Our data indicate that SGA children do not have altered insulin sensitivity when compared with auxologically identical AGA subjects but show a significant reduction of glucose concentrations. Whether the lower glucose levels are attributable to an early phase of augmented insulin sensitivity, as previously reported in animal models, has to be established. The finding of higher TSH concentrations in SGA children with blunted CG suggests that intrauterine reprogramming might involve thyroid function, which, in turn, might affect postnatal growth and cholesterol metabolism, eventually increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease."

Milk is a major food for young children and this analysis evaluated the impact of the type of milk consumed on nutrient intakes and nutritional status. Data from the Diet and Nutrition Survey of Infants and Young Children were used to investigate the intakes of key nutrients, and Fe and vitamin D status, of children aged 12-18 months, not breastfed, and consuming >400 g/d fortified milk (n 139) or >400 g/d of whole cows' milk (n 404). Blood samples from eligible children for measurement of Hb (n 113), serum ferritin and plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations (n 105) were available for approximately 20 % of children. Unpaired Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare nutrient intakes and status between consumers of fortified and cows' milk. Mean daily total dietary intakes of Fe, Zn, vitamin A and vitamin D were significantly higher in the fortified milk group. Mean daily total dietary intakes of energy, protein, Ca, iodine, Na and saturated fat were significantly higher in the cows' milk group. Hb was not different between groups. The fortified milk group had significantly higher serum ferritin (P = 0·049) and plasma 25(OH)D (P = 0·014). This analysis demonstrates significantly different nutrient intakes and status between infants consuming >400 g/d fortified milk v. those consuming >400 g/d whole cows' milk. These results indicate that fortified milks can play a significant role in improving the quality of young children's diets in their second year of life."

CD005253,0,9357931,0,Thyroid function in very preterm infants: influences of gestational age and disease.,"It is not known how immaturity and disease influence postnatal thyroid function in infants <30 wk of gestational age.

One hundred infants were divided twice into two groups: 1) in a group of 25-28 and of 28-30 wk of gestation; and 2) in a sick and a healthy group, with similar gestational ages. The time course of T4, FT4, T3, TSH, and TBG, but not rT3 differed significantly (p < 0.005) between the gestational age groups. T4 and FT4 decreased to levels below the cord blood value with a deeper FT4 nadir on d 7 in the youngest group. Disease decreased T4, FT4, T3, TSH, and TBG concentrations especially during the 1st wk after birth (p < 0.005). However, the FT4 nadir on d 7 was similar in sick and healthy infants. After 3 wk, T4, FT4, T3, and TBG were higher in the sick group compared with the healthy group. rT3 levels were not increased in sick infants. We conclude that the extent of the FT4 decrease after birth in infants of <30 wk gestation is mainly influenced by gestational age and probably reflects a transient depletion of thyroidal hormone reserves. rT3 cannot be used as a marker of nonthyroidal illness in very preterm infants."

We describe a girl with a mutation of the Pit-1 gene leading to a complete lack of GH, TSH and prolactin and a marked hypoplasia of the anterior pituitary gland. The patient had a homozygous nonsense-mutation at position 172 (CGA to TGA), converting arginine into a stop codon, leading to an early termination of protein translation. During the infancy period the girl had very conspicuous symptoms of hypothyroidism and the diagnosis of thyroid insufficiency preceded the diagnosis of GH-deficiency by 1.5 years.

A major risk factor for disability is having a low level of thyroid hormone described as hypothyroxinaemia, which is recognised to be a frequent phenomenon in these infants. Derangements of critical thyroid function during the sensitive window in prematurity when early development occurs, may have a range of long term effects for brain development. Further research in preterm infants using neuroimaging techniques will increase our understanding of the specificity of the effects of hypothyroxinaemia on the developing foetal brain. This is an explanatory double blinded randomised controlled trial which is aimed to assess the effect of thyroid hormone supplementation on brain size, key brain structures, extent of myelination, white matter integrity and vessel morphology, somatic growth and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis."
CD005253,0,18046071,0,Fetal goiter and bilateral ovarian cysts.,"A unique case of fetal goiter accompanied by bilateral ovarian cysts in a mother treated with methimazole for Graves'disease is reported. The abnormal findings were detected by ultrasound at 31 weeks of gestation. Umbilical fetal blood sampling revealed elevated serum TSH, normal concentrations of free T 4 , normal FSH and LH and high concentrations of E 2 . A series of weekly amniocenteses and intra-amniotic injections of levothyroxine was initiated, along with a reduction of the mother's methimazole dosage. The level of TSH in amniotic fluid was initially high, but was considerably reduced by each injection and followed by a gradual reduction of fetal goiter as well as the left ovarian cyst. The right cyst ruptured spontaneously. At 36 weeks + 4 days, the patient underwent elective caesarean section and gave birth to a female, weighing 2,880 g with 1- and 5-min Apgar scores of 10. The thyroid gland appeared normal in size, and cord blood TSH and free T 4 were both within normal limits. At ultrasound control 6 days later, the right ovarian cyst was not visible, while the left cyst was still present. Thus, our report supports previous findings that fetal goiter can be treated successfully with intra-amniotic injection of levothyroxine.More importantly, it shows that fetal hypothyroidism with elevated levels of TSH can be accompanied by ovarian cysts,suggesting interference between thyreotropic and gonadotropic hormones."

Cases included 4904 stillborn and liveborn infants with major anomalies diagnosed in the first year of life and born to residents of metropolitan Atlanta between 1968 and 1980. Controls included 3027 normal babies, frequency-matched to cases by race, hospital of birth and quarter of birth. We compared mothers of cases and controls regarding history of physician-diagnosed hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism before the infant's birth, age at diagnosis of thyroid condition, duration of illness, and intake of thyroid medications before and during pregnancy. Information obtained from maternal interviews was evaluated for concordance with hospital records. We adjusted for potentially confounding factors using conditional logistic regression analysis. Overall, there was no relationship between the risk of total birth defects and history of maternal hypothyroidism (odds ratio (OR) = 1.05, 95% C.I. 0.84-1.31), maternal hyperthyroidism (OR = 1.00, 95% C.I. 0.66-1.53), and intake of thyroid hormone and antithyroid drugs before and during pregnancy. In an analysis of 66 specific birth defects and defect groups, we found two statistically significant associations with hypothyroidism and three with hyperthyroidism which may reflect chance findings. In an evaluation of babies with multiple anomalies, we observed a two-fold increased risk with hypothyroidism but no discernible pattern of defects. The absolute risk of major birth defects in offspring of women with history of hypothyroidism can be estimated as 2.1%, a finding at odds with the 10-20% risk cited in the literature."

CD005253,0,20432818,0,Late-onset circulatory dysfunction after thyroid hormone treatment in an extremely low birth weight infant.,"Late-onset circulatory dysfunction (LCD) is a phenomenon specific to premature infants and is characterized by sudden onset of hyponatremia, hypotension, oliguria and non-physiological weight gain, without an obvious cause, in premature infants after stabilization of circulation and respiration. The cause of LCD is not clear, but adrenal insufficiency in premature infants is a severe syndrome because steroid replacement therapy is often essential to treat the symptoms. We report a rare case of a premature infant who developed an LCD crisis the day after thyroxine replacement therapy. The female infant was born at 25 weeks of gestational age, weighing 672 g, and appeared to have hypothyroidism, with free T4 of 0.19 ng/dl and elevated TSH levels of 26.3 microIU/ml at Day 14. She developed an LCD crisis the day after starting thyroxine treatment. She received steroid replacement therapy for 4 weeks and her adrenal function progressively recovered. She also needed thyroxine supplementation for 13 weeks, which maintained her thyroid function as euthyroid. Because she exhibited cortisol insufficiency and thyroid hormone insufficiency, the antecedent thyroid hormone replacement may be responsible for the onset of LCD. We must consider monitoring adrenal function when starting thyroxine therapy in premature infants with hypothyroxinemia."

The treatment led to complete remission in 14/40 and to favorable results in 18/40 cases. In 2 out of 3 cases of infantile atopic dermatitis improvement was followed by relapse. The responsiveness to AHR-1911 of patients with delayed hypersensitivity, which requires steroids for treatment, is considered of clinical importance.

CD005253,0,7756813,0,Dopamine suppresses thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion in neonatal hypothyroidism.,"The infusion of dopamine, a hypophysiotropic catecholamine, which inhibits release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), is the inotropic therapy of first choice in neonatal intensive care. Newborns with primary hypothyroidism are at increased risk of cardiocirculatory morbidity and are screened by measuring serum TSH concentrations. In an infant with both congenital heart disease and neonatal hypothyroidism, withdrawal of dopamine infusion was documented to evoke a doubling of serum TSH levels within 40 min, a finding suggestive of an inhibitory effect of dopamine administration on neonatal TSH hypersecretion. As a result, dopamine therapy may be a pitfall in TSH screening for neonatal hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,6360469,0,Endocrine regulation of calcium homeostasis during pregnancy.,"The principal maternal physiologic adjustment with respect to calcium metabolism is increasing PTH secretion, which maintains the serum ionic calcium level within its characteristically narrow physiologic limits in the face of an expanding extracellular fluid volume, increased urinary excretion, and calcium transfer to the fetus. Additionally, PTH promotes increased renal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D3, which acts in concert with PTH to meet the calcium demands of gestation. Whether or not calcitonin secretion increases as well is not clear; if so, this effect may be important in protecting the maternal skeleton. The primary characteristic of perinatal calcium metabolism is the active placental transport of calcium ions from mother to fetus, making the fetus relatively hypercalcemic. Since none of the calcitropic hormones cross the placenta, hypercalcemia apparently suppresses either secretion or activity of PTH by the fetus and stimulates fetal calcitonin release, creating an environment (high calcium, low PTH, high calcitonin) favorable to skeletal growth. With birth, the transplacental calcium source terminates abruptly and the serum calcium level declines for 24 to 48 hours, after which it stabilizes and then rises slightly. Neonatal calcium homeostasis probably reflects multiple influences, including the respective calcitropic hormones and other involved ions such as magnesium and phosphate. The physiologic mechanisms regulating calcium homeostasis during pregnancy and the perinatal period generally operate very effectively. Thus, aberrations leading to clinically evident disease states are relatively infrequent. Maternal hyperparathyroidism causes several complications, notably hypocalcemic tetany in the newborn, and maternal hypoparathyroidism may be associated with perinatal hyperparathyroidism. Diabetic pregnancy leads to altered calcium metabolism in mother, fetus, and newborn; the primary feature may be chronic hypomagnesemia, which leads to hypoparathyroidism to mother and fetus. There is some suggestion of an etiologic role for calcium in hypertensive disorders, and, in any event, magnesium sulfate therapy influences calcium homeostasis. Finally, leg cramps in the pregnant woman may reflect alterations in calcium metabolism."

Endocrine disruptors or thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDC) like bisphenol A, phthalates, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers are widely used as plastic additives in consumer products. This comprehensive review studied the magnitude and uncertainty of TDC exposures and their effects on thyroid hormones for sensitive subpopulation groups like pregnant women, infants, and children. Our findings qualitatively suggest the mixed, significant (α = 0.05) TDC associations with natural thyroid hormones (positive or negative sign). Future studies should undertake systematic meta-analyses to elucidate pooled TDC effect estimates on thyroid health indicators and outcomes."
CD005253,0,8048812,0,Growth in early treated congenital hypothyroidism.,"The growth of 361 children with congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed by screening was assessed by estimating mean values for height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and head circumference on each birthday up to the age of 4 years. In the group of children with severe congenital hypothyroidism (pretreatment plasma thyroxine < or = 30 nmol/l), the mean heights at 1 and 2 years were less than standards for healthy children, but this may be due to technical factors related to difficulties in measuring young infants and the method used to estimate height on each birthday. By the age of 3-4 years the values for mean height in the children with either severe or less severe congenital hypothyroidism were equal to or greater than those for healthy children. At all ages mean head circumference in boys and girls with severe congenital hypothyroidism was greater than standards for healthy children, but this only reached statistical significance in girls at 1 year. With the exception of the results for boys at 1 year, mean values for BMI were slightly greater in the children with severe congenital hypothyroidism. The mean BMI results for children with either severe or less severe congenital hypothyroidism were significantly greater than those for healthy French children at all ages, but they showed the same trends with increasing age. It is concluded that by the age of 3-4 years stature is essentially normal in children with early treated congenital hypothyroidism but that the increased head size reported before screening may still be evident in early infancy."
CD005253,0,9781983,0,Age- and gender-related elastin distribution changes in human vocal folds.,"The composition of the lamina propria in human vocal folds has been shown to affect vocal performance. Elastin plays a significant role in the biomechanical effects of the lamina propria. We obtained 19 larynges from the state medical examiner from subjects whose cause of death was unrelated to the trachea and laryngeal regions. The sample contained male and female subjects in the infant, adult, and geriatric age groups. We stained the vocal folds for elastin with Verhoeff's elastic tissue stain and studied them with use of an image analysis system configured for light microscopy. Distributions of elastin were measured from superficial to deep within the lamina propria (from epithelium to vocal muscle). These elastin distributions were then compared with the use of statistical software. The data showed that there was an increase in elastin content from the infant through geriatric stages. No gender-related differences were found. Infant folds had about 23% of the elastin found in adults, and geriatric subjects had about 879% of the elastin found in adults. Both of these results were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The distributions were consistent with previous observations that the lamina propria is a layered structure with most of the elastin present in the intermediate layer. This layer was larger in geriatric subjects than in adult and pediatric subjects. We observed that the fiber diameter appeared to be larger in geriatric subjects (this observation is currently being verified with electron microscopy) whereas smaller, spiraled fibers appeared in pediatric subjects."

CD005253,0,11357505,0,Scintigraphic evaluation of primary congenital hypothyroidism: results of the Greek screening program.,"The Greek screening program for primary congenital hypothyroidism was initiated in 1979. By early 2000, thyrotropin measurements had been performed in 1,976,719 newborns, using dried blood spots obtained by heel prick. Among these children, 584 were diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism (incidence: 1/3,384 births) and were given L-thyroxine (L-T4) replacement therapy. In order to further evaluate and classify the children as having either an aplastic (AT) or an ectopic thyroid gland (ET) or as showing thyroidal dyshormonogenesis (DN, with a nomotopic gland), scintigraphic studies were performed at the age of 2-3 years. In 413 children of this age group (including 24 subsequently diagnosed as having had transient hypothyroidism, in whom L-T4 therapy was not resumed), thyroid hormones were measured and scintigraphic studies were done after withdrawal of L-T4 replacement treatment for 3 weeks. Given the long duration of the study, we used various scintigraphic modalities. In 96 children (group A), scintigraphy was performed using technetium-99m pertechnetate (99mTcO4-; 18.5 MBq given i.v.) and a rectilinear scanner. Seventy-three children (group B) were studied with 99mTcO4- (18.5 MBq given i.v.) and a gamma camera equipped with a pinhole collimator. In these groups, atropine was administered 30 min prior to the study (0.02 mg/kg i.v. or i.m.) in order to reduce the secretion of saliva from the salivary glands. Finally, in the remaining 220 children (group C) iodine-123 sodium iodide (123I-Na) (0.74-1.85 MBq i.v.) and the same gamma camera were used. Between-group comparisons of scintigraphic findings were done with the chi square test. In 191 children from group C, thyroglobulin (Tg) was measured and in 49 children ultrasound (US) was performed (categorising the gland as AT or ET/DN). Comparison of these modalities was done with the kappa statistic. In group A, 61.5% of children had AT, 26.0% had ET and 12.5% had DN; in group B, 28.8% of children had AT, 52.0% had ET and 19.2% had DN; in group C, 23.2% of children had AT, 63.2% had ET and 13.6% had DN. Statistically significant differences in group A versus groups B and C were noted for AT and ET. The implementation of newer scintigraphic modalities, and especially the use of 123I-Na, indicates that the commonest finding in congenital hypothyroidism is ET. Scintigraphy was more concordant with Tg measurements (though at a moderate level) than with US. The latter was even less concordant with Tg values. These results show that the most appropriate approach for the evaluation and classification of congenital hypothyroidism is 123I-Na scanning."

Malnutrition covers a broad spectrum of ills, including undernutrition, specific nutrient deficiencies, and overnutrition; and it kills, maims, retards, cripples, blinds, and impairs human development on a truly massive scale worldwide. In the developing world in 1995, of the estimated 10.4 million deaths among children under 5 years of age, protein-energy malnutrition was an associated and causative factor in 5.1 million of these deaths (i.e. 49%). On the other hand, evidence has recently been compiled suggesting that of the more than 10 million cases of cancer that occurred in 1996, an estimated 30-40% (3-4 million every year) are preventable by feasible, appropriate diets, and by physical activity and maintenance of appropriate body weight. Malnutrition affects all age groups across the entire lifespan. From the moment of conception, throughout foetal life, iodine, folate and intrauterine nutrition have a profound influence on development, growth, morbidity, mortality, not only in utero and in early infancy, but on morbidity, physical and mental capacity throughout life.

Both the normal and low birth wt groups whose blood thyroxine was in the normal range had similar mean IGF-I values during the 1st wk of life that were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than those of either the normal or low birth wt groups whose thyroxine concentrations were below normal. Infants older than 1 wk of age with normal birth wt and normal thyroxine levels had significantly greater (p less than 0.05) mean IGF-I values than those of any of the other groups. Infants in the low birth wt-normal thyroxine group exhibited modest increases in IGF-I levels after the 1st wk of life that were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than those found in the low birth wt-low thyroxine infants. These studies have demonstrated that IGF-I concentration is correlated positively with total thyroxine and with birth wt and that the latter is confounded by the former.

CD005253,0,6677876,0,T4 levels in methylxanthine-treated premature newborns.,The respiratory stimulants caffeine and theophylline are able to control apneic spells in premature newborns. However both substances have goitrogenic properties in rats on low-iodine diet. They lower T4 serum levels and inhibit TSH- and GH-release probably by enhancing hypothalamic somatostatin secretion. The retrospective study described here was carried out in an attempt to clarify whether treatment of premature children with methylxanthines has adverse effects on thyroid function. The results are as follows: 1) There is no significant correlation between caffeine- and theophylline-concentrations and circulating T4 levels in single blood specimen of unselected premature infants. 2) In none of the infants was a low T4-serum value accompanied by a rise in serum TSH during methylxanthine treatment. Thus methylxanthines are not associated with the induction of primary hypothyroidism but the possibility of tertiary hypothyroidism cannot be excluded. In order to avoid adverse effects on thyroid function the lowest therapeutically active dose should be chosen.
CD005253,0,8636328,0,"Seven deadly sins in confronting endemic iodine deficiency, and how to avoid them.","Iodine deficiency is a problem for almost all countries of the world. Goiter is its most obvious consequence, but others do more damage, particularly effects on the developing brain. In 1990, most countries and international agencies pledged the virtual elimination of iodine deficiency by the year 2000. The technology for the assessment and implementation is sufficient to attain this goal, but translating its potential into success requires careful planning. This article reviews seven major errors that frequently occur in iodine supplementation programs and offers suggestions for their avoidance. They are 1) unreliable assessment of iodine deficiency: the best indicators are urinary iodine concentration, thyroid size (preferably by ultrasound), blood spot thyroglobulin levels, and neonatal TSH determinations; the best group for surveys is schoolchildren; 2) poor iodine supplementation plan: iodized salt is the preferred supplement; its effective application frequently requires extensive changes in salt production and marketing, and poor handling of these changes will endanger the iodization program; other measures include iodized oil, iodized water, and iodine drops; all are occasionally useful, but the long range solution should generally be iodized salt; 3) exclusion of relevant stake-holders: the program should include not only health authorities but other arms of the government as well (education, commerce, agriculture, and standards), the salt industry, health professionals, and the iodine-deficient community itself; 4) inadequate education: an understanding of the effects of iodine deficiency and the means for its correction is essential at all levels, from government to affected population; 5) insufficient monitoring: the best instruments are urinary iodine levels, iodized salt use, and thyroid size, measured in representative groups at regular intervals with public reporting of results; 6) inattention to cost: the expense of iodization must be recognized and apportioned fairly; and 7) nonsustainability: for permanent success, an iodization program must be fair to all relevant parties and accompanied by a regular system of appropriate monitoring. Only with careful avoidance of these seven ""deadly sins"" can the goal of sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency be achieved."

A two-year follow-up of a comparative trial.,"A controlled trial of iodine supplementation comparing oral with intramuscular iodized oil has been carried out in an iodine deficient area of Zaire. Two years after the administration of 2 ml of oral iodized oil to the population of four villages the overall goitre prevalence had fallen from 64 to 54%. In a further two villages given 2 ml of intramuscular oil the prevalence fell from 65 to 50%. The effectiveness of supplementation was also assessed by measuring changes in thyroid function in women of reproductive age. Among women in the villages given oral iodized oil, the geometric mean thyroxine concentration, measured in dried bloodspots, rose from 27.2 to 52.6 nmol/L at the two-year follow-up. This was similar to the response of the intramuscularly treated villages in which thyroxine levels rose from 32.1 to 65.4 nmol/L. There was no change in goitre prevalence or thyroid function in two control villages. Oral iodized oil is a cheaper and simpler alternative to the injected form providing effective iodine prophylaxis for up to two years after a single dose."

We studied the relationship between the effusion and the etiology of hypothyroidism, established through thyroid scintiscanning. Our data show a high prevalence of effusion in hypothyroid patients, without other clinical signs of cardiac involvement as well as a relationship between the etiology of hypothyroidism and the presence of effusion. This seems to be much more frequent in those forms which can imply a more severe hormonal defect, particularly during fetal life (agenesis/dyshormonogenesis). Furthermore, the high prevalence of pericardial effusion suggests to start the L-T4 replacement therapy with lower dosages as commonly advised, in order to avoid a cardiac involvement."

Two hundred and eighty-nine consecutive pediatric patients undergoing open heart surgery for repair of congenital heart disease were prospectively entered into the study and were randomly assigned to two groups: the pulsatile perfusion group (Group P, n = 208) and the nonpulsatile perfusion group (Group NP, n = 81). All patients received identical surgical, perfusional, and postoperative care. Study parameters included total drainage, mean urine output in the intensive care unit (ICU), intubation time, duration of ICU and hospital stay, the need for inotropic support, pre- and postoperative enzyme levels (ALT [alanine aminotransaminase] and AST [aspartate aminotransaminase]), c-reactive protein, lactate, albumin, blood count (leukocytes, hematocrit, platelets), creatinine levels, and thyroid hormones (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], FT(3) [free triiodothyronine], FT(4) [free thyroxine]). All patients survived the perioperative and postoperative periods. There were no statistically significant differences in either preoperative or operative parameters between the two groups. Group P, compared to Group NP, required significantly less inotropic support, had a shorter intubation period, higher urine output in ICU, and shorter duration of ICU and hospital stay. Lower lactate levels and higher albumin levels were observed in Group P and there were no significant differences in creatinine, enzyme levels, blood counts, or drainage amounts between two groups. TSH, Total T(3) , Total T(4) , and FT(3) , FT(4) levels were markedly reduced versus their preoperative values in both groups. FT(3) and FT(4) levels were reduced significantly further in the nonpulsatile group both during CPB and at 72 h postoperation. The results of this study confirm our opinion that pulsatile perfusion leads to better vital organ recovery and clinical outcomes in the early postoperative period as compared to nonpulsatile perfusion in pediatric patients undergoing CPB cardiac surgery. The plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones are dramatically reduced during and after CPB, but pulsatile perfusion seems to have a protective effect of thyroid hormone homeostasis compared to nonpulsatile perfusion."
CD005253,0,11165746,0,Prenatal diagnosis and early in utero management of fetal dyshormonogenetic goiter.,"We present a case of a fetal dyshormonogenetic goiter diagnosed by ultrasound examination at 24 weeks of gestation, in a woman with no past history of thyroid disease or goitrogen treatment and with normal thyroid tests, including absence of auto-antibodies. In this situation, fetal goiter may only be associated with fetal hypothyroidism, therefore cord blood sampling was not performed but early treatment was initiated. Amniotic fluid instillation of thyroid hormone led to a rapid decrease in amniotic fluid volume and a clear reduction in thyroid goiter. However, fetal thyroid volume did not totally normalise, and cord blood analysis at birth showed elevated fetal TSH level. As prenatal treatment of fetal hypothyroidism remains controversial in euthyroid mothers, the main objective is to prevent obstetrical complications of large goiters. Therefore, in some selected cases with no maternal history of thyroid disease and normal thyroid function tests, cordocentesis is not necessary to confirm fetal thyroid status or to adjust fetal treatment."
CD005253,0,23239635,0,Delayed onset congenital hypothyroidism in a patient with DUOX2 mutations and maternal iodine excess.,"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH), one of the most common congenital endocrine disorders, causes irreversible intellectual disability in untreated patients. Today, the vast majority of patients receive early diagnosis and treatment in the context of newborn screening for CH, and achieve satisfactory cognitive development. However, a subset of patients with delayed onset are undetectable by newborn screening, and miss benefit from early intervention. Here, we report on a delayed-onset CH patient that had two contributing factors in the pathogenesis of CH simultaneously, i.e., a genetic defect and iodine excess. The patient was exposed to excessive iodine in utero because her mother consumed massive amounts of seaweed during pregnancy. Surprisingly, the patient had a negative result in newborn screening, but developed overt CH at age 3 months. She received thyroxine supplementation until when normalization of the thyroid function was confirmed at age 3 years (i.e., transient CH). Mutation screening for DUOX2, a causative gene for transient CH, showed biallelic mutations (p.[E327X] + [H678R]). This report provides a new example of environmental modification of phenotypes of CH due to a genetic defect, which can potentially distort screening results."
CD005253,0,8112719,0,Early identification of congenital hypothyroid infants with abnormalities in pituitary setpoint for T4-induced TSH release.,"It is now clear that early detection and adequate replacement therapy of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) results in normal growth and psychomotor development. However, there is evidence that some of those infants might have a persistent alteration in the T4 feedback control of TSH release. To characterize further this phenomenon, 25 treated CH children were divided into two groups: group A consisted of children whose TSH was suppressed as early as 1 month after the onset of therapy, and group B consisted of children whose TSH suppression occurred much later. There were no differences in the etiology of CH, in the mean T4 and T3 serum levels or in the mean LT4 treatment dosage between the two groups. All children were clinically euthyroid throughout the follow-up, developed according to expected norms and no deviations were noted in bone age. However, serum TSH levels remained elevated in group B infants throughout the follow-up period (up to 14 years). Increase of LT4 treatment dosage resulted in TSH suppression in both groups. However, the TSH levels obtained in group B were still higher compared to group A. These results suggest that some CH infants might have an abnormal setpoint for T4 control of TSH secretion and that these infants can be detected as early as 1 month after birth. Thus, serum T4, T3 levels and clinical progress are better guides to the adequacy of therapy than serum TSH concentrations in this group of CH infants."

Patients were divided into four groups according to delayed or normal bone age at birth, and athyreosis or ectopic thyroid. All received an initial dose of 50 micrograms/day (12.9-13.7 micrograms/kg/day) LT4 and were followed bimonthly (first year) and quarterly (second year) with thyroid profile and bone age determinations at 6, 12 and 24 months. At diagnosis, hormone levels were higher in cases of ectopia than in athyreosis (p < 0.001), and T4 was lower in children with delayed than in normal bone age at birth (p < 0.05). During treatment, all groups were clinically euthyroid despite T4 and FT4 serum levels higher than the upper normal limit (p < 0.0.001), though T3 and FT3 were within the normal limit (p > 0.05). TSH normalized within 8 weeks. Bone age accelerated at 2 years in eight children of the bone age delayed group. No patient had craniosynostosis."

CD005253,0,10022392,0,Prenatal diagnosis of thyroid hormone resistance.,"A 29-yr-old woman with pituitary resistance to thyroid hormones (PRTH) was found to harbor a novel point mutation (T337A) on exon 9 of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) gene. She presented with symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism and was successfully treated with 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) until the onset of pregnancy. This therapy was then discontinued in order to prevent TRIAC, a compound that crosses the placental barrier, from exerting adverse effects on normal fetal development. However, as the patient showed a recurrence of thyrotoxic features after TRIAC withdrawal, we sought to verify, by means of genetic analysis and hormone measurements, whether the fetus was also affected by RTH, in order to rapidly reinstitute TRIAC therapy, which could potentially be beneficial to both the mother and fetus. At 17 weeks gestation, fetal DNA was extracted from chorionic villi and was used as a template for PCR and restriction analysis together with direct sequencing of the TRbeta gene. The results indicated that the fetus was also heterozygous for the T337A mutation. Accordingly, TRIAC treatment at a dose of 2.1 mg/day was restarted at 20 weeks gestation. The mother rapidly became euthyroid, and the fetus grew normally up to 24 weeks gestation. At 29 weeks gestation mild growth retardation and fetal goiter were observed, prompting cordocentesis. Circulating fetal TSH was very high (287 mU/L) with a markedly reduced TSH bioactivity (B/I: 1.1 +/- 0.4 vs 12.7 +/- 1.2), while fetal FT4 concentrations were normal (8.7 pmol/L; normal values in age-matched fetuses: 5-22 pmol/L). Fetal FT3 levels were raised (7.1 pmol/L; normal values in age-matched fetuses: <4 pmol/L), as a consequence of 100% cross-reactivity of TRIAC in the FT3 assay method. To reduce the extremely high circulating TSH levels and fetal goiter, the dose of TRIAC was increased to 3.5 mg/day. To monitor the possible intrauterine hypothyroidism, another cordocentesis was performed at 33 weeks gestation, showing that TSH levels were reduced by 50% (from 287 to 144 mU/L). Furthermore, a simultaneous ultrasound examination revealed a clear reduction in fetal goiter. After this latter cordocentesis, acute complications occured, prompting delivery by cesarean section. The female neonate was critically ill, with multiple-organ failure and respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, a small goiter and biochemical features ofhypothyroidism were noted transiently and probably related to the prematurity of the infant. At present, the baby is clinically euthyroid, without goiter, and only exhibits biochemical features of RTH. In summary, although further fetal studies in cases of RTH are necessary to determine whether elevated TSH levels with a markedly reduced bioactivity are a common finding, our data suggest transient biochemical hypothyroidism in RTH during fetal development. Furthermore, we advocate prenatal diagnosis of RTH and adequate treatment of the disease in case of maternal hyperthyroidism, to avoid fetal thyrotrope hyperplasia, reduce fetal goiter, and maintain maternal euthyroidism during pregnancy."

To evaluate the effect of TNH in intellectual function and psychomotor performance, a historical cohohrt study was performed in 9 years old children with documented TNH at birth. 18 children with TNH who had been born in Mahdieh Hospital were studied at age 9 and compared to 19 matcheal children born at the same time, but having normal thyroid function at birth. Global intelligence (IQ) and psychomotor performance were evaluated with Raven and Bender-Gestalt tests, respectively. Total serum T4 and T3 by commercial RIA and TSH by IRMA. Urine was tested for iodine content by digestion method. Height and weight were similar in two groups at birth and at 9 years of age. Thyroid function tests were similar in the two groups except for TSH at birth which was higher in TNH than in control group (23.4 +/- 8.3 vs 3.6 +/- 1.0 mU/L, P < 0.001). Results of T4, T3, resine uptake, and urinary iodine at 9 years of age were not different between two groups. Mean IQ was 98 +/- 11 and 106 +/- 8 in TNH and normal children, respectively (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between psychomotor performance in the two groups. There was no correlation between TSH at birth and IQ at 9 years of age.

CD005253,0,3658552,0,The role of magnesium in neonatal calcium homeostasis: effects of magnesium infusion on calciotropic hormones and calcium.,"Magnesium (Mg) deficiency is a possible etiologic factor contributing to neonatal hypocalcemia. In adults, parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion is negatively feedback regulated by acute changes in serum Mg concentration, but paradoxically Mg deficiency may lead to functional hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. We hypothesized that in neonates, Mg administration will cause changes in PTH secretion and serum Ca concentration that will be inversely related to serum Mg status. We also hypothesized that Mg administration will result in increased calcitonin (CT) secretion. Thirty-nine newborn infants with birth weights greater than 1500 g were studied on day 3 of life. Ten received placebo, and 29 intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), 6 mg elemental Mg/kg body weight, over 1 h. Serum Mg, Ca, PTH, and CT were measured at time 0 (baseline, preinfusion) and 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postinfusion. In both groups combined, baseline PTH correlated with baseline Mg (r = 0.72, p less than 0.005), and with baseline Ca (r = 0.68, p less than 0.005). In the control group there was no change in serum Mg, Ca, PTH, and CT during the study period. In magnesium sulfate-infused infants: 1) serum Mg concentration rose from 1.80 +/- 0.06 to 2.82 +/- 0.07 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001); 2) the change from baseline in serum PTH at 1, 6, and 12 h postinfusion correlated inversely with baseline Mg (p less than 0.05); 3) the change from baseline in serum Ca at 1, 2, and 24 h postinfusion correlated inversely with baseline Mg (p less than 0.005); 4) serum CT remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

They were studied using a variety of different tests as part of three consecutive research components: semiannual/annual psychological assessments using age-appropriate intelligence tests (phase I), detailed psychoeducational evaluations in grades 3 and 6 (phase II) and a thorough neuropsychological evaluation during adolescence (phase III). Controls for phase I were siblings and for phase II, classmates and siblings. Phase III controls were drawn from a larger control pool and were individually matched with each CH case for age and gender. The results showed that although the CH group was intellectually functioning well within the normal range by adolescence, the children were performing significantly below expectation. Longitudinal analyses showed significant declines in IQ with age, signifying that the CH group was failing to make the same age-related gains as controls. Children with CH showed significantly poorer performance in visuospatial, language and fine motor areas as well as selective attention and memory deficits. At school, they were initially below par in arithmetic but were able to catch up by grade 6; however, their teachers reported that they were not performing as well as controls in the classroom and they demonstrated more difficulty with more complex school subjects such as science and social studies. Correlational analyses indicated different manifestations of early hypothyroidism versus later treatment factors, suggesting that while some effects can be improved by better treatment and management approaches, others caused by prenatal and perinatal thyroid hormone insufficiency may persist."

CD005253,0,7693795,0,[Pregnancy and the thyroid gland].,"During pregnancy the thyroid should adapt itself to the availability of the least quantities of iodides necessary to synthesis hormones and to several other possible modifications such as a rise in the thyroxine-binding globulin and the thyroid stimulating effect of beta-hCG. An increase in size of the thyroid gland is very common. The interpretation of the parameters used to diagnose abnormalities of thyroid function can be carried out. Although the development of the fetal thyroid can take place independently of the maternal thyroid behaviour, an abnormal thyroid function in the mother can not occur without affecting the pregnancy. Grave's disease can cause either fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism due to a transplacental transfer of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins or hypothyroidism secondary to the use of too large doses of synthetic antithyroid products. Pregnancy itself favours hyperthyroidism. Maternal hypothyroidism which has not been treated is rarer because of a lack of fertility. It can cause repercussions on the fetus that have probably been over estimated. When pregnancy occurs in a hypothyroid woman who is being treated the dosages of drugs that she is being given should be increased by 20-30%. Providing a good knowledge of the thyroid parameters and keeping the patient preferably euthyroid in cases where thyroid dysfunction can occur, the pregnancy can continue normally whatever the state of the mother thyroid function was. The risks to the fetus are minimal. In women who are at risk it is very important to keep controlling the thyroid state after delivery when there is an immunological rebound which may lead to a relapse in Grave's disease and to post-partum thyroiditis."

CD005253,0,581616,0,[Danger of iodine drugs in the pregnant woman].,"The authors draw attention to the fact that the possible effects of drugs containing iodine are often neglected during pregnancy. As an example, they report the following observation : ""A young woman with benign asthma, treated for 14 years Asthmasedine and Asthmaligne, gave birth, on the 36th week of pregnancy, to a child apparenty dead but who was able to be reanimated. The child showed two types of signs : respiratory distress due to higher neurological disorders and a multinodular, non-compressing goiter. These two complications were caused by a congenital hypothyroidism corroborated by laboratory tests and due to the prolonged absorption of iodinated drugs by the mother"". In conclusion, in cases of women receiving during pregnancy high doses of drugs containing iodine (250 such drugs are recorded in the Vidal), it is desirable to control the effect on the fetus and to propose an intra-amniotic therapy with L-Thyroxine, thus allowing a cerebral development close to normal."

CD005253,0,24292031,0,Monitoring and prognostic evaluation of patients with congenital hypothyroidism treated in a pediatric endocrinology unit.,"In this study, the etiological factors, diagnostic approaches, dose, and duration of treatment were compared between cases with transient and permanent congenital hypothyroidism (CH) with respect to prognosis. One hundred and twenty-two patients who received treatments with the diagnosis of CH in the last 10 years were included in the study. The records of the patients were reviewed retrospectively. Serum thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at the time of diagnosis were found to be significantly higher, and total thyroxine (TT4) levels were found to be significantly lower in the permanent CH group in comparison to the transient CH group. A statistically significant difference was present between the groups regarding treatment doses, the time needed for TSH decrease to <5 mIU/ml and the TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) levels obtained one month after discontinuation of the treatment. The association between age at the time of initiation of treatment and results of Denver Developmental Test was noted to be statistically significant. The high frequency of transient CH in our region leads to the result that some of the patients had to be unnecessarily treated with L-thyroxine for a long time."

To investigate the effect of chlorinated dioxins and furans on thyroid hormone concentrations in humans, we studied 38 healthy breast-fed infants. The study population was divided into two groups according to the dioxin concentrations in milk fat of their mothers. Blood samples were taken at birth and at the ages of 1 and 11 weeks. At birth a tendency to higher total thyroxine (tT4) concentrations was found in the high exposure group. At the ages of 1 and 11 weeks the increase of mean tT4 concentrations and tT4/thyroxine-binding globulin ratios in the high exposure group reached significance as compared to the low exposure group. At birth and 1 week after birth, mean thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations were similar in both groups, but at the age of 11 weeks the mean TSH concentrations were significantly higher in the high exposure group. We postulate that the observed plasma tT4 elevation in infants exposed to dioxins before and after birth is the result of an effect on the thyroid hormone regulatory system."

Pretreatment (day 3) serum T4 and T3 concentrations were 49 micrograms/dl and 590 ng/dl, respectively. With 24 h after the first dose of ipodate, serum T3 fell by 40%, and it subsequently ranged from 209-278 ng/dl throughout the 39-day ipodate treatment period. Serum T4 also decreased after ipodate administration to 69% and 41% of the pretreatment value after 72 h and 7 days of treatment, respectively; values thereafter during treatment ranged from 19-22 micrograms/dl. These plateau values are in the upper range of normal for the neonatal period. Rapid clinical improvement occurred as the hyperiodothyroninemia abated. Serum rT3 concentrations increased from 468-672 ng/dl to greater than 1400 ng/dl 24 h after each ipodate dose. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin was present in maternal and cord sera, and the half-life of serum thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin in the infant was approximately 12 days. Antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies were present in the infant at 10 days of age, and the titers decreased progressively thereafter; the half-life for the antimicrosomal antibody titer was 3 weeks. The data suggest that sodium ipodate can be useful for treatment of neonatal hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease."
CD005253,0,17956157,0,The adverse effects of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency during pregnancy and childhood: a review.,"Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal brain development, and the fetus, newborn, and young child are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. The iodine requirement increases during pregnancy and recommended intakes are in the range of 220-250 microg/day. Monitoring iodine status during pregnancy is a challenge. New recommendations from World Health Organization suggest that a median urinary iodine concentration >250 microg/L and <500 microg/L indicates adequate iodine intake in pregnancy. Based on this range, it appears that many pregnant women in Western Europe have inadequate intakes. A recent Swiss study has suggested that thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the newborn is a sensitive indicator of mild iodine deficiency in late pregnancy. The potential adverse effects of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy are uncertain. Controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women suggest beneficial effects on maternal and newborn serum thyroglobulin and thyroid volume, but no effects on maternal and newborn total or free thyroid hormone concentrations. There are no long-term data on the effect of iodine supplementation on birth outcomes or infant development. New data from well-controlled studies indicate that iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient school-age children has clear benefits: it improves cognitive and motor function; it also increases concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, and improves somatic growth."

A ""low thyroid state"" may contribute to the adverse cardiovascular effects of diabetes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of thyroid hormone with those of insulin treatment on cardiac performance of diabetic SHR. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (45 mg/kg). Subsets of diabetic rats were treated with either insulin (10-20 units/kg/day) or triiodothyronine (8-10 micrograms/kg/day). Heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were obtained at weekly intervals. After 8 weeks, cardiac function was assessed using an isolated working heart preparation. Diabetes reduced arterial pressure and heart rate in vivo and markedly depressed cardiac performance under volume and pressure loading conditions ex vivo, confirming previous observations. As expected, insulin treatment prevented the bradycardia and depressor effect in vivo and the impairment of cardiac performance ex vivo caused by diabetes. The triiodothyronine treatment duplicated the effects of insulin on the hemodynamic measurements in vivo, and corrected nearly all depressed indexes of performance of diabetic SHR hearts ex vivo. Both treatment regimens successfully reduced 8-week mortality when compared with the untreated diabetic group. The results support the hypothesis that a low thyroid state may contribute to the cardiovascular dysfunction in diabetic SHR. Left ventricular hypertrophy may be an important factor in this phenomenon."

We evaluated thyroid gland size and urinary iodine excretion (microgram of iodine per gram of creatinine = I/C). Previously, studies of infantile population suggested a 63% of prevalence. Our results indicate a decrease to 16.4% of endemic goiter prevalence. Nevertheless, the success of iodine prophylaxis was heterogeneous and not good in some case: point out Ibias population with a prevalence of 48.5% (2,000 inhabitants and 353 in schooling). Remainder population was prevalences between 6.9% and 19.8%. The mean of urinary iodine excretion increased to I/C = 106 (previously I/C = 53). The smallest index I/C become to Ibias population = 78. (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 with regard to Cangas del Narcea and Tineo population respectively). Only 2 of the 52 cases of goiter were hypothyroidism (but because of autoimmune thyroiditis).

CD005253,0,23154161,0,"Hyperthyroidism in childhood: causes, when and how to treat.","Graves' disease (GD) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children. This review gives an overview and update of management of GD. Antithyroid drugs (ATD) are recommended as the initial treatment, but the major problem is the high relapse rate (30%) as remission is achieved after a first course of ATD. More prolonged medical treatment may increase the remission rate up to 50%. Alternative treatments, such as radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy, are considered in cases of relapse, lack of compliance, or ATD toxicity. Therefore, clinicians have sought prognostic indicators of remission. Relapse risk decreases with longer duration of the first course of ATD treatment, highlighting the positive impact of a long period of primary ATD treatment on outcome. The identification of other predictive factors such as severe biochemical hyperthyroidism at diagnosis, young age, and absence of other autoimmune conditions has made it possible to stratify patients according to the risk of relapse after ATD treatment, leading to improvement in patient management by facilitating the identification of patients requiring long-term ATD or early alternative therapy. Neonatal autoimmune hyperthyroidism is generally transient, occurring in only about 2% of the offspring of mothers with GD. Cardiac insufficiency, intrauterine growth retardation, craniostenosis, microcephaly and psychomotor disabilities are the major risks in these infants and highlight the importance of thyroid hormone receptor antibody determination throughout pregnancy in women with GD, as well as highlighting the need for early diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism."

We report here a case of severe iatrogenic hypothyroidism with goiter and cholestasis, discovered six weeks after a contrast enema using sodium ioxitalamate, an iodinated contrast agent. Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and enteral feeding intolerance could explain why this complication occurred after contrast enema.

Antenatal prediction of affected infants is imprecise; however, maternal history, coupled with a high maternal serum TSH receptor binding immunoglobulin index (TBII) predict adverse neonatal outcome. Mortality is reported to be as high as 25% in affected infants and would therefore be expected to be higher in premature infants.

Two distinct groups of cases were identified and characterized based on their newborn screening TSH value. The two groups are separated at a TSH concentration of 50 mU/l of serum by a normal probability plot. This finding is in agreement with the 1993 recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics that infants with a low T4 level and a TSH concentration greater than 40 mU/l be considered to have primary hypothyroidism until proven otherwise. The group of infants with TSH less than 50 mU/l have a higher proportion of males and low birthweight infants. For this group, T4 increases with increasing TSH. We find that screening TSH, T4, and birthweight are predictive of follow-up serum TSH level for the cases with TSH > 50 mU/l but not for cases with TSH < 50 mU/l. An optimal rule for selecting screening cutoff levels is presented based on only T4, TSH and their interaction. Adjustments for sex, birthweight or age at which sample was taken did not aid in distinguishing cases from controls for newborns whose age of sample is 2 days or greater."

Experimental evidence suggests that circulating maternal thyroxine is an important source of thyroid hormone for the developing foetal brain during the first trimester. These considerations have led some authors to advocate a population-based screening program for hypothyroidism in pregnancy. However, at present it is unclear when such screening should take place, which screening test should be used, and what the benefit of therapeutic intervention is in terms of neuropsychological outcome. At present, screening seems not warranted, but we would advocate case finding of (subclinical) auto-immune hypothyroidism in certain risk groups (e.g., positive family history for auto-immune thyroid disease, or presence of type 1 diabetes mellitus) since treatment in these cases is warranted. The establishment of the optimal timing and nature of screening for hypothyroidism in pregnant women and of its cost-effectiveness is an attractive goal for a research project in a defined region."

In this study, results of a 4-year follow-up of 36 cases who had been medically treated are discussed. Low-dose (5 microg/kg/day) L-thyroxin treatment was carried out in 36 cases that had 5 mU/l or higher TSH and showed exaggerated response to TRH test. Dose was decreased to 2-3 microg/kg/day in 24 of these patients during 6 months follow-up. The drug was stopped in three cases because of the development of biochemical hyperthyroidism. Denver developmental assessment test was applied to all cases at the end of the third year. All patients showed a normal development in relation to their age.

CD005253,0,2575017,0,Evaluation of TSH receptor antibody by 'natural in vivo human assay' in neonates born to mothers with Graves' disease.,"Neonatal thyrotoxicosis induced by transferred TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) is the ideal human in-vivo experimental system for the evaluation of TRAb. The clinical significance of circulating TRAb in Graves' disease was evaluated by this 'natural in-vivo human assay'. TRAb activity in vitro was measured by radioreceptor assay (thyrotrophin-binding inhibitor immunoglobulin, TBII) and sensitive cAMP accumulation assay using FRTL-5 cells (thyroid-stimulating antibody, TSAb). Further, the binding-stimulation index (B-S index) was newly introduced, which was the most useful indicator for prediction of neonatal thyrotoxicosis, calculated as the product of TBII and TSAb (Tamaki et al., 1988a). Maternal serum TRAb indices showed highly significant correlations with the serum free T4 index (FT4I) and free T3 index (FT3I) in neonates (5-10 days after birth) born to 20 mothers with Graves' disease who had positive TBII and/or TSAb (FT4I: r = 0.825 for TBII, r = 0.908 for TSAb, r = 0.944 for the B-S index, P less than 0.001; FT3I: r = 0.622 for TBII, P less than 0.01, r = 0.812 for TSAb, r = 0.791 for the B-S index, P less than 0.001; n = 20). In contrast, in 57 untreated adult patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease, the FT4I and FT3I levels were not correlated with any of the TRAb indices. The linear regression relationship between the B-S index and FT4I found in neonates was applied to values in adult patients with Graves' disease, and the patients were divided into three groups on the basis of the 95% confidence limit: high, normal, and low responders of thyroid hormone (FT4I) secretion to the B-S index. FT4I and the ratio of FT4I to the B-S index were highest and the TRAb indices were lowest in the high responders, while FT4I and the FT4I/B-S index ratio were lowest and the TRAb indices were highest in the low responders. The FT4I/B-S index ratio was inversely correlated with the titres of antithyroid microsomal antibody in all the adult patients with untreated Graves' disease (r = -0.288, P less than 0.05). The results suggest that in-vitro assays using animal thyroid cells and cAMP as an index of response are suitable for detecting circulating thyroid stimulating activity in vivo. Secretion of thyroid hormones in Graves' disease may be regulated not only by circulating thyroid-stimulating antibodies but also by intrathyroidal stimulatory factors or by inhibitory or destructive factors."

In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels and compared these with other commonly used inflammatory markers. We evaluated the ability of serum PCT levels to predict renal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte counts, and PCT levels were measured in 64 children admitted for suspected UTI. Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. In acute pyelonephritis, the median PCT level was significantly higher than in the lower UTI group (3.41, range 0.36-12.4 microg/l vs. 0.13, range 0.02-2.15 microg/l, P<0.0001). In these two groups, respectively, median CRP levels were 120 (range 62-249 mg/l) and 74.5 (range 14.5-235 mg/l, P=0.012) and leukocyte counts were 15,910/mm(3) (range 10,200-26,900) and 14,600/mm(3) (range 8,190-26,470, P=0.34). For the prediction of acute pyelonephritis, the sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 94.1% and 89.7%, respectively; CRP had a sensitivity of 100%, but a specificity of 18.5%. We conclude that serum PCT may be an accurate marker for early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis."

Impact on growth].,"In this work, we report the results of the treatment with amiodarone applied to 9 children suffering from dysrhythmia resistant to conventional drugs. The initial dose was 800 mg/1,73 m2, administered for two weeks, followed by a 50% dose administered 5 days a week. The duration of the treatment oscillated from 9 months to 15 months (average duration: 13 months). Patients were kept under control for a period ranging between 9 and 33 months (average period: 17 months). A complete remission was obtained in 56% of the cases and partial success in 46%. The following side effects were detected: photosensitization in 2 cases; repercussion on weight, height, growth velocity, thyroid hormones and acceleration in skeletal age in 44% and 66% of them. These effects could be observed from 2 to 8 months after the beginning of the treatment. They persisted for 5 to 18 months after the treatment was arrested. The main side effect of amiodarone in children is presumably an initial effect of hypothyroidism, followed by a biological hyperthyroidism reaction. For these reasons we suggest that amiodarone should be restricted as an alternative product for resistant critical dysrhythmias and be used for a limited period of two years only."

CD005253,0,24433025,0,Treatment with thyroid hormone.,"Thyroid hormone deficiency can have important repercussions. Treatment with thyroid hormone in replacement doses is essential in patients with hypothyroidism. In this review, we critically discuss the thyroid hormone formulations that are available and approaches to correct replacement therapy with thyroid hormone in primary and central hypothyroidism in different periods of life such as pregnancy, birth, infancy, childhood, and adolescence as well as in adult patients, the elderly, and in patients with comorbidities. Despite the frequent and long term use of l-T4, several studies have documented frequent under- and overtreatment during replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients. We assess the factors determining l-T4 requirements (sex, age, gender, menstrual status, body weight, and lean body mass), the major causes of failure to achieve optimal serum TSH levels in undertreated patients (poor patient compliance, timing of l-T4 administration, interferences with absorption, gastrointestinal diseases, and drugs), and the adverse consequences of unintentional TSH suppression in overtreated patients. Opinions differ regarding the treatment of mild thyroid hormone deficiency, and we examine the recent evidence favoring treatment of this condition. New data suggesting that combined therapy with T3 and T4 could be indicated in some patients with hypothyroidism are assessed, and the indications for TSH suppression with l-T4 in patients with euthyroid multinodular goiter and in those with differentiated thyroid cancer are reviewed. Lastly, we address the potential use of thyroid hormones or their analogs in obese patients and in severe cardiac diseases, dyslipidemia, and nonthyroidal illnesses."

CD005253,0,1964355,0,[Disorders due to iodine deficiency].,"1. An insufficient dietary supply of iodine results in the development of a variety of disorders of thyroid function and development of the fetus and young infants, grouped under the general heading of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, IDD. Endemic goiter constitutes the most spectacular disorder from the clinical and epidemiological point of view. However, the most serious consequence of iodine deficiency is the impact on neuro-intellectual development at a population level, varying from endemic mental retardation to the complete picture of endemic cretinism. 2. Considering that mental retardation due to iodine deficiency represents the longterm consequence of hypothyroidism occurring during the perinatal period, it is presently recognized that the target groups to the effects of iodine deficiency at a population level are, by order of priority, the fetus, the newborn, the pregnant woman, the child and, finally, the adult. 3. The newborn is more susceptible than the adult to the effects of iodine deficiency. Consequently, systematic screening for congenital hypothyroidism in endemic areas is a particularly sensitive index for detecting the presence and action of goitrogens in the environment and for monitoring the effects of programs of iodine prophylaxis. 4. IDD are particularly prevalent in developing countries. However, large areas or even countries in Europe are still obviously iodine deficient. For example, the iodine intake in adults in Belgium is 50 to 70 micrograms/day which is lower than the recommended dietary allowance for iodine (at least 100 micrograms/day). 5. IDD should be corrected on a world scale, including in Europe. Special attention should be devoted to the protection of mother and child. Within this framework, the iodine content of formula milk should be increased in Europe. 6. Finally, correction of iodine deficiency in Europe would decrease the avidity of the thyroid for iodide and, consequently, would constitute the most efficient preventive measure in case of nuclear fallout."

CD005253,0,15128917,0,Labor promotes neonatal neutrophil survival and lipopolysaccharide responsiveness.,"Labor is a mild proinflammatory state that is associated with fetal leukocytosis. Elective cesarean section has been linked with increased neonatal morbidity, which may be partially immune mediated. We hypothesized that labor may alter neutrophil phenotype and thereby decrease neonatal complications. We characterized neutrophil function and survival in normal neonates after either uncomplicated vaginal delivery (VD) or elective cesarean section (CS) without labor. Spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis is delayed in cord blood neutrophils of neonates after normal labor (VD) compared with CS, as assessed by propidium iodide DNA incorporation using flow cytometry. This demonstrates their ability to maintain an inflammatory response. CD11b expression on neonatal neutrophils after CS is decreased, providing further evidence of altered activation or priming. Lipopolysaccharide responsiveness, characterized by CD11b and apoptosis, is similar in VD and adults, but CS-derived neutrophils are unresponsive. Baseline TLR-4 levels are elevated in CS in contrast to the other groups, although expression is not up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide co-incubation. Neonatal neutrophil survival and function are altered by labor and may increase antibacterial function and neutrophilia. This suggests that labor of any duration may be immunologically beneficial to the normal term neonate."

However, little is known about the effects of maternal iodine status during pregnancy on fetal growth. The present study investigated the potential impact of maternal iodine status during pregnancy on offspring birth size. This large prospective cohort study was nested in a Bangladeshi population-based randomized supplementation trial in pregnant women [MINIMat (Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions in Matlab)]. Urine samples obtained at 8 wk of gestation from 1617 women were analyzed for iodine and other elements, such as arsenic and cadmium, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Anthropometric measurements at birth included weight, length, and head and chest circumference. Maternal urinary iodine concentrations (UICs) ranged from 0.020 to 10 mg/L, with a median of 0.30 mg/L. Below ∼1.0 mg/L, UIC was significantly positively associated with birth weight and length. Birth weight and length increased by 9.3 g (95% CI: 2.9, 16) and 0.042 cm (95% CI: 0.0066, 0.076), respectively, for each 0.1-mg/L increase in maternal UIC. No associations were observed between UIC and head or chest circumference. When we stratified the analyses by newborn sex, the positive associations between maternal UIC (<1 mg/L) and measurements of size at birth were restricted to boys, with no evidence in girls. Among boys, the mean weight, length, and head circumference increased by 70 g (P = 0.019), 0.41 cm (P = 0.013), and 0.28 cm (P = 0.031) for every 0.5-mg/L increase in maternal UIC. Maternal iodine status was positively associated with weight, length, and head circumference in boys up to ∼1 mg/L, which is well above the recommended maximum concentration of 0.5 mg/L. The associations leveled off at UIC ≥ 1 mg/L. Our findings support previous conclusions that the advantages of correcting potential iodine deficiency outweigh the risks of excess exposure."

In this study, changes in thyroid function after discontinuation of low-dose L-thyroxine (L-T4) supplement in infants with the condition were evaluated. Fourteen infants with hyperthyrotropinemia at neonatal screening had repeated hyperthyrotropinemia (> 8 mU/L) with normothyroxinemia. TSH response was exaggerated at TRH testing. The subjects were treated with low-dose L-T4 (3 to 9 microg/kg/day) for 2.2 to 6 years, and euthyroid status was maintained. After discontinuation of therapy, mild hyperthyrotropinemia persisted up to 24 months, while serum FT4 remained within the lower half of the normal range. TSH response to TRH stimulation, which tended to be exaggerated 1 month after discontinuation, became lower 6 to 12 months later. RAIU and thyroid scintigraphy were normal in all subjects. No patient developed hypothyroxinemia, although mild elevation of TSH lasted rather long after discontinuation of low-dose L-T4 therapy. Administration of L-T4 was not resumed provided the subjects were followed at regular interval. Further long-term investigation is needed to define whether re-administration is necessary or not."

CD005253,0,25986022,0,Vincristine for successful treatment of steroid-dependent infantile hemangiomas.,"Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are common, although systemic therapy has been generally limited to circumstances of potential compromise of vital functions (airway, vision, feeding, or cardiac), risk of disfigurement, or bleeding. IHs have previously been shown to express high levels of type III deiodinase, which catabolizes active thyroid hormone, resulting in a state of severe hypothyroidism, termed ""consumptive hypothyroidism."" We describe an infant with diffuse hepatic hemangiomas who developed consumptive hypothyroidism who was initially treated successfully with systemic glucocorticoids and β-blockers. Several efforts to wean her medications were unsuccessful. She subsequently developed severe growth restriction and treatment alternatives were sought. Although previously limited to treatment of life-threatening hemangiomas, a trial of vincristine was initiated. She was ultimately weaned from all systemic therapies, with recovery of a normal growth trajectory. This case highlights broader indications for vincristine as a safe and effective systemic therapy for treatment of IHs. It also stresses the importance of close anthropometric monitoring of infants and toddlers receiving glucocorticoid therapy and intervention when growth compromise becomes evident."

However, a few studies have demonstrated the relative safety of MMI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate thyroid function of breast-fed infants whose lactating mothers became hypothyroid while taking methimazole. Between 1990 and 2001, 134 thyrotoxic lactating mothers received MMI while breast-feeding. MMI therapy was initiated between 2-8 months postpartum, 10-30 mg for the first month and 5-10 mg from the second until the twelfth month. In 16 mothers, TSH was increased at the end of one month of MMI therapy (Group 1). Infants of 18 mothers whose serum TSH was normal at the end of the first month were included as controls (Group 2). Mothers and their infants were clinically evaluated and serum T4, T3 and TSH were measured before and at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 months after MMI therapy. Serum MMI was measured in 8 infants 2 h after breast-feeding. Mean +/- SD of FT4I and FT3I were not statistically different between the two groups of mothers before MMI therapy. In all 34 mothers thyroid indices decreased one month after MMI therapy; FT4I: Group 1 from 19.8 +/- 4.3 to 6.0 +/- 4.8 (p<0.001) and Group 2 from 20.3 +/- 4.7 to 11.4 +/- 4.1 (p<0.001); FT3I: Group 1 from 602 +/- 56 to 146 +/- 52 (p<0.001) and Group 2 from 562 +/- 42 to 186 +/- 39 (p<0.001). The difference in FT4I, FT3I and TSH (20 +/- 18 vs 2.1 +/- 1.1 mU/l, p<0.001) between the 2 groups was significant at the end of the first month of MMI therapy. There was no significant difference in thyroid function of infants of these two groups one month after MMI therapy and all tests remained within the normal range during 12 months of treatment of their lactating mothers. Serum MMI levels were less than 0.03 in 6 and 0.03 and 0.035 microg/ml in the other 2 infants. The results further indicate the safety of MMI therapy in breast-feeding thyrotoxic women."

CD005253,0,10479389,0,Comparison of immune responses to extracellular domains of mouse and human thyrotropin receptor.,"The mouse and human thyrotropin receptors show greater than 87% homology in their amino acid sequences. However, glycosylated extracellular domains of mouse (mET-gp) and human (hET-gp) thyrotropin receptors showed differences in their ability to react with patient autoantibodies to thyrotropin receptor (TSHR). To test for potential differences in their immunogenicity, we immunized BALB/c mice with either gel pure non-glycosylated ectodomain of human TSHR (ETSHR II), or hET-gp (hET-gp III), or mET-gp (mET-gp III). Alternatively, mice were primed with gel pure hET-gp or mET-gp and subsequently immunized with insect cells expressing hET-gp (hET-gp II) or mET-gp (mET-gp II) respectively. All groups of mice immunized with TSHR developed high titers of antibodies against the respective immunogens. As shown earlier, sera obtained from mice immunized with ETSHR showed strong reactivity to peptide 1 (aa 22-41) and weak reactivity to peptides 23 (aa 352-371), 24 (aa 367-386), 25 (aa 382-401), and 26 (aa 397-415). Mice immunized with hET-gp or mET-gp showed comparable titers to peptides 1 and 23 and lower reactivity to other peptides. Mice immunized with hET-gp showed higher TBII reactivity (52.2%) compared to mice immunized with either ETSHR (20.9%) or mET-gp (34.5%). Peptides from the C-terminal region of ETSHR could neutralize the TBII activities of sera from mice immunized with ETSHR or hET-gp but not mET-gp. Compared to corresponding control mice, T4 levels in mET-gp II mice were only marginally higher. These data suggested that outcome of immunization with mouse ETSHR is comparable to that seen after immunization with human ETSHR."
CD005253,0,15735106,0,The International Research on Infant Supplementation initiative.,"The International Research on Infant Supplementation trials emerged as an attempt to develop a credible evidence base to guide policy decision making in this area. The fact that infant diets in developing country settings are more often deficient in multiple micronutrients rather than in single nutrients and/or energy was increasingly recognized during the 1990s. The concept of a ""foodlet,"" a crushable hybrid between a tablet and a food that is water dispersible, was developed at the first IRIS meeting in Rio de Janeiro in 1999. Trials were performed in 4 countries: Indonesia, Peru, South Africa, and Vietnam. Four different formulations of foodlets were tested: a daily placebo supplement, a daily iron supplement, a daily multiple micronutrient supplement, and a weekly multiple micronutrient supplement with a placebo on the other 6 d. The multiple micronutrient foodlets contained adequate daily intakes of 13 micronutrients considered most likely to be inadequate in infant diets. The foodlets were produced in Peru and distributed to all 4 of the country study sites. The methods used in the efficacy trials were standardized across countries, and the trials were carried out in infants 6-11 mo of age for 6 mo. Anthropometry was measured monthly and morbidity checked daily. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the trial. The data and the biological samples collected in each country were analyzed centrally. The results of this remarkable international collaboration are encouraging and, hopefully, will spur the development of programs in this area of nutrition interventions."

Prior to and after 3-day MTC administration, blood samples were taken to determine serum TSH and PRL levels using a radioimmunoassay method. It has been demonstrated that in response to MTC administration PRL increased significantly from 4,010 +/- 383 to 5,478 +/- 441 mU/l (p less than 0.01), while TSH showed only a tendency to rise independent of the pretreatment hormone levels (from 2.85 +/- 0.44 to 3.06 +/- 0.38 mU/L. In healthy control infants and in those infants with similar functional gastrointestinal disturbances who were treated without MTC, serum PRL levels fell significantly from days 3-4 to days 6-7, serum TSH, triiodothyronine and free thyroxine, however, remained unaltered. It is concluded that dopaminergic inhibitory mechanism may be involved in the control of pituitary PRL and TSH release already in the neonatal period."

The number distribution of the iodide content or concentration in the morning specimens appeared logarithmic normal in adults, children and infants. Normal ranges found in 95 per cent of populations of healthy subjects were 5.3 to 62.0 mumoles/g Creatinine (Cr) for adults, 5.3 to 42 mumoles/g Cr for children, and 1.9 to 56 microM for infants, respectively. Urinary iodide concentrations in breast-fed infants varied widely compared with those in bottle-fed infants. Mean values were 16.4 microM for breast-fed infants and 8.6 microM for bottle-fed infants, and they were not statistically different. Urine samples from the infants with transient hypothyroidism, who had undergone amniofetography showed extraordinarily high iodide concentrations, even though they were measured at 20th, 29th and 30th days after birth. Although urinary iodide excretion in patients with simple goiter was within normal limits, the mean was statistically lower than that in normal controls (p less than 0.001). Because of the simplicity and rapidity of the electrode method, we strongly recommend it for use in examining iodide excretion in patients with various thyroid diseases."

In 40 neonates the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism was confirmed (1: 4,200). The iodine excretion of healthy neonates and their mothers was on average significantly lower in the Munich than the Hamburg region. No relationship between iodine supply and congenital hypothyroidism was demonstrated. On the other hand, iodine excretion in children with neonatal goiter (17% of those with hyperthyrotropinaemia detected by screening) and their mothers was significantly lower than in control groups in the same regions. In addition, there was a significant correlation between iodine excretion of the mothers and neonates. The results confirm the need for iodine prophylaxis which should also take into account the higher needs during pregnancy. Apart from prophylactic aspects, these measures would also be in the interest of greater effectiveness and selectivity of TSH screening since it would reduce the number of cost-intensive follow-up examinations."

She became pregnant six weeks after the diagnosis was obtained and then discontinued her antithyroid medication on her own responsibility. On a check-up in the 20th week of pregnancy, a hyperthyroidism was once more found, leading to a therapy with propylthiouracil, which however, was again interrupted by the patient a few weeks later. In the 32nd week, she gave birth to a male child that already presented with distinct signs of thyrotoxicosis and developed a continuous deterioration of the condition, including a tachycardia with up to 190 beats per minute, fever, tremor and a respiratory disorder. Assay of the newborn serum revealed a severe hyperthyroidism. The TRAb level was 180 U/l (normal range < 15). A therapy with propranolol and prednisolone was initiated, leading to a significant improvement of the general condition. Nevertheless, after 12 days, there was still no notable decrease of the hormone levels. Therefore an antithyroid medication was started, which caused normal thyroid hormone levels within 9 days. However, after the therapy was stopped, a hyperthyroidism was again observed within one week, requiring another, low-dose antithyroid medication, which was administered for 26 days. After this period, the TRAb level was down to 25 U/l and no more hyperthyroidism was found. The biological half-life of the TRAb was 20 days in our case."

In the Finnish national screening programme for CHT, treatment is started at a median age of 6 days. According to multiple logistic regression analysis based on 102 cases, the main manifestations of CHT at this age are retardation of skeletal maturation and growth in length, icterus, large tongue, abdominal distension, skin mottling, muscle hypotonia and probably increased head size. The presence of other signs did not increase the probability of CHT. All signs are non-specific and some of the hypothyroid infants did not have any of them. Control of other confusing perinatal problems improved the diagnostic scoring but this did not increase the accuracy of prediction acceptably."

The use of treatment modalities for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy such as surgery is also discussed. Studies of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications of hyperthyroidism are examined in this article. Moreover, the evidence regarding antithyroid drugs, specifically methimazole and propylthiouracil, during lactation is considered.

Anti-thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody activity was measured by both radioreceptor assay (TSH-binding inhibitor immunoglobulin [TBII]) and biologic stimulation assay (thyroid stimulating antibody [TSAb]). For generalization of the predictive criteria, the expression of TBII activity was standardized using standard serum made taking units of Medical Research Council long-acting thyroid stimulator, standard B as a reference, and expression of TSAb activity was standardized using bovine TSH as a standard. TBII activity was positive in 22 mothers at delivery, and TSAb activity was positive in 18. In 12 cases, both activities were positive. Both the TBII and the TSAb activity of maternal serum at delivery correlated well with that of the cord serum. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis occurred in 9 of 108 neonates (8%), of whom five (5%) had clinical overt symptoms requiring antithyroid drug treatment. In all nine cases the TBII and TSAb activities were both positive, but no neonate without TBII or TSAb activity developed thyrotoxicosis. The prediction rate (42%) of neonatal overt thyrotoxicosis was higher when both TBII and TSAb were measured than when only TBII (23%) or TSAb (28%) was measured. Clinical overt thyrotoxicosis could be predicted in five of six neonates (83%) of mothers when the cutoff levels of antibody activities were increased to a TBII activity of above 8 U/ml and TSAb activity of above 1.0 TSH microUEq.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

By September 1990, the program covered all deliveries at the Ministry of Health (MOH) and King Saud University hospitals. The program utilizes cord serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with a low recall rate of 0.1%. The average cost per specimen was SR 12 (US$ 3.20). Among 283,647 infants screened, 83 infants were confirmed to have CH (incidence 1:3417). In 17 infants, however, the diagnosis was not confirmed due to difficulties in recall. Eleven infants with cord serum TSH of more than 100 mU/L proved to be clinically and biochemically euthyroid at recall. Three of these were secondary to maternal proplthiouracil (PTU) therapy. The female to male ratio was 1.5:1. The majority of infants lacked clinical symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. Thyroid scans showed the most common etiology to be thyroid ectopy (50%), followed by dyshormonogenesis (26%) and athyrosis (24%). Although there was no significant difference in the mean cord T4 values among the different groups, the mean T4 value at recall in the athyrotic group was significantly (P <0.001) lower than the cord results (14.8 versus 62.7) and that is of recall for the ectopic and dyshormonogenesis groups (14.8 versus 47.0 and 51.3 respectively0. There was bo significant difference in the mean TSH among the different groups in the cord and recall samples. Skeletal maturation was more delayed in the athyrotic group. The mean age at the time of recall was 16.4 days (range 4 to 64), and the mean age at the start of therapy was 17.8 days (range 5-64)."
CD005253,0,27175627,0,Relationship Between Beta Cell Dysfunction and Severity of Disease Among Critically Ill Children: A STROBE-Compliant Prospective Observational Study.,"Although beta cell dysfunction has been proved to predict prognosis among humans and animals, its prediction on severity of disease remains unclear among children. The present study was aimed to examine the relationship between beta cell dysfunction and severity of disease among critically ill children.This prospective study included 1146 critically ill children, who were admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Hunan Children's Hospital from November 2011 to August 2013. Information on characteristics, laboratory tests, and prognostic outcomes was collected. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-β, evaluating beta cell function, was used to divide all participants into 4 groups: HOMA-β = 100% (group I, n = 339), 80% ≤ HOMA-β < 100% (group II, n = 71), 40% ≤ HOMA-β < 80% (group III, n = 293), and HOMA-β < 40% (group IV, n = 443). Severity of disease was assessed using the worst Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III score, incidence of organ damage, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk of developing poor outcomes among patients in different HOMA-β groups, with group I as the reference group.Among 1146 children, incidence of HOMA-β < 100% was 70.41%. C-peptide and insulin declined with the decrement of HOMA-β (P < 0.01). C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, rather than white blood cell, were significantly different among 4 groups (P < 0.01). In addition, the worst SOFA score and the worst PRISMIII score increased with declined HOMA-β. For example, the worst SOFA score in group I, II, III, and IV was 1.55 ± 1.85, 1.71 ± 1.93, 1.92 ± 1.63, and 2.18 ± 1.77, respectively. Furthermore, patients with declined HOMA-β had higher risk of developing septic shock, MODS, MV, and mortality, even after adjusting age, gender, myocardial injury, and lung injury. For instance, compared with group I, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for developing septic shock was 2.17 (0.59, 8.02), 2.94 (2.18, 6.46), and 2.76 (1.18, 6.46) among patients in group II, III, and IV, respectively.Beta cell dysfunction reflected the severity of disease among critically ill children. Therefore, assessment of beta cell function is critically important to reduce incidence of adverse events in PICU."
CD005253,0,23337015,0,Infant's bilobar thyroid agenesis and mother's I-131 accidental administration.,"Bilobar thyroid agenesis is one of rare diseases. Genetic and environmental factors may associate with bilobar thyroid agenesis. But the mechanism is still not completely understood. It had been showed that I-131 administration during pregnancy may induce thyroid dysfunction in newborn. Here we reported a case of female hospital staff who received I-131 accidently during (10-12th gestational weeks) and after her pregnancy. The absorbed dose to fetus was higher than 30mGy. At birth, the infant was found to have no thyroid. It was speculated that the fetal thyroid agenesis may be related with mother' I-131 administration during pregnancy. In addition, this case report also indicated that the radiation dose should be minimized to any developing embryo."
CD005253,0,15572818,0,Maternal micronutrients and fetal outcome.,"Maternal micronutrient deficiency has been related to adverse fetal effects. It is believed that micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy may improve fetal and neonatal outcome. Despite biological plausibility, the evidence base for individual micronutrient benefit on neonatal morbidity, mortality, growth and development is patchy and often contradictory, except for the role of folic acid in prevention of neural tube defects. Single micronutrient supplementation interventions have not been shown to consistently affect size at birth or duration of gestation. Sound evidence is generally lacking that micronutrient supplementation can reduce infection-related adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, preliminary data suggests that antenatal zinc supplements may cause reduction in later diarrheal and infectious morbidity in infants. The evidence linking maternal micronutrient deficiency to children's cognitive and motor functioning also lacks a clear consensus except for iodine in endemic areas. There is a pressing need for good quality randomized controlled trials evaluating food based and multiple micronutrient interventions in pregnancy and preconceptually. Future studies should also evaluate the effect on body composition and metabolism along with the functional consequences."
CD005253,0,10037081,0,Neonatal hypothyroidism: treatment and outcome.,"Systematic neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH), which was progressively implemented in industrialized countries over the past 15 to 25 years, has been extremely successful in eradicating severe mental deficiency resulting from CH. However, in the first generation of children diagnosed by screening, the concept that CH has a threshold effect on intelligence was confirmed. In spite of earlier diagnosis through screening, children with severe CH (i.e., those with a marked retardation of bone age and/or a low circulating thyroxine [T4] before treatment) still had clinically significant intellectual sequelae, amounting to a loss of 6 to 19 IQ points. Recent studies suggest that this developmental gap may be closed by treating more rapidly after birth (2 weeks instead of 4-5 weeks in the early years of the screening era) and by using a higher initial dose of levothyroxine (10-15 instead of 5-8 microg/kg per day). This regimen induces transient hyperthyroxinemia, but no clinical signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Longer term follow-up of larger numbers of patients remains necessary to confirm the normalization of intellectual development and the absence of untowards effects of the treatment regimen in children with severe CH."

It could be sporadic or familial as well as goitrous or non-goitrous. Inactivating mutations of TSHR , which is one of the genes responsible for non-goitrogenic congenital hypothyroidism, are mostly inherited autosomal recessively and result in a wide clinical spectrum owing to the extent of receptor function loss. Here, we report detailed clinical features of two CH cases with TSHR mutations. The first case was diagnosed before the initiation of the national screening program and had a severe clinical phenotype associated with a homozygous inactivating TSHR mutation (P556R), whereas the second case was diagnosed after the introduction of the national screening program and showed a mild clinical presentation and carried another homozygous missense mutation (P162A) in the TSHR gene. We compared the clinical features of our cases with those of previously reported patients with TSHR mutations to enhance the genotype/phenotype correlations between these mutations and corresponding clinical phenotypes."

Five women of the menstruating group conceived 7 times and gave birth to 4 healthy infants. The findings were compared to 30 age-matched healthy subjects (controls) and to 13 women under chronic hemodialysis (hemodialyzed patients): 2 menstruating, 24 and 36 years old, and 11 menopausal, mean age 59.4 years. Serum prolactin (PRL) showed a highly significant increase in hemodialyzed patients (p less than .0001) compared to controls. In recipients, PRL levels were significantly lower than in hemodialyzed patients, but higher than in controls (p less than .0001). LH and FSH were elevated in menstruating hemodialyzed patients (p less than .0001, p less than .02, respectively) and significantly high in menopausal hemodialyzed patients (p less than .02, p less than .01, respectively). In menstruating recipients, LH was also highly elevated (p less than .001), while FSH showed no significant difference from controls. In menopausal recipients the increase of LH was less prominent (p less than .02) but FSH was highly increased (p less than .001). T3, T4, and FTI were absolutely normal in recipients, while they were significantly lower than normal (p less than .0001) in hemodialyzed patients.

CD005253,0,2169274,0,[Changes in thyroid function during ACTH therapy in patients with infantile spasms].,"Serum triiodothyronine (T3), free T3, thyroxine (T4) and free T4 levels were measured before and immediately after daily ACTH-Z therapy (0.01 mg/kg/day, 1-2 weeks) for patients with 9 cases of infantile spasms and one case of myoclonus epilepsy. In some of them, serum reverse T3 (rT3) and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) levels were also measured. All patients became seizure free after ACTH-Z therapy. Before ACTH-Z therapy, all of the hormone levels were within normal limits. Serum T3 and free T3 levels were markedly decreased after daily ACTH-Z therapy, and serum T4, free T4 and TBG levels were moderately decreased after the therapy. 1-6 weeks after the daily treatment, all of these hormone levels returned to pretreatment levels. Serum rT3 levels did not change after ACTH-Z therapy. These results suggest that the effect of long-term daily ACTH-Z therapy is very critical to the immature brain, and conventional ACTH-Z therapy has to be reconsidered."

Five of the children before treatment and four during the early 3 months of treatment had mild hypercalcemia (10.8 to 12.4 mg/dl). Hypercalcemia before treatment did not appear to be related to the vitamin D status of the infant nor to an alteration in vitamin D metabolism, but to the presence of a residual thyroid secretion. In contrast, hypercalcemia during thyroxine therapy was related to vitamin D supplementation, even though the serum calcium concentration could not be correlated with the circulating concentration of any of the vitamin D metabolites assayed and obvious changes in vitamin D metabolism could not be demonstrated."

CD005253,0,7074933,0,Analytical artifacts in radioimmunoassay of L-thyroxin in human milk.,"Previous results are contradictory regarding the concentration of thyroxin in human milk. Using a sensitive radioimmunoassay, we have found a lack of parallelism between the standard curve for thyroxin and the curve for serial dilutions of whole human milk, skimmed milk, or ethanol extracts of milk. Nonspecific binding also indicated the presence of analytical artifacts. Thus we have separated thyroxin from other milk components by means of a strongly basic Bio-Rad anion-exchange resin with quaternary ammonium exchange groups attached to a styrene divinyl benzene copolymer lattice, radioimmunoassaying the fractions eluted with an equivolume mixture of acetic acid and water. Parallelism with the standard curve was good, and results were the same whether or not the resin eluate was further purified by paper chromatography. The range of thyroxin concentration in 21 samples of human milk was 0.29-2.00 micrograms/L (mean 0.71, SD 0.40, microgram/L). Such concentrations are unlikely to afford protection to the developing brain of a breast-fed athyreotic baby, as previously claimed."

CD005253,0,26189668,0,Influence of thyroid hormone disruption on the incidence of shingles.,"The reactivation of dormant alpha-human herpesvirus (αHHV) has been attributed to various causes often referred to as stressors. However, no clinical study investigating the relationship between stressors and reactivation exists in humans at this time. Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), an important αHHV, was shown to have its gene expression and replication regulated by thyroid hormone (TH) using molecular biology approaches. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is categorized in αHHV superfamily and shares similar homology with HSV-1. We hypothesize that a history of TH imbalance may be associated with the incidence of shingles (VZV reactivation). This current pilot study, based on a hospital medical claims database, was conducted as a retrospective case-controlled investigation to determine if a putative link between TH imbalance and incidence of shingles is present. An odds ratio of 2·95 with a χ 2 value of 51·74 was calculated for the total population diagnosed with TH disruption and shingles. Further analyses indicated that African American males exhibited a much higher chance of simultaneous diagnoses. These results show that a TH imbalance history may affect VZV reactivation at different incidence rates in different races and age groups."

The infants in the groups were matched for gestational age and birthweight. Administration of 25-OH De or 1,25-(OH)2 D3 did not significantly modify the course of early neonatal hypocalcemia as compared with infants receiving vitamin C3. Mean plasma Ca +/- S. D.

This prospective study was performed at level of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH). We singled out 60 cluster school-based surveys (6 cluster surveys in each canton) with equal representation of urban and rural areas. Within each cluster, between 10 to 30 subjects (both males and females) aged 11, 12, 13 and 14 were randomly selected. The study included a total of 962 schoolchildren. The mean iodine level per 1 kg of salt for whole FBH was 21.4+/-5.2. It ranged from 2.1 to 41.3 mg/kg. A significant improvement in urinary iodine excretion medians was detected in the current survey in all cantons and on the entire territory of FBH, compared to results from a previous study conducted in 1999. The urinary iodine excretion in schoolchildren in the whole FBH varied from 50.6 to 303.8 mug/l with a median of 139.5 mug/l. Values of urinary iodine <100.0 mug/l were found in 15.9% of samples of schoolchildren, whereas no values <50.0 mug/l were found. In conclusion, the results of the study indicate that increased iodine supplementation of salt in 2001 was successful and that FBH is presently iodine sufficient. In the future, however, program for monitoring of iodine prophylaxis has to have two major aims: firstly, control of iodine content in salt at different levels especially at retail shops and at imported salt and secondly, iodine deficiency disorders control. Also, a periodic measurement of urinary iodine excretion needs to be planned together with the neonatal TSH screening and the establishment of a notification system for cases of hyperthyroidism."
CD005253,0,96241,0,Thyroid function in healthy premature infants.,"Thyroid function was studied in healthy premature and term infants between 12 hours and 3 months of age. T4 and FT4I followed parallel courses in both groups; during the first 45 days, however, the values were significantly lower in premature infants under 34 weeks' EGA than in term infants (P less than 0.001). The post-delivery peak in TSH concentration (mean +/- SD) was 71.8 +/- 19.2 microunits/ml in the premature infants. In five premature infants, injection of TRH elicited a TSH increment of 29.4 +/- 20.7 microunits/ml at 30 minutes. T3 concentration was not significantly different in premature and term infants."

CD005253,0,20306671,0,Reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in neonates.,"The evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. Extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. In many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. It has recently been suggested that serum procalcitonin (PCT) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. This study was designed to determine the reliability of PCT concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values. The current study included 69 newborn babies. After full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: Group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. They had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. The second group: Group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified into twosubgroups: group 2A; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2B included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood culture. Blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and blood chemistry, additionally, CRP, serum IL-6 and PCT were measured. The microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2A; Escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group B streptococci (GBS) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was GBS positive mother. The comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (WBCs) and CRP levels were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. While in group 2B the WBCs not differed from group 1 but CRP differed from group 1. IL-6 and PCT values were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. Furthermore in group 2B both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. For the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, PCT give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.7%. At a cutoff >140 ng/ml, IL-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, speCificity of 70.4%, PPV of 64%, NPV of 63.3%. However, at a cutoff >12 mg/L, CRP gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, PPV of 77.1%, NPV of 70%. We conclude that the serum PCT concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group."
CD005253,0,20834200,0,Serum thyroid hormones levels are significantly decreased in septic neonates with poor outcome.,"The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the effects of thyroid hormone levels on the sepsis criteria and mortality in septic newborns. This study was performed at the Firat University Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. A group of septic newborns and a control group of healthy non-infected newborns were evaluated. Blood samples were obtained at onset from septic and healthy newborns and at 10th day of the antibiotic therapy from only septic newborns, and thereafter serum total T(3) (TT(3)), total T(4) (TT(4)), and TSH levels were determined. A total of 292 newborns were included in the study. Serum TT(3) levels at onset and at 10th day of the antibiotic therapy were 163.8±63.4 and 178.3±33.1 ng/dl, TT(4) levels were 6.9±2.2 and 11.0±2.6 mg/ml, and TSH levels were 3.8±2.1 and 4.0±2.5 μU/ml, respectively in septic newborns. Serum TT3 levels were 180.3±47.6 ng/dl, TT(4) levels were 10.9±2.3 mg/ml, and TSH levels were 4.1±2.2 μU/ml in healthy newborns. Serum TT(3), TT(4) levels of septic newborns were significantly decreased with respect to those of healthy newborns at onset and serum TT(4) levels was increased significantly after antibiotic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first study to compare thyroid hormone levels in a large number of septic newborns and a healthy group. Our findings suggest that before and after treatment of neonatal sepsis a significant change is realized in thyroid hormone levels."

CD005253,0,21274327,0,Hypothyroidism due to hepatic hemangioendothelioma: a case report.,"Although hemangioendothelioma (HHE) is a commonly encountered hepatic tumor during infancy, HHE-related hypothyroidism is rare. We present a patient who developed HHE-related hypothyroidism during the neonatal period and showed marked improvement in hypothyroidism by regression of HHE. A 28-day-old boy with TSH level of 77 mIU/mL on neonatal screening and diagnosed as congenital hypothyroidism was started on L-thyroxine (L-T4) (11 μg/kg/day) therapy on the 21(th) day of life. On physical examination, the liver was palpable 5 cm below the right costal margin, and the thyroid gland was nonpalpable. Thyroid ultrasonography was normal. Although L-T4 dose was increased to 15 μg/kg/day, TSH was not suppressed and free T3 level remained low. HHE in both lobes of the liver was detected by abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment was started with prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day and alpha-interferon 3 million U/m(2)/3 times per week. Thyroid dysfunction was thought to be due to type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase activity expressed by HHE. L-T4 therapy was changed to Bitiron® tablet, which includes both T4 and T3, and euthyroidism was attained within 1 month. Thyroid hormone requirement was reduced and treatment was discontinued after regression of the HHE. At the most recent visit, the patient was 21 months old and off treatment. His growth and neurological development were normal for age and he was euthyroid. HHE should be considered in cases with severe hypothyroidism resistant to high-dose thyroid hormone replacement. The treatment of HHE in combination with T4 and T3 therapy results in euthyroidism."
CD005253,0,6736662,0,Antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine on vaginal bacteria.,"The antimicrobial potency of 4 per cent chlorhexidine gluconate was compared with that of 10 per cent povidone-iodine (1 per cent free iodine) on the vaginal bacteria of 150 premenopausal, non-pregnant women. From 30 of the women blood samples were taken before and at either 15, 30 or 60 minutes after vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine for chlorhexidine analysis. Five minutes after applying either chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine almost 99 per cent of bacteria present on the lateral wall of the vagina were killed. Chlorhexidine was significantly more effective than povidone-iodine. Serosanguineous , mucoid or white-yellowish vaginal discharge did not alter the effectiveness of either antimicrobial agent. In contrast to povidone-iodine, vaginally applied chlorhexidine was not absorbed in measurable amounts (sensitivity of detection method: 0 X 1 mg/l) into the bloodstream. Chlorhexidine may therefore prove of value for treating vaginitis especially during pregnancy and also for combating microbes such as Group B streptococci which are potentially harmful to the newly-born child."

CD005253,0,6744638,0,Antithyroid treatment of maternal hyperthyroidism during lactation.,"Eleven pregnant women were treated for hyperthyroidism with carbimazole (CZ) and one with propylthiouracil (PTU). Based upon a previous study it was decided that lactation should be permitted if the dose required after delivery did not exceed 15 mg of CZ or 150 mg of PTU. In the patients studied here the daily dose of CZ varied from 5 to 15 mg and that of PTU was 125 mg. TSH was measured in cord blood and in the blood of the newborn infants usually after 2 and 3 weeks of lactation. Serum T4 was measured serially in the infants' blood from day 4 up to 21 day of age, at least. In all instances the TSH concentration in cord blood remained below 45 mU/l the level used in screening for neonatal hypothyroidism. Serum TSH and T4 were all within the appropriate reference limits during the 3 weeks of study with only one exception. In the infant whose mother was treated with PTU the serum T4 measured 5 d after birth was slightly below the lower limit but later returned to normal. Since serum TSH and T4 did not deviate from the reference range in newborn infants during lactation, we conclude that breast-feeding can be permitted if the daily dose of CZ does not exceed 15 mg (or 150 mg of PTU) and if facilities are available for measuring neonatal serum TSH and T4."
CD005253,0,12012289,0,Transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity is associated with abnormal cranial ultrasound and illness severity.,"Transient hypothyroxinemia without elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is common in prematurity, especially in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. The transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity (THOP) has been seen as a ""benign"" condition not requiring medical treatment. However, some recent large observational studies have revealed a relationship between THOP and abnormal neurodevelopment. Furthermore, one study showed THOP had twice the risk of brain echolucency, which was the best predictable neurodevelopmental dysfunction, than the premature infants with normal or higher thyroxine levels. The relationships among THOP, illness severity, and neurodevelopmental dysfunction remain unclear. We propose a hypothesis that THOP is associated with abnormal ultrasound and illness severity. We studied 54 infants who were admitted more than 14 days at our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with a birth weight <2000 g from March 1999 to March 2000. The infants received serum thyroxine (T4), free-T4, and TSH measurement during the first weeks of life. Most of them had serum thyroxine levels measured at approximately 2 weeks of age. The infants enrolled in the study were examined by at least 1 of 3 cranial ultrasounds during the first weeks of life, illness severity evaluation according to the neonatal therapeutic intervention scoring system (NTISS) score, as well as NICU hospital stay period. Infant were classified as THOP by T4 value <5.3 microg/dL (68 nmol/L), which is 2.6 SD below the mean for term infants in Massachusetts, without elevated TSH value (<20 microIU/mL). After adjusting for some confounding factors, such as gestational age, birth weight, duration of mechanical ventilation, infants with THOP were associated with abnormal cranial ultrasound, illness severity, and lower 1-minute Apgar score. In our studies, THOP was related with brain ultrasound anomaly, neonatal illness, and lower Apgar score at 1 minute. Does early thyroxine intervention improve the prognosis and neurodevelopmental dysfunction? This question requires further investigation."

CD005253,0,24174657,0,Treatment with thyroxine restores myelination and clinical recovery after intraventricular hemorrhage.,"Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) remains a major cause of white matter injury in preterm infants with no viable therapeutic strategy to restore myelination. Maturation of oligodendrocytes and myelination is influenced by thyroid hormone (TH) signaling, which is mediated by TH receptor α (TRα) and TRβ. In the brain, cellular levels of TH are regulated by deiodinases, with deiodinase-2 mediating TH activation and deiodinase-3 TH inactivation. Therefore, we hypothesized that IVH would decrease TH signaling via changes in the expression of deiodinases and/or TRs, and normalization of TH signaling would enhance maturation of oligodendrocytes and myelination in preterm infants with IVH. These hypotheses were tested using both autopsy materials from human preterm infants and a rabbit model of IVH. We found that deiodinase-2 levels were reduced, whereas deiodinase-3 levels were increased in brain samples of both humans and rabbits with IVH compared with controls without IVH. TRα expression was also increased in human infants with IVH. Importantly, treatment with TH accelerated the proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, increased transcription of Olig2 and Sox10 genes, augmented myelination, and restored neurological function in pups with IVH. Consistent with these findings, the density of myelinating oligodendrocytes was almost doubled in TH-treated human preterm infants compared with controls. Thus, in infants with IVH the combined elevation in deiodinase-3 and reduction in deiodinase-2 decreases TH signaling that can be worsened by an increase in unliganded TRα. Given that TH promotes neurological recovery in IVH, TH treatment might improve the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants with IVH."
CD005253,0,7136673,0,Hypocalcemia in infants of diabetic mothers.

In the first group, serum calcium levels decreased markedly during the first 24 hours of life (mean +/- SD: 1.77 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, p less than 0.01) and remained low at 5 days. Serum phosphorus levels remained normal but serum magnesium levels decreased significantly at 24 hours (mean +/- SD: 0.64 +/- 0.108 mmol/l, p less than 0.01) and returned to normal at 5 days. Serum immunoreactive parathormone levels increased consistently to high levels at 24 hours and remained elevated at 120 hours (p less than 0.001). Serum immunoreactive calcitonin levels increased at 24 hours (p less than 0.001) and decreased at 120 hours to low or undetectable values in all infants. In group II, serum 25O-HD levels and 1.25 OH2 D levels increased significantly (p less than 0.001) respectively to 27.2 +/- 2.7 ng/ml and 114 +/- 20 pg/ml at 5 days. The results of this study show hypocalcemia to be a common event in IDM during the first days of life and furthermore hypophosphatemia, hypoparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia or defect of vitamin D metabolism would not seem to be the main etiological factors."

CD005253,0,25825289,0,Global micronutrient deficiencies in childhood and impact on growth and survival: challenges and opportunities.,"Despite numerous advances and improvements in child health, malnutrition still remains as one of the main public health challenges of the 21st century, particularly in developing countries. It undermines the survival, growth and development of children, and is associated with almost 35% of all deaths in children under the age of 5 years worldwide. An estimated 178 million children are stunted globally, and an additional 19 million children have severe acute malnutrition (wasting). These conditions are very often associated with concomitant micronutrient deficiencies, and among these, vitamin A, iron, zinc and iodine deficiencies are the most prevalent in childhood. Vitamin A and zinc deficiency is associated with an estimated 1 million child deaths and 9% of global childhood disability-adjusted life years. Recent data on the timing of growth retardation and stunting in infants suggest that the onset is commensurate with inappropriate complementary feeding and potentially compounded by maternal undernutrition and intrauterine growth retardation, and that the first 24 months represent a critical window of opportunity for intervention. Given the wide prevalence of multiple micronutrient deficiencies in malnourished children in developing countries, the challenge is to implement intervention strategies that combine appropriate infant and young child feeding with micronutrient interventions at scale. Emerging data from community intervention trials now provide evidence that this is both tangible and can lead to alleviation of childhood undernutrition. Some of these recent findings will be discussed."

This group was characterised by low serum thyroxine (T4), normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), low-normal thyroid binding globulin (TBG), low free thyroxine index (FTI) and low triiodothyronine (T3). The incidence of hypothyroxinaemia defined as a serum T4 value of less than 65 nmol/l was 58% after birth, increasing to 84% at 1 week, after which there was progressive reduction to 36% by 6 weeks of age. Mean T4 values were inversely proportional to gestational age during this study period. Infants of 23-28 weeks gestation had significantly lower T4, TBG, FTI and T3 values compared to those of 29-31 weeks gestation. Infants who had hyaline membrane disease (HMD) had significantly lower T4 and FTI values compared to those without HMD for up to 3 weeks of age. Similar differences were found between deaths and survivors in the first week after birth. This study suggests that there is increasing delay in maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis control with increasing prematurity. In addition, the data suggest that infants who were extremely preterm or those with HMD had worse and more persistent abnormalities of thyroid function secondary to their illness and metabolic stress. The significance of our findings, in particular that of prolonged hypothyroxinaemia, is uncertain. The role of thyroid replacement therapy in these very preterm infants therefore need to be assessed with a randomised clinical trial."

Recent animal studies suggest, however, that elevated T3 in SIDS may be a non-specific post-mortem phenomenon. Therefore, we studied the possible effects of post-mortem time on T3 levels in 10- and 20-day-old rats killed by various methods including: Sodium pentobarbital overdose, injection of KCl, cervical dislocation or asphyxia with 100% N, 95% N-5% CO2 or 100% CO2. In both age groups T3 remained unchanged or increased slightly when the animals were killed with Na Pentobarbital or KCl. Greater increases were observed when rats were killed by cervical dislocation or asphyxia (100% N, 95% N-5% CO2 or 100% CO2). T3 levels did not become elevated in asphyxiated adult rats in which the inferior vena cava was ligated immediately following death. By extension to the human infant, the results of this study support the possibility that elevated T3 levels in SIDS victims may result from post-mortem processes. However, these results also suggest that the post-mortem elevation in T3 levels may be directly related to the mode of death."

The mean cord serum TSH, T3 or T4 levels in the fetus delivered with uterotonic agents were no significant difference from those in fetus without these drugs and also there was no significant difference in the mean cord serum TSH, T3 or T4 levels according to the fetus sex (P > 0.05). (2) The mean cord serum TSH level of fetus in vacuum extraction group was significantly higher than that of fetus in normal vaginal delivery or caesarean section group (P < 0.01). However, the mean TSH levels of neonates on day 3-5 in heel blood spotted filter paper were no significant differences among the three groups (P > 0.05). (3) The mixed cord blood TSH level related quite well to the TSH level obtained from heel blood on day 3-5, or cord venous serum samples (r = 0.67-0.84, P < 0.01).

CD005253,0,12914728,0,Management of fetal endocrine disorders.,"A number of maternal endocrine disorders, when active during pregnancy, can have adverse effects on the newborn. Frequently, these affects can be anticipated as in Graves' disease, or the adverse effect can be prevented as in macrosomia in the infant of the diabetic mother. Occasionally, there are opportunities for prenatal treatment of a fetal endocrine disorder. For instance, a large goitre that may cause problems during delivery can be treated with thyroid hormones administered intra-amniotically or as analogues that cross the placenta. A uniquely effective form of treatment for prevention of a major birth defect is administration of dexamethasone to the mother to avoid virilisation of a female fetus with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). However, such treatment should only be conducted within the framework of a clinical trial as the long-term effects of exposure to potent glucocorticoids in utero are unknown. Intrauterine growth retardation, which affects about 5% of newborns, is currently not amenable to direct pharmacological treatment before birth. However, there are more practical options for managing this condition, including improved maternal nutrition and avoidance of toxins injurious to fetal growth."

The size and type of goitre was examined, height and body weight and urinary iodine excretion were assessed. The same examinations were made for comparison in 194 children (76 boys and 118 girls) in a Prague school, i.e. in an non-endemic area. The somatic development of the children from the endemic area, expressed as height and body weight, was retarded in relation to the development of children from Bohemia as a whole and in particular when compared with Prague children. In both groups only small diffuse goitres were observed or small nodular goitres, contrary to the period before the onset of iodisation when at that age medium-sized diffuse and nodular goitres were frequent. The difference in the prevalence of goitre in both groups was significant in 8-9-year-old children of both sexes. In girls it persisted to the age of 10 years, there was considerable nodulation. In boys from the endemic area goitre was found in 34.0%, in girls in 40.7%, nodulation was observed in boys in 14.0% and in girls in 18.7%, while in Prague the corresponding values in boys were 19.7% (and 3.9%, resp.) and in girls 20.3% (and 6.8%, resp.). The mean values of urinary iodine excretion varied in both areas and in the two sexes between 30.0 and 230.0 micrograms/l. Association revealed a statistically significant relationship between iodine excretion and the presence of goitre in boys and girls of the endemic area and boys from Prague. It was revealed that dietary iodine deficiency remains a permissive factor in the development of goitre and is more marked in former endemic foci. Prevention by iodised table salt protects newborn infants, but does not prevent the development of goitre in all subjects in the course of development of the organism. The possibility of reinforced iodisation in treated areas deserves consideration."
CD005253,0,17589142,0,Congenital hypothyroidism: Clinical and laboratory characteristics in infants detected by neonatal screening.,"A pilot cord serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening program for congenital hypothyroidism began in December 1988 at the Ministry of Health Maternity Hospitals in Riyadh. Out of 40,000 infants screened, 15 infants with congenital hypothyroidism have been detected. Of these, five had athyreosis, eight with ectopic thyroid glands, interestingly five of which had positive perchlorate discharge test suggestive of organification defects, and two had normally located glands with perchlorate discharge test suggestive of organification defects. The female to male ratio was 1.5:1. The clinical characteristics in our cases were not different from that previously reported. Although there was no significant difference in the mean cord T4 values among the different groups, the mean T4 values at recall in the aplastic group is significantly (P<0.001) lower than the cord results, (60.3 versus 15.3) and that is of recall for the ectopic group (15.3 versus 47.0). There was no significant difference in the mean TSH among the different groups in the cord and recall samples. The skeletal maturation was more delayed in the athyrotic group. The mean age at the time of recall was 17.8 days (range 6 to 64) and the mean age at the start of therapy was 20 days (range 8 to 64)."

CD005253,0,2909709,0,Effect of thyroid hormone level on temperament in infants with congenital hypothyroidism detected by screening of neonates.,"To determine the effect of congenital hypothyroidism and its treatment on infant behavior, we assessed temperament in 50 six-month-old infants with congenital hypothyroidism detected by means of screening of neonates. Intelligence and temperament were also evaluated at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. More of these children were classified as ""difficult"" than children in the nonhypothyroid standardization sample. Temperamental difficulty was associated with increased nervous system sensitivity, reflecting more intense responses and a lower threshold of response to external stimulation. Greater temperamental difficulty was found to persist until at least age 2 years of age and to be associated with higher circulating triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels between 1 and 3 months of age. Our results suggest that behavioral features should be considered, as well as circulating hormone levels, in determining the proper dose of thyroid hormone replacement in infants with congenital hypothyroidism."

Half of the 16 infants who were followed had normal free T4 (0.8 ng/dl or higher) and the remaining 8 infants had a low free T4 (0.38 +/- 0.15 ng/dl) during the first 2 weeks of life. Infants with low free T4 were followed sequentially during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and all eight showed free T4 levels more than 0.8 ng/dl by 36 to 44 weeks postconceptional age without any thyroid replacement. At follow-up, all 16 infants were functioning within normal range by Stanford-Binet testing at mean age of 4.6 years. There was no significant difference between the two groups in their motor development, hearing, language, or physical growth. Despite the small sample size, it appears there is no correlation between the free T4 levels during the first 2 weeks of life in infants 33 weeks' or less gestation and their developmental outcome at mean age of 4.6 years."

The required amount of iodine in infant formulas is based on caloric content, and the label must provide the iodine content per 100 kcal. Cuprous iodide and potassium iodide may be added to table salt as a source of dietary iodine at a maximum amount of 0.01%; if added, the label must indicate that the salt is iodized. Table salt to which iodine has not been added must bear the statement, ""This salt does not supply iodide, a necessary nutrient."" If a nutrient is to be appropriately added to a food for the purpose of correcting a dietary insufficiency, there should be sufficient scientific information available to demonstrate a nutritional deficiency and/or identify a public health problem. Furthermore, the population groups that would benefit from the proposed fortification should be identified. If iodine is added to a food, the percent Daily Value of iodine must be listed. There are no FDA regulations governing ingredient standards for dietary supplements. As a result, some dietary supplements include iodine and others do not. If a supplement contains iodine, the Supplement Facts label must list iodine as a nutrient ingredient. If iodine is not listed on the Supplement Facts label, then it has not been added. There are similarities between the FDA, which establishes US food regulations and policies, and the Codex Alimentarius (Codex), which develops international food standards and guidelines under the aegis of the FAO and the WHO. Both the FDA and Codex call for the labeling of table salt to indicate fortification with iodine, voluntary labeling of iodine on foods, and a Daily Value (called a Nutrient Reference Value by Codex) of 150 μg for iodine."

He had been treated with a vitamin D-free, low calcium milk and rectal administration of exogenous calcitonin (elcatonin). The latter seemed to be more effective as a treatment for IIH. The serum calcium level came within the normal range and the serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3) level decreased from 101.5 to 75.6 pg/mL with the treatments mentioned above.

The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in pediatric patients is Graves' disease. The main options for its management include antithyroid drugs, surgery, and radioiodine therapy. Despite collective experience covering more than 4 decades in the management of hyperthyroidism in children, controversy still abounds regarding the choice of treatments. None of the current treatment options is ideal. Each has risks and selection should be tailored to individual patients, especially in view of the absence of large, prospective, randomized outcome studies. Finally, we discuss the diagnosis and management of less common causes of pediatric hyperthyroidism, including non-autoimmune causes in neonates, autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas, destructive thyroiditis, excessive or inappropriate thyroid-stimulating hormone production, excessive ingestion of thyroid hormone and exposure to large, stable iodine loads."

CD005253,0,9139498,0,[Incidence of inflammatory placental changes in threatened premature labor with and without additional antibiotic therapy].,"Considering the causal association of silent intrauterine infection and prematurity we investigated the possible effect of adjuvant antibiotic treatment of women with preterm labour on the appearance of inflammatory placental lesions. 140 patients with preterm labour in the 30 + 2 week of gestation (median; range: 17 + 2-34 + 6) without premature rupture of the membranes and detection of facultative-pathogenic micro-organisms in the vagina and/or in the canal of the cervix were enrolled in the study. 74 women were treated vaginally (polyvidone-iodine) in addition to intravenous tocolysis, 66 women were given ampicillin, cefotiam or erythromycin intravenously. After delivery the placentas were examined histologically and the frequency of inflammatory lesions was evaluated by use of 4 scores of classification. For statistical analysis the Fisher Exact- and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test were used. We found no differences concerning amnamnestic and perinatal parameters comparing the 2 groups of patients. With only one of the histological scores used (according to Salafia et al. [18]) we found a higher frequency of inflammatory placental lesion in the antibiotic treated group (12/66) in comparison to the vaginal treated group (4/74). Fifty patients of the antibiotics' group received the antibiotic during the last 10 days before birth. No differences in the frequency of inflammatory placental lesions were detectable in these patients when compared with the local treated group. However, we found a lower prolongation of gestation (calculated from the day of admission to the day of delivery, median: 7; range: 1-92 days) and a lower gestational age at delivery (median: 33 + 0; range: 22 + 2-39 + 6 weeks) in the patients receiving antibiotics during the last 10 days before birth in comparison to the local treated women (22; 1-138 days and 35 + 0; 23 + 4-41 + 5 weeks, respectively).

Previously, at the age of 12 years, she had undergone thyroid surgery for Graves' disease that resulted in persistent hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. After surgical excision, the patient started levothyroxine replacement therapy and had regular control of thyroid function with normal findings throughout the years. The dose of levothyroxine had not been adjusted when the pregnancy started, and at the 29th week of gestation the patient had a thyrotropin (TSH) of 72.4 microU/mL. Ultrasound studies were performed in order to monitor fetal development. The fetal parameters analyzed before the adjustment of levothyroxine therapy showed growth retardation of various degrees. All analyzed fetal parameters (biparietal diameter, cranial and abdominal circumference, humerus and femur length) improved during the last 6 weeks of gestation, showing a good correlation with the newly achieved euthyroid state of the mother. The infant was clinically euthyroid at birth and was found normal at all evaluations of the neonatal hypothyroidism screening program (1, 5, 30 days)."

CD005253,0,179741,0,Neonatal metabolism and endocrinology studied by exchange transfusion.,"The work reviewed here illustrates how a therapeutic procedure, exchange transfusion of newborn infants, may be used to gather information which is both of practical value to infants treated in this way and also of value in the study of human neonatal physiology. The scientific deductions that can be drawn are weakened by the uncontrolled nature of the subjects available for study but this problem can be mitigated by changing one variable at a time between two groups of clinically similar infants undergoing transfusion and paying attention only to large changes in whatever is measured. In this way it has been possible to show that the glucose of ACD blood stimulates insulin and GH secretion and that the stimulation of insulin secretion is less, and that of GH more, if the transfusion is performed via the umbilical artery rather than via the vein. Arterial transfusions may be more stressful than venous ones since they are associated with greater growth hormone, ACTH and glucocorticoid release. Citrate, the other additive in ACD blood, causes a fall in ionised plasma calcium levels resulting in a stimulation of PTH secretion and mobilisation of calcium and phosphorus. Transfusion with heparinised blood is therefore preferred by some because normoglycaemia is preserved during and for three hours after transfusion, whereas post-transfusion hypoglycaemia may occur after ACD transfusion. However, heparin transfusion causes a marked rise in plasma FFA levels which may interfere with the binding of bilirubin by albumin. In either type of transfusion the side-effects may be minimised by feeding the baby afterwards, as soon as practicable. Thyroid hormones are washed out of the infant during transfusion but normal thyroid balance is restored quickly afterwards. The temperature of the donor blood does have thermal effects on the baby but these are less than might be expected due to the rapid equilibration of donor blood temperature with that of the room. The metabolic consequences of transfusion with cold blood are less than might be anticipated due in part to the glucose infusion that is part of an ACD transfusion."

CD005253,0,1761806,0,Thyroid hormones changes in infants and children with metabolic acidosis.,"The influence of the acidotic state on the thyroxine (T4) peripheral metabolism was studied in two different forms of metabolic acidosis, ie infantile diarrhea and diabetic ketoacidosis. The serum concentrations of T4, free T4 (FT4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse T3 (rT3), thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) were measured and compared to healthy control groups. Lower T4 and T3 and higher rT3 serum concentrations were found in both tested groups of patients in relation to the control groups. In infants with severe metabolic acidosis FT4 values were lower than those observed in the control group. In addition, serum TBG levels were lower in diabetic patients as compared to control subjects. Despite the reduced serum T3 and T4 concentrations in both groups of patients, TSH concentrations, were within the normal range. Therefore, we concluded that acidosis caused either by diarrhea (not so far described) or by diabetes mellitus (well documented up to now) affects the thyroid hormones metabolism in a similar way, at least as far as the thyroid hormones blood levels are concerned."

Multiple anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies, including ACTH, were finally confirmed. High basal serum cortisol levels (up to 45.1 microg/dl) were observed during a stressful episode before L-thyroxine replacement therapy was started. Decreased morning serum cortisol levels (5.0 microg/dl or below) were observed on the sixth day of L-thyroxine replacement therapy despite mild hypoglycemia (lowest serum glucose level of 50 mg/dl). ACTH deficiency was then confirmed by insulin-induced hypoglycemia test (peak serum cortisol level of 4.9 microg/dl). The present findings showed that serum cortisol levels can be high during a stressful episode in an infant with ACTH deficiency and a coexisting hypothyroid state. Thus, the diagnostic evaluation of adrenal function soon after L-thyroxine replacement therapy is important in order to verify a possible subclinical ACTH deficiency, even in the presence of high serum cortisol levels before L-thyroxine replacement therapy."

CD005253,0,24622372,0,Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.,"Changes in thyroid hormone concentrations that are characteristic of hyperthyroidism must be distinguished from physiological changes in thyroid hormone economy that occur in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Approximately one to two cases of gestational hyperthyroidism occur per 1000 pregnancies. Identification of hyperthyroidism in a pregnant woman is important because adverse outcomes can occur in both the mother and the offspring. Graves' disease, which is autoimmune in nature, is the usual cause; but hyperthyroidism in pregnancy can be caused by any type of hyperthyroidism--eg, toxic multinodular goitre or solitary autonomously functioning nodule. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is typically reported in women with hyperemesis gravidarum, and is mediated by high circulating concentrations of human chorionic gonadotropin. Post-partum thyroiditis occurs in 5-10% of women, and many of those affected ultimately develop permanent hypothyroidism. Antithyroid drug treatment of hyperthyroidism in pregnant women is controversial because the usual drugs--methimazole or carbimazole--are occasionally teratogenic; and the alternative--propylthiouracil--can be hepatotoxic. Fetal hyperthyroidism can be life-threatening, and needs to be recognised as soon as possible so that treatment of the fetus with antithyroid drugs via the mother can be initiated. In this Review, we discuss physiological and pathophysiological changes in thyroid hormone economy in pregnancy, the diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, severe life-threatening thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy, neonatal thyrotoxicosis, and post-partum hyperthyroidism."

CD005253,0,14770404,0,"Fetal hydrops, associated with maternal propylthiouracil exposure, reversed by intrauterine therapy.","Thyroid hormone is essential for fetal neurological development. Among other etiologies, fetal hypothyroidism may be caused by maternal exposure to antithyroid drugs (ATDs). The most common presentation of fetal hypothyroidism is fetal goiter, which can cause dystocia, in addition to airway obstruction in the neonate. Intra-amniotic treatment with levothyroxine normalizes fetal thyroid status and reduces goiter size. We present a case of fetal hypothyroidism diagnosed in a patient who was treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) for Grave's disease. The fetus had marked hydrops fetalis and a large goiter. In addition, anal stenosis, vesicovaginal fistula, bilateral pyelectasia and polydactyly were diagnosed in the neonate. Intra-amniotic treatment with levothyroxine resulted in a regression of the hydrops and a reduction in the goiter size. A euthyroid, non-edematous, non-goitrous neonate was delivered. At the age of 27 months the child's psychomotor development was normal. The present case indicates that hydrops fetalis may be an unusual manifestation of fetal hypothyroidism, caused by intrauterine exposure to maternal antithyroid drugs (ATDs), and that it may be resolved by treatment with intra-amniotic levothyroxine."

Fetal hypothyroidism was confirmed by cordocentesis and amniotic hormone levels. After assessment of relevant risk factors and the criteria for in-utero intervention, including goiter volume, amniotic fluid index, polyhydramnios and tracheal compression, we determined that hormonal therapy was warranted.

CD005253,0,19533052,0,[Thyroid diseases and pregnancy].,"Thyroid diseases in pregnancy must be recognized as a specific challenge for the clinician. Any pregnancy is causing alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism which have to be differentiated from pathologic states of thyroid function. Any thyroid disease of the mother with disturbances in the functional state of the gland could induce an adverse influence on the course of pregnancy. Furthermore, it can be associated with adverse consequences on fetal development. Especially hypothyroidism has to be avoided during pregnancy due to a danger of affected neurocognitive development of the offspring. Yet also maternal hyperthyroidism can lead to impairments in the course of pregnancy and to fetal thyroid dysfunction. Further clinical attention should be given to thyroid autoimmunity. There is a clear relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and decreased fertility and an increase in the rate of spontaneous miscarriages. Furthermore, it displays an increased risk for the manifestation of postpartum thyroiditis. The management of nodular thyroid disease and malignancy does not differ from that of nonpregnant women/patients. Thyroid scintiscan and radioiodine therapy must be avoided during pregnancy and lactation. This review deals with the broad variety of thyroid disorders and function disturbances during and after pregnancy.

CD005253,0,6805554,0,"Growth, development, and reassessment of hypothyroid infants diagnosed by screening.","Thirty]six neonates in whom hypothyroidism was diagnosed after thyroid stimulating hormone screening were reassessed at 1 year. All had grown satisfactorily and the mental development scores were normal in all except two. Treatment was withdrawn in 32 and persistent hypothyroidism was confirmed in 31 cases. Thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations were raised in one-third of cases before the withdrawal of treatment and this was associated with generally lower concentrations of serum thyroxine (T4) and smaller doses of L-thyroxine than in those cases with normal concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone. In treating congenital hypothyroidism, serum T4 concentrations should be monitored regularly and the dose of thyroxine adjusted to maintain serum T4 in the upper part of the reference range."
CD005253,0,14648215,0,Dopamine infusion and hypothyroxinaemia in very low birth weight preterm infants.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity (THOP) in very low birth weight newborns and dopamine administration. A total of 172 newborns was enrolled in a prospective observational study and divided into three groups: group A included newborns who were never treated with dopamine; group B were infants in whom dopamine treatment was discontinued for at least 6 h before the congenital hypothyroidism screening and group C included infants who were given dopamine during the screening. Among those newborns given dopamine, the THOP incidence was higher (11.6% in group A; 53.8% in group B; 89.3% in group C), and the vales of TSH (1.67+/-2.32 microU/ml in group A; 1.29+/-1.74 microU/ml in group B; 0.89+/-1.34 microU/ml in group C) and thyroxine (6.1+/-2.2 microg/dl in group A; 3.9+/-1.9 microg/dl in group B; 2.4+/-1.4 microg/dl in group C) were significantly lower. These differences were further confirmed even after gestational age stratification and mathematical correction for differences in clinical conditions.

CD005253,0,1296165,0,"[L-carnitine: metabolism, functions and value in pathology].","Although L-carnitine is not considered as an essential nutrient, endogenous synthesis may fail to ensure adequate L-carnitine levels in neonates, especially those born prematurely. Free L-carnitine is found in many foods, mainly those from animal sources. Absorption of free L-carnitine is virtually complete. Lysine and methionine are necessary ingredients for the biosynthesis of L-carnitine. All tissues in the body can produce deoxy-carnitine but, in humans, the enzyme that enables hydroxylation of deoxy-carnitine to carnitine is found only in the liver, brain and kidneys. Complex exchanges of carnitine and its precursors occur between tissues. Muscles take up carnitine from the bloodstream and contain most of the body carnitine stores. L-carnitine and L-carnitine esters are eliminated mainly through the kidneys, which may play a central role in the homeostasis of this compound. Thyroid hormones adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), and diet all influence urinary excretion of L-carnitine. Free L-carnitine can be assayed in plasma and urine and is occasionally measured in muscle biopsy specimens. Plasma L-carnitine levels may not accurately reflect L-carnitine body stores. L-carnitine ensures transfer of fatty acids to the mitochondria where they undergo oxidation. This process is associated with production of short-chain acylcarnitine which exit from the mitochondria or peroxisomes. L-carnitine ensures regeneration of coenzyme A and is thus involved in energy metabolism. L-carnitine also ensures elimination of xenobiotic substances. Carnitine deficiencies are common. Currently, these deficiencies are classified into two groups. In deficiencies with myopathy, only the muscles are deficient in L-carnitine, perhaps as a result of a primary anomaly of the L-carnitine transport system in muscles. In systemic deficiencies, L-carnitine levels are low in the plasma and in all body tissues. Systemic L-carnitine deficiencies are usually the result of a variety of disease states including deficient intake in premature infants or long-term parenteral nutrition; renal failure; organic acidemias; and Reye's syndrome. Modifications in L-carnitine metabolism have also been reported in patients with diabetes mellitus, malignancies, myocardial ischemia, and alcohol abuse. A large number of supplementation trials have been carried out."

CD005253,0,2546895,0,Etiology of childhood hypothyroidism.,"This study prospective without any selection bias included 80 of the 152 hypothyroid infants and children seen over the past six years. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by TSH and thyroid hormone (T3, T4) studies. Scanning for thyroid with TC99m pertechnetate was carried out in all except seven older children with grade II and III goiters where 131I uptake studies were done. Serum thyroglobulin (RIA) was estimated and antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies were tested. Based on thyroid 131I scan or 131I uptake, 52.5% had no demonstrable thyroid tissue except one with hypoplasia (Group I, n = 42), 25% had ectopic thyroid (Group II, n = 20), and 22.5% had normal or enlarged thyroid gland (Group III, n = 18). One hypothyroid patient of Group III had thyroiditis with high antibody titre and one was proved to have iodine deficiency). The mean age at time of diagnosis was lowest in Group I (age in months--30.3 +/- 36.2; 60.6 +/- 53.9; 106.2 +/- 69.3 in Groups I, II and III respectively. The intergroup differences in age were significant. The mean serum Tg levels increased progressively from Groups I to III. In the present series thyroid dysgenesis led to hypothyroidism in 77.5%, with athyreosis in 52.5% and ectopia in 25%. Dyshormonogenesis was noted in 20% and thyroiditis in 1.5%."
CD005253,0,10427933,0,Oral iodine supplementation does not reduce neutralizing antibody responses to oral poliovirus vaccine.,"Iodine deficiency is a major cause of impaired mental development, goitre, and cretinism in many parts of the world. Because existing immunization programmes can be used to deliver oral iodized oil (OIO) to infants at risk, it was important to know whether OIO could adversely affect the antibody response to vaccines, such as trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in Subang, West Java, Indonesia, in which 617 eight-week-old infants received either OIO or a placebo (poppy-seed oil) during a routine visit for their first dose of OPV as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). The infants received two boosters of OPV at 4-week intervals after the first dose, and were followed up when 6 months old. Neutralizing antibody titres to poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were compared in serum samples that were taken from 478 of these infants just before the first dose of OPV and at 6 months. It was found that oral iodized oil did not reduce the antibody responses to any of the three serotypes of OPV. These results indicate that oral iodine may safely be delivered to infants at the same time as oral poliovirus vaccine according to current EPI immunization schedules."

Clinical guidelines for management of fetal SVT have not been determined in standardized trials, nor do we have a clear sense regarding the long-term developmental outcomes and side effects of in utero antiarrhythmic therapy. We describe our approach to the treatment of refractory SVT in a fetus with hydrops using direct umbilical vein treatment with amiodarone coupled with effusion evacuation. We successfully achieved in utero resolution of SVT. There was transient amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, which we screened for early and treated with Synthroid. Ultimately our patient had normal long-term growth and development as measured by modified Denver office checklists and Ages and Stages questionnaires. Our experience advocates for vigilant screening and management of hypothyroidism in fetuses exposed to in utero amiodarone and suggests that it is possible to achieve good outcomes in high-acuity refractory cases of SVT."

These families were divided into two groups, depending on whether hemizygous males had low or undetectable serum thyroxine-binding globulin levels. Five families belonged to the low (hypo-TBGnemic) type while the remaining 8 families belonged to the absent (a-TBGnemic) type. On pedigree analysis, 10 families satisfied the requirements for an X-linked co-dominant mode of transmission. Three families, 2 a-TBGnemic and 1 hypo-TBGnemic, did not satisfy these requirements and three hypotheses had to be put forward to explain these situations: an autosomal recessive mode of transmission, a spontaneous mutation, or an extreme lyonisation of the defective X. Since the thyroxine-binding globulin gene has been localized to the X-chromosome, the two latter explanations appear to be the most plausible."
CD005253,0,623168,0,Enhancement of fetal lung maturity by intra-amniotic administration of thyroid hormone.,"Following preliminary results in animal studies demonstrating that thyroxine (T4) injected directly into the fetus or the amniotic sac is capable of enhancing fetal lung maturity, a trial of thyroxine treatment in mean was carried out. Two hundred micrograms of T4 were injected intra-amniotically in eight women with high-risk pregnancies in which premature delivery was inevitable or indicated. Fetal lung maturity was evaluated by a recently developed, accurate, and rapid method using the microviscosity value epsilon (this being the linear expression of the polarization value P) of the lipid assembly of the amniotic fluid as a parameter of the surfactant content. epsilon Values, which were very high before T4 injection, dropped steeply to below the value of 4.344, indicating fetal lung maturity. Eight newborn infants delivered, five by caesarean section, soon after the T4 injection did not develop respiratory distress syndrome, although they were born prematurely. Intra-amniotic injection of T4 appears to be of therapeutic value in enhancing fetal lung maturity."

CD005253,0,11509110,0,Micronutrients in pregnancy.,"Vitamins and minerals, referred to collectively as micronutrients, have important influences on the health of pregnant women and the growing fetus. Iron deficiency results in anemia which may increase the risk of death from hemorrhage during delivery, but its effects on fetal development and birth outcomes is still unclear. Folic acid deficiency can lead to hematological consequences, pregnancy complications and congenital malformations, but again the association with other birth outcomes is equivocal. Zinc deficiency has been associated in some, but not all studies with complications of pregnancy and delivery, as well as with growth retardation, congenital abnormalities and retarded neurobehavioral and immunological development in the fetus. Iodine deficiency during pregnancy results in cretinism and possible fetal wastage and preterm delivery. Deficiency of other minerals such as magnesium, selenium, copper, and calcium have also been associated with complications of pregnancy, childbirth or fetal development. Deficiencies of vitamins other than folate may likewise be related to such complications; and vitamin A or beta-carotene supplements in pregnancy reduced maternal mortality by 50 % in a controlled trial in Nepal. Additional research is need on the prevalence of such deficiencies and their consequences and on cost-effective public health interventions for their control."
CD005253,0,10693082,0,Neonatal thyroxine level and perchlorate in drinking water.,"Environmental contamination of drinking water has been observed for perchlorate, a chemical able to affect thyroid function. This study examines whether that exposure affected the thyroid function of newborns. Neonatal blood thyroxine (T4) levels for days 1 to 4 of life were compared for newborns from the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, which has perchlorate in its drinking water, and those from the city of Reno, Nevada, which does not (detection limit, 4 micrograms/L [ppb]). This study is based on blood T4 analyses from more than 23,000 newborns in these two cities during the period April 1998 through June 1999. No difference was found in the mean blood T4 levels of the newborns from these two cities. Drinking water perchlorate levels measured monthly for Las Vegas ranged during this study period from non-detectable for 8 months to levels of 9 to 15 ppb for 7 months. Temporal differences in mean T4 level were noted in both cities but were unrelated to the perchlorate exposure. This study was sufficiently sensitive to detect the effects of gender, birth weight, and the day of life on which the blood sample was taken on the neonatal T4 level, but it detected no effect from environmental exposures to perchlorate that ranged up to 15 micrograms/L (ppb)."

Cord serum thyrotropin (TSH) was significantly decreased (8.2 +/- 4.0 U/l vs. 10.3 +/- 4.9 U/l) and free thyroxine index (FT4I)/TSH ratio significantly increased (18.8 +/- 9.0 vs. 14.4 +/- 7.6) (p less than 0.05) in the smoking group compared to infants of non-smokers.

The results indicate that infants of smoking mothers may have a hyperfunction of the thyroid gland at birth compared to infants of non-smokers, with a negative feed-back on TSH production from the pituitary gland. Increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption caused by fetal thyroid hyperfunction may be pathogenetic factors for the fetal growth retardation caused by maternal smoking."

MS and other bacterial levels were periodically monitored in 48 mother-infant pairs until the child's third birthday. There were significant reductions in maternal salivary MS (P = 0.04), lactobacilli (P = 0.04), total streptococci (P = 0.002), and total cultivable organisms (P = 0.004) immediately following treatment. In children, 3-yr incidence of MS colonization and the time of acquisition of MS or the caries experience did not differ significantly between the two groups. We conclude that short-term application of I2-NaF to the maternal dentition of predentate infants significantly lowers MS, lactobacilli, total streptococci, and total cultivable bacteria in mothers' saliva, but does not influence the incidence and the time of acquisition of MS or the caries experience in children."

CD005253,0,25173191,0,Universal screening versus selective case-based screening for thyroid disorders in pregnancy.,"Thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy is associated with significant maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. Early treatment of thyroid disorders can effectively reduce the risk of such complications. The results of different clinical trials have demonstrated that screening pregnant women for thyroid dysfunctions is cost-effective and should be encouraged. However, there is no consensus over the advantages of universal versus case-finding screening for thyroid disorders during pregnancy. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies having been carried out to make a comparison between universal and case-finding screening methods during pregnancy in terms of the loss rate. The main search criteria were related to thyroid function, pregnancy, and adverse outcomes. All articles in English language are included. We analyzed by random effect method due to between-study heterogeneity. Among 241 articles found using the search terms, 40 articles were included out of which 10 were considered as acceptable and relevant. Five articles showed that case-finding screening missed between 30 and 55% of pregnant women with thyroid dysfunction. 4 studies demonstrated that universal screening and detection of thyroid dysfunction may lead to less miscarriage and pregnancy complications. The results of 2 studies demonstrated that universal screening in pregnancy with a focus on hypothyroidism would be cost-effective. Early detection of thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy can minimize the adverse maternal and fetal outcomes and is demonstrated to be cost-effective. Meta-analysis confirmed that case-based screening may miss up to 49% of pregnant women with thyroid dysfunction. This provides further support for the argument in favor of universal screening of thyroid disorders in pregnancy. In order to shed more light on the advantages of universal screening for thyroid disorders in pregnancy, more comprehensive randomized controlled trials with larger cohorts are required."

CD005253,0,19904446,0,Neuro-developmental deficits in early-treated congenital hypothyroidism.,"This paper summarises the current evidence on neuro-developmental deficits in the early (< 1 month of age) treated congenital hypothyroid and the influencing factors. A literature search revealed only few citations that compared outcome with matched controls. In all but one, the median age of treatment onset was >2 weeks. Mean Global IQ scores are about 10 points lower and remain identifiable in adulthood. Verbal and performance scores are usually similar. Deficits persisting into adolescence and adulthood involve the visuomotor, memory, attention and posture domains. Lower academic performance is common in the early years. Prenatal factors associated with a worse prognosis are aetiology (dysgenesis), low birth weight, associated complications and severity of hypothyroidism. Postnatal factors are age at onset of treatment (>1 month), lower thyroxine dose at onset (<8 mcg/kg/day), late normalisation of thyroid function (>2 weeks after treatment), and a lower socio economic family status. The author proposes the evaluation of a multi centre cohort with a median age of treatment onset <1 week, TSH normalisation by <3 weeks with treatment thyroxine levels maintained in the 3rd quartile for age. The outcome of this cohort should indicate if current targets in management need to be revised."

Two hundred cases of our hospital treatment confirmed infection early newborn children were selected from February 2014 to March 2015. According to the condition, the children were divided into four groups as follows: severe infection group, local infection group, non-infection group and healthy newborns group. At the same time, the new healthy newborns were chosen as control group. The levels of serum procalcitonin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were detected in all children and the levels in severe infection group children before and after treatment were also quantitatively detected and the test results were analyzed. There was significant difference in procalcitonin among the four groups (pS<0.05). The positive rate of the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in local infection group has no significant difference compared with the non-infection group (p>0.05). But there was significant difference between the local infection group and healthy newborn group. As for the severe infection group, both the levels of procalcitonin and positive rate of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein had significant difference compared with the other groups. The detection of procalcitonin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein could contribute to the diagnose of the early infection neonatal children and has important values in diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases in the newborns."

CD005253,0,836646,0,Intra-amniotic injection of thyroxine (T4Y to a human fetus. Evidence for conversion of T4 to reverse T3.,"131I (150 mCi) was inadvertently given to a woman during week 10 to 11 of her gestation. When referred, fetal size was estimated at 31 to 32 weeks' gestation. Because of the potential risk of fetal hypothyroidism, an amniocentesis, with an injection of 500 mug of thyroxine, was performed weekly from week 33 until delivery. T4, T3, thyrodi-stimulating hormone (TSH), and rT3 were measured in amniotic fluid samples obtained at 33, 36, and 37 weeks. Maternal serum T4 was measured on the day of delivery. T4, T3, and TSH concentrations were measured in cord blood and during the neonatal period. The concentration of T4 in amniotic fluid (AF) was within the normal range at 32 weeks (prior to thyroxine); AF T3 and TSH were not detectable. The concentration of AF rT3 at 32 weeks also was normal (160 ng. per deciliter) and increased markedly after beginning intra-amniotic T4 injections; AF T4 increased modestly, but the AF T3 level remained unmeasurable. The concentration of T4 in cord serum obtained within 24 hours of the last amniotic fluid thyroxine injection, was in the hyperthyroid range and the TSH level was low. The cord serum T3 level was at the upper range of normal. The infant's serum T4 and T3 both increased during the first 24 hours. The male infant developed normally and serum T4 and TSH concentrations were normal at 4 months of age. The data indicate: (1) that T4 injected into AF is absorbed by the human fetus, (2) that AF rT3 concentration increases markedly after the AF T4 injection, whereas AF T3 levels do not increase, and (3) that the neonatal TSH surge is not entirely suppressed by hyperthyroid levels of cord serum T4."
CD005253,0,2753978,0,Thyroid function in neonates from goitrous and nongoitrous iodine-sufficient areas.,"We compared thyroid function between newborns from goitrous and nongoitrous localities in which iodine intake has been supplemented since 1955. Cord serum samples were analyzed in 185 infants born during a 9-month period (1986-1987) in 2 goitrous and 1 nongoitrous localities of western Colombia. Urinary iodine was determined in all mothers before delivery. No significant differences were found among neonates of the 3 localities (Kruskal-Wallis test) for the various thyroid hormone values, and all values were within the normal range, although there was a trend in distribution of TSH to higher values in both goiter areas. Thyroid autoantibodies (antithyroglobulin and antithyroid microsomal) were negative in all neonates, and iodine intake, as indicated by urinary iodine, was adequate and similar among the mothers of the 3 groups. Those newborn infants with serum TSH values higher than 20 mU/L were reexamined 5-7 months later. At this time, all infants had lower serum TSH values and their serum free T4 index and T3 values were normal. Gestational age, weight, and height at birth were normal and also equal among the neonates in the 3 localities. These results indicate that neonates from goitrous iodine-sufficient areas have thyroid function similar to that of infants born in nongoitrous areas equally supplemented with iodine, and therefore, they are not more at risk to develop congenital hypothyroidism."

The mother had been subjected to local polyvidone iodine therapy for seven weeks with PVP suppositories to prevent vaginal infections. Control checks revealed persistently elevated TSH levels, whereas T3/T4 levels were always reduced. Greatly pronounced iodine excretion was seen in the urine of both the babies. This raised the suspicion of iodine-induced hypothyroidism in both children. Substitution with 1-thyroxine was initiated and a withdrawal trial performed after 12 weeks. The patients remained euthyroid after the treatment had been discontinued. Due to possible transfer of iodide to the fetus associated with the risk of iodine-induced hypothyroidism, it is recommended to abstain from vaginal application of iodine during pregnancy."

CD005253,0,9039509,0,A thyroxine dosage of 8 micrograms/kg per day is appropriate for the initial treatment of the majority of infants with congenital hypothyroidism.,"The adequate L-thyroxine dosage for the initial treatment of infants with congenital hypothyroidism is a subject of controversy. Some recommend higher dosages (> 10 micrograms/kg/day) to ensure adequate levels, while others advocate lower dosages to permit normalisation of thyroid status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a treatment strategy using an initial dosage of 7.5-8.0 micrograms/kg per day, TSH measurements being taken at 15 and 30 days of treatment. Fifty one newborns infants with primary congenital hypothyroidism detected by neonatal screening were treated with the same therapeutic strategy. A mean L-thyroxine dosage of 7.9 micrograms/kg per day at the onset of treatment and 6.6 micrograms/kg/d at 2 months, normalised the FT4 and FT3 levels at 15 days in 100% and TSH levels at 2 months in 90% of cases. Many patients showed elevated levels of FT4 and a systematic higher initial dosage could expose many infants to a dangerous hyperthyroidism. Patients with abnormal TSH levels at 2 months already had higher TSH levels in the first 8 weeks of life and, despite higher L-thyroxine dosage, also exhibited lower FT4 and FT3 levels. These patients who needed an early increase in dosage had already shown a more profound ante and neonatal hypothyroidism. This subgroup of patients require a higher dosage of thyroxine and early assessment of FT4, FT3 and TSH levels are required for optimum dosage choice."

The patients included 27 with congenital hypothyroidism and 5 with transient hypothyroidism. Abnormal auditory brainstem evoked potential tracings were found in 8 patients (congenital hypothyroidism in 7 and transient hypothyroidism in 1). Four of these patients had increased peripheral conduction time (wave I prolongation), and the other 4 had increased central conduction time (wave III or V prolongation). The patients with abnormal auditory brainstem evoked potentials did not show increased initial manifestations, yet 6 of them had lower initial thyroxine levels. Specific auditory brainstem evoked potential abnormalities were found in 25% of early-treated patients with congenital hypothyroidism. The possible causal relationship between deviant auditory brainstem evoked potential patterns and later neurodevelopment demands further clarification. This study suggests the usefulness of auditory brainstem evoked potential assessment to provide information about electrophysiologic deviation of the auditory pathway in patients with early-treated congenital hypothyroidism."

He was characterized clinically by severe neurologic impairment (initially with global hypotonia, later evolving with generalized hypertonia), normal growth during infancy, reduced weight gain, and absence of typical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, while the laboratory evaluation disclosed elevated T3, low total and free T4, and mildly elevated TSH serum levels. Treatment with levothyroxine improved thyroid hormone profile but was not able to alter the clinical picture of the patient. These data reinforce the concept that the role of MCT8 is tissue-dependent: while neurons are highly dependent on MCT8, bone tissue, adipose tissue, muscle, and liver are less dependent on MCT8 and, therefore, may suffer the consequences of the exposition to high serum T3 levels."

Twelve mothers were on anti-thyroid drugs and 2 were drug-free, with 8 being euthyroid and 6 being hyperthyroid. Serum concentrations of T3, T4 and fT3 in cord blood were all the same regardless of maternal thyroidal function. Though cord blood TRAb levels correlated with maternal levels, cord fT4 levels were low in those who given antithyroid drugs. TSH levels in cord blood were low in Cesarean section delivery and babies with low birth weight. Birth weight and gestational weeks were both inversely correlated with maternal T4, fT4, fT3 and TRAb concentrations.

CD005253,0,15863666,0,Genetics of congenital hypothyroidism.,"Congenital hypothyroidism is the most common neonatal metabolic disorder and results in severe neurodevelopmental impairment and infertility if untreated. Congenital hypothyroidism is usually sporadic but up to 2% of thyroid dysgenesis is familial, and congenital hypothyroidism caused by organification defects is often recessively inherited. The candidate genes associated with this genetically heterogeneous disorder form two main groups: those causing thyroid gland dysgenesis and those causing dyshormonogenesis. Genes associated with thyroid gland dysgenesis include the TSH receptor in non-syndromic congenital hypothyroidism, and Gsalpha and the thyroid transcription factors (TTF-1, TTF-2, and Pax-8), associated with different complex syndromes that include congenital hypothyroidism. Among those causing dyshormonogenesis, the thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin genes were initially described, and more recently PDS (Pendred syndrome), NIS (sodium iodide symporter), and THOX2 (thyroid oxidase 2) gene defects. There is also early evidence for a third group of congenital hypothyroid conditions associated with iodothyronine transporter defects associated with severe neurological sequelae.

CD005253,0,15871630,0,Neonatal chlamydial infections: prevention and treatment.,"Neonatal chlamydial infection, which manifests principally as ophthalmia neonatorum (ON) or pneumonia, is a significant cause of neonatal morbidity. Widespread use of silver nitrate drops resulted in a dramatic decline in the incidence of gonococcal ophthalmia but had much less impact on the incidence of neonatal chlamydial infection. Chlamydia trachomatis has become the most common infectious cause of ON in developed countries.A number of prophylactic antibiotic or antiseptic agents have been used to prevent ON. Prophylaxis with 1% silver nitrate ophthalmic drops, 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, or 1% tetracycline ointment has comparable efficacy for the prevention of chlamydial ophthalmia but does not offer protection against nasopharyngeal colonization or the development of pneumonia. Erythromycin or tetracycline topically have been used as prophylactic agents because of their allegedly superior activity for the prevention of ON and because they produced less chemical conjunctivitis compared with silver nitrate. However, the relative efficacy of these agents for chlamydial infection and the emergence of beta-lactamase-producing Neisseria gonorrheae has raised questions regarding their effectiveness when applied topically for prophylaxis of ON. Compared with these agents, a 2.5% povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution has been found to have greater efficacy for the prevention of ON generally, and chlamydial ophthalmia specifically. In countries where the incidence of ON is very low, an alternative strategy is to institute prenatal screening and treatment of infected mothers, forgo routine neonatal prophylaxis, and follow-up infants after birth for the possible development of infection. For the treatment of chlamydial ophthalmia or pneumonia, oral erythromycin for 2 weeks is recommended; additional topical therapy is unnecessary. However, in approximately 20-30% of infants, therapy will not eradicate the organism and the infant may require a repeat oral course of antibiotics. The few published studies on the use of the new oral macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin, roxithromycin, or clarithromycin for chlamydial infections in neonates suggest that these agents may be effective; however, more data on their tolerability and efficacy in this patient group are warranted."

We describe the current fortification practice of commercial CF and formula in Germany as an example for other European countries, based on a market survey conducted in autumn 2008. In addition, we estimated the iodine intake of an 8-month-old infant, fed one portion of milk and three complementary meals per day. All formulae were fortified with iodine, and half of CF products. Iodine concentration varied depending on product groups. A partially breast-fed infant getting homemade CF reached less than 50% of the recommended iodine intake. Using infant formula and commercial CF, the recommended intake was exceeded by 39 or 100%, depending on which products were chosen. A well-balanced fortification of commercial CF, including pure infant cereals, would be required to ensure an adequate iodine supply."

A 31-yr-old infertile woman with a TSH-secreting macroadenoma was treated with continuous sc infusion of 300 micrograms octreotide/day. After 3 months, euthyroid status was restored, and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a reduction of the macroadenoma. Subsequently, the patient was found to be pregnant, and octreotide was stopped after 1 month of gestation. Serum TSH and free thyroid hormone concentrations returned to pretreatment values. At 6 months of pregnancy, a visual field examination was abnormal, and a magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an enlargement of the pituitary adenoma. Reinstitution of octreotide treatment was associated with normalization of TSH and free thyroid hormone concentrations, a rapid improvement of visual fields, and a new reduction in the size of pituitary macroadenoma. Octreotide treatment was continued until an elective cesarean section was performed at 8 months gestation. Despite the presence of immunoreactive octreotide in the umbilical cord, neonatal thyroid parameters were normal, and a physiological rise in TSH with the increase in thyroid hormone concentrations occurred in the neonate. In conclusion, 1) octreotide treatment is effective in controlling TSH-secreting macroadenoma during pregnancy; 2) despite the transplacental passage of immunoreactive octreotide, physiological changes in thyroid parameters occur in the neonate, and 3) exposure of the fetus to octreotide during the first month as well as the last trimester of gestation did not induce any malformation or affect fetal development."

At the 6th hour of life the CF neonates demonstrated lower serum Ca and higher serum CT in comparison with normal infants. In the hours following, no significant differences between the two groups for the Ca levels were found, whereas serum CT remained significantly higher in the CF newborns at the 24th, 48th, and 72nd hour of life. Significant differences between normal and CF infants in the PTH serum levels were detected only at the 48th hour, when PTH was lower in the CF newborns. The results of this investigation indicate that the fracture of the clavicle is a significant and peculiar factor in stimulating CT secretion. Serum Ca level appeared to be controlled by CT rather than auto-regulating the secretion of the hormone."

CD005253,0,9251921,0,Neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism: results and perspectives.,"Systematic screening for congenital hypothyroidism in the neonate constitutes a major progress in the prevention of mental retardation, as the condition occurs in 1/4,000 newborns and necessarily results in brain damage if not properly detected and treated during the first days of life. Screening and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are discussed, as well as outcome and prognosis of the affected infants. Primary thyroid-stimulating hormone screening is almost universally recommended. Early therapy (within 14 days) with appropriate doses of thyroxine (about 10 micrograms/kg/day) will prevent any brain damage even in case of evidence of fetal hypothyroidism, as thyroxine of maternal origin will reach the fetus and largely protect him. Neonatal thyroid screening is also a particularly sensitive monitoring tool in the evaluation of the effects and of the correction of iodine deficiency at the population level."
CD005253,0,6851158,0,Thyroid hormones in the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).,"Results are presented of serum total T4, T3, and TSH measurements on 92 patients. There are 34 infants exhibiting the sudden infant death syndrome, 36 in control group 1, who are matched both for age of infant and for duration of storage of specimen, and 22 post-mortem sera from non-SIDS deaths. There is no significant difference between the groups for total T4 measurements, but there is a highly significant elevation of both total serum T3 and TSH in the SIDS group compared with control group 1. It is suggested that the TSH elevation may be due to a post-mortem effect, but the T3 results appear to confirm and extend the recent publication of Chacon et al [1]. Evidence of one case of a near-SID that subsequently died is presented, demonstrating that disturbances of thyroid function tests occurred in this patient before death."
CD005253,0,6384328,0,Amiodarone treatment of critical arrhythmias in children and young adults.,"The majority of sudden cardiac deaths in children occur in patients with prior arrhythmias and an abnormal heart. Amiodarone was given to 39 young patients (35 with an abnormal heart) with arrhythmias unresponsive to conventional treatment. Their age ranged from 6 weeks to 30 years with nine patients younger than 2 years of age. Atrial flutter was present in 16 patients, ventricular tachycardia in 14 patients and supraventricular tachycardia in 9 patients. The most common diagnosis (14 patients) was postoperative repair of congenital heart disease. The dose ranged from 2.5 to 21.6 mg/kg per day (mean 8.2). Elimination of arrhythmia (on 24 hour electrocardiography) occurred in 15 of 16 patients with atrial flutter, 11 of 14 with ventricular tachycardia and 5 of 9 with supraventricular tachycardia. Symptomatic side effects were: rash (three patients), headache (two patients), nausea (one patient) and peripheral neuropathy (one patient); seven patients had asymptomatic corneal microdeposits which normalized in all after the drug was discontinued. No side effects occurred in patients younger than 10 years of age. The following changed with treatment (p less than 0.05): heart rate decreased (three patients with atrial flutter and sick sinus syndrome required pacemaker implantation for bradycardia) and QTc increased; thyroxine (T4) and serum reverse triiodothyronine (T3) increased. During follow-up study (range 6 months to 3 years), 21 of the 39 patients continued to take amiodarone with complete control of arrhythmias, 9 were no longer taking the drug and 9 died (7 nonsudden and 2 sudden deaths). Amiodarone is an extremely effective treatment for infants and children with tachyarrhythmias resistant to conventional treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

They rapidly and dramatically reduce serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels by inhibiting conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3 in the periphery and by blocking secretion from the thyroid. Potential risks from the large iodine load resulting from their use limit their widespread applicability. In addition, they are ineffective when used alone on a long-term basis. However, these agents may be especially useful in treating thyrotoxic patients preoperatively, in neonatal Graves' disease, in massive levothyroxine ingestion, and when other conventional antithyroid drugs are unsuccessful or contraindicated."

CD005253,0,28534114,0,Pediatric Hypothyroidism: Diagnosis and Treatment.,"Thyroid hormone has important physiologic functions in nearly every organ system. The critical role of thyroid hormone in growth and in physical and neurologic development lends particular importance to the prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of hypothyroidism in infants and children. Congenital hypothyroidism is common and has potentially devastating neurologic consequences. While the approach to diagnosis and treatment of severe congenital hypothyroidism is well established, data continue to emerge about the genetic causes, clinical significance, and prognosis of the milder forms of congenital hypothyroidism that are increasingly being diagnosed by newborn screening. Similarly, the diagnosis and treatment of severe acquired hypothyroidism is straightforward and clearly of clinical benefit, but uncertainty remains about the optimal management of mild subclinical hypothyroidism. This review summarizes current knowledge of the causes, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of hypothyroidism in infants and children, with a focus on recent developments and areas of uncertainty in this field."
CD005253,0,21902053,0,A review on the metabolic disorders of iodine deficiency.,Iodine is in the crucial parts of two hormones of T4 and T3 produced by the thyroid glands which are essential for all the aspects of human metabolisms. It is demonstrated that iodine deficiency can be considered as sole cause of many thyroid abnormalities including mental disorders. Iodine deficiency of sufficient degree to cause hypothyroidism during fetus life and early infancy will be accompanied with brain abnormality possibly to the stage of mental retardation. The iodine deficiency among subjects in their early stage of childhood is not as severe as those in their fetus or infancy. In adult subjects the sever iodine deficiency can be also associated with mental disorders due to the direct side effects of hypothyroidism occurred by lack of iodine. The clinical manifestation of iodine deficiency show itself with psychological disorders in adult subjects. The status of iodine within blood can be evaluated through measurement of urinary iodine level and the low urinary concentration is an indicative of hypothyroidism. Mental retardation and brain damage due to iodine deficiency can be prevented if iodine supplementation prescribed duly on time.

CD005253,0,3032814,0,A controlled trial of iodinated oil for the prevention of endemic cretinism: a long-term follow-up.,A double blind controlled trial designed to examine the effectiveness of intramuscular iodinated oil as a prophylactic for the nervous type of endemic cretinism was begun in 1966 in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Infants born into the trial between 1966 and 1972 were followed up until 1982. The results showed that if the iodine supplement was given before conception the nervous form of endemic cretinism was prevented. Also a striking difference in the 15-year cumulative survival rate in favour of the test (iodinated oil) group was observed. Measures of motor and intellectual function revealed that children born to mothers given an iodine supplement performed significantly better. This observation shows that iodine deficiency leads to sub-clinical as well as clinical deficits. It also justifies the use of the term iodine deficiency disorder to cover the polymorphic nature of the abnormalities attributable to iodine deficiency.

CD005253,0,24629859,0,Fetal thyroïdology.,"Advances in prenatal imaging techniques and in fetal hormonology now allow for identification of disorders of thyroid function in the fetus. These can potentially be treated in utero by giving drugs to the mother. This review shows the feasibility of in utero treatment of fetal thyroid disorders, either indirectly by treating the mother or by giving the necessary drugs directly to the fetus. For goitrous fetal hypothyroidism leading to hydramnios, repeated intra-amniotic injections of thyroxine have been reported to decrease the size of the fetal thyroid. Experience with such procedures is limited but positive. The risk that direct in utero treatment of the fetus may provoke premature labor or cause infection should be carefully evaluated. In women with Graves' disease, autoimmune fetal hyperthyroidism can generally be treated in a noninvasive way by optimizing treatment of the mother, such as by increasing the dose of antithyroid drugs. Follow-up of the efficacy and the possible long-term consequences of medical interventions to normalize thyroid function of the fetus are of great importance. Specialized care of the fetus should be provided by skilled teams with extensive experience in prenatal care."

We aimed to explore the possibility of detecting key synaptic proteins in the CSF, in particular dopaminergic and gabaergic, as new procedures that could be useful for both pathophysiological and diagnostic purposes in investigation of inherited disorders of neurotransmission. Dopamine receptor type 2 (D2R), dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) were analysed in CSF samples from 30 healthy controls (11 days to 17 years) by western blot analysis. Because VMAT2 was the only protein with intracellular localisation, and in order to compare results, GABA vesicular transporter, which is another intracellular protein, was also studied. Spearman's correlation and Student's t tests were applied to compare optical density signals between different proteins. All these synaptic proteins could be easily detected and quantified in the CSF. DAT, D2R and GABA VT expression decrease with age, particularly in the first months of life, reflecting the expected intense synaptic activity and neuronal circuitry formation. A statistically significant relationship was found between D2R and DAT expression, reinforcing the previous evidence of DAT regulation by D2R. To our knowledge, there are no previous studies on human CSF reporting a reliable analysis of these proteins. These kinds of studies could help elucidate new causes of disturbed dopaminergic and gabaergic transmission as well as understanding different responses to L-dopa in inherited disorders affecting dopamine metabolism. Moreover, this approach to synaptic activity in vivo can be extended to different groups of proteins and diseases."

CD005253,0,15627725,0,Effect of administration of recombinant human leptin during the neonatal period on the plasma concentration and gene expression of leptin in the piglet.,"Leptin is produced predominantly by white adipocytes and in adults it regulates both appetite and energy expenditure but its role in the neonate remains to be fully established. The aim of this, the first study of leptin administration to Meishan piglets, was to examine the effects of chronic leptin administration to neonatal pigs on their endocrine profile, growth and development. Six Meishan sows gave birth normally at term and 6 pairs of siblings (n = 12), matched by birth weight and gender (male, n = 6; female, n = 6) were randomly allocated to leptin (L: n = 6) or placebo (P: n = 6) administration groups. Piglets remained with their mother throughout the study and from day 3 to 8 of neonatal life each pig received either 4 microg ml(-1) kg(-1) body weight recombinant human leptin or a saline placebo. Plasma concentrations of key hormones and metabolites were determined in conjunction with messenger RNA (mRNA) for leptin, which was assessed by PCR. Recombinant leptin treatment improved growth performance and promoted skeletal growth in favour of adipose tissue accretion. Circulating plasma leptin concentrations were higher on days 4 and 7 in L pigs. Leptin administration altered the endocrine profile of the neonatal pig, although these changes were not maintained. There were no relationships between plasma leptin and body weight or mRNA leptin abundance, irrespective of treatment. Chronic leptin administration appeared to have a beneficial influence on growth rate and body conformation, which may in part be attributed to alterations in metabolism and nutrient partitioning."

Studies with a specific beta 2-antagonist, IPS 339, indicated that 72% of receptors present were of the beta 2-subtype. Quantitative studies of beta-receptor concentrations in myometrium from women at term indicated no change in receptor concentration during labor. Similarly, there was no difference in beta-receptor concentration in myometrium from women in labor or before labor between 28 and 34 weeks of gestation. Concentrations of the beta-receptor were not different at any stage of gestation assayed. Isoproterenol competition for iodocyanopindolol binding was used to examine efficacy of receptor agonist interactions in myometrium from women at term, in labor, or before labor and from women in preterm labor. There was no difference in high-affinity binding, an index of efficacy, in any of the groups examined."
CD005253,0,8740299,0,Sustained attention problems in children with early treated congenital hypothyroidism.,"Sustained attention was studied in 48 children with early treated congenital hypothyroidism and 35 healthy controls, using a computer-paced and a self-paced continuous performance task. The performance of the patients, particularly those in the low T4 group (38 patients with T4 levels < 50 nmol/l at neonatal screening), declined in the final stage of the computer-paced task, suggesting a problem in remaining attentive over time. The performance of all children declined in the first and improved in the final stage of the self-paced task. This pattern was most pronounced in the low T4 group, reflecting greater variability in their task performance over time, again indicating a problem in sustaining attention. No correlation was found between onset of treatment and sustained attention. The small size of the intermediate T4 group (10 patients with T4 levels > or = 50 nmol/l at neonatal screening) made the results more difficult to interpret and may have concealed a problem with sustained attention in this group."

Because a high titer of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody was noted in maternal serum and the fetal goiter was detected on ultrasonography, fetal hyperthyroidism was strongly suspected and subsequently confirmed with cordocentesis at 31 weeks gestation. After treatment of fetal hyperthyroidism through oral maternal administration of methimazole (MMI) starting at 33 weeks gestation, fetal heart rate and amniotic fluid volume returned to normal ranges. Complete resolution of the fetal goiter was observed at 35 weeks gestation. A male infant was born at 35 weeks 6 days gestation via cesarean section in the absence of thyrotoxic findings; however, cord blood chemical analysis at birth indicated iatrogenic fetal hypothyroidism.

This decrease in T3 was significantly (P less than 0-001) more pronounced in kwashiorkor of recent onset than in long-term P.C.M., a finding which suggests that impaired thyroxine (T4) monodeiodination in the liver was responsible for the fall in serum-T3 concentration rather than a reduction in the secretion of T3 by the thyroid. Serum-T3 concentrations became normal in both malnourished groups after two weeks of appropriate nutrition. Serum-T3 concentrations in healthy, euthyroid, Senegalese children were higher than in White children. In frank kwashiorkor in Senegalese children, serum-thyroid-stimulating-hormone (T.S.H.) concentrations were within the normal range throughout the entire course of dietary therapy, indicating that the children remained euthyroid. In contrast, protracted P.C.M. led to impairment of the T.S.H./T3 feedback mechanism and to a condition resembling hypophysectomy, which required two weeks' dietary therapy for its correction."

The parenchymal iodine maps generated by DECT are well correlated with scintigraphy, and are becoming an essential tool for evaluating patients with pulmonary vascular diseases. With a single DECT acquisition, complete imaging of pulmonary hypertension is now available, displaying vascular anatomy, parenchymal morphology and functional assessment. Triangular pulmonary perfusion defects in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension may be clearly analysed even in the presence of distal arterial occlusion. Perfusion heterogeneities seen in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension reflect mosaic perfusion and may be helpful for the diagnosis, severity assessment and prognosis of the disease. Vascular or parenchymal abnormalities can also be analysed with perfusion defects to determine their aetiology. Pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart disease can be assessed with a single DECT, even in the neonatal population. Furthermore, new applications are emerging with ventilation imaging or myocardial perfusion imaging obtained by DECT and should be considered. In conclusion, DECT of the thorax enables the simultaneous and noninvasive assessment of vascular anatomy, parenchymal morphology and functional pulmonary imaging in various groups of PH."

The infants were given either a fixed dose of thyroxine (8 microg/kg birthweight/day) or placebo for the first 6 weeks of life. This paper evaluates the effect of thyroxine administration on behavioural outcome at the age of 2 years. More externalizing, especially destructive, behaviours were found in the group given thyroxine than in the placebo group. This difference was more pronounced in boys and in children born after 27 weeks' gestation. The thyroxine-treated children with behavioural problems had lower plasma-free thyroxine levels than the thyroxine-treated children without behavioural problems. This finding suggests that the presence of more behavioural problems in the group given thyroxine was not an immediate consequence of the treatment."

Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS software. Whole group, first trimester, second trimester and third trimester urinary iodine concentrations (mean+/-SD) in pregnant women were 1.13+/-0.81, 1.08+/-0.71, 0.86+/-0.58 and 1.27+/-0.87 micromol/L, respectively. The urinary iodine concentration significantly increased with gestational age (p<0.05). We found that our study group was mildly iodine-deficient according to WHO criteria. Furthermore, the pregnant women were found to be mildly iodine-deficient in the first and third trimesters and moderately so in the second trimester. The only statistical difference was between second and third trimester values (p<0.05). Even though the increased iodine deficiency in the second trimester is not useful for early detection of iodine deficiency in pregnancy, the severity of this deficiency in the second trimester may lead to important effects on thyroid metabolism for both mother and fetus. Our study suggests that the iodine excretion of pregnant women living in iodine-deficient areas could be assessed using this fast and automated method."
CD005253,0,3597705,0,"Thymulin deficiency and low 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine syndrome in infants with low birth weight syndromes.","Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that thymic endocrine function is under neuroendocrine control. Recently, a positive correlation was found between plasma thymulin (a major endocrine product of thymus) and serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Low serum thyroid hormone concentrations are frequently found in premature newborn infants. In this study we measured plasma thymulin by bioassay and serum T3 and T4 in a series of healthy fullterm newborns and in premature infants with various disorders. The study subjects were 26 healthy fullterm infants, 23 fullterm small for gestational age infants, 30 preterm appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants, 22 preterm small for gestational age infants and 30 infants with respiratory distress syndrome, of whom 15 were fullterm and 15 were preterm AGA. Blood samples were obtained 3, 5, 10, 20, and 40 days after delivery. In the healthy fullterm infants plasma thymulin concentrations were low during the first days of life and subsequently increased, reaching normal values for children aged 1-12 months by the 10th day after birth. Persistently low plasma thymulin and serum T3 levels were found in the majority of infants with pathological conditions; the lowest values for both hormones were found in infants with respiratory distress syndrome. A highly significant positive correlation was present in all groups between mean plasma thymulin and serum T3, but not T4. Short term T3 administration in 6 additional preterm AGA infants caused a significant increase in plasma thymulin titers compared to those in 6 untreated infants. We conclude that plasma thymulin is decreased in premature newborns with the low T3 syndrome and that this abnormality may be reversed by administration of T3. These findings indicate that thymic endocrine activity is modulated by thyroid function in early postnatal life."

CD005253,0,20715770,0,"Perchlorate and iodide in whole blood samples from infants, children, and adults in Nanchang, China.","Perchlorate, ClO(4)(-), interferes with iodide (I(-)) uptake by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) and thereby affects thyroid hormone production in the body. Studies have reported human exposures to perchlorate based on measurements in urine, but little is known about the levels in blood. In this study, we determined concentrations of perchlorate, iodide, and other anions (e.g., chlorate [ClO(3)(-)], bromate [BrO(3)(-)], bromide [Br(-)]) in 131 whole blood samples collected from Chinese donors aged 0.4 to 90 yr, in Nanchang, China. Perchlorate, iodide, and bromide were detected in all of the samples analyzed, whereas chlorate was found in only 27% of the samples and bromate was found in only 2%. The mean (range) concentrations of perchlorate, iodide, and bromide were 2.68 (0.51-10.5), 42.6 (1.58-812), and 2120 (1050-4850) ng/mL, respectively. Perchlorate levels in blood from Nanchang adults were 10-fold greater than levels that have been previously reported for U.S. adults. The iodide/perchlorate molar ratio ranged from 3.05 to 15.3 for all age groups, and the ratio increased with age (r = 0.732, p < 0.01). Perchlorate and bromide concentrations decreased significantly with age, whereas iodide concentrations increased with age. No significant gender-related differences in blood perchlorate, iodide, or bromide levels were found. A significant negative correlation was found between the concentrations of perchlorate and iodide in blood. Exposure doses of perchlorate were estimated for infants, toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults based on the measured concentrations in blood, using a simple pharmacokinetic model. The mean exposure doses of perchlorate for our age groups ranged from 1.12 (adults) to 2.22 μg/kg bw/day (infants), values higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) reference dose (RfD: 0.7 μg/kg bw/day). This is the first study on perchlorate and iodide levels in whole blood from infants, toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults from a city in China with known high perchlorate levels."

CD005253,0,3012027,0,Impact of radiocontaminants in commercially available iodine-123: dosimetric evaluation.,"Iodine-123 (123I) is considered by some to be the radionuclide of choice for thyroid scintigraphy because of its ideal physical and biological characteristics and low radiation absorbed dose to the thyroid. However, commercially available 123I (p,2n) and (p,5n) have radiocontaminants. The MIRD formalism was used to estimate the absorbed dose to the thyroid for various age groups receiving recommended administered activities at the time of delivery and at two half-lives assuming radiocontamination levels specified by the suppliers. The calculations demonstrate that an 131I uptake with a technetium-99m scan at the time of delivery results in less absorbed dose to the thyroid than an 123I (p,2n) scan and uptake. At two half-lives the absorbed dose triples and becomes equivalent to the dose from an 131I scan. The absorbed dose from an 123I (p,5n) scan at two half-lives is higher than that of an 123I (p,2n) scan at the time of delivery. Iodine-123 capsules should not be decayed down in order to obtain a recommended pediatric administered activity. There appears to be no dosimetric advantage of commercially available 123I for thyroid scintigraphy for adults or most children."
CD005253,0,18717247,0,Congenital nephrotic syndrome and persistent hypothyroidism after bilateral nephrectomy.,"Congenital nephrotic syndrome is commonly associated with hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone supplementation is recommended as standard of care. The hypothyroidism is postulated to occur secondary to chronic massive proteinuria with loss of thyroid binding globulin, thyroid hormone and iodine. Previous reports have indicated that thyroxin may be discontinued following bilateral nephrectomy. We report our experience with one child with congenital nephrotic syndrome, Finnish type, and hypothyroidism who had a high requirement for thyroxin (100-150 microg/d) from infancy to 4 years of age. Hypothyroidism persisted despite bilateral nephrectomy and later following renal transplantation. However, his thyroxin requirement is now substantially lower (62.5 microg/d) at age 14 years. No goiter was detected clinically and antithyroid antibodies were negative. Thyroid ultrasound and 123I scan revealed a thyroid gland in the anatomically normal location. 123I uptake was elevated, 18% at 6 hours and 51% at 24 hours (normal values: 3-16% at 6 hours and 8-25% at 24 hours). Perchlorate was unavailable for a perchlorate washout study. We speculate that this patient may have an intrinsic problem with thyroid hormone synthesis. It is unclear whether this is related or coincidental to the Finnish nephrotic syndrome. We recommend following thyroid functions closely if thyroxin is discontinued following bilateral nephrectomies in Finnish type congenital nephrotic syndrome."

Their age ranged from 3 to 8 weeks. One of these patients had familiar dyshormonogenesis, 21 had ectopic glands and one hemiagenesis. As a control group, we studied 46 sex- and age-matched healthy newborns. Before the beginning of therapy, the hypothyroid patients showed higher values of calcium (2.78 +/- 0.04 vs 2.65 +/- 0.07 mmol/l; p < 0.05) and of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D (159.7 +/- 31.6 vs 90.5 +/- 33.1 ng/l; p < 0.01), while they showed lower values of osteocalcin (1.9 +/- 0.8 vs 2.9 +/- 0.9 ng/ml; p < 0.01) than controls. After 3 months of therapy, we found a complete normalization of all these parameters and a progressive increase of osteocalcin. Our data show that in congenital hypothyroid children there are abnormalities in calcium metabolism which seem to be transient and reversible after L-thyroxine replacement therapy."

CD005253,0,9734700,0,Stability and distribution of orally administered epidermal growth factor in neonatal pigs.,"Stability and distribution of orally administered epidermal growth factor (EGF) were examined in newborn and 5-day-old pigs. Forty-five minutes after oral administration of iodine-125 labeled EGF, 60 and 50% of the radioactivity administered were recovered from the internal organs in newborn and 5-day-old pigs, respectively. In both age groups, over 95% of the recovered radioactivity was found in the gastrointestinal tract, of which 78-86% was found in the luminal contents with the remaining found in the gastrointestinal wall. Within the gastrointestinal tract, 65-71% of radioactivity was found in the stomach, 27-30% in the proximal and mid small intestine and 3-4% was found in the distal part of the small intestine. There were no significant differences in the overall distribution of orally administered radioactivity between two age groups. Based on liquid chromatography and trichloroacetic acid precipitation, a substantial amount of EGF recovered from the luminal contents (63-86%) and the gastrointestinal wall (42-81%) remained ""intact"". The receptor binding ability of the EGF recovered from the gastric contents was 96-102% comparable to the native EGF tracer. The receptor binding ability remained high (40-58%) in the proximal small intestinal lumen and it decreased to 15% in the distal small intestinal lumen in newborn pigs. In 5-day-old pigs, EGF recovered from the small intestinal contents had 5 to 24% receptor binding ability when compared with native EGF tracer. The receptor binding ability of the EGF recovered from all other organs was below 5% with an exception of the gastric wall, from which recovered EGF retained 9 to 26% receptor binding ability. These results indicate that most of orally ingested EGF remained in the gastrointestinal tract in neonatal pigs 45 min after oral ingestion, and significant amount of the ingested EGF remained biologically active. It suggests that milk-borne EGF can survive in the gastrointestinal tract and may play a role in regulating gut development in neonatal animals."
CD005253,0,19057795,0,"[Interactions between brain, psyche and thyroid].","Interactions between brain, psyche and thyroid are known from historical descriptions of thyroidectomy (Kocher) and hyperthyroidism. However, their importance is often underscored in clinical routine. Thyroid hormone deficiency during pregnancy may result in irreversible mental retardation and requires levothyroxine substitution. TSH screening after delivery must identify newborns with congenital hypothyroidism: An early levothyroxine substitution and long term therapy control are required. Hypothyroidism and depression have many symptoms in common. Cognitive deficits and depressive states are often found in overt hypothyroidism, psychotic derangements are rare. Levothyroxine improves hypothyroid symptoms and mental performance, mood and motivation. Psychic symptoms of hyperthyroidism include agitation, irritability, mood disturbances, hyperactivity, anxiousness and even panic attacks. Manic and delusional states are rare. In geriatric patients hyperthyroidism may be oligosymptomatic. In psychiatric patients more frequent but unspecific disturbances of thyroid laboratory values being reversible without specific therapy have to be distinguished from rather rare but causative organic thyroid diseases with therapeutic consequences. Some psychiatric drugs influence thyroid laboratory results. Hypothyroidism in depressive patients is a negative prognostic parameter and requires therapy. Psychiatric symptoms associated with hypothyroidism are usually reversible under levothyroxine within 4-8 weeks. The standard for hypothyroidism is mono-levothyroxine therapy."
CD005253,0,11231999,0,Relationship of etiology to treatment in congenital hypothyroidism.,"We examined the patterns of TSH, T(4), and treatment schedules from diagnosis to 4 yr of age in 125 children (50 males anf 75 females) with congenital hypothyroidism (CH). Subjects were divided into 3 groups based on their thyroid scans: 1) athyreosis (n = 31), 2) dysgenesis (n = 54; 49 lingual and 5 hypoplastic), and 3) dyshormonogenesis (n = 40). Follow-up evaluation was carried out at 2-4 wk and 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months of age. Median gestational age, age at onset of therapy, and starting L-T(4) dose were similar in the three groups. In infants with athyreosis median screening TSH levels were higher (P < 0.02) and confirmatory T(4) levels were lower than in the other two groups (P < 0.01 vs. dysgenetic; P < 0.05 vs. dyshormonogenetic CH). During the first 6 months of therapy, mean TSH levels were highest in the athyrotic group, intermediate in the dysgenetic group, and lowest in the dyshormonogenetic group. In children with athyreosis, TSH levels normalized by 12 months of age. At 12 months dysgenetic patients had the highest TSH levels (P < 0.05). During the entire study period, TSH levels were lowest in patients with dyshormonogenesis (except at 48 months) and normalized earlier. Mean T(4) levels normalized by 2-4 weeks in all groups. At 3 and 6 months, the percentage of patients who required dose changes was highest in the athyrotic group, and at 12 months it was highest in the dysgenetic group. The athyrotic group received the highest dose of L-T(4), and dyshormonogenetic group received the lowest dose. We conclude that treatment and follow-up schedules for CH may differ in the three etiological categories based on the different hormonal patterns and responses to therapy. Children with athyreosis need close monitoring particularly early in life, whereas those with dysgenesis and dyshormonogenesis require more attention later in life."

The outcome of children with persistent hyperthyrotropinaemia is uncertain. The study objective was to evaluate the outcome of children with the persistent form of hyperthyrotropinaemia. We carried out a retrospective analysis on children who attended one institution over the last 20 years with this diagnosis. Eight children were diagnosed with hyperthyrotropinaemia lasting more than 3 months in total. Four had a transient form lasting between 3 and 18 months in total. Three continue to have persistently raised TSH at 5, 9 and 17 years, respectively. One patient became biochemically hypothyroid at 1 year of age requiring treatment with replacement thyroxine. All of our group had normal growth and development. We recommend that thyroid function monitoring should continue in all children with hyperthyrotropinaemia until the thyroid function tests have normalised."
CD005253,0,19711739,0,[Diagnostic and therapeutic problems in thyrotoxic crisis in pregnant women. Influence of treatment on life and health of fetus and infant].,"Thyrotoxic crisis during pregnancy is a rare condition, but because of the danger it poses for the mother and fetus, every physician should be able to diagnose and treat it. When not recognized or incorrect treated hyperthyroidism, which is not easy to diagnose during pregnancy, is usually the basis for thyrotoxic storm. Serious conditions such as Graves' disease or multinodular goiter have to be distinguished from transient hyperthyroidism. Symptoms, such as: heat intolerance, hyperexia, emesis, tachycardia, increased pulse pressure and emotional liability should be considered cautiously because they are characteristic both for hyperthyroidism and for pregnancy. Interpretation of laboratory results need to take physiological changes during pregnancy into account--during the first trimester a low TSH serum concentration should be expected, whereas in the third trimester the free thyroxine (fT4) concentration decreases. Some conditions characteristic for pregnancy may be causative for thyrotoxic crisis: preeclampsia, placenta previa, labour induction, labour and cessarian section. Usually a hypermetabolic state has a characteristic, severe course but the possibility of monosystemic presentation must be kept in mind, because it is difficult to diagnose. Management of thyrotoxic crisis includes specific (thyrostatic agents, iodine preparations, adrenolytics, plasmaferesis) and supportive treatment. Thyrostatic agents (thiamazole and propylthiouracyl) can cross the placental barrier and similarly to iodine preparations can interfere with the pituitary-thyroid axis of the fetus. Additionally, thiamazole may cause specific embryopathy and should be considered as a second-line treatment. Adrenolytics affect the placental and uterine functions, and in high doses causes newborn hypoglycemia and bradycardia. A surgical approach is linked to an increased rate of preterm labour and miscarriage, but long-term effects are good."

CD005253,0,3257052,0,"Hyperiodothyroninaemia of neonates, its significance for thermogenesis.","Danowski et al. (1951) were probably the first who showed an increase of PBI in infants shortly after birth. Later a number of investigators presented further evidence on the increased thyroid gland function in newborns. This condition named ""neonatal thyroid hyperactivity"" [Fisher and Oddie, 1964] was described also in animals. The available data indicate that all the newborn mammals till now studied, independently of the maturation stage of development they reach at birth, display some features of thyroid hyperactivity, but in some it does not lead to hyperiodothyroninaemia. Interspecies differences coincide well with significance of the thyroid hormones for neonatal thermogenesis. There are few sequential studies of the three principal iodothyronines: T4, T3 and rT3 available at present. The most comprehensive data concern infants, newborn lambs and pigs. Immediately after birth, there is a sudden rise in serum thyroid hormone concentrations, with some species differences related to the degree of the increase and to the iodothyronines involved. The course of the postnatal hyperiodothyroninaemia is dependent on the maturation level reached at birth, food intake, and cooling relative to extrauterine environment. At least five main factors contribute to the immediate postnatal hyperiodothyroninaemia: 1) abrupt depletion of the preformed fetal hormonal iodine stores; 2) preferential T3 secretion; 3) increase in the T4 to T3 monodeiodination in the peripheral tissues; 4) a release of thyroid hormone content from peripheral reservoirs to plasma, and 5) action of other hormone(s) concomitantly released at birth. From the point of view of the thermal adaptability, the newborn mammals fall into two distinct groups: first, in which immediately after birth the metabolic rate decreases, and second, in which the metabolic rate increases, after cooling. Our understanding of the role and significance of hormonal factors involved in mechanisms of the postnatal thermogenesis is incomplete. However, some similarities in adaptation to cold in adults and in newborns seem to be relevant. Cold adaptation is accomplished by development of nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) depending on NA. The presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is essential for NA thermogenic action. According to the common opinion, based on data from laboratory animals and human baby, non-shivering thermogenesis, but not shivering, predominates in newborns. However, data from domestic animals indicate that shivering thermogenesis may be of comparable or greater thermogenic capacity than NST at birth. Besides, there are some newborns which have little or no BAT and associated NST.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD005253,0,19453201,0,Lithium: updated human knowledge using an evidence-based approach: part III: clinical safety.,"Lithium use in mental diseases has changed over the years but remains a cornerstone of treatment in bipolar disorders. In two companion papers, we have reviewed existing (and especially recent) data on lithium efficacy and updated basic knowledge regarding the practical fundamentals of lithium therapy. The present paper reviews safety data on lithium available to date. Gastrointestinal pain or discomfort, diarrhoea, tremor, polyuria, nocturnal urination, weight gain, oedema, flattening of affect and exacerbation of psoriasis are typical complaints of patients receiving long-term lithium therapy. Renal involvement results in a reduced urinary concentrating capacity, expressed as obligate polyuria, with secondary thirst. With long-term therapy, this may result in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In addition, glomerular filtration rate falls slightly in about 20% of patients. The view that only a few patients receiving long-term lithium are at increased risk of glomerular impairment and progressive renal insufficiency should be regarded with caution. The risk is increased in case of concomitant diseases or medications. Lithium treatment may inhibit thyroid hormone release and induce goitre. Consequently, the prevalence of both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism is increased, with circulating thyroid auto-antibodies frequently being found. Much less commonly, thyrotoxicosis may also develop in association with lithium therapy. Long-term lithium treatment may also be associated with persistent hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia, as well as with hypermagnesaemia. Overweight of up to 4-10 kg is found in approximately 30% of lithium-treated patients. Most neurological manifestations are benign, for example, the fine postural and/or action tremor present in 4-20% of patients. This is increased by high caffeine consumption and concomitant use of other psychotropic agents. A number of rare, potentially serious neurological adverse effects have been reported, including extrapyramidal symptoms, 'pseudotumour cerebri' or occasionally cerebellar symptoms. Severe neurological sequelae are exceptional. Cognitive disturbances are often mentioned as a lithium-related adverse effect. The few controlled studies do show a statistically significant negative effect of lithium on memory, vigilance, reaction time and tracking. There are frequent reports of mild effects of lithium on cognition at therapeutic serum concentrations. A number of deaths associated with lithium treatment have been reported. The most serious issue is that of non-accidental overdose, i.e. either long-term overdosage or acute overdose on long-term treatment. Progressive renal insufficiency, an exceptional complication of long-term lithium therapy, may also have a fatal outcome. In relation to pregnancy, lithium salts are rated as category D (positive evidence of risk). Therefore, prescription of lithium should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother exceeds the risk to the fetus. Although lithium transfer into breast milk is well established, the long-term fate of babies breast-fed by mothers receiving lithium therapy is unknown. Whether lithium therapy is safe in breast-feeding women is controversial. Although there is no absolute contraindication, it is known that the kidney is particularly sensitive to lithium just after birth. Intoxication in patients on long-term treatment with lithium in the absence of history of acute ingestion is not rare. Contributing factors include change in daily dose, long-term high dosage, kidney disease or drug interaction. In suspected cases, serum concentrations should be obtained early and repeatedly. In addition to supportive measures, haemodialysis is the treatment of choice for severe cases. Thorough knowledge of the limitations and drawbacks of lithium therapy is mandatory for its optimal use, especially at a time when its risk/benefit profile needs to be compared accurately with that of antiepileptic drugs and other mood stabilizing medications."

CD005253,0,11518756,0,Localization of bilirubin in phospholipid bilayers by parallax analysis of fluorescence quenching.,"It has been proposed that the neurotoxicity observed in severely jaundiced infants results from the binding of unconjugated bilirubin to nerve cell membranes. However, despite potentially important clinical ramifications, there remains significant controversy regarding the physical nature of bilirubin-membrane interactions. We used the technique of parallax analysis of fluorescence quenching (Chattopadhyay, A., and E. London. 1987. Biochemistry. 26: 39;-45) to measure the depth of penetration of bilirubin in model phospholipid bilayers. The localization of unconjugated bilirubin and ditaurobilirubin within small unilamellar vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine was determined through an analysis of the quenching of bilirubin fluorescence by spin-labeled phospholipids, and by bilirubin-mediated quenching of a series of anthroyloxy fatty acid probes at various depths within the membrane bilayer. Findings were further verified with potassium iodide as an aqueous quencher. Our results indicate that, at pH 10, unconjugated bilirubin localizes approximately 20 A from the bilayer center, in the region of the polar head groups. Further analyses suggest a modest influence of pH, membrane cholesterol content, and vesicle diameter on the bilirubin penetration depth. Taken together, these data support that, under physiologic conditions, bilirubin localizes to the polar region of phospholipid bilayers, near the membrane-water interface."

Between April and October 2002, a total of 67 neonates were randomly recruited into the study and were divided into four groups as: those with highly probable sepsis (group 1), probable sepsis (group 2), possible sepsis (group 3), and no sepsis (group 4; controls). When the initial procalcitonin levels of the groups were compared, the results were statistically significant (p < 0.05) except for the comparison between groups 3 and 4 (p > 0.05). When the initial CRP levels were compared between the groups, the levels measured in groups 1 and 2 were significantly higher than the levels measured in groups 3 and 4 (p < 0.05). In addition, the decreasing levels in procalcitonin were statistically more significant than the decreasing levels in CRP in showing the response to antibiotic treatment (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, serum procalcitonin levels seemed to be superior to serum CRP levels in terms of early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, in detecting the severity of the illness, and in evaluation of the response to antibiotic treatment."

In addition, exogenous levothyroxine cannot be distinguished from the endogenously produced hormone. Since 2004, generic formulations have been approved for the most frequently prescribed brands of levothyroxine sodium. This review examines the methodology and statistical acceptance criteria and summarizes findings of a previously published relative bioavailability study that brings into question the use of standard criteria to assess bioequivalence of levothyroxine sodium. The key findings reviewed were the following: (1) in the absence of baseline correction for endogenous T4 levels, products that differed by as much as 25% to 33% would be declared bioequivalent; (2) the use of baseline correction reduced the likelihood of declaring products bioequivalent when they actually differed by 25% to 33%; (3) even with baseline correction, products that differed by 12.5% would be declared bioequivalent; and (4) there was evidence of significant carryover from one dosing period to the next even with washout periods of up to 53 days. In conclusion, the current recommended methodology in the United States to assess bioequivalence for levothyroxine sodium products is inadequate to differentiate products that differ by 12.5%, a clinically relevant difference. Recommendations are made for modifications to the criteria that could improve the likelihood that products that differ by a clinically significant amount in their bioavailability would not be accepted as bioequivalent."
CD005253,0,6493849,0,Prenatal thyroid function abnormalities in infants with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome.,"Thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations were measured on cord sera of 21 preterm infants with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and were compared to the values obtained from 15 healthy preterm infants. When log T3, log T4, and log TSH were considered as the dependent variables in the multivariate test Hotelling-Lawley-Trace, there was an overall difference between the two groups: F = 3.94, p = 0.03. When log T3 and log T4 were considered separately in an analysis of covariance, there was a significant difference between the two groups for log T3 after adjusting for birth weight and gestational age (F = 7.98, p = 0.008). However, for log T4 and TSH, there was no difference between the IRDS and control infants. These findings exclude the possibility of antenatal thyroid dysfunction in babies with IRDS. An explanation for reduced cord blood T3 concentration in infants with IRDS is lacking at present. Extrathyroidal factors that predispose to IRDS may also affect peripheral T3 generation. Alternatively, one might postulate that there is relative immaturity of both peripheral T3 generating pathway and lung development in infants who develop IRDS."
CD005253,0,8577088,0,"Classification of congenital hypothyroidism based on scintigraphy, ultrasonography and the serum thyroglobulin level.","In the present study, infants with congenital hypothyroidism discovered on neonatal mass screening were examined in order to clarify the pathogenesis by means of I-123 or Tc-99m scintigraphy, with and without thyroid ultrasonography and serum thyroglobulin measurement. The patients were divided into two groups: sixteen neonates with hypothyroidism discovered in a neonatal mass screening program performed between 1985 and 1992 (group A), and eleven neonates discovered between 1992 and 1994 (group B). In group A, only I-123 scintigraphy was performed to determine the pathogenesis. Group B was subjected to Tc-99m scintigraphy, thyroid ultrasonography and serum thyroglobulin measurement. The pathogenesis of thirteen patients with congenital hypothyroidism in group A (1985-1992) were as follows; seven patients were diagnosed as having dysorganogenesis, consisting of six with ectopic glands and one with agenesis of the thyroid gland. Six patients were diagnosed as having dyshormonogenesis. All three patients with transient hypothyroidism were diagnosed as having transient dyshormonogenesis. The pathogenesis of eight patients with congenital hypothyroidism in group B (1992-1994) were as follows; one patient of dysorganogenesis with ectopic gland and seven patients of dyshormonogenesis consisting of one patient with iodine transport defect, one patient with iodine transport defect combined with ectopic gland, one patient with dyshormonogenesis combined with dysorganogenesis and four patients with only dyshormonogenesis. All of three patients with transient hypothyroidisms were diagnosed as transient dyshormonogenesis. These results suggest that the examination of thyroid scintigraphy and ultrasonography as well as serum thyroglobulin measurement are useful to clarify the etiology and pathogenesis of congenital hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,8787954,0,Prognostic factors in the intellectual development at 7 years of age in children with congenital hypothyroidism.,"The influence of the initial L-T4 dose and some other factors on the intellectual development was evaluated at 7 years of age in 47 congenitally hypothyroid children detected by the regional screening program. All patients were initially treated with 25 micrograms LT4/kg/day that represented a mean replacement dose of 6.8 +/- 1.3 micrograms/kg. Despite the ""low"" initial dose mean IQ at 7 years resulted within normal range (96 +/- 9). Twenty-eight patients initially treated with 6.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms L-T4/kg/day had a mean IQ (96 +/- 9) which was not different with respect to 19 patients (IQ 94 +/- 7) treated with a significantly higher L-T4 dose (8.1 +/- 0.9 micrograms/kg/day; p < 0.0001). The initial L-T4, dose did not correlate with IQ at 7 years whereas a significant correlation was found between IQ and serum T4 concentration at diagnosis (r = 0.35; p < 0.01) regardless of the fact that serum T4 concentration normalized after the first 2 months of therapy in both groups. Twenty-three patients whose serum T4 at diagnosis was < 2 micrograms/dl (1.0 +/- 0.5) had a mean IQ at 7 years (92 +/- 9) which was significantly lower than the 24 patients (IQ 98 +/- 7; p < 0.02) whose serum T4 was > 2 micrograms/dl (5.7 +/- 2.4; p < 0.001). The present findings suggest that the severity of neonatal hypothyroidism is an important factor in determining subsequent intellectual development of congenitally hypothyroid children."

Report of a case and review.,"Detailed endocrinological studies were performed during and after the eighth pregnancy of a 38-year-old woman who had eight spontaneous pregnancies after the onset of hypopituitarism secondary to massive postpartum hemorrhage. Hormonal replacement therapy was not provided during seven pregnancies and all terminated in spontaneous abortions. Studies of pituitary function during and after the eighth pregnancy demonstrated that the patient had measurable amounts of growth hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyrotropin (TSH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and prolactin in her plasma under basal conditions but that these hormones did not increase approximately in response to pregnancy, stress, and specific stimuli. Evaluation of placental function at 26 weeks gestation by measurement of estradiol, progesterone, human placental lactogen, and chorionic gonadotropin revealed no abnormality. Hormone replacement therapy during the eighth pregnancy was associated with the delivery of normal premature infant at 32 weeks gestation. In addition to these studies, a critical review of the literature was undertaken to more clearly define the clinical and laboratory features of pregnancy in Sheehan's syndrome."

CD005253,0,807972,0,Radioimmunoassay and the hormones of thyroid function.,"Radioimmunoassay (RIA) has provided the tools for wide-reaching investigations that have changed and continue to change many important concepts of thyroid physiology and pathosphysiology. The RIA vor human thyrotropin (TSH) was developed in 1965; development of the RIA for triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), and, recently, thyrothropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroglobulin (Tg) followed. The capacity to measure nanogram and picogram concentrations with relative ease and speed has permitted the demonstration of dynamic relationships of the intrathyroidal and circulating thyroid hormones to each other and to the pituitary and hypothalamic regulating hormones. Evidence for the presence of cross-influences between TRH and other hypothalamic regulating hormones on the secretion of pituitary hormones has accumulated. The impact of the new information on clinical practice is now becoming evident. There is new appreciation of the value of assaying serum T3 and TSH concentrations in the clinical management of patients with disturbed function of the thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamus. The necessary components for RIA performance can be purchansed separately or in kit form from commercial sources. With appropriate quality-control procedures, precise, sensitive, and reliable data can be generated. Awareness of the specific technical problems relating to the RIA of these hormones is absolutely necessary to assure reliable results. The availability of kits or their components permits the performance of these studies in the community hospital and in reliable commercial-service laboratories."

Fourteen term infants with slightly abnormal newborn screening results (thyroxine <10th percentile, thyroid stimulating hormone ¿TSH <40 microU/mL) were identified. The subsequent serum confirmatory TSH results of 12 subjects were modestly elevated (5.3 to 18.8 microU/mL, normal 0.6 to 4.6), whereas 2 subjects who had borderline confirmatory TSH (4.6 and 4.7 microU/mL) had abnormal TSH responses to thyrotropin releasing hormone testing. After 3 years of therapy, levothyroxine was discontinued in 13 patients, and repeat thyroid function tests were obtained 1 month later. Levothyroxine was not discontinued in one patient because he had an elevated random TSH (10 microU/mL) while receiving therapy. At 3 years of age, 13 patients had persistently abnormal thyroid function tests (TSH >4.6 microU/mL or a thyroid releasing hormone test result consistent with primary hypothyroidism), and levothyroxine was reinitiated. Only one patient had normal thyroid function studies. Although prospective studies are still lacking, we recommend levothyroxine replacement in newborns with borderline hypothyroidism."

CD005253,0,9403264,0,Povidone-iodine liposomes--an overview.,"In recent years, liposomes have been increasingly explored as novel drug delivery systems, and several liposome-based drug products have been approved in Europe, the USA and Japan. Depending on size, composition and surface characteristics, liposomes interact specifically with biological structures. Liposomal drug products provide a topical activity at the desired locus of action and are deemed more effective and less toxic than conventional drug formulations. The combination of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) and liposomes unites the exceptional microbicidal activity of the antiseptic substance with the excellent tolerability and lack of immunogenicity of liposomes; in addition, liposomes provide a moist molecular film for the wound environment. The multilamellar vesicles act as microreservoirs hence prolonging the release of the active ingredient. Although no commercial product for repeated application on the eye is currently available, PVP-I has been used in ophthalmology not only for pre- and postoperative antisepsis, but also for the treatment of bacterial and viral conjunctivitis and for prophylaxis against ophthalmia neonatorum. For these indications, liposomal formulations with 2.5 and 5.0% PVP-I were developed. These eye drops are isotonic with tear fluid at pH 6. First in vitro tests demonstrated an excellent antimicrobial efficacy, and a placebo-controlled clinical study on volunteers showed a very good local tolerability. A study on rabbits demonstrated positive results of the PVP-I liposome eye drops compared to placebo and the broadspectrum antibiotic Polyspectran in a standardized model of Staphylococcus aureus deep eye infection. The other aim is a well-tolerated liposomal PVP-I hydrogel for improved antiseptic wound treatment with moisturizer. It has been reported that liposomes are enriched at the wound bottom for direct action against infection and support of wound healing. An animal study on the efficacy and tolerability of different formulations of a hydrogel with PVP-I liposomes in deep dermal burn wounds has indicated an outstanding quality of wound healing with smooth granulation tissue, less inflammation, less wound contraction and no hyperkeratotic reactivity, especially with the 3% PVP-I liposome formulation."
CD005253,0,27136582,0,"Iodine Concentration in Breastmilk and Urine among Lactating Women of Bhaktapur, Nepal.","Adequate iodine concentration in breastmilk (BMIC) is essential for optimal neonatal thyroid hormone synthesis and neurological development in breastfed infants. For many decades, iodine deficiency has been a public health problem in Nepal. However, recently, excessive iodine intakes among Nepali infants have been reported. This study aimed to measure BMIC and urinary iodine concentration (UIC) among lactating women in a peri-urban area of Nepal. Iodine concentration was measured in spot urine (n = 485) and breastmilk samples (n = 291) of 500 randomly selected lactating women. The median (p25, p75) BMIC and median UIC were 250 (130, 370) µg/L and 230 (135-377) µg/L, respectively. Around 82% had BMIC > 100 µg/L, 61% had BMIC > 200 µg/L and 81% had UIC > 100 µg/L, 37% had >300 µg/L and 20% had >500 µg/L. In multiple linear regression models, time since birth (β 3.0, 95% CI (0.2, 5.0)) and UIC (β 1.0, 95% CI (0.1, 2.0)) were associated with BMIC, explaining 26% of the variance. A large proportion of the women had adequate BMIC and UIC; however, a subset had high iodine concentrations. These findings emphasize the importance of carefully monitoring iodine intake to minimize the risk of iodine excess and subsequently preventing transient iodine-induced hypothyroidism in breastfed infants."

Hair T4 content was similar at diagnosis in hypothyroid newborns (2.6 +/- 2.3 pg/mg hair) and in infants undetected at birth (2.4 +/- 1.7 microg/mg hair), but very high only in the latter after therapy (23.2 +/- 3.9 microg/mg hair). Untreated hyperthyroid adults surprisingly evidenced lower hair T4 (0.4 +/- 0.2 microg/mg hair) than controls (1.5 +/- 0.3 microg/mg hair). We suggest these findings are due to differential tissue storage of thyroid hormone, related to the different blood T4 concentration. Therefore, T4 hair assay could be a non-invasive method to further assess thyroid status."

CD005253,0,17107219,0,Neonatal thyroxine supplementation for transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity : beneficial or detrimental?,"Extremely low birth-weight newborns (<1000g) experience low levels of thyroid hormone that vary inversely with the severity of neonatal illness and the extent of developmental immaturity with levels reaching a nadir at approximate, equals7 days after birth; this phenomenon can persist for several weeks. In the absence of transplacental passage, 30-50% of these neonates cannot generate sufficient quantities of thyroid hormone to meet postnatal demands, placing them at an increased risk for developmental delay and cerebral palsy. Population surveys and interventional trials suggest that a therapeutic opening exists during a 'window of opportunity' corresponding to this period of diminished capacity. Variables to consider before intervention focus on the consideration that supplementation of both the substrate thyroxine and the active hormone triiodothyronine may be necessary in quantities that do not suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone release, yet overcome the persistence of increased conversion to 3,3'5'-triodo-L-thyronine, terminal deiodination, and activity of the sulfation inactivation pathways, as well as the diminished capacity of the newborn to accommodate postnatal physiologic changes. Single daily replacement doses may suppress levels of converting enzymes in the brain, suggesting that physiologic 'mimicry' provided by a constant infusion may be the preferred dosing option. Properly powered clinical trials targeting long-term developmental outcomes are needed to discern whether these interventions will do more than simply elevate blood levels of thyroid hormones to the target values of either the fetus or developing neonate. Identifying the appropriate indications for supplementation may alleviate individual pain and distress due to disability for several hundred extremely low birth-weight neonates each year in the US alone, and save society a pro-rated lifetime cost of nearly $US1 million per child."
CD005253,0,10863651,0,Antecedents of cerebral palsy in very low-birth weight infants.,"Research from the last two decades provides directions for efforts to prevent CP in VLBW infants. The pathogenesis of CP seems to involve factors operating both during pregnancy and in the neonatal period. The most important prenatal factor appears to be intrauterine infection. Perinatal infection and other risk factors, such as the death of a co-twin, placental abruption, and cerebral ischemia, could trigger a cytokine cascade resulting in damage to the developing brain. The low frequency of intrauterine infection in mothers with preeclampsia might explain the apparent protective effect of this disorder. If the brain damage attributed to intrauterine infection and other risk factors involves cytokines as intermediates, then blockade of the proinflammatory cascade or promotion of endogenous inhibitors might prevent CP. Other potentially preventive strategies include corticosteroids given to mothers (but not those given to neonates) and thyroid hormone."

SWOT analysis, questionnaire, focus groups discussion beside a combination of rapid assessment approach and qualitative method were used to critically evaluate the salt iodization situation in the country and assess the prevailing IDD situation in and propose a plan of action to overcome the bottlenecks. The survey concluded that Iodine deficiency affects children and women all through Sudan. The prevalence is even greater in some regions of the country and there is no supportive policy environment for successful universal salt iodization. To overcome this aggravated situation Sudan will need to conduct a baseline study to provide data on the prevalence of IDD, geographic distribution, knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to iodine deficiency.

Aim of the study - to define the specificities of gestation period and determine the prognostic risk of obstetric and perinatal complications in pregnant females with thyroid pathology. The study was performed at the base of ""David Gagua Clinic"" Ltd. Prospective, open controlled study design was applied. Based upon the referral to the clinic, 292 pregnant females with thyroid pathology were involved in the main group. The control group involved 58 conditionally healthy pregnant females of reproductive age.

The prognostic risk of early spontaneous abortion, premature delivery and obstetric surgical interventions was statistically significant in pregnant females with hypothyroidism. The relative ratio for low neonatal weight, maternal iron deficiency anemia in postpartum period, abnormal weight gain and chronic lower limb venous disorders were high in the aspect of perinatal outcomes. Thus, despite of timely diagnosis and adequate treatment, thyroid pathology revealed in the gestational period is related with particular risk for development of obstetric and perinatal complications, which indicates on absolute necessity of pregravid preparation and achievement of euthyroid state at preliminary stage of pregnancy planning."
CD005253,0,15531476,0,Developmental trends in cord and postpartum serum thyroid hormones in preterm infants.,"The purpose of this study was first to clarify postnatal trends in sera T(4), free T(4) (FT(4)), T(4)-binding globulin, TSH, T(3), rT(3), and T(4) sulfate levels in cord and at 7, 14, and 28 d in groups of preterm infants at 23-27 wk (n = 101), 28-30 wk (n = 196), and 31-34 (n = 253) wk gestation, and second to compare these trends to those of term infants and also with cord sera levels of equivalent gestational ages (n = 812; 23-42 wk gestation). In all preterm groups, TSH and rT(3) decrease to below, T(4)-binding globulin increases to within, and T(3) and T(4) sulfate increase to above cord levels of equivalent gestational age. Term infants are hyperthyroxinemic relative to cord and nonpregnant adult levels of T(4). Postnatal T(4) increases are attenuated in 31- to 34-wk infants, absent in 28- to 30-wk infants (although levels are equivalent to gestational age), and crucially reversed in 23- to 27-wk infants. This immature group is hypothyroxinemic relative to other groups and to cord levels of equivalent gestational age. Compared with term infants, postnatal FT(4) increases are lower in 31- to 34-wk infants, attenuated in 28- to 30-wk infants, and absent in 23- to 27-wk infants. The 23- to 27-wk group is distinctive; they are hypothyroxinemic on T(4) levels, yet FT(4) levels are within the cord levels of equivalent gestational age."
CD005253,0,26761540,0,MIBG in Neuroblastoma Diagnostic Imaging and Therapy.,"Neuroblastoma is a common malignancy observed in infants and young children. It has a varied prognosis, ranging from spontaneous regression to aggressive metastatic tumors with fatal outcomes despite multimodality therapy. Patients are divided into risk groups on the basis of age, stage, and biologic tumor factors. Multiple clinical and imaging tests are needed for accurate patient assessment. Iodine 123 ((123)I) metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is the first-line functional imaging agent used in neuroblastoma imaging. MIBG uptake is seen in 90% of neuroblastomas, identifying both the primary tumor and sites of metastatic disease. The addition of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and SPECT/computed tomography to (123)I-MIBG planar images can improve identification and characterization of sites of uptake. During scan interpretation, use of MIBG semiquantitative scoring systems improves description of disease extent and distribution and may be helpful in defining prognosis. Therapeutic use of MIBG labeled with iodine 131 ((131)I) is being investigated as part of research trials, both as a single agent and in conjunction with other therapies. (131)I-MIBG therapy has been studied in patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma and those with relapsed disease. Development and implementation of an institutional (131)I-MIBG therapy research program requires extensive preparation with a focus on radiation protection."

There is no therapeutic modality for GD considered as totally safe in pregnancy. Fetal and neonatal risks of maternal hyperthyroid disease are related to the hyperthyroidism itself and/or to the medical treatment of the disease. There are no data supporting an association between congenital anomalies in the fetus and propylthiouracil (PTU). Hepatotoxicity, cytopenias--especially agranulocytosis and quite rarely, angioedema, may be seen as side effects of PTU. In this case report, we examine an instance of Graves' hyperthyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy. In this case, a serious side effect during anti-thyroid drug usage was encountered, eventually resulting in surgery in the second trimester. This intervention was assisted by the use of plasmapheresis to obtain rapid normalization of serum thyroid hormone levels."
CD005253,0,11886524,0,"PARP determines the mode of cell death in skin fibroblasts, but not keratinocytes, exposed to sulfur mustard.","Sulfur mustard is cytotoxic to dermal fibroblasts as well as epidermal keratinocytes. We demonstrated that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) modulates Fas-mediated apoptosis, and other groups and we have shown that PARP plays a role in the modulation of other types of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. We have now utilized primary dermal fibroblasts, immortalized fibroblasts, and keratinocytes derived from PARP(-/-) mice and their wildtype littermates (PARP(+/+)) to determine the contribution of PARP to sulfur mustard toxicity. Following sulfur mustard exposure, primary skin fibroblasts from PARP-deficient mice demonstrated increased internucleosomal DNA cleavage, caspase-3 processing and activity, and annexin V positivity, compared to those derived from PARP(+/+) animals. Conversely, propidium iodide staining, PARP cleavage patterns, and random DNA fragmentation revealed a dose-dependent increase in necrosis in PARP(+/+) but not PARP(-/-) cells. Using immortalized PARP(-/-) fibroblasts stably transfected with the human PARP cDNA or with empty vector alone, we show that PARP inhibits markers of apoptosis in these cells as well. Finally, primary keratinocytes were derived from newborn PARP(+/+) and PARP(-/-) mice and immortalized with the E6 and E7 genes of human papilloma virus. In contrast to fibroblasts, keratinocytes from both PARP(-/-) and PARP(+/+) mice express markers of apoptosis in response to sulfur mustard exposure. The effects of PARP on the mode of cell death in different skin cell types may determine the severity of vesication in vivo, and thus have implications for the design of PARP inhibitors to reduce sulfur mustard pathology."
CD005253,0,23609774,0,Iodine and mental development of children 5 years old and under: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Several reviews and meta-analyses have examined the effects of iodine on mental development. None focused on young children, so they were incomplete in summarizing the effects on this important age group. The current systematic review therefore examined the relationship between iodine and mental development of children 5 years old and under. A systematic review of articles using Medline (1980-November 2011) was carried out. We organized studies according to four designs: (1) randomized controlled trial with iodine supplementation of mothers; (2) non-randomized trial with iodine supplementation of mothers and/or infants; (3) prospective cohort study stratified by pregnant women's iodine status; (4) prospective cohort study stratified by newborn iodine status. Average effect sizes for these four designs were 0.68 (2 RCT studies), 0.46 (8 non-RCT studies), 0.52 (9 cohort stratified by mothers' iodine status), and 0.54 (4 cohort stratified by infants' iodine status). This translates into 6.9 to 10.2 IQ points lower in iodine deficient children compared with iodine replete children. Thus, regardless of study design, iodine deficiency had a substantial impact on mental development. Methodological concerns included weak study designs, the omission of important confounders, small sample sizes, the lack of cluster analyses, and the lack of separate analyses of verbal and non-verbal subtests. Quantifying more precisely the contribution of iodine deficiency to delayed mental development in young children requires more well-designed randomized controlled trials, including ones on the role of iodized salt."

CD005253,0,16444157,0,Congenital hypothyroidism clinical aspects and late consequences.,"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the commonest treatable cause of mental retardation. The prevelance is 1/3000 - 1/4000 live births worldwide. The importance of CH is that, the longer the diagnosis of CH is delayed, the higher the risk of mental retardation and neurologic sequale; such as poor motor coordination, ataxia, spastic diplegia, muscular hypotonia, strabismus, learning disability and diminished attention span. The most common cause of permenant CH is thyroid dysgenesis (85-90%) in which the transcription factors TTF1,TTF2 and PAX8 would appear to be obvious candidate genes in the aetiology. Especially cardiac defects and some other birth defects are described in patients with CH. Inborn errors of thyroid hormonogenesis are responsible for 10-15% of CH cases and usually have autosomal recessive inheritance, consistent with a single gene mutation. Transient CH is very common in prematures with an estimate of 10% of CH babies identified on newborn screening, or 1 in 40,000 neonates. CH neonates are usually symptom-free and the most encountered symptoms are prolonged jaundice, large fontanelles and umbilical hernia. In general, the extent of clinical findings depends on the cause, severity and duration of hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH>20 microm Iu/L and a decreased concentration of T4 confirms the diagnosis of CH. Infants with permanant abnormalities of thyroid function mostly have a serum TSH concentration > 50 microm Iu/L. Ultrasonography, thyroid scintigraphy, bone x ray of the knee and serum thyroglobulin concentration are the other essentials after diagnosis to clarify the status of the thyroid and the severity of hypothyroidism. The higher doses of 10- 15 microm g/kg/day and the commencement of treatment before 2 weeks gave rise to better long term outcome of CH patients. In the follow up of the patients noncompliance is the most important problem and serum freeT4 or T4 and TSH should be obtained at each visit to adjust the doses of L-thyroxine. Still a small number of patients with severe hypothyroidism in utero or reflected by clinical signs and symptoms extremely low T4 levels and delayed bone age may have intellectual deficits despite normal intelligence."

The therapeutic use of the following thyroid agents is reviewed: levothyroxine sodium, Thyroid USP, thyroglobulin, liotrix, and liothyronine sodium. Myxedema coma, neonatal hypothyroidism, primary hypothyroidism, and secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism are specific hypothyroid states for which drug therapy is discussed. Levothyroxine sodium is the preferred agent because of consistent potency, restoration of normal, constant serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and ease of interpretation of thyroid hormone levels. Other agents, because they contain T3, result in postabsorptive elevated T3 serum concentrations that may cause thyrotoxic symptoms and reduction of T4 levels. This, in turn, may give rise to misleading estimates of thyroid dosage. Patients with the sick euthyroid or low T3 syndromes are not candidates for thyroid hormone therapy."

Thyrotropin receptor-blocking antibodies were present in maternal serum and in the three neonates. Each baby also had a different congenital malformation.

CD005253,0,22575544,0,Iodine supplementation in pregnancy and its effect on child cognition.,"Maternal hypothyroidism and hypothyroxenemia due to iodine deficiency have been shown to affect development of the newborn negatively. Maternal iodine supplementation may therefore improve cognitive performance of the offspring, even in areas of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency (ID). Several iodine supplementation studies have been performed in mildly ID pregnant women in Europe. These studies have shown that iodine supplementation increases maternal urinary iodine (UI) excretion and reduces thyroid volume, as well as prevents increases in infant thyroid volume and thyroglobuline. However, randomized controlled studies with long-term outcomes are lacking. Therefore, two trials were started in 2008 in areas of low iodine status; one in Bangalore, India (n=325), and another in Bangkok, Thailand (n=514). Pregnant women were recruited <14 weeks gestational age and randomized to either receive a daily dose of 200 μg I (as KI) or an identical placebo throughout pregnancy. Both trials are ongoing, and women are followed up during pregnancy and at delivery. UI, thyroid hormones, and thyroid size are measured. Birth outcomes are recorded, such as gestational age at delivery, height, weight, and APGAR scores, and cord blood and heel stick blood (<72 h) is collected from the child. Child development is assessed at 6 weeks of age using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS), and at 12 and 24 months of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The outcomes of these trials will contribute importantly to the evidence base for iodine supplementation of pregnant women living in areas of mild iodine deficiency."
CD005253,0,2486887,0,Fetal goitrous hypothyroidism.

An obstetrical sonogram at 33 weeks revealed a bilobed fetal neck mass, compatible with enlarged thyroid gland, associated with neck hyperextension, reduced gastric fluid, and polyhydramnios. Umbilical blood sampling after volume reduction amniocentesis confirmed fetal hypothyroidism with a euthyroid mother. Fetal T4 measured 1.3 micrograms/dl, free T4 0.3 ng/dl, and thyroid-stimulating hormone 186 microU. Intraamniotic levothyroxine, 500 micrograms, was given twice with a 14-day interval. The head flexed, gastric fluid increased, and amniotic fluid levels returned to normal. Prenatal (36 weeks) and neonatal blood sampling demonstrated return to euthyroid indices. Ultrasonic estimates of thyroid volume decreased by over 50%. Vaginal delivery at 39 weeks was uncomplicated. The newborn appeared normal and is being maintained on thyroid replacement therapy."
CD005253,0,12064898,0,Long-term consequences of congenital hypothyroidism in the era of screening programmes.,"Newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH), is one of the major achievements of medicine because early diagnosis and treatment has resulted in normal development in the vast majority of cases. However, all studies on outcome report up to 10% of patients with residual problems regarding mental development and neurological symptoms despite early diagnosis. Factors clearly associated with a less favourable outcome are late onset and an inadequate dosage of thyroid hormone substitution, a poor social-economic environment and compliance problems, while the impact of severity of CH at diagnosis on outcome is not completely settled, although most studies demonstrate a correlation between severity of hypothyroidism and poorer outcome. More recently in a few cases the molecular basis of CH has been clarified. It has become evident that, in some patients with persistent mental retardation and neurological symptoms, defects in transcription factors which are expressed in the thyroid gland as well as in the central nervous system (CNS) during embryonic development cause both defective thyroid and CNS development. The clarification of further molecular defects which affect the thyroid gland and brain development will help us to understand the poor outcome of patients with CH in the era of newborn screening and these diagnostic advances will ensure adequate counselling and care for these patients."

The active ingredient is simeticone. No drug interactions with simeticone are documented in the current summary of product characteristics. The authors report the case of an infant with confirmed congenital hypothyroidism on levothyroxine who experienced a possible drug interaction with simeticone. Despite adequate levothyroxine dosage, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was high, suggesting undertreatment. Questioning revealed the child was taking Infacol drops before feeds while on levothyroxine. The colic drops were immediately discontinued and TSH promptly normalised with a reduction in thyroxine requirement to an age appropriate dosage. Drug interaction of thyroxine with simeticone has not been reported previously and is not listed in the British National Formulary for Children. Clinicians and parents need to be aware of this interaction to avoid unnecessary undertreatment and prevent potential long-term neurological sequelae."
CD005253,0,2670624,0,Lung surfactant enhancement in utero.,"Over the last 10 years the strategy for the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has been directed towards the acceleration of fetal lung maturity in utero by means of drugs administered to the mother, the most thoroughly investigated being glucocorticoids (GC). Many reports indicate that the administration of GC decreases the incidence of RDS in the neonate delivered between 28 and 32 weeks and weighing less than 1500 g. The type of GC and the drug-delivery interval are critical. Harmful potential side effects of GC have led to the testing of other drugs capable of accelerating fetal lung maturity, among them ambroxol and aminophylline. Ambroxol has been shown to reduce significantly RDS compared to placebo, without causing important adverse effects either on the mother or the baby. Our experimental studies on aminophylline have shown that the drug exerts only minor beneficial effects on fetal lung maturation and surfactant production. Recently we have evaluated the association of GC with inositol. The sugar alcohol dramatically affected pregnant rabbit fetal lung mechanisms, reducing GC-adverse effects such as decrease in lung DNA and protein content. In attempts to minimize the risk of neonatal RDS it is important (1) to identify pregnant women at risk for preterm labor; (2) to establish specific guidelines for the use of any prenatal drug to be administered for the prevention of RDS; (3) to assess fetal lung maturity; (4) to intensively monitor the fetus intrapartum; and (5) to prevent birth asphyxia."

The results showed: 1) The percentage of subjects with TSH levels equal to or greater than 5 mIU/L in the neonate group was 38.9% while the percentages in the other groups were 0-3.3% (P < 0.01); 2) The TSH levels of the neonates were inversely related to the urinary iodine values of their mothers (pregnant women).

Children with goitre but without obvious signs of cretinism (cases) were maximally matched with a goitre-free child of the same ethnic group, village, sex and age (controls). Anthropometry of cases and controls was compared in order to investigate if endemic goitre is associated with any growth impairment. Surprisingly, between ages 2 and 4 years, children with goitre are taller and heavier, and have a smaller triceps skinfold thickness. Arm circumferences did not differ between cases and controls. Stunting is more prevalent in controls. If manifest cretinism is excluded, goitre is not associated with growth retardation. The higher anthropometric figures in goitrous children remain unexplained. In the absence of any data on the hormonal status of these two groups of children, it can only be surmised that, in iodine-deficient areas, some degree of hypothyroidism negatively influencing growth might be more frequent in non-goitrous children than in goitrous ones."
CD005253,0,7622777,0,[Prenatal prevention of infant respiratory distress syndrome. 1st part: experimental data and pharmacological treatment].,"Pulmonary maturation and growth are two time-related interdependent phenomena. The main regulatory mechanisms of pulmonary maturation are complex and the role of epithelial-mesenchymal interrelationship appear to be determinant in the phenomena leading to morphological growth of the lung and in cellular differentiation of the epithelium during development. At an early stage of morphological development of the fetal lung, endogenous hormones do not directly affect epithelial differentiation but modulate the expression of genes coding for surfactant. Later surfactant production responds to multihormone regulation. Some of these hormones or growth factors (steroids, oestradiol, prolactin, thyroxine, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast pneumocyte factor) are powerful stimulators, favoring biochemical development of the fetal lung. Inversely, other factors (insulin, androgens) limit the production of surfactant. Glucocorticoids play a specific role (stimulation of morphologic and biochemical development of the lung) and potentialize the stimulating effect of other factors. A good understanding of these mechanisms is essential before introducing treatments stimulating natural processes as closely as possible. Experimental results on the use of lung maturation induction, especially with glucocorticoids, have been quite promising. Combining thyroid hormones and thyrotropin-releasing hormone appears to be an interesting proposal, as is the use of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor."

Germinal spectra from cervical smears at the beginning of birth and directly post partum (p.p.) were taken, and bacteriological specimens from the intra-uterine catheter system and the oral cavity of the neonatus were also determined. In the p.p. cervical smears of the PVP iodine prophylaxis group, Escherichia coli (p = 0.05) were found significantly less frequently. The germinal isolates of the tip and middle of the catheter produced an increased occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. The frequency of these germs could be reduced significantly by vaginal application of PVP iodine. The oral cavity smear of the neonatus which was taken at the same time as the post partum cervical smear showed an almost identical bacterial flora. A reduction of E. coli and other gram-negative bacilli were found in the PVP iodine group."

We present a case of fetal goiter diagnosed at 29 weeks of gestation following routine ultrasound examination. Fetal blood sampling performed at this time confirmed the presence of fetal hypothyroidism. Treatment was performed using a series of intra-amniotic injections between 31 and 36 weeks, initially with tri-iodothyronine (T3) and subsequently with thyroxine. During this period, shrinkage of the fetal goiter, increasing neck flexion and resolution of the polyhydramnios was observed. Following birth, neonatal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within the normal range but thyroxine was reduced. The baby was started on daily oral thyroxine and, on examination 7 weeks following birth, he appeared clinically and chemically euthyroid. In the absence of maternal thyroid disease, fetal goiter is extremely rare, with only seven cases previously reported in the English literature to have used intra-amniotic thyroxine injections as a form of treatment. This report reviews the current literature regarding the diagnosis and intrauterine management of fetal goiter and considers the possibility of T3 therapy in future cases of congenital hypothyroidism."

At age 24 h, there was a significant difference in T4 and TSH values between the full-term and preterm groups; no such difference was found in the T4N values. By 21 days of age, the TSH values were still significantly higher in full-term babies compared with preterm ones, but the T4 values were similar. The T4, T4N and TSH values at 24 h in preterm newborns with respiratory distress syndrome were similar to those in normal preterm babies, and the changes in these values with age had no consistent pattern. In preterm babies with low 24-h T4 and T4N values, these two parameters increased with age, reaching normal adult values by 21 days. We concluded that T4N could serve as a useful thyroid function test in the newborn."

Neonatal Screening Programs allow early identification of the disease and the adequate treatment of affected children can avoid the complications related to deprivation of the hormone. Most cases of primary congenital hypothyroidism (85%) are due to thyroid dysgenesis (ectopia, hypoplasia or agenesis) while the remaining result from defects in hormone synthesis. Affected children (> 95%) usually have no symptoms suggesting the disease at birth. The most frequent symptoms and signs are prolonged neonatal jaundice, hoarse cry, lethargy, slow movements, constipation, macroglossia, umbilical hernia, large fontanelle, hypotonia and dry skin. Around the world, various strategies are used for the screening of the CH. In Brazil, screening for CH is mandatory by law and usually done by serum TSH in dried blood collected from the heel. The recommended age for performing this test is after 48 hours of life until the 4th day. Diagnostic confirmation is required dosing TSH and free T4 or total T4 in serum."

It was shown that the thyroid gland of the children who were evacuated from the 30-km zone was damaged most severely due to the influence of radioactive iodine (131I). Living on radionuclide-polluted territories in conditions of iodine deficiency has been an additional contributory factor in the development of thyroid gland diseases.

Thirty-four positive neonates of the mass-screening for cretinism were classified into three groups by the pediatrician after the reevaluation of the serum TSH level, that is, negative in reevaluation group, hyper thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) emia group and cretinism group. One-hundred and two negative neonates of the mass-screening were classified into the normal group. Concentrations of these organochlorine compounds in the breast milk of mothers, which were considered as the indicator of prenatal exposures to them, were gradually increased from the normal group to the cretinism group in the four groups and were around two times higher in the cretinism group than in the normal group. According to the case-control study adjusted for the parity and mother's age, odds ratios of PCBs, DDT and HCB were 10 (p=0.003), 10 (p=0.003) and 22 (p=0.004), respectively and in dioxin-like compounds, PCDFs showed the highest odds ratio, 9.8 (p=0.005).

These defects, which are hereditary and transmitted as recessive autosomic characters, are clinically manifest in homozygotic subjects in the form of goitres which appears during the neonatal age or, as in more common, during later infancy. At present, mass neonatal screening allows this phenomenon to be diagnosed during the first days of life. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism caused by enzyme deficiency is made on the basis of radioisotopic and ultrasonic studies, and by the assay of plasma levels of thyroglobulin. The exact definition of the specific enzyme activity which is lacking in each case is more complex and has still to be resolved. This study describes the biochemical and pathogenetic characteristics of the different thyroid hormone synthesis defects and includes the findings of previously published diagnosis tests in order to identify the missing enzymatic activity. Lastly, a protocol for the differential diagnosis of the various types of defect is outlined. A specific etiological definition of the altered thyroid metabolism, while providing further insight into the physiopathology of the thyroid and the epidemiology of enzymatic hormone synthesis defects, should not be a motive for delaying the start of substitutive therapy at the earliest possible stage."
CD005253,0,17226091,0,Maternal smoking and infant feeding: breastfeeding is better and safer.,"The rise in smoking rates among young women has implications for children's health aggravated in lower social strata where infant morbidity and mortality rates are higher. The protection afforded by breastfeeding is beneficial to infants in rich and poor countries alike. Women (especially when young, uneducated, and unsupported) who are smokers constitute a risk group for abandoning breastfeeding; moreover, their bottle-fed newborns run a greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Bottle-feeding is attendant on maternal cigarette smoking. The advantages of breastfeeding over bottle-feeding are discussed with regard to systemic effects and the specific effects of cyanide (which can affect the iodine metabolism of infants) and nicotine derived from food and maternal smoking. Despite great strides in bans on smoking, public health policies should be designed to keep in perspective that breastfeeding is an effective tool to counterbalance the health disadvantages that under-privileged infants of smoking mothers face. This paper argues that infants born to smoking parents are better protected by breastfeeding than by formula feeding. Therefore, if public health policies cannot stop addicted mothers from smoking during pregnancy it is fundamental not to miss the chance of encouraging and supporting breastfeeding. The food and health inequalities of socially disadvantaged groups demand well crafted public-health policies to reduce the incidence of diseases and compress morbidity: these policies need to make it clear that breastfeeding is better and safer."

The predicted values of minimal (inhalation) and maximal (inhalation and ingestion) committed dose equivalent to the thyroid varied from 2.5 (min) to 24.7 (max) mSv in different groups of adults and children. To follow up the results of iodine prophylaxis and some aspects of possible thyroid gland morphological and functional changes 11086 persons were carefully investigated clinically and biochemically. Among these 11086 persons were 42.6% males and 57.4% females both adults from 17 till 40 year and children up do 16 years. The following parameters were reviewed: pregnancy, time of residence in the region, thyroid abnormalities, family history concerning thyroid diseases, iodine intake in April and May 1986 with possible side effects, changes in the thyroid size observed before and after 1986, degree and kind of thyroid enlargement, serum concentration of T3, T4, TSH, ATMA and ATG titre and finally the effectiveness of thyroid blockade at 24, 48 and 72 h after ingestion of Lugol's solution. Side effects of the ingestion of potassium iodide from 30-70 mg were observed in 153 cases, 36 of them consulted medical doctors but in no case the side effects (dominated by vomiting) threatened the life. In the investigated group were 144 pregnant women. Majority, because 88% of them delivered the baby on or after time and 6.9% before time, 4.9% of natural abortions were noted but non artificial.

CD005253,0,61585,0,Propranolol in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis: a review.,"The clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism have suggested to physicians for many years that the sympathetic nervous system may be involved in their production. Despite this, the precise interrelationship between the thyroid gland and the sympathetic nervous system has never been defined but controlled investigations have shown that hypersensitivity to catcholamines does not occur in animals or man with artificially produced thyrotoxicosis. In recent years beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, and in particular propranolol, have been used in patients with hyperthyroidism. Evidence exists that they control some of the peripheral manifestations of the disease, including nervousness, palpitations, tachycardia, increased cardiac output and tremor, but they do not appear to affect the underlying thyrotoxic process itself. Propranolol has been used with sucess in the treatment of acute hyperthyroid crisis, in pre-operative preparations for thyroidectomy, for the control of symptoms and signs following the administration of radioactive iodine therapy and antithyroid drugs, during the period of diagnostic thyroid investigations and occasionally as the sole therapy. The supportive role of propranolol in the management of hyperthyroidism is now established and in some instances such as radioactive iodine therapy, it has enabled improvements in the existing methods of treatment to be achieved."

The infants were randomized to three groups. Group 1 (n = 6) received nonprotein energy 38 kcal/kg/d; group 2 (n = 5), 64 kcal/kg/d; and group 3 (n = 8), 64 kcal/kg/d plus 1 to 2 g/kg/d crystalline amino acids. Thirty-six hours after beginning the infusion, oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured by indirect calorimetry for 5 to 6 hours. Simultaneously, urine was collected for urinary norepinephrine excretion, which was determined using liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Group 1 had lower VO2 and urinary norepinephrine excretion than did groups 2 and 3, which did not differ. T4 and T3 were not different among the three groups. The demonstrated simultaneous changes in VO2 and norepinephrine excretion with varying energy intakes independent of age supports energy intake as a modulator of the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn controls metabolic rate. Moderate amounts of intravenously administered amino acids do not appear to play an active role in this process; nor do they alter T3 and T4 valves. When VO2 increased with increasing energy intake, T3 and T4 were unaffected, supporting a passive role for thyroid hormones in diet-induced thermogenesis."

Further characterization by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a fetal goiter. During her evaluation for the underlying cause of the fetal goiter, the patient revealed she was taking nutritional iodine supplements for treatment of her hypothyroidism. She was ingesting 62.5 times the recommended amount of daily iodine in pregnancy. The excessive iodine consumption caused suppression of the fetal thyroid hormone production, resulting in hypothyroidism and goiter formation. After the iodine supplement was discontinued, the fetal goiter decreased in size. At delivery, the airway was not compromised.

(1) Screening programs should report thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as well as thyroxine (T(4)) levels in premature infants, which will allow the treating physicians to be aware of possible abnormality that needs to be followed. (2) Sick premature infants and other populations at risk should undergo a full serum thyroid function evaluation including free T(4) and TSH beyond the screening program at discharge or at 30 days of age, whichever comes first. (3) Physicians should use their clinical judgment and experience even in the face of normal newborn thyroid screening test and reevaluate for hypothyroidism when there is a clinical suspicion.

Serum Tg was measured by Radioimmunoassay (RIA) (two methods) and Immunometricassay (IMA) (three methods). Mean Tg values measured by the five methods exhibited among-method biases, although a significant positive correlation was observed. Serum Tg levels measured by the five methods showed a correlation with age, but not with TSH or gender. During the first days of life, relatively high mean Tg levels were observed, which progressively decreased until they reached a plateau. Therefore, with the aim of establishing reference values, the population was separated into two age groups: from 3 to 15 days of life (group A) and from 16 to 180 days of life (group B).

The last dose of T-4 was given 2 weeks before delivery; cord blood levels of T-4 and T-3 were undetectable and the TSH concentration was markedly elevated. The case illustrates several important physiological concepts regarding thyroid hormone and TSH metabolism in the fetal-placental unit, including the minimal placental permeability to iodothyronines and TSH, independent function (including feedback control) of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and the TSH response at parturition.

These infants also have a high prevalence (30%-60%) of nonthyroidal illnesses that impact thyroid function, including total and free iodothyronine concentrations. Finally, thyroid gland hormone biosynthesis and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are relatively immature and thyroid glandular iodine stores are low. As a result, VLBW infants manifest a high prevalence of transient primary hypothyroidism (0.41%) and transient hypothalamic-pituitary (thyrotropin [TSH] deficiency) hypothyroidism (5%-10%?). Thyroid function should be monitored in VLBW infants during the first 1-4 weeks of life to detect these disorders as well as the much less common permanent congenital hypothyroidism. An elevated serum TSH level (> 20 mU/L) is diagnostic of primary hypothyroidism and a low free T4 concentration with a normal or low serum TSH level suggests hypothalamic-pituitary hypothyroidism. Treatment of transient or permanent primary hypothyroidism and of congenital TSH deficiency is indicated. Preliminary data suggests that 30-60-day treatment of transient hypothalamic-pituitary hypothyroidism improves IQ at 2 years of age. However, further information confirming the benefit of treatment, the threshold free T4 values for diagnosis, and the optimal dose of T4 are necessary."
CD005253,0,8054857,0,The disorders induced by iodine deficiency.,"This paper reviews present knowledge on the etiology, pathophysiology, complications, prevention, and therapy of the disorders induced by iodine deficiency. The recommended dietary allowances of iodine are 100 micrograms/day for adults and adolescents, 60-100 micrograms/day for children aged 1 to 10 years, and 35-40 micrograms/day in infants aged less than 1 year. When the physiological requirements of iodine are not met in a given population, a series of functional and developmental abnormalities occur including thyroid function abnormalities and, when iodine deficiency is severe, endemic goiter and cretinism, endemic mental retardation, decreased fertility rate, increased perinatal death, and infant mortality. These complications, which constitute a hindrance to the development of the affected populations, are grouped under the general heading of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). At least one billion people are at risk of IDD. Iodine deficiency, therefore, constitutes one of the most common preventable causes of mental deficiency in the world today. Most of the affected populations live in mountainous areas in preindustrialized countries, but 50 to 100 million people are still at risk in Europe. The most important target groups to the effects of iodine deficiency from a public health point of view are pregnant mothers, fetuses, neonates, and young infants because the main complication of IDD, i.e., brain damage resulting in irreversible mental retardation, is the consequence of thyroid failure occurring during pregnancy, fetal, and early postnatal life. The main cause of endemic goiter and cretinism is an insufficient dietary supply of iodine. The additional role of naturally occurring goitrogens has been documented in the case of certain foods (milk, cassava, millet, nuts) and bacterial and chemical water pollutants. The mechanism by which the thyroid gland adapts to an insufficient iodine supply is to increase the trapping of iodide as well as the subsequent steps of the intrathyroidal metabolism of iodine leading to preferential synthesis and secretion of triiodotyronine (T3). They are triggered and maintained by increased secretion of TSH, which is ultimately responsible for the development of goiter. The acceleration of the main steps of iodine kinetics and the degree of hyperstimulation by TSH are much more marked in the pediatric age groups, including neonates, than in adults, and the development of goiter appears as an unfavorable side effect in the process of adaptation to iodine deficiency during growth. The most serious complication of iodine deficiency is endemic cretinism, a syndrome characterized by irreversible mental retardation together with either a predominant neurological syndrome or predominant hypothyroidism, or a combination of both syndromes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD005253,0,1794336,0,Influence of perinatal factors and sampling methods on TSH and thyroid hormone levels in cord blood.,"To evaluate the effect of perinatal factors and sampling methods on thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone levels in cord blood, serum TSH, free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) concentrations were measured in 124 healthy term neonates. Eighty-eight infants were born in normal vaginal deliveries, 25 were delivered by vacuum extractor and 11 by Cesarean section. There was no significant difference among the three infant groups in the mean TSH levels. Birth weight, the infant's sex, duration of labor and uterotonic agents had no effect on cord serum TSH and free thyroid hormone levels in the neonates born by normal vaginal delivery. To assess the adequacy of specimen collection, mixed cord blood samples, obtained by a direct application of cord on a filter paper, and venous blood withdrawn with a plastic syringe were collected in another 200 infants. There was a significant linear correlation in the TSH concentration in mixed cord blood and cord venous serum from the same individuals, while a poor correlation was found in T4 values from two specimens. Our results suggest that the TSH value in cord blood is less influenced by perinatal factors, including the sampling method, and the mixed cord blood collected by this technique might be a feasible alternative specimen for a TSH screening program with cord blood which is useful in countries where neonatal blood is not available."

Since propranolol has been recently used successfully to treat cutaneous infantile hemangiomas, we decided to use it in three patients who presented with hepatic and skin hemangiomatosis. Three patients with skin and hepatic infantile hemangiomas, two of whom had evidence of cardiovascular compromise and one of whom had extensive liver involvement and hypothyroidism, were treated with oral propranolol. Regression of both skin and hepatic hemangiomas was noted in all patients, as was resolution of the cardiac symptoms and decreased thyroid requirement in two patients each. Propranolol was well tolerated without any adverse effects. Propranolol should be considered as a potential first-line therapy in patients with symptomatic hepatic hemangiomatosis."
CD005253,0,17057303,0,[The function of thyroid gland during the course of pregnancy].,"The influence of pregnancy on the function of thyroid gland on the one hand and the influence of dysfunction of this organ on duration of pregnancy on the other is a common and topical problem in medicine. For the study of this correlation, 77 pregnant women have been examined, 45 of which suffered from the thyroid gland dysfunction of different levels. According to the level of iodine excretion acute insufficiency has not been detected among the observed pregnant women; 7 (9%) of them had medium insufficiency and 14 (18%) suffered from moderate lack of iodine. Such patients were treated with iodine preparations only. 24 women (31%) were assigned a combined treatment of hormonal (e.g. L-Thyroxin) and iodine medications. Moreover, they were placed under a dynamic monitoring of endocrinologist and the gynaecologist during the entire period of pregnancy. The research also included a detailed study of age dependence, the sequence of pregnancy, extra genital pathologies and regional spreading. The latter showed that the thyroid gland pathology is the most frequently encountered among the pregnant from Tbilisi and its proximity areas (53%) and from the Western parts of Georgia (22%). The thyroid gland pathology is more frequent among women during repeated pregnancy (35%) as compared to the primigravidae (23%). Our overall data show that the dysfunction of thyroid gland is observed in 58.4% of cases. Every examined woman delivered a healthy baby after a full-term pregnancy."
CD005253,0,10986446,0,Hormonal modulation of fetal pulmonary development: relevance for the fetus with diaphragmatic hernia.,"Antenatal hormonal modulation of pulmonary growth has been successfully introduced in clinical practice to reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of preterm born infants. However, a certain amount of reserve to repeat courses should be taken into account because of possible adverse effects of antenatal administration of glucocorticoids. Although in experimental animals thyroid hormones given alone were not shown to have stimulatory effects on pulmonary development, there was an apparent synergistic effect with corticosteroids. Yet, such effects have not been substantiated in clinical trials. Whereas in cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in utero tracheal occlusion could stimulate fetal lung growth and modulation, the enhancement of type II cell differentiation is more likely to be achieved with antenatal exposure to hormonal therapies. However, there is still no firm scientific basis for either of these two treatment modalities in CDH. Yet, antenatal hormonal modulation is now soon to be tested in an extensive multi-center clinical trial. In this review, the current status of antenatal hormonal modulation of pulmonary growth will be described and its potential role in the treatment of CDH will be discussed."
CD005253,0,6416059,0,Neonatal methadone withdrawal. Effect of two treatment regimens.,"Thirty-one infants exposed to methadone in utero who required pharmacologic treatment for withdrawal symptoms were randomly assigned to a paregoric or phenobarbital treatment group. Seven infants had symptoms too mild to require treatment. Respiratory rate, blood pH, PCO2, systolic BP, and serum thyroxine concentrations were measured on the 4th, 7th, and 14th days of life. Platelet counts were performed on the seventh and 14th days of life, and urinary catecholamine excretion was measured on the sixth day of life. Rates of weight gain were recorded during the second and third weeks of life. With the exception of a slightly higher blood PCO2 level in the phenobarbital-treated infants on day 7, no significant intergroup differences were observed in the treated infants. Paregoric-treated infants required a significantly longer period of treatment than phenobarbital-treated infants (22 v 17 days). This may have been due, at least in part, to the prolonged half-life and relatively high blood levels of phenobarbital present after cessation of therapy."

Timing and dosage of initial treatment.,"Sixty of 68 consecutive patients detected during the first two years of the Swedish screening programme for congenital hypothyroidism were Griffiths tested at the age 6.5-7.5 years. The test quotients of the patients could not be distinguished from those of a reference population. Replacement therapy with 8.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms of L-thyroxine (mean +/- SD)/kg/d had been started at 15.0 +/- 7.1 days of life. Furthermore, normal results on Griffiths tests were also found in 13 patients with delayed normalization of serum TSH, i.e. greater than 19 mU/l at the age of six weeks, as well as in patients with retarded skeletal maturity and/or very low neonatal serum levels of thyroxine, i.e. less than 18 nmol/l and tri-iodothyronine, i.e. less than 0.92 nmol/l. Our findings indicate that a replacement dose of 6-11 micrograms L-thyroxine/kg/d is adequate and allows normal psychological development if treatment is started early."
CD005253,0,876699,0,Postnatal triiodothyronine concentrations in healthy preterm infants and in infants with respiratory distress syndrome.,"Postnatal changes in triiodotyronine (T3) concentration were investigated in 12 preterm infants of 26-34 weeks of gestational age. Blood for measurement of T3 was obtained from the cord at delivery and from infants at 1 day of age and at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Seven of the babies suffered from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and five were considred healthy. Gestational ages and body weight were comparable in both groups. In preterm infants with RDS, cord blood T3 concentration was significantly lower than that in cord blood of babies without RDS (22 +/- 2.6 versus 36 +/- 5 ng/dl, P less than 0.05). There was no significant rise in T3 concentration of RDS babies at 24 hr of age (22 +/- 2.6 versus 34.0 +/- 8 ng/dl, P greater than 0.05), and hypotriiodothyroninemia persisted for 3 weeks. At 4 weeks of age, T3 concentration in babies with RDS, although within the normal range (80-190 ng/dl), was significantly lower than that in the healthy preterm infants (110 +/- 10 versus 165 +/- 11 ng/dl, P less than 0.05). Postnatal T3 changes in healthy preterm infants wre characterized by the absence of the initial hypertriiodothyroninemia and by a gradual rise within the first month of life. The noted difference in the pattern of postnatal T3 changes in healthy preterm infants compared to full term infants may reflect thyroid immaturity. The machanism and the significance of the neonatal hypotriiodothyroninemia in RDS and its long term effects on the development of these babies remain to be investigated."

CD005253,0,4331799,0,"Concentrations of idoxuridine in serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with suspected diagnoses of Herpesvirus hominis encephalitis.","A reproducible microbiologic assay of microgram quantities of idoxuridine (IDU) in serum, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid is presented. The antiviral assay is not interfered with by type-specific antibody or interferon. During slow intravenous infusions of idox-uridine (4 mg/min) in patients with suspected diagnoses of Herpesvirus hominis encephalitis, the rate of inactivation and/or removal of drug exceeded its administration. During several rapid infusions of idoxuridine (50 mg/min) significant quantities of the drug were found in serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Idoxuridine is not significantly bound to serum proteins and is not deiodinated in fresh serum or urine in vitro to inactive products (iodouracil, uracil, iodide). It is rapidly excreted into the urine. Inactivation of IDU occurs in tissues. This antiviral assay of IDU in body fluids should be applicable to other viruses and potential antiviral agents. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of IDU for fresh isolates of Herpesvirus hominis (type 1 or 2) were determined. Type 1 herpesviruses' microplaques in baby hamster kidney cell (BHK 21) tissue cultures were sensitive to 2.5-10 mug/0.4 ml. Type 2 macroplaques required 25-50 mug/0.4 ml. This latter characteristic may be an additional biologic marker which may be useful in suggesting type-specificity of herpesvirus isolates."

This uncertainty commonly results in unnecessary and prolonged empiric antibiotic treatment.

CD005253,0,25139139,0,Thyroid screening in pregnancy.,"The adverse impact of overt hypothyroidism that complicates pregnancy outcomes is well-established and not debated. For more than a decade, however, endocrinologists and obstetricians have been debating whether screening for subclinical thyroid disorders during pregnancy should be routine or should continue to be based on symptoms and risk factors. Several observational studies have suggested that offspring of women with asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction were at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopment. Other studies have suggested that pregnant women with subclinical thyroid disease, particularly those identified with an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level may be at increased risk for pregnancy complications such as fetal death, preterm birth, or placental abruption. These data have prompted both obstetric and endocrinologic professional societies to draft recommendations regarding screening for thyroid disease during pregnancy, some of which are not entirely based on available evidence. The prevalence of overt thyroid disease is estimated to be 1-2 per 1000 pregnancies and historically has not been considered high enough to justify routine screening. Lower TSH thresholds (>2.5 mU/L) for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism have been promoted, and women with subclinical thyroid dysfunction commonly are included in estimates of thyroid disease during pregnancy, both of which exaggerate prevalence rates. The most compelling recent evidence on this issue has come from the Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening trial. After almost 22,000 pregnant women were screened for either isolated high TSH or isolated low free thyroxine level, 390 children of treated women with either diagnosis were compared with 404 children of similar women who were not treated during pregnancy. Treatment had no effect on mean offspring IQ at age 3 years or the number of children with an IQ <85. Authors of this landmark study concluded that antenatal screening and maternal treatment for women with subclinical thyroid dysfunction did not result in improved cognitive function. An ongoing intervention trial conducted by the Eunice Kennedy-Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network will provide further clarity to this important question. In the interim, the debating authors have concluded, after careful review of the currently published literature, that routine screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy is not currently warranted at this time."

CD005253,0,8408462,0,Thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation tests in infants.,"The TSH response to TRH administration (7 micrograms/kg) was measured in 68 infants (22 premature) who had abnormal thyroid screening tests by the filter paper method and whose serum thyroid function tests were only mildly abnormal. Twenty-eight infants (12 premature) had peak TSH values of 35 mU/L or less and were considered normal (group I). Forty infants (10 premature) had peak TSH values above 35 mU/L and were considered hyperresponsive (group II). The mean age at testing, screening T4, TSH levels that prompted the testing, as well as baseline T4, T3, and free T4 at the time of TRH testing were not different between the groups. The mean (+/- SD) baseline TSH value was greater in group II (6.8 +/- 2.3 mU/L) than in group I (4.4 +/- 2.2 mU/L; P < 0.001). However, there was a great deal of overlap in the individual TSH values (group I, 0.9-10 mU/L; group II, 1.9-10.6 mU/L). Mean peak TSH levels were significantly different in the two groups (group I, 24 +/- 7.7 mU/L; group II, 60.3 +/- 26.1 mU/L; P < 0.001). During long term follow-up, all 25 group I infants available for evaluation have been confirmed as clinically and biochemically normal. No infant diagnosed as normal was later found to have evidence of hypothyroidism. Fourteen infants in group II have had evidence of thyroid dysfunction. We conclude that the TSH response to TRH stimulation is a useful tool for the evaluation of infants suspected of having primary hypothyroidism. Whether hyperresponsiveness to TRH represents a form of neonatal hypothyroidism requiring treatment remains to be determined."

CD005253,0,17079099,0,Transient hypothyroxinaemia in preterm infants.,"Thyroid hormones are required for normal development of the brain. Transient hypothyroxinaemia is the most common thyroid dysfunction in preterm infants and is defined by temporary low levels of T4, T3 and normal or low TSH. Low T4 levels in preterm infants are associated with persistent neurodevelopmental deficits in cognitive and motor function. Thyroid hormone substitution trials to date are underpowered and show inconsistent results; the question remains -- are low T4 levels simply an epiphenomenon? The aetiology of transient hypothyroxinaemia is multifactorial and the components amenable to correction form the basis of the therapeutic strategy: rectification of iodine deficiency in parenteral nutrition; a reduction of non-thyroidal illnesses and attenuation of their severity; and substitution of drugs that interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Thyroxine substitution therapy should only be done in the context of clinical trials and only in those infants who are hypothyroxinaemic."
CD005253,0,28079353,0,Historical aspects of iodine deficiency control.,"In 1895, iodine was characterized as an essential element of thyroid tissue by Baumann. The efficacy of iodine to prevent goiter was demonstrated by Marine in Northern USA in 1916-1920. Severe endemic goiter and cretinism had been almost entirely eliminated from continental Western Europe and Northern America before the 1930's; however large populations elsewhere and even some places in Western Europe (Sicily) were still affected up to the 2000's. Public health consequences of iodine deficiency are not limited to endemic goiter and cretinism. Iodine deficiency disorders include also increased neonatal death rate and decreased intellectual development, although these consequences are not included in the current estimation of the Global Burden Disease related to iodine deficiency. Severe iodine deficiency as a public health problem is now largely under control worldwide, but can still affect isolated places, in hard-to-reach and/or politically neglected populations. We emphasize the importance of maintaining international cooperation efforts, in order to monitor iodine status where iodine deficiency is now adequately controlled, and identify at-risk population where it is not. The goal should be now global eradication of severe iodine deficiency. Commercial distribution of iodized salt remains the most appropriate strategy. A randomized clinical trial in New Guinea clearly showed in the 1970's that correcting severe iodine deficiency early in pregnancy prevents endemic neurological cretinism. This supports the essential role of thyroid hormones of maternal origin on the normal fetal development, during the first trimester of pregnancy (i.e. when fetal thyroid is still not functional). A randomized clinical trial in Congo (RD) in the 1970's also showed that correcting severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy prevents myxœdematous cretinism, particularly prevalent in affected Congolese areas."

CD005253,0,12297896,0,The nutritional iodine supply of Belgian neonates is still insufficient.,"Belgium used to be affected by mild iodine deficiency. Improvement in iodine nutrition has been recently documented in schoolchildren in Belgium in spite of the absence of any systematic programme of iodine supplementation. The question arises as to whether this 'silent iodine prophylaxis' affected also the neonates. A total of 185 random urine samples were collected from 90 full term and 65 preterm neonates in Brussels on day 5 and repeated on day 30 in 30 preterms who were bottle-fed with iodine-enriched formula-milk. The iodine content was also determined in 58 samples of breast-milk on day 5. The median urinary iodine on day 5 in full term neonates was 86 micro g/l, which is markedly higher than the figure of 48 micro g/L reported 15 years previously in neonates in the same area but still much lower than normal for this age group (150-200 micro g/l). The mean iodine content of breast-milk was 78 micro g/l, which is unchanged as compared to 15 years ago and is about 66% of normal.

CD005253,0,27534639,0,Statistical design considerations applicable to clinical trials of iodine supplementation in pregnant women who may be mildly iodine deficient.,"No large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of iodine supplementation in pregnant women in a region of mild or moderate iodine deficiency has been completed in which a primary outcome measure was an assessment of the neurobehavioral development of the offspring at age ≥2 y. In this article, I discuss considerations for the design of such a trial in a region of mild iodine deficiency, with a focus on statistical methods and approaches. Exposure and design issues include the ethics of using a placebo, the potential for overexposure to iodine, and the possibility of community randomization. The main scientific goal of the trial is important in determining the follow-up period. If the goal is to determine whether iodine supplementation during pregnancy improves neurobehavioral development in the offspring, then follow-up should continue until a reasonably reliable assessment can be conducted, which might be at age ≥2 y. Once the timing of assessment is decided, the impact of potential loss to follow-up should be considered so that appropriate statistical methods can be incorporated into the design. The minimum sample size can be calculated by using a sample size formula that incorporates noncompliance and assumes that a certain proportion of study participants do not have any outcome observed. To have sufficient power to detect a reasonably modest difference in neurobehavioral development scores using an assessment tool with an SD of 15, a large number of participants (>500/group) is required. The minimum adequate number of participants may be even larger (>1300/group) depending on the magnitude of the difference in outcome between the supplementation and placebo groups, the estimated proportion of the iodine-supplementation group that fails to take the supplement, and the estimated proportion of pregnancies that do not produce outcome measurements."

One women had inadvertently received a therapeutic dose of radioiodine at 21 weeks gestation and the other suffered from severe thyrotoxicosis with a serum LATS level of 1850%. In both patients, the serum triiodothyronine was maintained above 500 ng/dl by the concurrent oral administration of this hormone. Despite this precaution, cord serum thyrotrophin levels were markedly elevated and both infants showed clinical signs of hypothyroidism at birth. This experience indicates that triiodothyronine does not prevent fetal hypothyroidism when given to the mother in pharmacological amounts."

CD005253,0,8205252,0,Prevention of iodine deficiency disorders by oral administration of lipiodol during pregnancy.,"The prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders and the thyroid status of the population were studied in an endemic goitre area in Algeria. After oral administration of lipiodol (0.5 ml), three treated groups of mother-newborn couples were compared to an untreated group: group A, mothers treated 1-3 months before conception; group B, mothers treated during the first month of pregnancy; group C, mothers treated during the third month of pregnancy. Untreated mothers were used as a control (group D). After lipiodol treatment, all newborn babies and mothers were clinically euthyroid. All tested newborn babies were full term and no goitre was observed in the four groups. In the mothers, goitre prevalence and thyrotrophin levels decreased significantly, whereas maternal milk and urinary iodine and serum-free thyroxine levels were significantly higher after treatment. The rate of prematurity, stillbirths and abortions in the treated groups was reduced when compared to the untreated group, whereas placental and birth weights were significantly higher. In group D two cases of neonatal hypothyroidism were detected. Their re-evaluation confirmed that hypothyroidism was transient. Groups A, B and C were statistically different from group D with regard to neonatal thyrotrophin and thyroxine. Positive correlations were found between neonatal thyroxine and birth weights and placental weights on the one hand, and maternal urinary iodine and free thyroxine on the other. Consequently, these data indicate that oral administration of lipiodol before or during the first trimester of pregnancy normalizes thyroid function in newborn babies and mothers, increases placental and birth weight and reduces the frequency of iodine deficiency disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD005253,0,18174723,0,Update on the management of congenital hypothyroidism.,"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most frequent congenital endocrine disorder. The diagnosis in industrialized countries is usually made with population-based newborn screening that measures thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH and total thyroxine (T(4)) in dried blood spots in the first 3 days of life. In newborns with a screening result suspicious for hypothyroidism, the diagnosis of primary CH is confirmed when serum TSH levels are above and T(4) (free T(4)) levels are below the age-related reference ranges. Hypothalamic-pituitary hypothyroidism is more difficult to diagnose. Most infants with this diagnosis are missed in screening programs unless T(4) (free T(4))/TSH or TSH/T(4)/thyroxine binding globulin is simultaneously measured. If hypothyroidism is confirmed by laboratory analysis, imaging studies should be performed immediately; however, it is not acceptable to delay hormone replacement therapy if imaging studies are not readily available."
CD005253,0,7758067,0,[Growth in children with impairment of thyroid gland function].,Changes of thyroid function affect beyond doubt the growth rate and bone maturation. In particular thyroid hypofunction during the first months of life leads not only to irreversible disorders of the development of the CNS but causes also a significant impairment of growth. In older children and adolescents with a more long-lasting thyroid dysfunction milder growth disorders without mental retardation were observed. The effect on growth by thyroid hormones takes place at the level of metabolic processes of every single cell and in particular at the level of growth cartilage. The purpose of our investigation was to test the relationship between the production of the growth factor somatomedin C (insulin growth factor-1) and the thyroxine level in children with congenital hypothyroidism revealed during neonatal screening.

Cord blood TSH results were analyzed in 1,578 euthyroid infants from singleton pregnancies with GDM: 103 with elevated TSH (>16 mIU/l) and 1,475 with normal TSH. Maternal characteristics, pregnancy outcome and perinatal complications were compared between the two groups. Multiple logistic regression was used to study the association between high cord blood TSH level and various perinatal complications which reflect in-utero stress in GDM after adjusting for the confounding effects of parity, instrumental delivery, cesarean section and baby gender. High cord blood TSH level was found to be associated with the 1-min Apgar score <7 (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.78-6.16), birth trauma (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.11-10.69), neonatal jaundice requiring treatment (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.30-3.32), neonatal sepsis (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.24-4.42), respiratory complications (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.37-8.70), neurological complications (OR 8.01, 95% CI 1.91-33.60) and overall perinatal morbidity (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.58-3.67).

Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) indicated rhabdomyolysis, ultimately attributed to severe, acquired autoimmune hypothyroidism. Growth data and bone-age suggest the onset of hypothyroidism occurred at or before 12 months of age. Acquired hypothyroidism is rare before age 3 years, and rhabdomyolysis due to hypothyroidism has not previously been reported as a cause of delayed gross-motor development in toddlerhood. Despite the early onset of hypothyroidism, cognitive function appeared to be unaffected. Adequate thyroid hormone replacement quickly normalized the CPK in our patient, and gross motor development rapidly improved. Although rare, rhabdomyolysis secondary to hypothyroidism should be in the differential diagnosis of delayed gross-motor development in infancy and toddlerhood."

Fifteen neonates (nine boys and six girls) of preeclamptic women and 17 healthy neonates (nine boys and eight girls) for the control group were included in the study. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total triiodothyronine (TT3) and total thyroxine (TT4) levels and thyroid gland volumes were determined in both groups. Serum TSH and TT4 levels were not statistically different between the two groups. However, serum TT3 level was 79.22 +/- 40.19 ng/dl in the study group and 40.00 +/- 15.99 ng/dl in control subjects (p < 0.01).

CD005253,0,11238502,0,Selenium decreases thyroglobulin concentrations but does not affect the increased thyroxine-to-triiodothyronine ratio in children with congenital hypothyroidism.,"Compared with euthyroid controls, patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) who are receiving L-T(4) treatment show elevated serum TSH relative to serum T(4) concentrations and increased T(4)/T(3) ratio. These abnormalities could be the consequence of impaired activity of the selenoenzymes deiodinases on which patients with CH rely to convert the ingested L-T(4) into active T(3). Eighteen patients (0.5-15.4 yr), diagnosed with CH in infancy, received selenomethionine (SeM, 20-60 microg selenium/day) for 3 months. The study took place in Belgium, a country where selenium intake is borderline. Compared with the values observed in age- and sex-matched euthyroid controls, patients with CH had decreased selenium, thyroglobulin and T(3) concentrations and increased TSH, reverse T(3), and T(4) concentrations and T(4)/T(3) ratio at baseline. Selenium supplementation caused a 74% increase in plasma selenium values but did not affect the activity of the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase used as a marker of selenium status. SeM abolished the TSH difference observed between CH patients and euthyroid controls at baseline and caused a significant decrease in thyroglobulin values. Thyroid hormone concentrations were not affected by SeM. In conclusion, our data suggest that selenium is not a limiting factor for peripheral T(4)-to-T(3) conversion in CH patients. In contrast, we find indirect evidence that SeM improves thyroid hormones feedback at the hypothalamo-pituitary level and decreases stimulation of the residual thyroid tissue, possibly suggesting greater intracellular T(4)-to-T(3) conversion."

Streptococcus was isolated singly in 28.2% of cases and in concomitant with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in 71.8%. Major clinical features of streptococcal impetigo, especially caused by group A streptococci, were non-bullous pustules with thick crusted ceiling. Impetigo caused by group G or B streptococci generally formed smaller sized pustules of fewer numbers. Impetigo was usually present, associated with severe eczematous lesions. Various degrees of fever were noticed in 32.8% (group A, 39.8%; group G, 17.6%; group B, 11.8%) during active stages. The lesions on the face often resembled Kaposi's varicelliform eruption in any group. Systemic antimicrobial agents were administered in 71.3% of cases and the remainder were treated with topical antibiotics (oxytetracycline hydrochloride) or disinfectants (povidone-iodine). Recurrence occurred within a month in 38.0% of cases treated with topical agents only and in 17.7% treated with systemic antimicrobial agents.

To determine the efficacy of povidone-iodine (P-I) prophylaxis for ophthalmia neonatorum (ON) in Angola and to document maternal prevalence and mother-to-child transmission rates. Methods. Endocervical samples from mothers (n = 317) and newborn conjunctival smears (n = 245) were analysed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG). Newborns were randomized into a noninterventional group and an interventional group that received a drop of P-I 2.5% bilaterally after conjunctival smear collection. Mothers were trained to identify signs of ON and attend a follow-up visit. Results. Forty-two newborns had ocular pathology, and 11 (4.4%) had clinical signs of ON at the time of delivery. Maternal PCR was positive for MG (n = 19), CT (n = 8), and NG (n = 2). Six newborns were positive for CT (n = 4), MG (n = 2), and NG (n = 1). Mother-to-child transmission rates were 50% for CT and NG and 10.5% for MG. Only 16 newborns returned for follow-up. Conclusions.

CD005253,0,14975516,0,Time to reevaluate the therapeutic use of calcitonin and biological role attributable to parafollicular (C) cells.,"There is rich anecdotal evidence that calcitonin significantly increases bone mineral density and reduces fracture risk. However, observation in a previous study of an increased bone formation in calcitonin-deficient mice has led us to reevaluate the therapeutic use of calcitonin and to investigate the primary role of parafollicular (C) cells of the thyroid gland. We found that C cells are involved mainly in the regulation of follicular cell activity in a paracrine manner and in doing so they may regulate the growth rate in newborn by affecting the thyroid hormone levels in the early postnatal period. In the light of reports that showed thyroid physiology is different between populations and it is affected by environmental factors we suggested that C cells may be involved in population differences in thyroid physiology and environmental adaptation. We conclude that C cells may facilitate the adaptation of the follicular cells to environmental changes, enabling more effective coordinated functions of the body and producing variations between populations."

Recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) is available for the management of patients with thyroid carcinoma, and after its administration the serum TSH levels are similar to those observed in hypothyroid infants with precocious puberty. Our objective was to investigate whether rhTSH increased testosterone secretion in adult males with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Thirty-one adult Caucasian men, ages 18-59 years, with differentiated thyroid carcinoma were studied. While continuing on thyroid hormone therapy, patients received 0.9 mg of rhTSH 24 hours apart. Blood samples were obtained before the first rhTSH dose (day 1) and at 24 hours (day 3) and 72 hours (day 5) after the second rhTSH dose. TSH, total testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were determined. Serum TSH levels were increased at day 3 (129.2 +/- 5.7 micro U/mL) versus day 1 (0.6 +/- 0.2 micro U/mL) but observed differences in total testosterone, LH and FSH throughout the study were not statistically significant.

The persistence of fetal hypothyroidism in spite of maternal thyroid improvement was confirmed by a second cordocentesis at 35 weeks of gestation, and a single injection of intra-amniotic levothyroxine (250 micrograms) was performed. The serial ultrasonographic examinations showed disappearance of the fetal goiter. A healthy female baby (3,630 g) was delivered at term. At birth, the thyroid gland was not enlarged, and neonatal thyroid hormones were within the normal range. This case suggests that cordocentesis is a reliable method to assess the fetal thyroid status; moreover a single injection of intra-amniotic thyroxine was effective in treating fetal hypothyroid goiter."

CD005253,0,7883848,0,"The effects of different doses of oral iodized oil on goiter size, urinary iodine, and thyroid-related hormones.","The prevention of iodine deficiency is still a worldwide concern. This study, conducted in Soja in western Sudan, was carried out to evaluate the effects of a dose of iodized oil sufficient enough to give maximum protection against goiter and provide an acceptable iodine supply without side-effects over a sufficiently long period of time. Adult goitrous subjects (n = 117) were randomly assigned to three groups, A, B, and C, and received a single oral dose of 200, 400, or 800 mg iodine, respectively. Urine and blood samples were collected at the start of the study and monitored for 1 yr. In the 3 groups, mean serum T4 and median urinary iodine and serum TSH values were restored to reference limits, and these were maintained for about 1 yr. In each treatment group, about two thirds of the subjects displayed a reduction in goiter size, and the 400- and 800-mg doses were not more efficient than the 200-mg dose to accomplish normalization of thyroid hormone values. A temporary rise in TSH was noted 1 week after iodine administration in 1, 3, and 10 subjects, respectively, and 1, 0, and 3 subjects showed biochemical signs of thyrotoxicosis during the year after treatment with the 3 different doses. The data indicate that oral administration of 200 mg iodine is effective and acceptable for treating iodine deficiency in adults for 1 yr. Because of the risks of side-effects and the shortage of medical resources, higher doses are not recommended."
CD005253,0,7699215,0,Elevation of cord blood TSH concentration in newborn infants of mothers exposed to acute povidone iodine during delivery.,"The thyroid function in full term newborn infants of 30 pregnant women given topical germicide providine-iodine (PVPI) during delivery was evaluated. For comparison 12 full term newborn infants of pregnant women using clorhexidine hydrochloride as germicide in selective cesarean section were designed as control. The two pregnant groups had similar median age (27.5 yr in PVPI group, range: 19-42 yr and 28.5 yr in control group, 19-40 yr) and gestational age (39 weeks, 38-42 weeks and 39.5 weeks, 38-42 weeks). Birth weight (3365 g, 2500-3860 g and 3265 g, 2850-4000 g) and the apgar score (9, 9-10 and 9, 8-10) of newborn were similar in both groups. Umbilical cord blood samples were taken after immediate clamping and serum total T3, total T4, free T4 and TSH concentrations were assayed by an immunofluorimetric method. T3, T4 and free T4 concentrations in the cord blood were not different in PVPI newborn infants (median values: 0.92 nmol/L, 135 nmol/L, and 15.9 pmol/L), in comparison to control newborns (0.97 mmol/L, 140.9 nmol/L and 17.3 pmol/L). In contrast, cord blood TSH concentration in newborn infants of PVPI pregnant women (median value: 6.47 mIU/L) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than in control newborn infants (4.8 mIU/L). In PVPI exposed group 14 out of 30 newborn infants had TSH concentration above the upper value (6.7 mIU/L) observed in the control groups (X2 = 8.4, p < 0.01). These data suggest that fetal thyroid is susceptible even to acute iodine overload and support the recommendation that PVPI should be avoided during pregnancy."

The complex relationship between thyroid hormone and the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor axis is not completely understood. We investigated age-related differences in serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels in 43 patients with primary congenital hypothyroidism. These patients were classified into five age groups (Group I: 0-1 month, Group II: 1 month-1 year, Group III: 1-5 years, Group IV: 5-9 years, Group V: 9-13 years). Patients diagnosed in the first month of life did not display a significant difference in serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels compared to age-matched controls (p > 0.05). However, in groups II to V, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels were significantly lower than in controls (p < 0.05). Thyroid hormone replacement therapy increased serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels significantly in 26 hypothyroid children (p < 0.05). Although serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels increase in an age dependent manner in normal children, this increment was not observed in hypothyroid children."
CD005253,0,7153056,0,"Serial blood T4 and TSH determinations in low birth weight infants. Influence of gestational age, birth weight and neonatal pathology on thyroid function.","Serial blood T4 and TSH determinations were performed on a total number of 352 low birth weight (LBW) infants: 210 healthy newborns and 142 infants affected by respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), sepsis, hyperbilirubinaemia, hypocalcemia, or hypoglycemia. The healthy infants have been divided into three groups in relation to gestational age (less than or equal to 33 wk, 34-36 wk, greater than or equal to 37 wk). Statistical evaluation among groups shows that reduced T4 concentration in LBW infants is strictly related to gestational age, while TSH failed to demonstrate any significant correlation. No significant influence of birth weight on T4 and TSH has been observed. The preterm newborns affected by RDS or sepsis showed a significant reduction of mean T4 concentrations up to 20th day of life when compared with healthy controls similar for gestational age and birth weight. TSH levels are not significantly different. No significant modifications of T4 and TSH have been found related to the other pathological conditions. The significant reduction of T4 and the high incidence of subjects with low T4 values observed in healthy and sick preterm population lend further support to the use of TSH determination for optimum screening of congenital hypothyroidism."
CD005253,0,11435461,0,Thyroid hormone--sympathetic interaction and adaptive thermogenesis are thyroid hormone receptor isoform--specific.,"In newborns and small mammals, cold-induced adaptive (or nonshivering) thermogenesis is produced primarily in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Heat production is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system, but it has an absolute requirement for thyroid hormone. We used the thyroid hormone receptor-beta--selective (TR-beta--selective) ligand, GC-1, to determine by a pharmacological approach whether adaptive thermogenesis was TR isoform--specific. Hypothyroid mice were treated for 10 days with varying doses of T3 or GC-1. The level of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), the key thermogenic protein in BAT, was restored by either T3 or GC-1 treatment. However, whereas interscapular BAT in T3-treated mice showed a 3.0 degrees C elevation upon infusion of norepinephrine, indicating normal thermogenesis, the temperature did not increase (<0.5 degrees C) in GC-1--treated mice. When exposed to cold (4 degrees C), GC-1--treated mice also failed to maintain core body temperature and had reduced stimulation of BAT UCP1 mRNA, indicating impaired adrenergic responsiveness. Brown adipocytes isolated from hypothyroid mice replaced with T3, but not from those replaced with GC-1, had normal cAMP production in response to adrenergic stimulation in vitro. We conclude that two distinct thyroid-dependent pathways, stimulation of UCP1 and augmentation of adrenergic responsiveness, are mediated by different TR isoforms in the same tissue."
CD005253,0,4077564,0,"Head circumference, height, bone age and weight in 103 children with congenital hypothyroidism before and during thyroid hormone replacement.","Head circumference, height, bone age and weight were studied in 103 children with congenital hypothyroidism before and up to 8 years of thyroid replacement therapy. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to the age at start of treatment: group I (diagnosed by neonatal screening): less than 2 weeks (n = 55); group II: 1-3 months (n = 7); group III: 4-12 months (n = 15); group IV: greater than 1 year of age (n = 26). Before treatment, group I showed a head circumference significantly larger than normal and a delay in bone maturation in the presence of normal length and weight. In the other groups length as well as bone age were significantly lower than normal, head circumference, in contrast, was normal (groups II and III) or even increased (group IV). During therapy, head circumference and bone age of group I became normal as were length and weight from the beginning. In the other groups, therapy led to a further increase of head size resulting in a mean head circumference significantly larger than normal during 8 years of observation in group IV. There was a catch-up of height, bone age and weight in groups II, III and IV; mean height of late treated children (group IV), however, remained significantly lower than normal even after 8 years of therapy. - Our study shows that congenital hypothyroidism is associated with increased head circumference, either absolutely or in relation to stature. Thyroid hormone therapy resulted in a normalization of head growth when treatment was initiated early, and in a further increase when treatment was started late. There was a catch-up of height, bone age and weight; complete normalization, however, occurred only in those children treated before one year of age."

CD005253,0,10696788,0,Postulated human sperm count decline may involve historic elimination of juvenile iodine deficiency: a new hypothesis with experimental evidence in the rat.,"Human sperm count studies, historic dietary iodination, and an animal model where neonatal goitrogen administration causes unprecedented testis enlargement, together suggest an hypothesis relevant to the postulated fall in human sperm counts. We present the hypothesis with a supporting study extending the model to include iodine deficiency. In a one-generation rat reproduction study, dams were fed an iodine sufficient (control, 200 ppb I) or deficient (low iodine diet [LID], <20 ppb I) diet from prebreeding through weaning, when male offspring were divided into three groups: 1) controls from iodine sufficient dams, 2) neonatal LID (NLID) from the LID dams, fed control diet postweaning, and 3) chronic LID (CLID) from LID dams, fed a moderate LID (40 ppb I) postweaning. F1 males were euthanized on postnatal day (PND) 133+/-1. Each of the three diet groups comprised two subgroups in which testicular parameters were evaluated: 1) daily sperm production (DSP), sperm motility, morphology, and histopathology, and 2) Sertoli cell and round spermatid morphometry. In the first subgroup, NLID and CLID testes weights were 8.5% and 14.0% heavier than their unusually heavy controls (3.921 g; historical control mean approximately 3.5 g), with proportional DSP increases. Sperm motility, morphology, and testis histopathology were unaffected. In the morphometry subgroup, respective increases in NLID and CLID rats included testes weights (+28.6% and +20.3%), Sertoli cells (+24.8% and +23.9%), and round spermatids (+20.4% and +15.8%). The results indicate that neonatal iodine deficiency can significantly increase spermatogenic function in rats, and support our hypothesis concerning human sperm counts."

CD005253,0,6321866,0,Influence of ACTH on serum hormone content and its anticonvulsant action towards infantile spasms.,"Ten patients with infantile spasms were treated with ACTH, which resulted in a suppression of thyroxine through an increase of the serum cortisol level and suppression of pituitary TSH secretion. The thyroxine level in the excellent-response group was suppressed more than that in the other groups. There was a statistically significant difference (t-test, p less than 0.01) in the suppression of T4 between the excellent-response group and the others. Although the high cortisol level was essential for the clinical effectiveness of ACTH therapy and the suppression of the thyroid hormones, the therapeutic correlation with the elevated cortisol level might be weak as compared to that with the suppression of T4. These findings suggest the possibility that the efficacy of ACTH therapy in infantile spasms may depend in part on the suppression of the thyroid hormone."
CD005253,0,26857284,0,Can postpartum maternal urinary iodine be used to estimate iodine nutrition status of newborns?,"I deficiency can lead to detrimental effects, particularly in neonates and young infants. The aim of this study was to explore whether postpartum maternal urinary I can be used to estimate the I status of newborns. In this cross-sectional study conducted in Tehran, lactating mothers and newborns, within 3-5 d postpartum, were randomly selected. Urine samples were collected from each mother and newborn, and a heel-prick blood sample was obtained from all newborns as part of the routine national newborn screening programme. According to the WHO criteria, median urinary I concentration (UIC) 5 mIU/l was considered as I insufficiency. A total of 147 postpartum women and neonates, aged 27·8 (SD 5·3) years and 4·2 (SD 0·6) d, respectively, completed this study. The median UIC was 68·0 (interquartile range (IQR) 39·4-133·5) and 212·5 (IQR 92·3-307·3) µg/l in postpartum mothers and newborns, respectively. The median neonatal TSH was 1·00 (IQR 0·50-1·70) mIU/l. There was no significant difference in the neonatal UIC and TSH of infants whose mothers had deficient and sufficient urinary I. In the multiple linear regression, neonatal UIC value was associated with maternal urinary I (P=0·048) and parity (P=0·039); a significant association was observed between neonatal TSH and infant sex (P=0·038) and birth weight (P=0·049). The findings of our study demonstrate that, despite postpartum mothers being mildly I deficient, I status of their infants was adequate as assessed by UIC and TSH values. It seems factors other than maternal urinary I may influence the I status in newborns."
CD005253,0,934210,0,Low thyroid hormones and respiratory-distress syndrome of the newborn. Studies on cord blood.,"To investigate the relation between thyroid function and respiratory-distress syndrome we determined thyroid hormone in cord serum from 39 term and 120 premature newborns. In groups matched for gestational age (33 to 37 weeks) and body length, after exclusion of newborns with birth asphyxia, maternal diabetes and delivery by cesarean section, the newborns with respiratory distress syndrome had significantly lower cord tri-iodothyronine index, higher ratio of thyroxine to tri-iodothyronine and higher thyrotropin concentration than those without syndrome (P less than 0.05 or less). Conversely, the frequency and severity of respiratory-distress syndrome were higher in newborns who had low cord tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine concentration, low free tri-iodothyronine index and high thyrotropin levels. These observations show an association between low thyroid activity at birth and respiratory-distress syndrome and are in accord with animal studies showing accelerated lung maturation due to thyroxine administration."
CD005253,0,27534628,0,Suggested use of sensitive measures of memory to detect functional effects of maternal iodine supplementation on hippocampal development.,"Maternal hypothyroxinemia secondary to iodine deficiency may have neurodevelopmental effects on the specific neurocognitive domain of memory. Associated disruption of thyroid hormone-dependent protein synthesis in the hippocampus has the potential to result in compromised development of the structure with consequential impairments in memory function. Despite links between maternal iodine deficiency during gestation and lactation and abnormal hippocampal development in rat fetuses and pups, there has been little research on the specific function of memory in human infants and young children born to iodine-deficient mothers. Several candidate measures have proven to be sensitive to the effects of gestational iron deficiency on memory function in infants and young children, including habituation and dishabituation, imitation-based tasks, and event-related potentials. Such measures could be used to test the effects of maternal iodine supplementation on the specific neurocognitive domain of memory in infants and young children. Furthermore, progress in understanding the effects of maternal iodine supplementation on neurocognitive development could be accelerated by the development of a nonhuman primate model to complement the rodent model."

Although short-term use in pregnancy has been described in cases of fetal supraventricular tachycardia, there are few reports on the chronic use of the drug. In this paper we describe our experience with amiodarone treatment in two pregnant sisters with familial dilatative cardiomyopathy and ventricular malignant extrasystole. Prolonged administration of amiodarone (400-200 mg/die) since the beginning of pregnancy did not have any adverse effects; maternal and neonatal thyroid function was normal, as was the neurological and motor development of the neonates."

The significance of maternal and foetal parameters.,"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy may be dangerous to the infant. The major risks are prematurity and neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The latter may be due to placental transfer of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins from mother to fetus. Of two siblings of a previously thyrotoxic mother the first had marked symptoms of neonatal thyrotoxicosis after a pregnancy where no antithyroid treatment was given. The second child had only minimal thyrotoxic symptoms but almost as high levels of thyroid hormones as the first. During the second pregnancy propylthiouracil was given to the mother from 26 weeks' gestation, because of increased fetal movements and fetal tachycardia. Fetal movements and fetal heart rate were considered to be most valuable indicators of thyroid function in the fetus. Intense control is necessary from the beginning of the second trimester."

Mean cord calcium concentrations were similar for term and premature infants. Serum calcium concentrations fell in both term and premature infants at 48 hr, but decreased more in the premature infants (from 10.23 +/- 0.30 to 8.74 +/- 0.19 mg/dl) than in the term infants (from 10.5 +/- 0.26 to 9.6 +/- 0.23 mg/dl). Serum calcium values increased from 48 hr to 7 days in both groups, and there was no significant difference between term and premature infants' serum calcium concentrations (10.6 +/- 0.28 and 10.12 +/- 0.3 mg/dl, respectively) at that time. There was no significant difference between term and premature cord serum magnesium concentrations. Serum magnesium concentrations increased similarly by 48 hr in both groups and remained at these concentrations at 7 days of life. Serum HCT concentrations were elevated above normal adult levels (71.9 +/- 6.6 pg/ml, 81% less than 100 pg/ml, n = 63) in both premature and term cord sera, but premature cord concentrations (146 +/- 24 pg/ml) were significantly higher than term cord concentration (91 +/- 21 pg/ml). Both term and premature infants displayed a 2-3-fold increase in serum HCT by 48 hr and a partial fall by 7 days to concentrations still above those seen in cord sera (Fig. 1). Nine of 10 premature and 9 of 10 term infants had undetectable PTH concentrations in cord sera. In two premature infants, PTH serum concenttration remained undetectable at 48 hr. However, the majority of both premature and term infants had elevated levels of PTH at 48 hr. The mean PTH concentrations were lower but still elevated at 7 days with the suggestion of higher concentrations in premature infants (Fig 2). There were no significant differences in serum 25-OHD concentrations between term and premature sera at birth or at 7 days. There was a weakly positive correlation between 25-OHD and cord calcium (r = 0.45, P less than 0.05), and a negative correlation between cord calcium and 48-hr PTH (r = -0.53, P less than 0.01). Calcium and magnesium were significantly positively correlated in 48-hr (r = 0.83) and 7-day (r = 0.84) sera in premature infants but not in term infants.

A total of 44 cases of CH was found out of them 13 cases of athyreosis, 3 cases of ectopic thyroid and 28 cases of dyshormonogenesis (among them 5 cases with goiter and 23 cases without goiter). The average incidence of CH was 1:6874. Until January 1st, 1988 (when only T4 estimation was used as a first step) the recall rate was 2.32% and the treatment was started before 25th day after birth, while after the use of TSH by IRMA from dry blood spot in suspected cases (i.e. after January 1st, 1988) the recall rate decreased to 0.82% and the treatment was started before 14th day of life. In addition, the data on 39 cases of TBG deficiency and on regional differences in their incidence are reported. Some remarkable differences in the incidence of total CH and of its individual variants between West, Central and East Slovakia with different historical, cultural, economical and genetical background as well as in some ethnic groups (Gypsies) are also presented."

There are no new data on the diagnosis or treatment of neonatal chlamydial or gonococcal infections. New data on the efficacy of neonatal ocular prophylaxis are limited. Two recent studies from Iran and Brazil suggest that povidone-iodine may not be effective for prevention of chlamydial or gonococcal ophthalmia. Prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women, which has been demonstrated to be very effective for the prevention of neonatal gonococcal ophthalmia, is the most effective strategy for preventing neonatal chlamydial infection."
CD005253,0,20539120,0,Reconstruction of radiation doses in a case-control study of thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl accident.,"A population-based case-control study of thyroid cancer was carried out in contaminated regions of Belarus and Russia among persons who were exposed during childhood and adolescence to fallout from the Chernobyl accident. For each study subject, individual thyroid doses were reconstructed for the following pathways of exposure: (1) intake of 131I via inhalation and ingestion; (2) intake of short-lived radioiodines (132I, 133I, and 135I) and radiotelluriums (131mTe, 132Te) via inhalation and ingestion; (3) external dose from radionuclides deposited on the ground; and (4) ingestion of 134Cs and 137Cs. A series of intercomparison exercises validated the models used for reconstruction of average doses to populations of specific age groups as well as of individual doses. Median thyroid doses from all factors for study subjects were estimated to be 0.37 and 0.034 Gy in Belarus and Russia, respectively. The highest individual thyroid doses among the subjects were 10.2 Gy in Belarus and 5.3 Gy in Russia. Iodine-131 intake was the main pathway for thyroid exposure. Estimated doses from short-lived radioiodines and radiotelluriums ranged up to 0.53 Gy. Reconstructed individual thyroid doses from external exposure ranged up to 0.1 Gy, while those from internal exposure due to ingested cesium did not exceed 0.05 Gy. The uncertainty of the reconstructed individual thyroid doses, characterized by the geometric standard deviation, varies from 1.7 to 4.0 with a median of 2.2."

CD005253,0,8087723,0,Thyroid function in healthy and sick neonates.,Low serum thyroid hormone concentrations are frequently observed in critically ill patients. Low-birth-weight preterm infants have also been reported to contain lower serum thyroxine (T4) levels when compared with normal term infants. Investigating the differences of the thyroid function between sick and healthy term and preterm infants becomes a worthwhile task.
CD005253,0,1287557,0,Plasma thyroid hormones and prolactin in premature infants and their mothers after prenatal treatment with thyrotropin-releasing hormone.,"We assayed TSH, triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and prolactin (PRL) in plasma of women and infants participating in a trial of prenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) treatment for prevention of newborn lung disease. Women in labor at 26-34 wk of gestation received 400 micrograms of TRH i.v. every 8 h (one to four doses) plus 12 mg betamethasone (one or two doses); controls received saline plus betamethasone. Mean cord concentrations in control infants were TSH 9.7 mU/L, triiodothyronine 0.6 nmol/L (40.2 ng/dL), free thyroxine 14.4 pmol/L (1.13 ng/dL), and PRL 67.6 micrograms/L. TRH increased maternal plasma TSH by 100% at 2-4 h after treatment and decreased levels by 28-34% at 5-36 h. In cord blood of treated infants delivered at 2-6 h, TSH, triiodothyronine, and PRL were all increased about 2-fold versus control, and free thyroxine was increased 19%; the response was similar after one, two, three, or four doses of TRH. In treated infants delivered at 13-36 h, cord TSH and triiodothyronine levels were decreased 62 and 54%, respectively, and all thyroid hormones were lower after birth at 2 h of age versus control. We conclude that prenatal TRH administration increases thyroid hormones and PRL in preterm fetuses to levels similar to those normally occurring at term. Pituitary-thyroid function is transiently suppressed after treatment to a greater extent in fetus than mother, and infants born during the early phase of suppression do not have the normal postnatal surge in thyroid hormones."

Apropos of 82 cases].,"Systematic neonatal screening of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) allowed to detect 82 children (62 girls and 20 boys) including 73% with ectopic thyroid, 18% with athyreosis and 9% with eutopic thyroid. They were followed for 1 to 7 years according to the same protocol. Skeletal maturity was studied according to 2 methods: TW2 and Sempé's numerical. Height growth was compared to the standards for French children. T4 values were normal at all ages, TSH values were slightly higher than standard. Concerning the skeletal maturity the delay observed in boys lessened from age 6 years (TW2 method: less than 25th percentile until 3 years, = 25th from 3 to 5 years, between P25 and P50 by 7 years of age). This delay was less important in children who, at the time of diagnosis (day 15) had an epiphyseal surface greater than or equal to 5 mm2. In girls, it was always above the 25th percentile. The expression of the delay was greater with Sempé's method than with the TW2 method. Thus, early substitutive treatment of CH allows a normal height growth. The skeletal maturity is somewhat abnormal in boys. This could be explained by the high percentage (66.6%) of boys with a small epiphyseal surface during the neonatal period and by a slight under-treatment."
CD005253,0,9832414,0,Mechanism of hypothyroidism action on insulin-like growth factor-I and -II from neonatal to adult rats: insulin mediates thyroid hormone effects in the neonatal period.,"The effects of thyroid hormone deficiency on serum levels and liver messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) were studied in neonatal (until 20 days of life), weaned (22-37 days), and adult (72-87 days) rats, short periods (5, 10, and 15 days) after thyroidectomy (T). Serum levels and liver mRNA expression of IGF-I, plasma and pituitary GH, plasma insulin, and glycemia were measured in all populations; and serum levels and liver mRNA expression of IGF-II were measured only in the neonatal populations. Surprisingly, plasma insulin and GH and serum and liver mRNA expression of IGF-I were found elevated in T neonatal rats, and they decreased in weaned and adult rats and in neonatal rats rendered hypothyroid by mercapto-1-methylimidazole (MMI) treatment (MMI-hypothyroid). T and MMI-treatment of neonatal rats disturbed the normal pattern of progressive decrease of IGF-II with age. A positive correlation between insulin and IGF-I and a poor correlation between GH and IGF-I were found in both hypothyroid neonates (T and MMI-hypothyroid). On the contrary, a positive correlation between GH and IGF-I and a poor correlation between insulin and IGF-I were found for control and T adult rats. Because plasma insulin and GH changed in the same direction in all groups, insulin secretion in T neonatal was suppressed by streptozotocin, and insulin was given to T adult rats. The combined results of these experiments support the idea that the effects of thyroid hormones on IGF-I secretion are age-dependent, and they are mediated mainly by insulin during the neonatal period and by GH during adulthood."
CD005253,0,9160396,0,Effect of prenatal T4 treatment in neonatal morbidity: preliminary findings.,"We report our experience with the use of intra-amniotic thyroxine to accelerate fetal maturation in preterm delivered infants. One hundred and fourteen infants who had received 500 micrograms of thyroxine weekly prenatally until an L/S ratio greater or equal to 2.0 was achieved, were compared to 113 premature infants who had not been given thyroxine or steroids prenatally. After stratification by weight, the relative incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) were compared. A decrease in the incidence of RDS was observed in the infants with birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g who had received more than one dose of intra-amniotic thyroxine. No difference in the incidence of RDS was observed in infants with birth weight of less than 1000 g or over 1500 g. One dose of thyroxine had no effect in decreasing the incidence of RDS, PDA, NEC, and IVH in any of the groups. We conclude intra-amniotic thyroxine seems to decreases the incidence of RDS in very low birth weight infants."
CD005253,0,9439907,0,Congenital hyperthyroidism.,"Congenital hyperthyroidism is a very rare disease. But, for each affected child it has to be considered as a serious condition because of the negative impact of hyperthyroidism on fetal and postnatal development. If the manifestation occurs during fetal life tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, growth retardation and, most significant, prematurity are the consequences. Postnatal signs of hyperthyroidism are irritability, tachycardia, hypertension, poor weight gain and thyroid enlargement. Even cardiac failure may occur if hyperthyroidism is severe and treatment not adequate which explains the high early mortality rate of 16%. The main complication of persistent hyperthyroidism in the neonatal period and during infancy is craniosynostosis. Severe developmental delay or even mental retardation can be the consequence of inadequate high T4-levels during fetal and neonatal life. Congenital hyperthyroidism was first recognized in infants born to mothers with Graves' disease. The description of transplacental passage of the maternal thyroid stimulating antibodies elucidated the molecular mechanism in this major group of patients with ""autoimmune congenital hyperthyroidism"". In contrast to this transient, self-limited character of ""autoimmune congenital hyperthyroidism"", due to the clearance of maternal antibodies from the infant's circulation, some cases of persistent congenital hyperthyroidism without signs of thyroid autoimmunity have been recognized. Activating mutations in the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor were described recently as the underlying molecular pathogenesis in this group of ""non-immune congenital hyperthyroidism"". Therefore the possibility of a molecular differential diagnosis of both groups of congenital hyperthyroidism now exists and opens the opportunity of optimal treatment for each patient."

Effects on labour and on the neonatal course of the newborn were also studied. OAD cream was used for disinfection of the vulva and vagina during prenatal obstetric examinations (1-10 times) and at parturition. Bacteriological specimens were obtained before and after use of the OAD cream, and the total iodine, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) levels were measured in the maternal blood and umbilical cord blood. The overall bacterial eradication rate for the vulva was 74.7% although the eradication rate for coagulase negative staphylococci was low (23.1%). The overall bacterial eradication rate for the vagina was 56.1% although the eradication rates for Candida albicans and Lactobacillus spp. were low (9.1% and 29.4% respectively). There was no significant difference in the types of delivery or complications of labour and delivery between the group treated with OAD cream and the control group, but the duration of labour was prolonged in the former group. There were no malformations among the newborn, and no difference between the group treated with OAD cream and the control group in regard to body weight and length of the newborn at birth, Apgar score, postnatal gain in body weight, or bilirubin level. The maternal blood levels of total iodine, TSH, and T4 were within the normal ranges both during pregnancy and at delivery, but the level of T3 was slightly elevated at delivery. The umbilical cord blood levels of the total iodine, TSH, and T4 were within normal ranges both during pregnancy and at delivery, but the level of T3 was somewhat elevated. At age six days, the T4 level was normal in all the newborn. TSH was higher than 15 microU/ml in two newborns, but returned to normal levels three week later."

Methods for prediction of fetal hyperthyroidism are available, but are not widely used. Clinical assessment of fetal thyroid status by monitoring of fetal heart rate and growth may be inaccurate. This raises some uncertainty in the initial diagnosis of fetal thyrotoxicosis and complicates the assessment of fetal response to maternal propylthiouracil therapy. A case illustrating these pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of fetal hyperthyroidism is presented. The condition was correctly diagnosed, but treatment based on fetal heart rate resulted in biochemical hypothyroidism in the infant at birth. Current recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of fetal hyperthyroidism are reviewed along with recent developments in the field. A modified approach is proposed."

By means of a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for calcitonin precursors, we have measured serum concentrations of procalcitonin in patients with various bacterial and viral infections. 79 children (newborn to age 12 years) in hospital with suspected infections were investigated prospectively. 19 patients with severe bacterial infections had very high serum concentrations of procalcitonin at diagnosis (range 6-53 ng/mL) in comparison with 21 children found to have no signs of infection (baseline concentrations < 0.1 ng/mL). Serum procalcitonin values decreased rapidly during antibiotic therapy. 11 patients with peripheral bacterial colonisation or local infections without invasive sepsis and 18 (86%) of 21 patients with viral infections had concentrations within or slightly above the normal range (0.1-1.5 ng/mL). Among 9 severely burned patients studied in an intensive care unit, the post-traumatic course of procalcitonin concentrations (range 0.1-120 ng/mL) was closely related to infectious complications and acute septic episodes. Concentrations of mature calcitonin were normal in all subjects, whatever procalcitonin concentrations were found. Concentrations of a substance immunologically identical to procalcitonin are raised during septic conditions. Serum concentrations seem to be correlated with the severity of microbial invasion."

Medicolegal autopsy cases (n=120; within 48 h postmortem; survival time, <24 h), including cases of blunt injury (n=9), sharp instrument injury (n=8), fire fatality (n=18), mechanical asphyxiation (n=10), drowning (n=21), poisoning (n=6), hypothermia (n=10), and acute ischemic heart disease (n=38), were examined. Serum and CSF TSH concentrations were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. TSH immunoreactivity in adenohypophysis was quantitatively analyzed. Serum and CSF TSH levels were significantly lower in cases of hypothermia than in the other groups (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). TSH immunopositivity in adenohypophysis was significantly lower in cases of hypothermia, but exhibited a large case-to-case variation for poisoning. These observations suggest that a decrease in serum and CSF TSH levels in hypothermia is related to hypothalamic adenohypophyseal dysfunction."

CD005253,0,1906897,0,Pregnancy in patients with mild thyroid abnormalities: maternal and neonatal repercussions.,"A prospective study was undertaken during pregnancy in 120 euthyroid women presenting with mild thyroid abnormalities (TA): 11 with a past history of thyroid disorder, 44 with goiter, 20 with nodules, and 45 with thyroid autoantibodies. The aims of the study were to assess whether the pattern of thyroid alterations during gestation was different in women with TA compared to that in healthy control pregnant subjects and to evaluate possible obstetrical and neonatal repercussions. The overall prevalence of underlying subtle thyroid abnormalities in the cohort was 17%, probably as the result of the environmental moderately low iodine intake. Despite the intrinsic heterogeneity of the four groups of women with TA, the adaptation of the thyroid to the stress of pregnancy was different from that of the control subjects. Noteworthy were 1) the marked elevation of serum thyroglobulin in women with past history of thyroid disorder, goiter and thyroid nodules; 2) the increase in goiter size in a third of the goitrous women, associated with biochemical evidence of functional stimulation of the gland; 3) the indirect evidence of partial thyroidal autonomy in goitrous patients; and 4) the increase in the number and size of thyroid nodules during gestation. Taken together, the data indicated that pregnancy was associated with a greater thyroidal risk in patients with TA compared to healthy subjects. In relation to thyroid autoimmunity, most patients remained euthyroid during gestation, but in a few cases, TSH was elevated at delivery, suggesting diminished thyroidal reserve. Also, 40% of newborns from mothers with thyroid autoimmunity had elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers at birth, and there was a highly significant correlation between maternal and neonatal thyroid peroxidase antibody titers. Finally, thyroid autoimmunity was clearly associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (13.3 vs. 3.3%; P less than 0.001). Thyroid function in newborns from mothers with TA was normal and not different from that in controls; similarly, obstetrical features were similar in patients with TA and control subjects. In conclusion, pregnancy is associated with a greater thyroidal risk in women with TA, thereby emphasizing a potential link between pregnancy and thyroid disorders. It is recommended that patients with known, even subtle, thyroid abnormalities be closely monitored during pregnancy, in particular those with a goiter, nodules, or thyroid autoimmunity, especially in areas with a moderately low iodine intake, where the prevalence of mild thyroid disturbances is high."

This was a multicenter, nonrandomized prospective study in a tertiary neonatal intensive care setting in which povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate were each used as antiseptic skin preparations over sequential 6-month periods. During the first 6 months of the study when povidone-iodine was in use 9.3% (38 of 408) of catheters were colonized. During the second 6 months of the study when chlorhexidine gluconate was in use, catheter colonization occurred in 4.7% (20 of 418, P = 0.01). Catheter-related bacteremia occurred during only 0.2% (2 of 826) of all catheterizations. Heavy skin colonization before catheter insertion (relative risk, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.9, 7.0), catheterization > or = 72 hours (relative risk. 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.01, 3.8) and gestational age < or = 32 weeks (relative risk, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.02, 3.3) increased colonization risk. Ampicillin infusion (relative risk, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2, 0.7) and 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate cutaneous antisepsis (relative risk, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2, 0.8) were factors associated with decreased colonization risk. We conclude that 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol appears to be more efficacious than 10% povidone-iodine for the prevention of peripheral intravenous catheter colonization in neonates."
CD005253,0,509706,0,Blood thyroxine concentration is lower in low-birth-weight infants.,"From out data bank, we analyzed results for thyroxine concentration in blood samples spotted on filter paper from different age groups (one to nine days postpartum) of our low-birth-weight and normal population. It was significantly lower in the low-birth-weight infants in almost all the age groups, and in both groups it significantly declined after postnatal day 5. The influence of weight is more important in the low-birth-weight population, but does not completely explain the smaller values. The results indicate that blood samples used in screening for congenital hypothyroidism in the neonate should be taken on postnatal days 3 to 5, and if a recall specimen is collected on days 5 to 9, one should expect the thyroxine concentration in the second specimen to be lower than in the first."

We observed a rapid and parallel decrease of both Tg and thyroid-stimulating hormone during the early weeks of therapy. However, Tg was always detectable in the serum of treated (euthyroid) patients. After 34 months of therapy serum Tg was 11.4 +/- 1 ng/ml, a value significantly different (p less than 0.001) from that obtained in normal controls of similar age (23.5 +/- 3 ng/ml). In nine treated children aged more than 2 yr, thyroid-stimulating hormone and Tg were increased after a brief period of decreased L-thyroxine dosage. These data indicate that ectopic thyroid tissue does not involute during thyroxine therapy and, in response to elevations of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, can be stimulated to secrete Tg."
CD005253,0,1580531,0,[Prevention of iodine deficiency disorders in children in the rural African zone].,"The effectiveness of iodinated silicone polymers placed in bore wells for combating goiter in children under 15 years of age was evaluated in two villages in Mali. Of the 581 included children, 367 did and 214 did not receive supplemental iodine. Overall, follow-up data at one year were available for 86% of study subjects. At baseline, Goiter was present in 43.3% of the children in the supplemental iodine group and in 69.2% of controls. Stage G1B predominated in both sexes. After one year, 36% of the goiters had resolved in the supplement group. Effectiveness of iodine supplementation was greater in young children with small goiters. Urinary iodine levels returned to normal by the third month. Iodine levels in the supplemented water remained above 50 micrograms/l throughout the year; daily intake of iodine was 50 to 100 micrograms. In the unsupplemented village, 21 new cases of goiter occurred, for an annual incidence of 40%."
CD005253,0,1543829,0,Drug therapy during pregnancy.,"A randomized prospective trial has shown that folic acid started before conception and continued for the first trimester reduces the risk of recurrence of neural tube defects by 72% in women with a previously affected child. Carbamazepine exposure in utero is associated with a 1% risk of spina bifida. Long-term follow-up of antenatal exposure to phenobarbital and carbamazepine in two groups of infants shows no neurologic differences between the two groups. Magnesium sulfate is more effective in prevention of recurrent eclamptic seizures than phenytoin. During pregnancy, the need for thyroxine increases in many women. Vitamin B6 and ginger are both effective for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. Low-dose aspirin does not change the course of preeclampsia when it is started after the diagnosis is made. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors cause significant disturbances of fetal and neonatal renal function. Prophylactic beta-adrenergic agents fail to prevent prematurity in twins. Oral tocolysis with magnesium chloride or ritodrine is no more effective than observation alone. The risk of primary pulmonary hypertension in the newborn after indomethacin tocolysis is increased with prolonged therapy. Lithium causes polyhydramnios from fetal diabetes insipidus in utero. Treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection with erythromycin during pregnancy does not eliminate the organism from the lower genital tract and does not improve perinatal outcome."

CD005253,0,27750361,0,Thyroid Autoimmunity and Reproductive Function.,"Thyroid hormones are important for normal reproductive function, and maternal thyroid dysfunction has been associated with infertility, miscarriage, preterm birth, and poor neurodevelopment in the offspring. Thyroid autoimmunity is the leading cause of thyroid dysfunction in women of reproductive age. Women with thyroid autoimmunity, even with normal thyroid function, appear to be at a higher risk for poor reproductive outcomes, including miscarriage and preterm birth. Thyroxine replacement in women with thyroid autoimmunity with or without appreciable thyroid dysfunction may improve pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identification and treatment of women with thyroid autoimmunity may optimize reproductive success."
CD005253,0,22574629,0,Severe maternal hypothyroidism corrected prior to the third trimester is associated with normal cognitive outcome in the offspring.,"Concern about potential harmful effects of early maternal hypothyroidism (MH) on fetal brain development has led to calls for universal screening early in, or even before, pregnancy. However, evidence in humans that adverse effects are irreversible if thyroid hormone replacement is initiated after the first trimester is limited. Severe MH due to thyrotropin (TSH) receptor blocking antibodies (Abs) is associated with profound cognitive delay in the offspring if MH is untreated or inadequately treated; here, we sought to determine the outcome if treatment is given in early pregnancy."
CD005253,0,22570966,0,Difficult treatment of consumptive hypothyroidism in a child with massive parotid hemangioma.,"Consumptive hypothyroidism is a rare condition related to massive infantile hemangiomas producing an excess of the thyroid-hormone-inactivating enzyme type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase. We report the first case of consumptive hypothyroidism secondary to a large parotid hemangioma, highlighting the difficulties in selecting an adequate therapeutic strategy. The affected child was initially referred to our center for congenital hypothyroidism with a hypoplastic thyroid gland. L-Thyroxine (L-T4) replacement therapy was started at seven days of life. In the following weeks, the hemangioma rapidly increased in volume and the child developed severe hypothyroidism refractory to high doses of L-T4 therapy. The concentration of reverse triiodothyronine was elevated, suggesting that the underlying cause was an excessive conversion of thyroid hormones by high type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase levels in the tumor. Corticosteroid treatment showed only partial benefit. Introduction of propranolol instead led to normalization of thyroid hormones along with a dramatic involution of the hemangioma."
CD005253,0,22319040,0,Neurodevelopment in children born to hypothyroid mothers restored to normal thyroxine (T₄) concentration by late pregnancy in Japan: no apparent influence of maternal T₄ deficiency.,"The importance of maternal T₄ for brain development prior to the onset of fetal thyroid function has been suggested in basic studies, and a correlation between mild maternal T₄ deficiency in early gestation and disturbance of neurodevelopment in progenies has been shown in large case-control studies. These findings suggest that maternal T₄ deficiency in early pregnancy potentially affects neurointellectual development. On the other hand, no apparent adverse effect in children born to mothers with overt hypothyroidism in Japan has been reported where maternal T₄ had been restored to normal by late pregnancy."
CD005253,0,6244799,0,Hypoglycemia in pregnancy. Occurrence due to adrenocorticotropic hormone and growth hormone deficiency.,"Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia (serum glucose level, 24 mg/dL) developed in a 23-year-old, 147.3-cm-tall woman during her late second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Endocrine studies disclosed insulin levels less than 2 microU/mL; growth hormone level less than 3 ng/mL; and cortisol level less than 1 microgram/dL. Hydrocortisone therapy corrected her hypoglycemia, and she was delivered of a healthy female infant. Postpartum, her evaluation included normal thyroid function studies, a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone response to protirelin (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), normal serum and urine gonadotropin levels, normal serum prolactin, normal sella turcica tomograms, and a normal EMI brain scan. Urine 17-hydroxycorticosteroids increased during a four-day cosyntropin infusion, but failed to rise after metyrapone administration. The growth hormone level failed to rise after stimulation with levodopa and propranolol administration. The patient was believed to have idiopathic partial hypopituitarism, with hypoglycemia being due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and growth hormone deficiency and the drain of maternal glucose by the fetus. It is suggested that pregnant women with symptomatic hypoglycemia be treated with glucocorticoids while awaiting the results of their endocrine evaluation."

CD005253,0,9441554,0,[Therapy of hypo- and hyperthyroidism in pregnancy].,"Therapy of thyroid dysfunction needs a close cooperation between endocrinologist and gynecologist. In addition to a number of metabolic changes during pregnancy, the diaplacentar transfer of different substances (thionamides, antibodies) has to be considered. Pregnant women with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism should be treated using L-Thyroxine with the bTSH between 1 and 2 mU/l. Many of the women need an increase of the L-Thyroxine dose during pregnancy. Overt hyperthyroidism (mostly due to Graves' disease) has to be treated immediately after diagnosis using thionamides. Because thionamides cross the placenta, the dose should be as low as possible with the fT4 in upper level and bTSH in the lower level of normal range. Most studies show, that both methimazole (MI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) can be used in pregnancy. Although PTU is preferred especially in the USA, an advantage of PTU over MI is not proven. Surgery is necessary in only few cases of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy with the optimal time for surgery during the second trimester. In case of subclinical hyperthyroidism and HCG induced hyperthyroidism several controls of thyroid function should be performed to decide whether treatment is necessary."
CD005253,0,3884406,0,Metoclopramide and breast feeding: efficacy and anterior pituitary responses of the mother and the child.,"The purpose of this randomized, double-blind clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of the antidopaminergic agent metoclopramide (MC) in the treatment of puerperal lactational insufficiency, and prolactin, TSH and free thyroxine responses of the mother and the child to this therapy. Therefore, 11 women received MC (10 mg 3 times daily orally) and 14 a placebo for 3 wk. MC increased the serum concentration of PRL from 57.5 + 45.5 U/l to 315.0 + 300.0 U/l (P less than 0.001), and the amount of daily milk yield in 8 women with established lactational deficiency rose from 285 + 75 ml to 530 + 162 ml (P less than 0.01) while the placebo was ineffective. Serum concentrations of TSH and free thyroxine did not change during either of the treatments. Serum concentrations of PRL, TSH and free thyroxine in the infants were similar in both groups and remained unchanged throughout the study. Our results suggest that MC is useful in the treatment of deficient puerperal lactation, and it does not stimulate the pituitary lactotropes or thyrotropes of the nursing infants."

CD005253,0,15169965,0,Iodine toxicity and its amelioration.,"Iodine (I) toxicity is rare in animals and humans, but nuclear explosions that give off radioactive I and excessive stable I ingestion in parts of the world where seaweed is consumed represent specialized I toxicity concerns. Chronic overconsumption of I reduces organic binding of I by the thyroid gland, which results in hypothyroidism and goiter. Bromine can replace I on position 5 of both T(3) and T(4) with no loss of thyroid hormone activity. Avian work has also demonstrated that oral bromide salts can reverse the malaise and growth depressions caused by high doses of I (as KI) added as supplements to the diet. Newborn infants by virtue of having immature thyroid glands are most susceptible to I toxicity, whether of stable or radioactive origin. For the latter, the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in Belarus has provided evidence that KI blockage therapy for exposed individuals 18 years of age and younger is effective in minimizing the development of thyroid cancer. Whether bromide therapy has a place in I toxicity situations remains to be determined."

CD005253,0,17375502,0,Marked insulin resistance in pregnancy: a case report and literature review.,"Pregnancy is usually accompanied by insulin resistance; however, severe insulin resistance in pregnancy requiring massive doses of insulin is rare. We report a case of a 14-year-old with acanthosis nigricans and a strong family history of Type 2 diabetes who exhibited marked insulin resistance during pregnancy. Her treatment included terbutaline for pre-term labor and dexamethasone for fetal lung maturity. Shortly after these interventions, her insulin requirements escalated to 130 units per hour. Multiple insulin regimens were used in her treatment. Investigations were negative for antinuclear antibodies, islet cell IgG auto-antibodies (GAD65 Antibody assay) and insulin antibodies. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone was within normal limits and her C-peptide level elevated at 18 ng/dL [1.1-4.8 ng/L]. A week following cessation of the dexamethasone and terbutaline, her insulin requirements dramatically decreased. We conclude that in pregnant patients with underlying insulin resistance and strong family history of diabetes, the use of agents that antagonize insulin action, such as dexamethasone and terbutaline, can result in massive insulin resistance."

CD005253,0,8372599,0,Thyroxine administration to infants of less than 30 weeks' gestational age does not increase plasma triiodothyronine concentrations.,"Very preterm infants (less than 30 weeks' gestational age) were treated with thyroxine in three different dosage schemes: 10, 8 and 6 micrograms.kg-1 birthweight.day-1 during the first 6 weeks of life. The aim was to prevent transient hypothyroxinemia of the preterm infant. Plasma levels of thyroxine, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, reverse triiodothyronine, thyroxine-binding globulin and thyrotropin were measured weekly. Thyroxine administration increased thyroxine and free thyroxine levels most properly in the 8-micrograms supplementation group. It did not result in a change in plasma triiodothyronine levels. Levels of reverse triiodothyronine increased in relation to the thyroxine dosage. Thyrotropin secretion was suppressed in the 6- and 8-micrograms groups during the first 2 weeks, while in the 10-micrograms group suppression lasted 4 weeks. No clinical adverse effects of thyroxine administration were seen. We conclude that 8 micrograms thyroxine.kg-1 birthweight.day-1 for 6 weeks prevents transient hypothyroxinemia. The finding that plasma triiodothyronine concentrations are not influenced by thyroxine administration suggests a specific maturation process in the deiodination of thyroxine."
