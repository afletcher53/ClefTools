CD011571,0,10743574,0,[Mycophenolate mofetil: a new immunosuppressive drug in dermatology and its possible uses].,"Mycophenolate mofetil represents a new immunosuppressive drug. Several case reports have shown that mycophenolate mofetil has a good therapeutic effect in patients with psoriasis and autoimmune dermatoses. Mycophenolate mofetil is a morpholine ester of mycophenolic acid which was shown in the 1970s to be effective in patients with severe psoriasis. Mycophenolate mofetil has an increased bioavailability as compared to mycophenolic acid and thereby an improved therapeutic window. Currently, mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prevention of organ rejection in transplant patients. The mode of action and the pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil are reviewed and the current clinical experience with this immunosuppressive drug for dermatological disorders is summarized."

CD011571,0,16871248,0,The place of sirolimus in kidney transplantation: can we reduce calcineurin inhibitor renal toxicity?,"Sirolimus, a macrocylic lactone, blocks T-cell activation by a mechanism of action distinct from calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). Therefore, it may be expected that sirolimus would display a safety profile without the vasomotor form of nephrotoxicity characteristic of CNIs. Initial studies in rodent models and in psoriasis patients showed that sirolimus alone did not impair renal function. Subsequently, two pivotal, randomized double dummy, phase III trials in human renal transplantation demonstrated that sirolimus exacerbated the nephrotoxicity of full doses of CNIs. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Subsequent experience has shown that cyclosporin A dose reduction, elimination, or avoidance mitigates these effects, particularly in patients distant from the transplant procedure. However, there is concern about recovery from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Animal models suggesting that sirolimus may delay recovery in this setting have been supported by non-randomized experiences at single centers, which have observed an increased incidence of delayed graft function among sirolimus-treated recipients. In contrast, large single- and multi-center studies have not confirmed this finding; impaired renal recovery has been observed in only occasional instances. Thus, present data indicate that sirolimus does not impair the function of an uninjured kidney, but whether the drug acts alone or potentiates conditions that delay recovery after ischemic injury remains to be established by large randomized trials specifically targeted to recipients at high risk for this complication."
CD011571,0,27608793,0,[Not Available].,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that possibly leads to structural damage and to a reduction of joint function and poor quality of life. Treatment of PsA has changed since its introduction of anti- TNF drugs, which have shown to reduce the symptoms and signs of the disease and slow the radiographic progression. However, recently, the discovery of new pathogenic mechanisms have made possible the development of new molecules that target pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in skin, joint and entheseal inflammation. New drugs like ustekinumab, secukinumab and apremilast inhibit interleukin axis and intracellular pathways and showed their efficacy and safety in randomized clinical trials. These drugs have been recently approved for the treatment of PsA and included in the new EULAR and GRAPPA treatment recommendations. The aim of this paper is to briefly review the clinical trials that led to their approval for PsA."
CD011571,0,28809995,0,Efficacy and Safety of Apremilast in Patients With Moderate Plaque Psoriasis With Lower BSA: Week 16 Results from the UNVEIL Study.,"<p>INTRODUCTION: Many options are available for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Patients with moderate disease, however, are often undertreated and do not achieve satisfactory clearance. UNVEIL (NCT02425826) assessed efficacy and safety of apremilast in patients with chronic moderate plaque psoriasis.</p> <p>METHODS: Patients with psoriasis body surface area (BSA) 5% to 10% and static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 3 (moderate) without prior exposure to systemics were randomized (2:1) to apremilast 30 mg twice daily or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean percentage change in the product of sPGA and BSA scores (PGAxBSA).</p> <p>RESULTS: Of 221 patients (placebo, n=73; apremilast, n=148), >80% had received prior topical therapy. At week 16, apremilast yielded a significantly greater percentage change from baseline in PGAxBSA (-48.1%) vs placebo (-10.2^; P less than 0.0001). Dermatology Life Quality Index scores were significantly improved with apremilast (-4.8) vs placebo (-2.4; P=0.0008). Mean improvements in the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, version II, were greater with apremilast vs placebo for global satisfaction (63.2 vs 48.7; P less than 0.0001) and treatment effectiveness (57.3 vs 38.8; P less than 0.0001). Most adverse events were mild or moderate; most common were diarrhea, headache, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, and vomiting.</p> <p>CONCLUSION: Apremilast was effective and well tolerated, significantly improved quality of life, and was associated with high patient satisfaction in systemic-naive, post-topical patients with moderate plaque psoriasis.</p> <p>ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02425826</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(8):801-808.</em></p>."
CD011571,0,10796842,0,Antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.,"Guttate psoriasis is a distinctive acute form of psoriasis which characteristically occurs in children and young adults. It is closely associated with preceding streptococcal sore throat or tonsillitis. Some authorities have claimed that ordinary (chronic plaque) psoriasis may also be made worse by infection at distant sites. Although many dermatologists have recommended using antibiotics for guttate psoriasis in particular, it is not clear whether they influence the course of either form of psoriasis. Some dermatologists have also recommended tonsillectomy for psoriasis in patients with recurrent streptococcal sore throat."

CD011571,0,11705350,0,Targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha. New drugs used to modulate inflammatory diseases.,"Since its discovery, the understanding of the roles for TNF-alpha in human biology and disease has grown. Receptors for TNF are found on virtually all cell types, and many physiologic processes seem to be altered by TNF-alpha. The understanding of how TNF-alpha is involved in the pathophysiology of diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, has allowed the development of new drugs that can interfere with excess TNF-alpha and thus has allowed novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. As the role of TNF-alpha in other diseases becomes better understood, such TNF-alpha-modulating drugs may find further applications. In the skin, TNF-alpha is prominent cytokine that seems to be important in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and inflammatory skin conditions. Modulating TNF-alpha activity in the skin may provide therapeutic benefits for a variety of skin conditions (Table 4). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels are elevated in skin lesions of psoriasis. A few reports have already suggested that etanercept and infliximab may offer a therapeutic effect in patients with psoriasis. Clinical studies evaluating the true efficacy of these drugs in psoriasis are under way. Specifically, the authors and others are involved in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of etanercept for psoriasis. Thalidomide has been used off-label with some success to treat a number of dermatologic diseases, including several inflammatory skin conditions. Etanercept and infliximab might perhaps prove efficacious for inflammatory skin conditions as well. Finally, it is possible that drugs targeting TNF-alpha may have yet-unrecognized serious side effects. Because TNF-alpha seems to be a central cytokine in UVR-induced apoptosis, the chronic use of TNF-alpha-altering drugs might increase the risk for skin cancers. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha also plays some role in cutaneous wound healing; the effect these drugs might have on this process is also unknown at this time. Certainly, much is already [table: see text] known about TNF-alpha and how it plays many central roles. This understanding has allowed the development of useful new drugs for intractable disease. As the understanding of TNF-alpha and other cytokine biology increases, so will the number of potential therapeutic agents."

CD011571,0,27486641,0,Apremilast (Otezla). No progress in plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.,"When PUVA therapy and immunosuppressants such as methotrexate are ineffective, TNF alpha antagonists are an option for patients with severe plaque psoriasis, in the absence of a better alternative. This is also the case for patients with psoriatic arthritis after failure of a ""disease-modifying"" antirheumatic drug. Apremilast, an oral immunosuppressant that inhibits phosphodiesterase type 4, has been authorised in the European Union for use in these settings. In patients with plaque psoriasis, oral apremilast was compared with subcutaneous etanercept, aTNF alpha antagonist, in a randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial lasting 16 weeks and involving 250 patients in whom other treatments had failed or were inappropriate. This trial failed to show that apremilast was more effective than etanercept. And about one-quarter more patients experienced symptom relief compared with placebo. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, there are no clinical trials comparing apremilast with TNF alpha antagonists, and no interpretable trials of apremilast after failure of a TNF alpha antagonist. In three randomised, double-blind trials including a total of 1493 patients treated for 16 weeks, at least a modest improvement in joint status was reported in about 35% of patients treated with apremilast versus 19% with placebo. This would suggest that apremilast is less effective than a TNF alpha antagonist. In the trial versus etanercept, serious adverse events occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with apremilast versus 1.2% of those treated with the TNF alpha antagonist. The main adverse effects of apremilast are diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, headache, sometimes marked weight loss, and infections. A risk of depression and cardiac arrhythmia must also be taken into account. A risk of cancer in the long-term is likely, given the immunosuppressive action of apremilast. Apremilast is a substrate of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 and accumulates in patients with renal failure. This creates a risk of multiple pharmacokinetic interactions."

CD011571,0,23978809,0,Indications of pediatric tonsillectomy.,"Possible indications for tonsillectomy include sleep apnea and other obstructive sleep-related breathing disorders, recurrent tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA), and other miscellaneous rare conditions. Over the last century indications have changed, with a decrease in infectious causes and an increase in sleep apnea disorders. Sleep apnea in children is difficult to diagnose short of polysomnography (PSG) which is expensive and disturbing, especially in young children. In sleep apnea confirmed by PSG, tonsillectomy relieves the trouble in close to 80% of patients. What remains unclear is how to diagnose sleep-related breathing disorders without PSG and the efficacy of tonsillectomy in this population. Recurrent tonsillitis is generally poorly documented and randomized studies assessing the efficacy of tonsillectomy are sparse. When frequent infections are present for several years (>7 episodes/1 year, >5/2, >3/3) some benefit from tonsillectomy could be found. If fewer infectious episodes are present, the benefit of tonsillectomy is low. Peritonsillar abscess tends to be treated with quinsy tonsillectomy. Some PFAPA and psoriasis children might benefit from tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy for other conditions is not warranted."

Lupus lesions are characterized by a dermo-epidermal dermatitis. Other lesions, vascular or non vascular, are essentially present in association with systemic lupus erythematosus. Acute, subacute and chronic lupus erythematosus are distinguishable according to their clinical aspects, pathological features and evolution. Acute lesions are either localized to the midface or widespread. Subacute lesions may be annular or psoriasiform. Chronic lupus erythematosus includes localized or widespread discoid lupus, lupus tumidus, chilblain lupus and panniculitis. Therapy of cutaneous lupus is mainly based on antimalarials and avoidance of sun irradiation. In refractory cutaneous lupus, no universal guidelines are currently available. Except for acrosyndromes and urticaria-like lesions, vascular lesions may be due to vasculitis or thrombosis. An accurate diagnosis is absolutely necessary since therapy is different in thrombosis and vasculitis. Non vascular and non lupus lesions are numerous, some of them require special treatment such as dapsone for bullous lupus."

Its immunomodulatory effects led us study how immune responses are modified and the possible consequences for vaccinations in clinical practice. This was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 12 weeks of subcutaneous efalizumab treatment of patients with moderate psoriasis. Bacteriophage phiX174 was used as a model neoantigen to assess T-cell-dependent humoral immunity. Tetanus booster vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, and intracutaneous skin tests were administered to further evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses. During efalizumab treatment, both primary and secondary antibody responses to phiX174, including IgM/IgG isotype switch, were reduced. There appeared to be naïve T-cell anergy to a neoantigen (phiX174) during active CD11a blockade, without tolerance to the antigen after efalizumab withdrawal. Secondary humoral immune responses to tetanus booster during treatment were reduced, but antibody titer increases led to protective levels. Responses to pneumococcal vaccination 6 weeks after withdrawal from efalizumab were not affected. Cellular immune responses to intracutaneous recall antigens were reduced during treatment and returned to pretreatment conditions after withdrawal. These results expand our knowledge of how immune responses are modulated in humans by CD11a blockade and have implications for vaccinations of patients treated with this agent."

CD011571,0,346042,0,Mycophenolic acid in psoriasis.,"Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a fermentation product of a penicillium mould which has shown antitumour acitivity in certain animal models. It blocks nucleic acid synthesis by interfering with the interconversions of inosine monophosphate (IMP), xanthine monophosphate (XMP) and guanine monophosphate (GMP) thereby inhibiting growth and/or replication of tumour cells. In vivo activity depends on the presence of a beta-glucuronidase which is abundant in the cell wall of epithelial tissues. Encouraged by results obtained in earlier clinical trials, we have studied 28 patients with psoriasis, 21 in double-blind fashion. A comparison of disease severity in patients before and after receiving MPA versus patients receiving placebo clearly showed the superiority of drug over placebo. The mean severity score of patients receiving MPA as an initial course of therapy improved by 56% versus 9% in patients receiving placebo. Patients receiving MPA after an initial course of placebo therapy showed improvement in their mean severity score averaging 86%. Those patients receiving placebo after an initial course of MPA showed worsening of their mean severity score averaging 70%. Overall, about 75% of MPA treated patients have shown good to excellent responses, and toxicity appears low. Evidence suggests that MPA may be very useful in treating severe psoriasis."
CD011571,0,10390602,0,Mizoribine and mycophenolate mofetil.,"Both mizoribine (MZR) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) are immunosuppressive agents that inhibit the proliferation of lymphocytes selectively, via inhibition of IMPDH. MZR is a nucleoside of the imidazole class, isolated from the culture medium of the mold Eupenicillium brefeldianum M-2166. Although this compound has been found to have weak antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, it has proved ineffective against experimental candidiasis. Unlike azathioprine, this compound is not taken up by nucleic acids in the cell. Instead, after phosphorylation MZR-5 -monophosphate inhibits GMP synthesis by the antagonistic blocking of IMPDH (Ki = 10(-8)M) and GMP- synthetase (Ki =10(-5) M). The drug has been found to inhibit both humoral and cellular immunity, and on this basis it was developed in Japan as an immunosuppressant. MZR has been shown in animal experiments to lack oncogenicity, and has been shown clinically to be associated with a low incidence of severe adverse reactions. MZR has been registered in Japan for the prevention of rejection in renal transplantation, and for the treatment of lupus nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis and the nephrotic syndrome. MMF is the morpholinoethyl ester prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), which was first isolated in 1896 from the culture media of several Penicillium species. MPA has been evaluated for its unique properties as an anticancer, antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial agent, as well as for its therapeutic use in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. MMF was designed to enhance the oral bioavailability of the parent compound. After beneficial effects were observed in animals, the clinical efficacy of MMF as an immunosuppressant in renal transplantation was studied in the United States. In 1995 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of MMF for the prevention of rejection in renal transplantation, the drug also available on a number of European markets."

Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square and logistic regression tests. PASI scores were significantly higher in patients with H. pylori infections. Treatment aimed at eradicating H. pylori infection enhanced the effectiveness of acitretin therapy and shortened response times. Our results suggest that H. pylori infection plays a role in the severity of psoriasis, and that eradicating such infections enhances the effectiveness of psoriasis treatment."

Physicians may hesitate to use systemic or biologic agents in elderly psoriasis patients because of an increased risk of adverse events in this patient population. Small molecule medications are emerging as promising options for elderly patients with psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions. Areas covered: Here we review the efficacy, safety and tolerability of small molecule inhibitors apremilast, tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and peficitinib in the treatment of psoriasis, with focus on their use in the elderly population. Expert opinion: Although small molecule inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in elderly patients with psoriasis, they will require larger head-to-head studies and post-marketing registries to evaluate their effectiveness and safety in specific patient populations. Apremilast, ruxolitinib, and peficitinib are effective agents with favorable side effect profiles; however, physicians should exercise caution when prescribing tofacitinib or baricitinib in elderly populations due to adverse events. The high cost of these drugs in the U.S. is likely to limit their use."

Seventy patients with the former diagnosis were treated with either halcinonide-neomycin-amphotericin or hydrocortisone-iodochlorhydroxyquin ointment combinations on a double-blind parallel comparison basis. Similar results were obtained after both therapies. Thirty patients with symmetrical bilateral lesions of steroid-responsive dermatoses were treated with halcinonide-neomycin-amphotericin cream on the lesions on one side of the body and hydrocortisone-iodochlorhydroxyquin cream on the opposite side. A double-blind design was used in directly comparing the response to each of the two drugs. Considering the results of all dermatoses together the test combination was statistically superior to the control cream (p less than 0-05). However, while numerical superiority of good responses to the halcinonide combination was recorded in psoriasis, no statistical significance could be derived due to the limited number of cases. No side-effects occurred with any drug combination use. In the opinion of the authors halcinonide-neomycin-amphotericin cream and ointment are safe and effective in the treatment of cutaneous candiasis and steroid-responsive dermatoses."
CD011571,0,2383162,0,Ceftriaxone therapy of chronic inflammatory arthritis. A double-blind placebo controlled trial.,"To determine whether chronic inflammatory arthritis may respond to antibiotic therapy (implying a bacterial origin), we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Sixty patients with inflammatory arthritis and antibody titers to Borrelia burgdorferi 1:64 or more were randomized to receive placebo (n = 20) or 2 g/d of ceftriaxone intravenously (n = 40) for 2 weeks. Two of 20 placebo- and 19 of 40 antibiotic-treated patients improved. At 1 month, the placebo-treated patients could elect to receive ceftriaxone. Altogether, 58 patients were treated with ceftriaxone and followed up for 13 to 24 months. Improvement was noted in 27 of the 58 antibiotic-treated patients. Patients with a wide diversity of inflammatory arthritis were studied. Response to ceftriaxone was seen in all groups, including 5 of 12 with rheumatoid arthritis, 5 of 8 with psoriatic arthritis, 3 of 5 with vasculitis, and 14 of 33 with less well-differentiated chronic inflammatory arthritis. In 16 of the 27 who responded to the antibiotic, the arthritis worsened 6 to 18 months after the initial response to ceftriaxone. Previous improvement of arthritis after oral antibiotic was a better predictor of response to ceftriaxone than either duration of disease or Lyme antibody titer. Side effects to ceftriaxone were frequent and included diarrhea (29/60) and acute allergic reactions (9/58). We conclude that some patients may have an occult bacterial infection underlying their chronic inflammatory arthritis, and may respond to antibiotic therapy. The response to ceftriaxone in patients with even weakly reactive Lyme titers encourages further prospective placebo-controlled studies of antibiotics in various subsets of chronic arthritis."
CD011571,0,23569359,0,New developments in the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: a focus on apremilast.,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, most commonly resulting in the occurrence of red and silver scaly plaques. About 30% of psoriasis sufferers develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a disorder that presents with additional joint inflammation and other clinical features. At present, the most effective treatment for moderate and severe psoriasis and PsA are biologics such as antitumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. Biologics are costly and typically require repeated injections; hence, the development of novel, orally available, small molecular inhibitors that are less expensive to produce is highly desirable. The phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast is a small molecular inhibitor that acts by increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, ultimately suppressing tumor necrosis alpha production. Apremilast has been tested in a number of psoriasis and PsA pilot and Phase II trials to evaluate its efficacy and safety. More recently, three larger double-blinded, and randomized multicenter studies demonstrate that apremilast is efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis and PsA, with significantly higher numbers of apremilast-treated patients achieving endpoints of a 75% reduction compared to baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) or American College of Rheumatology-20 scores, relative to placebo. This encouraging data, along with a tolerable incidence of mild to moderate adverse events, has led to the initiation of several large Phase III trials that aim to further validate apremilast as a treatment for psoriasis and PsA. Here, we provide an overview of the current treatments for psoriasis and PsA, and summarize the findings from multiple Phase II clinical trials where the effects of apremilast in the treatment of psoriasis and PsA patients have been investigated."
CD011571,0,26923915,0,Novel Oral Therapies for Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis.,"Several classes of new oral therapy are in use or in development for the treatment of psoriasis. Despite the high efficacy of biologics, new oral therapies remain important as patients generally prefer this mode of administration and they offer an alternative risk-benefit profile. In this review, we discuss the novel modes of action of these drugs, including modulation of cellular pathways involving diverse targets such as Janus kinase, phosphodiesterase 4, sphingosine 1-phosphate, A3 adenosine receptor and rho-associated kinase 2. We review the available evidence around licensed drugs (apremilast) and drugs that are advanced (tofacitinib) or early (ponesimod, baricitinib, peficitinib, INCB039110, CF101, KD025) in the development pipeline. The key limitations of these oral therapies are their modest efficacy profile (apremilast, ponesimod) and the limitations of their safety profile (tofacitinib, ponesimod), while the evidence for the early pipeline drugs are at phase II level only. Potential niches of current unmet needs include apremilast for patients with concomitant psoriatic arthritis, as combination treatments with biologic therapies, and/or for patients in whom multiple biologic therapies have failed due to immunogenicity and secondary inefficacy. The present knowledge gap regarding these novel drugs includes the need for longer clinical trials or observational studies to evaluate safety, and randomised phase III trials for the early pipeline drugs. We conclude that further research and data are necessary to conclusively establish the role of these agents in the current psoriasis treatment paradigm."
CD011571,0,26243735,0,Apremilast for the treatment of psoriasis.,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by dysregulation of the immune system and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Drugs available for psoriasis show some limits as tolerability and route of administration. Apremilast , Otezla®, is an oral small molecule recently approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

CD011571,0,26220911,0,Apremilast: A Review in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis.,"Apremilast (Otezla(®)) is an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor indicated for the twice-daily treatment of adults with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Its use in these patient populations has been assessed in two phase III clinical trial programmes (ESTEEM and PALACE). At 16 weeks in the two ESTEEM trials, apremilast reduced the severity and extent of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, including nail, scalp and palmoplantar manifestations, versus placebo in adults, with these benefits generally being sustained over 52 weeks of treatment. Similarly, in three PALACE trials (PALACE 1-3), apremilast improved the signs and symptoms of PsA relative to placebo at 16 weeks in adults with active disease despite treatment with conventional synthetic and/or biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. These PsA benefits were generally sustained for up to 104 weeks of treatment; skin involvement, enthesitis and dactylitis also improved with the drug. Apremilast was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being diarrhoea and nausea in the first year of treatment (usually occurring in the first 2 weeks after the first dose and resolving within 4 weeks) and nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection with continued treatment. Although further longer-term and comparative efficacy and tolerability data would be beneficial, the current clinical data indicate that apremilast is an effective and well tolerated option for the management of psoriasis and PsA in adults."
CD011571,0,3092343,0,A prospective study of high-frequency auditory function in patients receiving oral neomycin.,"Orally administered, neomycin is reported to cause ototoxicity rarely. Most reports on hearing loss due to oral neomycin have been case studies. One prospective study of a pediatric sample demonstrated a significant loss of hearing in the frequency range of 2 to 8 kHz in 9 of 17 children. To our knowledge there are no published prospective studies on this type with adult samples and therefore little is known of the true incidence or nature of ototoxicity from oral neomycin. This prospective study presents the results of long-term use of oral neomycin in 30 adult subjects. Hearing sensitivity was serially monitored in the frequency range 250-20,000 Hz. Two of the 30 subjects subsequently revealed ototoxicity. Thus the results of this investigation suggest that clinical use of oral neomycin implies relatively little risk of ototoxicity."

CD011571,0,8554937,0,The pharmacokinetics of 8-methoxypsoralen following i.v. administration in humans.,"1. 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is a naturally occurring photoreactive substance which, in the presence of u.v. light, forms covalent adducts with pyrimidine bases in nucleic acids. For many years, 8-MOP has been used in PUVA therapy for treatment of psoriasis. Recently, the drug has been found to inactivate effectively bacteria spiked into platelet concentrates. The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of 8-MOP administered intravenously in the bactericidal dosage range. 2. Eighteen volunteers were divided into three treatment groups to receive, respectively, 5, 10, and 15 mg 8-MOP infused over 60 min. Frequent arterial samples were gathered, and the blood and plasma were assayed for 8-MOP concentration. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by moment and compartmental population analysis, the latter performed with the program NONMEM. Haemodynamics, ventilatory pattern, and subjective effects were recorded throughout the study. 3. The intravenously administered 8-MOP was well tolerated in all individuals, and no acute toxicity was observed. 4. The pharmacokinetics of 8-MOP were best described by a three-compartment mammillary model in which the volumes and clearances were proportional to weight. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the plasma concentrations were: V1 = 0.045 1 kg-1, V2 = 0.57 1 kg-1, V3 = 0.15 1 kg-1, CL1 (systemic) = 0.010 1 kg-1 min-1, CL2 = 0.0067 1 kg-1 min-1, CL3 = 0.012 1 kg-1 min-1. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the blood concentrations were: V1 = 0.061 1 kg-1, V2 = 1.15 1 kg-1, V3 = 0.21 1 kg-1, CL1 (systemic) = 0.015 1 kg-1 min-1, CL2 = 0.011 1 kg-1 min-1 and CL3 = 0.015 1 kg-1 min-1. 5. The plasma pharmacokinetic model described the observations with a median absolute error of 17%, and the blood pharmacokinetic model described the observations with a median absolute error of 18%. Analysis of the relative concentration of 8-MOP between plasma and red blood cells suggested concentration-dependent partitioning. 6. The addition of 7.5 mg 8-MOP to 300 ml platelet concentrate would produce bactericidal concentrations of 25 micrograms ml-1. Simulations based upon our data show that intravenous administration of 7.5 mg over 60 min would result in systemic concentrations of 8-MOP similar to those observed with conventional PUVA therapy. We conclude that the extensive safety history established in PUVA therapy will be applicable to this new application of 8-MOP."

CD011571,0,30124722,0,Mechanisms Underlying the Clinical Effects of Apremilast for Psoriasis.,"Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease with manifestations resulting from a dysregulated immune response. In psoriatic skin, expression of all phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) isoforms (A-D), part of a family of enzymes known to regulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels and immune homeostasis, is elevated compared with healthy controls. Agents that inhibit the enzymatic activity of PDE4, the predominant PDE in most immune cells, exert well-recognized anti-inflammatory effects. Apremilast is a selective PDE4 inhibitor approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis. In vitro and in vivo investigations have demonstrated the beneficial impact of apremilast treatment on PDE4 activity, inflammatory signal expression, and dermal psoriasiform signs. In patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, treatment with apremilast is associated with significant reductions in plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-17F, IL-17A, IL-22, and tumor necrosis factor-α compared with placebo as early as week 4; decreases in cytokine levels were sustained with continued treatment. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that while changes in IL-17F are the most important predictor of improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores, apremilast exerts synergistic attenuating effects among a key group of cytokines involved in the pathology of psoriasis, and these effects correlate with improved skin symptoms. These in vitro and clinical data demonstrate that the beneficial effects of apremilast on known inflammatory mediators are associated with its clinical efficacy.

Each patient received 3 months each of clomocycline and placebo in random order. Forty patients completed the trial. Twenty-two failed to respond to either treatment, fifteen improved on clomocycline, two improved on placebo and one placebo and one improbed on both treatments. These results are highly significant (P = 0-003) and suggest that clomocycline may suppress pustulation in some patients. The twenty-two 'non-responders' were compared with the eighteen 'responders' for sex, age, length of history and associated psoriasis but no significant differences were found. Difficulties in assessment and the possiblity of improvement deing due to spontaneous remission are discussed. Further follow-up of both groups suggested that clomocycline used over long periods favourably influenced the course of the disease in the 'responder' group."

CD011571,0,12010072,0,Helicobacter pylori infection in skin diseases: a critical appraisal.,"More than 50% of the human population have long-term Helicobacter pylori infection, causing, in some cases, severe diseases such as peptic ulcers and stomach cancer. In the last few years several extra-gastrointestinal disorders have been associated with H. pylori infection. This review summarized the current medical literature, identified through hand searching and MEDLINE research, including our own studies, with regard to H. pylori and skin diseases. From the literature it can be seen that the role of H. pylori in skin diseases is still a controversial subject. Randomized controlled trials with adequate masking and sample sizes are still lacking. The best evidence comes from studies investigating chronic urticaria in which chronic urticaria disappeared in many patients with H. pylori infection after careful eradication of the H. pylori. Moreover, there are promising recent reports of beneficial H. pylori eradication in Behçet's disease, pruritus cutaneus, prurigo chronica, prurigo nodularis and in some patients with lichen planus, but not in rosacea or psoriasis. Before any conclusions with respect to other skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, Schoenlein-Henoch Purpura, Sweet's syndrome, Sjögren syndrome or systemic sclerosis may be drawn, additional randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled studies including adequate diagnostic schedules, sufficient eradication treatment protocols, confirmation of eradication and adequate control groups are needed. The cutaneous pathology of H. pylori is far from being clear, but it is speculated that the systemic effects may involve increased mucosal permeability to alimentary antigens, immunomodulation, an autoimmune mechanism or the impairment of vascular integrity."

CD011571,0,22421457,0,[New therapeutic targets in psoriatic arthritis].,"Registries estimate that one third of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are ""resistant"" to of TNF-alpha blockers. Therefore, the search for new approaches to treatment of this disease may be justified. Currently the treatment options that have proven effective are associated with inhibition of the T cell costimulatory pathway (abatacept and alefacept) and blocking the P40 fraction of IL-12 and IL-23 (ustekinumab). A novel pathway inhibition, which deserves special attention is offered by apremilast. This molecule inhibits phosphodiesterase IV, responsible for hydrolyzing cyclic adenosine monophosphate to adenosine monophosphate, which causes an increase in cAMP. This metabolite is associated with decreased TNF-alpha. It has a modest efficacy (ACR 20 response of 43%), and subsequent studies have shown an improvement in visual analog scale and the SF36 compared to placebo. Currently there are five clinical trials in phase III to assess its effectiveness in parameters of inflammation and radiographic progression. The spectrum of possibilities before treatment failure with anti-TNF alpha, is augmented by the appearance of several reports that show efficacy with the individual use of CD20 inhibitors and IL-1. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the effectiveness of molecules that inhibit signal transduction of cytokines (Anti-JAK) has been proven, so it is possible that in the future they may be used in patients with PsA."

Considering the beneficial effect of benzathine penicillin in chronic plaque psoriasis, but due to the risk of penicillin sensitivity and to its painful parenteral route of administration, we tried oral azithromycin in this single blind randomized case-control trial. 50 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis were enrolled. Of these, 30 randomly selected patients received azithromycin for 48 weeks as a single oral 500 mg daily dose for 4 days with a gap of 10 days (total 24 such courses). The remaining 20 patients received a vitamin C tablet (non-chewable) in the same dosage schedule. Informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled. Though the trial concluded at 48 weeks, patients in the azithromycin-arm were followed for another year to observe any relapse. A significant improvement in PASI score was noted from 12 weeks in the majority of patients in the azithromycin group. At the end of 48 weeks, 18 patients (60%) showed excellent improvement, while 6 patients (20%) showed good improvement and 4 patients (13.33%) showed mild improvement. PASI 75 was 80%. No significant change was seen in lesions in the control group. 2 patients in the study group and 5 patients in the control group did not complete the prescribed duration of study.

Streptococcal infection, especially streptococcal pharyngitis, has been shown to be a significant trigger of psoriasis in some patients, possibly by sensitizing T cells to keratin epitopes in the skin. Due to the role of the palatine tonsils as an immunological organ that may generate autoreactive T cells, tonsillectomy has been investigated as a treatment for psoriasis. Tonsillectomy originally gained acceptance in Japan as a treatment for palmoplantar pustulosis, a condition that shares features with pustular psoriasis. Subsequently, tonsillectomy has been used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and guttate psoriasis. Recently, the first randomized, controlled clinical trial of tonsillectomy was performed. Here, we review the available evidence for the benefit of tonsillectomy as a treatment for palmoplantar pustulosis and psoriasis.

CD011571,0,20699017,0,[Mucocutaneous abnormalities in Chlamydia trachomatis-induced reactive arthritis].,"Reactive arthritis (previously known as Reiters syndrome) is an inflammatory arthritis that is a type of spondyloarthropathy. The disease consists of the classical triad of arthritis, urethritis and conjunctivitis, but mucocutaneous abnormalities also frequently appear: balanitis circinata, keratoderma blennorrhagicum, aphthous ulcers in the mouth and nail disorders. These skin lesions are mainly found in reactive arthritis induced by Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). Reactive arthritis is often triggered by a sexually transmitted infection (Chlamydia trachomatis) or an enteric infection (such as Salmonella or Shigella). It is thought that human antibodies against the pathogen cross-react with the HLA antigen (mainly HLA-B27). To distinguish between reactive arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, screening of the urine or synovium for Ct infection should be carried out. Acute reactive arthritis is treated with NSAIDs as the first choice. In addition, patients may receive an intra-articular injection of glucocorticoids. The mucocutaneous abnormalities respond well to topical glucocorticoids. Although in the Netherlands a Ct induced reactive arthritis is not yet treated with antibiotics, a recent published clinical trial in patients with a chronic Ct induced reactive arthritis showed a significant reduction in complaints in the group treated with a combination of antibiotics for 6 months, compared to the placebo group. Active genitourinary Ct infection should be treated with antibiotics, the first choice being azithromycin 1000 mg as a single dose. It is important that the patient's partner is tested at the same time and if necessary treated simultaneously to prevent reinfection."
CD011571,0,27272887,0,The Clinical and Cost Effectiveness of Apremilast for Treating Active Psoriatic Arthritis: A Critique of the Evidence.,"As part of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) single technology appraisal (STA) process, the manufacturer of apremilast was invited to submit evidence for its clinical and cost effectiveness for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) for whom disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been inadequately effective, not tolerated or contraindicated. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper provides a description of the ERG review of the company's submission, the ERG report and submission and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (December 2015). In the company's initial submission, the base-case analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £14,683 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for the sequence including apremilast (positioned before tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-α inhibitors) versus a comparator sequence without apremilast. However, the ERG considered that the base-case sequence proposed by the company represented a limited set of potentially relevant treatment sequences and positions for apremilast. The company's base-case results were therefore not a sufficient basis to inform the most efficient use and position of apremilast. The exploratory ERG analyses indicated that apremilast is more effective (i.e. produces higher health gains) when positioned after TNF-α inhibitor therapies. Furthermore, assumptions made regarding a potential beneficial effect of apremilast on long-term Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression, which cannot be substantiated, have a very significant impact on results. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC), when taking into account their preferred assumptions for HAQ progression for patients on treatment with apremilast, placebo response and monitoring costs for apremilast, concluded that the addition of apremilast resulted in cost savings but also a QALY loss. These cost savings were not high enough to compensate for the clinical effectiveness that would be lost. The AC thus decided that apremilast alone or in combination with DMARD therapy is not recommended for treating adults with active PsA that has not responded to prior DMARD therapy, or where such therapy is not tolerated."

Significant differences in ACR20 response rate were revealed between secukinumab 150 mg and apremilast 20 mg [relative risk; RR = 2.55 (CI-confidence interval; 1.24, 5.23)] and between secukinumab 300 mg and apremilast 20 or 30 mg [RR = 3.57 CI (1.48, 8.64) and RR = 2.84 CI (1.18, 6.86), respectively]. Any AEs occurred more often in apremilast 20 and 30 mg compared with placebo [RR = 0.58 CI (0.45, 0.74) and RR = 0.58 CI (0.45, 0.75), respectively] but also compared with secukinumab 150 mg [RR = 0.54 CI (0.35, 0.81) and RR = 0.45 CI (0.35, 0.82), respectively]. No significant differences were revealed for SAEs among biologics and between biologics and placebo. In the overall population, as well as in the anti-TNF-α-naive subpopulation, secukinumab at a dose of 300 and 150 mg was ranked the highest for the ACR20 endpoint, while in the anti-TNF-α-experienced subpopulation, secukinumab 300 mg and apremilast 30 mg revealed the highest rank. Secukinumab 75 mg was the safest drug in terms of any AEs, but for SEAs the safest was ustekinumab 90 mg. Our study revealed no significant differences among non-anti-TNF-α biologics in the treatment of PsA in the comparisons performed with regards to the highest efficacy and safety. Both in the overall population and in the analyzed subpopulations, secukinumab 300 mg was ranked the highest for the ACR20 response rate. Secukinumab 300 mg was the safest drug in terms of any AEs, and ustekinumab 90 mg presented the lowest overall risk of SAEs. Head-to-head trials and evaluation of comparative efficacy and safety between non-TNF-α biologics are warranted to inform clinical decision making with a relevant treatment paradigm."
CD011571,0,26692125,0,A new therapeutic for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: apremilast.,"Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disease. Being a life-long condition, a prolonged and safe control of the disease is needed. Current anti-psoriatic treatments show some limits in terms of tolerability and route of administration. Recently, a new oral small molecule, apremilast, has been approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor that regulates the transduction of intracellular signals, including pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways. Because of the favorable safety profile and the oral route of administration, apremilast may represent a promising therapeutic target for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. In this review, we report an updated overview about clinical trials testing apremilast in the treatment of psoriasis and seek to provide comprehensive information about this anti-psoriatic drug and a future perspective of the therapeutic algorithm for psoriasis."

CD011571,0,23750651,0,The association of sore throat and psoriasis might be explained by histologically distinctive tonsils and increased expression of skin-homing molecules by tonsil T cells.,"Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of the palatine tonsils in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, particularly among patients with recurrent throat infections. However, the underlying immunological mechanism is not well understood. In this study we confirm that psoriasis tonsils are infected more frequently by β-haemolytic Streptococci, in particular Group C Streptococcus, compared with recurrently infected tonsils from patients without skin disease. Moreover, we show that tonsils from psoriasis patients contained smaller lymphoid follicles that occupied a smaller tissue area, had a lower germinal centre to marginal zone area ratio and contained fewer tingible body macrophages per unit area compared with recurrently infected tonsils from individuals without skin disease. Psoriasis patients' tonsils had a higher frequency of skin-homing [cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA(+) )] CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and this correlated significantly with their frequency of blood CLA(+) T cells. The psoriasis patients also had a higher frequency of tonsil T cells expressing the interleukin (IL)-23 receptor that was expressed preferentially by the CLA(+) T cell population. In contrast, recurrently infected tonsils of individuals without skin disease had a higher frequency of tonsil T cells expressing the activation marker CD69 and a number of chemokine receptors with unknown relevance to psoriasis. These findings suggest that immune responses in the palatine tonsils of psoriasis patients are dysregulated. The elevated expression of CLA and IL-23 receptor by tonsil T cells may promote the egression of effector T cells from tonsils to the epidermis, suggesting that there may be functional changes within the tonsils, which promote triggering or exacerbation of psoriasis."

CD011571,0,6090019,0,Ceftizoxime treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue infections.,"Forty-seven adults with infected cutaneous lesions including decubitus ulcers, leg ulcers, cellulitis, pyoderma, and infected dermatitis were treated in a randomized single-blind study with ceftizoxime (2 gm/day, administered intravenously) or cefamandole (4 gm/day, administered intravenously). The duration of treatment ranged from five to 17 days with ceftizoxime and from six to 14 days with cefamandole. Both gram-positive cocci (mostly Staphylococcus sp) and gram-negative bacilli were cultured from the infected areas before treatment. Clinical and bacteriological responses to both drugs were excellent. Ceftizoxime at a dosage of 1 gm twice daily proved to be at least as effective as 1 gm of cefamandole given four times daily. Both drugs were well tolerated, effective, and safe in the treatment of skin and skin-structure infections. Neither drug therapy had to be discontinued because of adverse effects."

CD011571,0,22491250,1,Improvement of psoriasis after tonsillectomy is associated with a decrease in the frequency of circulating T cells that recognize streptococcal determinants and homologous skin determinants.,"Exacerbation of chronic psoriasis can be associated with streptococcal throat infections, and T cells that respond to peptide sequences common to streptococcal M proteins and skin keratins have been detected in patients' blood. To our knowledge, we have conducted the first blinded, prospective study to assess the impact of tonsillectomy on psoriasis. Twenty-nine patients with chronic psoriasis and history of exacerbation after sore throat were randomly assigned to tonsillectomy (n = 15) or control (n = 14) groups and monitored for 2 y clinically and by enumeration of circulating skin homing T cells that respond to short homologous M protein or keratin peptides. Thirteen patients (86%) showed sustained improvement after tonsillectomy ranging from 30 to 90% reduction in disease severity. Furthermore, there was a close correlation between the degree of clinical improvement in individual patients and reduction in the frequency of peptide-reactive skin-homing T cells in their circulation. No corresponding clinical or immunologic changes were observed among the controls. These findings indicate that tonsillectomy may have a beneficial effect on chronic psoriasis because the palatine tonsils generate effector T cells that recognize keratin determinants in the skin."

The effects of apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor, on pruritus, skin discomfort/pain, and patient global assessment of psoriasis disease activity (PgAPDA) were assessed in moderate/severe chronic plaque psoriasis patients in the phase 3 ESTEEM trials. Significant improvements in pruritus and skin discomfort/pain observed at Week 2 with apremilast versus placebo (both studies, p < 0.0001) were sustained through Week 32. Among apremilast-treated patients, improvements in pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) scores correlated with Dermatology Life Quality Index scores (rs = 0.55 [Week 16], rs≥0.51 [Week 32]; both studies, p < 0.001). PgAPDA correlated with improvements in pruritus (rs≥0.56 [Week 16]; rs≥0.53 [Week 32]; both studies, p < 0.001) and skin discomfort/pain (rs ≥0.54 [Week 16]; rs≥0.53 [Week 32]; both studies, p < 0.001) VAS scores.

CD011571,0,19150270,0,Mycophenolate mofetil in dermatology.,"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a medication used to treat psoriasis in the 1970s until side effects and the concern of carcinogenesis led to its discontinuation. The prodrug, MMF, emerged decades later in the transplant field. Dermatologists have since used MMF off-label to treat various inflammatory skin conditions, with most research concentrating on its use in psoriasis, autoimmune blistering disorders, dermatitides, and connective tissue disorders. The appeal of MMF is predicated upon its lymphocyte specificity and consequent decreased toxicity profile. These attributes may make it a preferable treatment option. Its use in the field of dermatology is currently limited by a lack of randomized controlled trials, potential unknown side effects, and cost of treatment. In reviewing both current literature and our own clinic records, MMF appears to be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of cutaneous inflammatory diseases."
