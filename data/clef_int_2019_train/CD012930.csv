CD012930,0,24085591,0,ACCORD COPD II: a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the 12-week efficacy and safety of twice-daily aclidinium bromide in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.,Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist approved for the long-term maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This 12-week phase III study evaluated efficacy and tolerability of aclidinium 200 or 400 μg in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.
CD012930,0,20477569,0,Formoterol fumarate inhalation solution (Perforomist) for COPD.,"Formoterol fumarate is an effective treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with moderate or greater severity of airflow obstruction. Published studies indicate that formoterol has a rapid onset of bronchodilation, which may enhance compliance, and sustained bronchodilation over 12 h, which produces a cumulative effect when inhaled twice daily. With long-term use, formoterol fumarate increases trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s and improves measures of hyperinflation, which correlate with relief of symptoms and a decreased need for additional short-acting bronchodilators as rescue treatment. The combination of formoterol with anticholinergic bronchodilators, especially the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium, appears to further improve bronchodilation, decrease hyperinflation, improve symptoms and decrease the need for rescue therapy, compared with either agent alone. The availability of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution (Perforomist) for treatment of COPD now extends these benefits to patients who prefer nebulizer therapy and/or cannot use metered-dose or dry-powder inhalers effectively."
CD012930,0,19431081,0,"Aclidinium bromide, a novel long-acting muscarinic M3 antagonist for the treatment of COPD.","Aclidinium bromide is a novel, inhaled, long-acting antimuscarinic agent being developed by Almirall Prodesfarma SA and Forest Laboratories Inc as a once-daily treatment for COPD. In preclinical studies, aclidinium bromide demonstrated a comparable profile to tiotropium bromide, with a slightly quicker onset of action but shorter duration of action. Clinical trials have demonstrated an unquestionably interesting pharmacological profile characterized by a faster rate of onset of the smooth muscle relaxing activity than tiotropium bromide and a rapid plasma hydrolysis in human plasma to inactive metabolites that may account for its favorable cardiovascular safety profile. However, the disappointing efficacy results of the recent phase III trials have cast doubt on the real advantage of introducing this drug on the market. Discussions with the FDA concluded that more trials are needed to assess selected dosing regimens, including higher and/or more frequent doses. At the time of publication, further phase III trials with aclidinium bromide were ongoing, and the developing companies were also extending development to combinations of aclidinium bromide with formoterol or an undisclosed inhaled corticosteroid."
CD012930,0,23245993,0,Additive efficacy of short-acting bronchodilators on dynamic hyperinflation and exercise tolerance in stable COPD patients treated with long-acting bronchodilators.,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the additive efficacy of short-acting β(2)-agonists (SABA) or muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) on dynamic hyperinflation and exercise tolerance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who had been treated with long-acting bronchodilators. Thirty-two patients with stable COPD who had been treated with long-acting bronchodilators, including long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), were examined by pulmonary function tests, dynamic hyperinflation evaluated by the method of step-wise metronome-paced incremental hyperventilation, and the incremental shuttle walking test before and after inhalation of SABA or SAMA. The additive efficacy of the two drugs was analyzed. Inhalation of SABA and SAMA improved airflow limitation and dynamic hyperinflation in stable COPD patients who had been treated with LAMA. Inhalation of SABA decreased respiratory resistance and the difference in respiratory resistance at 5 Hz and 20 Hz. On the whole, the additive efficacy of SABA on airflow limitation and dynamic hyperinflation was superior to that of SAMA. Furthermore, inhalation of SABA resulted in relief of breathlessness during exercise and significant improvement in exercise capacity. Inhalation of SABA resulted in significant improvement in exercise tolerance, which may have been due to improvement in dynamic hyperinflation. Single use of SABA before exercise, in addition to regular treatment with LAMA, may therefore be useful in stable COPD patients."

Therefore, identifying strategies to reduce emergency admission rates is a key priority. There have been large-scale evidence reviews to address this issue; however, there have been no reviews of medication therapies, which have the potential to reduce the use of emergency health-care services.

Three fixed-dose combination products have recently been approved for the treatment of COPD (the long-acting β2-agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LABA/LAMA] combinations glycopyrronium/indacaterol [QVA149] and umeclidinium/vilanterol, and the LABA/ICS fluticasone furoate/vilanterol), with others currently in late-stage development. LABA/LAMA and LABA/ICS combination therapies demonstrate positive effects on both lung function and patient-reported outcomes, with significant improvements observed with LABA/LAMA combinations compared with placebo, each component alone and other comparators in current use. No new safety concerns have been observed with combinations of long-acting bronchodilators. Combinations of two long-acting bronchodilators represent a new and convenient treatment option in COPD. This review summarizes published efficacy and safety data from clinical trials of both LABA/LAMA and novel LABA/ICS combinations in patients with COPD."

CD012930,0,17702532,0,Is combination therapy with inhaled anticholinergics and beta2-adrenoceptor agonists justified for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating condition characterised by progressive, irreversible airflow limitation. The economic and social burden of the disease is enormous. The treatment of COPD is guided by the stage of the disease and is aimed primarily at control of symptoms. Bronchodilators are the cornerstone of pharmacological management of COPD. Short-acting bronchodilators (beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists and anticholinergics) have been available for many years and have been extensively studied as individual agents and in combination. When administered in combination, short-acting bronchodilators provide superior bronchodilation compared with individual agents given alone. However, the improvement in bronchodilation does not translate into an improvement in quality-of-life (QOL) indices. More recently, long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs) and anticholinergics have been introduced, and current guidelines recommend regular use of these agents in COPD of Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II or more. Combining short-acting anticholinergics with LABAs for daily use has been evaluated, but this combination does not confer any advantage in terms of subjective improvement or prevention of exacerbations. Combining the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium bromide with formoterol given once or twice daily improves airway obstruction and hyperinflation. However, the effects of combinations of long-acting bronchodilators on patients' symptom scores, QOL and exacerbations remain to be studied. Ultra-LABAs, which are in development, may enable use of a combination of long-acting bronchodilators in a single inhaler for once-daily use, thus simplifying the regimen. This article discusses the results of various clinical trials comparing the efficacy of bronchodilators given alone or in combination to patients with COPD, with emphasis on the effects of these agents on bronchodilation, symptomatic and objective improvements in QOL and prevention of exacerbations."
CD012930,0,25773742,0,Olodaterol: a review of its use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Olodaterol (Striverdi(®) Respimat(®)) is an inhaled long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) indicated as a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator therapy in adults with COPD. Several well-designed phase III trials have assessed use of the drug over 6 or 48 weeks in this patient population. In these studies, once-daily olodaterol improved lung function relative to placebo over 48 weeks of treatment, with such improvements being achieved and maintained within the 24-h dosage interval, supporting its once-daily administration. In addition, combined analyses of 48-week trials indicated that olodaterol reduces rescue medication use and may also improve dyspnoea and health-related quality of life, and crossover studies showed improvements in exercise endurance after 6 weeks of treatment with the drug. Pooled analyses of crossover studies assessing 24-h bronchodilation after 6 weeks of therapy indicated that once-daily olodaterol has a 24-h bronchodilatory profile generally similar to that of once-daily tiotropium bromide and twice-daily formoterol. Olodaterol was generally well tolerated and had an acceptable cardiovascular and respiratory adverse event profile. However, further longer-term and active comparator-controlled studies would be beneficial, including trials powered to assess COPD exacerbations."

In the Glycopyrronium bromide in chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease airWays trials, treatment with inhaled glycopyrronium bromide at 50 μg once daily achieved a significantly better lung function than placebo, as measured by the trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. The lung function improvement was maintained for up to 52 weeks. Other improved indexes were dyspnea scores, health status, exacerbation rates and time of exercise endurance. Studies comparing the efficacy of glycopyrronium versus tiotropium bromide found substantial equivalence of the two drugs. Glycopyrronium was generally well tolerated. These data add inhaled glycopyrronium bromide to the treatment of patients with moderate to severe COPD as an effective once-daily LAMA."

CD012930,0,25446566,0,Pharmacological characterization of the interaction between aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate on human isolated bronchi.,"Long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs) cause airway smooth muscle (ASM) relaxation via different signal transduction pathways, but there are limited data concerning the interaction between these two drug classes on human bronchi. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential synergistic interaction between aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate on the relaxation of human ASM. We evaluated the influence of aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate on the contractile response induced by acetylcholine or electrical field stimulation (EFS) on human isolated airways (segmental bronchi and bronchioles). We analyzed the potential synergistic interaction between the compounds when administered in combination by using Bliss independence (BI) theory. Both aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate completely relaxed segmental bronchi pre-contracted with acetylcholine (Emax: 97.5±2.6% and 96.4±1.1%; pEC50 8.5±0.1 and 8.8±0.1; respectively). Formoterol fumarate, but not aclidinium bromide, abolished the contraction induced by acetylcholine in bronchioles (Emax: 68.1±4.5% and 99.0±5.6%; pEC50 7.9±0.3 and 8.4±0.3; respectively). The BI analysis indicated synergistic interaction at low concentrations in segmental bronchi (+18.4±2.7%; P<0.05 versus expected effect) and from low to high concentrations in bronchioles (+19.7±0.9%; P<0.05 versus expected effect). Low concentrations of both drugs produced a synergistic relaxant interaction on isolated bronchi stimulated with EFS that was sustained for 6h post-treatment (+55.1±9.4%; P<0.05 versus expected effect). These results suggest that combining aclidinium bromide plus formoterol fumarate provides synergistic benefit on ASM relaxation of both medium and small human airways, which may have major implications for the use of this combination in the clinic."
CD012930,0,26739997,0,"Concentration-QT analysis of the randomized, placebo- and moxifloxacin-controlled thorough QT study of umeclidinium monotherapy and umeclidinium/vilanterol combination in healthy subjects.","The long-acting muscarinic antagonist umeclidinium (UMEC) is approved as a once-daily monotherapy and in combination with the long-acting β2 agonist vilanterol (VI) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The objective of this analysis was to assess the relationship between observed plasma UMEC and/or VI concentrations and QT interval corrected using Fridericia's correction (QTcF). 103 subjects were enrolled and 86 (83 %) completed the study. Subjects were randomized to 4 of 5 repeat-dose treatments (days 1-10: n = 77 subjects received placebo, n = 76 UMEC 500 µg, n = 78 UMEC/VI 125/25 µg, or n = 76 UMEC/VI 500/100 µg; day 10: n = 74 oral tablet moxifloxacin 400 mg [positive control]). The concentration-QTcF interval relationship was examined using nonlinear mixed-effects methods. For UMEC, predicted QTcF interval prolongation (at observed geometric mean of maximum plasma concentrations) was -2.38 ms (90 % prediction interval [PI] -3.82, -0.85) with UMEC 500 µg and -0.50 ms (90 % PI -0.80, -0.18) and -2.01 ms (90 % PI -3.22, -0.72) with UMEC/VI 125/25 µg and 500/100 µg, respectively. For VI, estimates were 5.89 ms (90 % PI 4.89, 6.91) and 7.23 ms (90 % PI 5.88, 8.55) with UMEC/VI 125/25 µg and 500/100 µg, respectively. Combined additive mean effects were estimated for UMEC/VI 125/25 µg (5.39 ms [90 % PI 4.40, 6.47]) and 500/100 µg (5.22 ms [90 % PI 3.72, 6.80]). The model-predicted decrease with UMEC and increase with UMEC/VI combination in QTcF interval suggest that the QT effect is likely attributable to VI. These model-predicted results support those of previously-published traditional statistical analyses."

CD012930,0,28235977,0,Use of concomitant inhaled corticosteroids: pooled data from two phase III studies of aclidinium plus formoterol in COPD.,"Bronchodilator therapy is the backbone of the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In some patients, inhaled corticosteroids can be prescribed in combination with bronchodilators. Through a subgroup analysis of pooled data from two large phase III clinical trials of bronchodilator therapy according to concomitant inhaled corticosteroid use (user vs. non-user), we sought to evaluate the clinical benefit of adding inhaled corticosteroids to dual bronchodilator therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary focus of this analysis of pooled data from the phase III ACLIFORM and AUGMENT studies was to evaluate the efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol on lung function stratified by inhaled corticosteroid use. We found that lung-function end points were significantly improved regardless of concomitant inhaled corticosteroid use among patients treated with the dual bronchodilator aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg twice daily compared with placebo and both monotherapies. Together with the previously reported observations that aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg reduces exacerbations vs. placebo in inhaled corticosteroid users and improves dyspnoea compared to monotherapy in inhaled corticosteroid non-users, these data suggest that both groups achieve lung function improvements, which translates to different clinical benefits depending on whether or not a patient is receiving concomitant inhaled corticosteroids.CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE: 'TRIPLE' THERAPY COULD PROVE BENEFICIAL: A dual bronchodilator therapy taken together with corticosteroid inhalers may benefit patients with severe chronic lung disease. Bronchodilator drugs relax the lungs and widen airways in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While recent studies have shown that a dual bronchodilator therapy containing aclidinium and formoterol significantly improves lung function in COPD, little is known about combining the dual therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). Anthony D'Urzo at the University of Toronto, Canada, and co-workers analysed data from 3394 patients with COPD undergoing dual therapy trials. Of these, 1180 were already taking ICSs. The team compared symptoms in the ICS group with those not taking ICSs. The dual therapy improved lung function across both groups regardless of ICS use, though patients gained different clinical benefits depending on ICS use and disease severity."
CD012930,0,20332199,0,Identification of the human enzymes responsible for the enzymatic hydrolysis of aclidinium bromide.,"Aclidinium bromide [LAS34273, 3R-(2-hydroxy-2,2-dithiophen-2-yl-acetoxy)-1-(3-phenoxy-propyl)1-azonia bicycle-[2.2.2]-octane bromide], a novel, long-acting, inhaled muscarinic antagonist for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has shown rapid hydrolysis in human and animal plasma. This process occurred both nonenzymatically (k(h), 0.0075 min(-1)) and enzymatically. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis of aclidinium in humans. Human butyrylcholinesterase was identified as the most important esterase responsible for the enzymatic hydrolysis of aclidinium from inhibition studies in human plasma with selective paraoxonase, arylesterase, carboxylesterase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase chemical inhibitors, as well as from incubations with pure human cholinesterases. Furthermore, neither human cytochrome P450 nor human serum albumin participated in the enzymatic ester cleavage of aclidinium. Butyrylcholinesterase activity in the human lung was lower than that observed in human plasma. Aclidinium was shown to inhibit competitively both human butyrylcholinesterase (K(i), 2.7 microM) and acetylcholinesterase (6.3 microM) but did not have any effect on the activity of other human esterases, as well as its hydrolysis metabolites. These results suggest that the potential for clinical interactions involving human cholinesterases is remote at clinically relevant plasma, which are less than 1 nM."

We report the difficulties of, and pitfalls in, the investigation of the safety of drug treatments in COPD, which is hampered by the so-called COPD trial paradox: on the one hand, COPD is defined as a systemic disease and is frequently associated with comorbidities (especially cardiovascular comorbidities), which have an important effect on the prognosis of individual patients; on the other hand, patients with COPD and cardiovascular or other coexisting illnesses are often excluded from participation in randomised controlled clinical trials. In these trials, inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, both LAMA or LABA, or both, seem to be safe when used in the appropriate dose in adherent patients with COPD without uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or other notable comorbidities. However, the cardiac safety of LAMA and LABA is less evident when used inappropriately (eg, overdosing) or in patients with COPD and substantial cardiovascular disease, prolonged QTc interval, or polypharmacy. Potential warnings about rare cardiac events caused by COPD treatment from meta-analyses and observational studies need to be confirmed in high quality large randomised controlled trials.

CD012930,0,22419862,0,Comparative efficacy of indacaterol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Long-acting bronchodilators have been shown to improve multiple clinical outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including lung function, symptoms, dyspnea, quality of life, and exacerbations. Indacaterol is a novel, inhaled, long-acting β2-agonist providing 24-hour bronchodilation with once-daily dosing. It is currently approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD to be administered as 150 or 300 μg once-daily doses as licensed in many countries and 75 μg as licensed in the US by means of a single-dose dry powder inhaler. The data from clinical development support a favorable safety and tolerability profile within the β2-agonist drug class, with no relevant issues identified. Current evidence indicates that indacaterol is suitable for use as first-line monotherapy in COPD patients with moderate disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage II) and beyond that do not require an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as per GOLD guidelines, or in combination with an ICS in severe or very severe patients with repeated exacerbations. Data from trials with the novel once-daily β2-agonist, indacaterol, indicate superior bronchodilation and clinical efficacy over twice-daily long-acting β2-agonists and at least equipotent bronchodilation as once-daily tiotropium. Bronchodilators are central in the symptomatic management of COPD. It is likely that once-daily dosing of a bronchodilator would be a significant convenience and probably a compliance-enhancing advantage, leading to improved overall clinical outcomes in patients with COPD."

The results can be summarized in a comparable efficacy of indacaterol, mainly assessed by the increase in FEV1 value but also by quality of life and other patient- reported outcomes (PROs), compared with the OD antimuscarinic tiotropium bromide, and in a slightly higher efficacy compared with the LABA formoterol and salmeterol administered twice-daily. No problems of safety and tolerability were reported in the trials as well as in specific studies, every kind of adverse event, including cardiovascular effects, being similarly frequent with indacaterol and with placebo. Concerning the real-life management, in respect to LABA, the OD dosing makes indacaterol more convenient for COPD patients and is likely to positively influence the patient's adherence. Since adherence to medical treatment of chronic diseases, and particularly COPD is a crucial issue in medicine, such aspect should confer to indacaterol a valuable role in clinical practice. The recently approved combination of indacaterol with the antimuscarinic glycopyrronium [QVA149], based on the demonstration of positive effects on both lung function and PROs, is likely to be a further option for patients with severe COPD."

Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, namely LABA (long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists) and LAMA (long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists) are the mainstay of COPD treatment. Because the symptoms of many patients with COPD do not satisfactorily improve by using a single, either LABA or LAMA bronchodilator, the synergism of action resulting from the combination of the different bronchodilating mechanisms activated by LABA and LAMA, respectively, can significantly contribute to a better disease control. Based on these clinical and pharmacological considerations, several LABA/LAMA fixed-dose combinations have been developed and experimentally evaluated. Within such a context, the drug co-formulation containing indacaterol and glycopyrronium is probably the LABA/LAMA association which has been most extensively studied during the last few years."

CD012930,0,27304394,0,A Novel Method for Studying the Pharmacokinetics of [(14) C]Umeclidinium After Application to the Axilla or Palm of Healthy Male Subjects.,"Umeclidinium (UMEC), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist approved for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was investigated for primary hyperhidrosis as topical therapy. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of [(14) C]UMEC applied to either unoccluded axilla (UA), occluded axilla (OA), or occluded palm (OP) of healthy males. After 8 h the formulation was removed. [(14) C]UMEC plasma concentrations (Cp) were quantified by accelerator mass spectrometry. Occlusion increased systemic exposure by 3.8-fold. Due to UMEC absorption-limited pharmacokinetics, Cp data from the OA were combined with intravenous data from a phase I study. The data were described by a two-compartment population model with sequential zero and first-order absorption and linear elimination. Simulated systemic exposure following q.d. doses to axilla was similar to the exposure from the inhaled therapy, suggesting that systemic safety following dermal administration can be bridged to the inhaled program, and offering the potential for a reduced number of studies and/or subjects."
CD012930,0,23835953,0,Siglec-8 in induced sputum of COPD patients.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is related to infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells in airways and pulmonary tissue. In COPD, neutrophils are prominent, while eosinophilic influx is typical to asthma. Inflammatory cells express sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin like lectins called Siglecs, a family of innate immune receptors that are transmembrane I-type lectins binding sialic acid. One member of the Siglec family, Siglec-8, is expressed mostly in eosinophils and may be an important therapeutic target in asthma or COPD. The aim of our project was to quantify Siglec-8 expression in induced sputum cells of COPD patients treated with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) or combined with long-acting antimuscarinic agents (LAMA) - tiotropium bromide. Thirty stable COPD patients (21 males and 9 females, mean age 67 years) receiving 12 μg BID formoterol therapy were assessed before and after 3 months' add-on therapy consisting of 18 μg QID tiotropium. In all patients, spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO were performed before and after therapy. The patients were subjected to sputum induction before and after therapy. Sputum cells were isolated and processed to obtain cell membranes. Siglec-8 protein expression was assessed using Western blot. In patients receiving tiotropium and formoterol, improved FEV1 and lung volumes were observed compared with formoterol-only treated patients. The mean Siglec-8 level was significantly higher in eosinophilic subgroup of COPD patients compared with non-eosinophilic patients before therapy 40,000 vs. 15,000 Adj. Vol. INT/mm(2). Our data show that Siglec-8 may be involved in COPD pathogenesis and may influence COPD phenotyping."

CD012930,0,25471458,0,Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by dual bronchodilation with coformulation of indacaterol/glycopyrronium.,"Bronchodilators are the cornerstone of the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In particular, the most commonly used drugs are inhaled long-acting agents, including long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs). The combination of a LABA with a LAMA, i.e. of molecules characterized by different mechanisms of action, results in a synergistic enhancement of their clinical and functional effects. Therefore, this combined treatment can be implemented in a number of cases in which disease control is not adequately achieved by a single active agent such as a LABA or a LAMA. Several LABA/LAMA fixed-dose combinations, mainly made up of newly developed compounds, are currently in advanced phases of experimental evaluation. Within such a context, the aim of this review is to outline the pharmacological basis of dual bronchodilation as well as to discuss the results of the main trials carried out using the drug combination consisting of indacaterol and glycopyrronium, a LABA and a LAMA recently introduced in the treatment of COPD."

Bronchodilators remain the cornerstone of COPD treatment, especially inhaled β2-adrenergic receptor agonists and inhaled anticholinergics. Long-acting bronchodilators are considered more effective and convenient than short-acting bronchodilators for the maintenance treatment in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. There are currently 3 long-acting inhaled bronchodilators available in the United States: the β2-adrenergic receptor agonists formoterol and salmeterol, and the anticholinergic, tiotropium. All 3 long-acting bronchodilators have been shown to be effective and well tolerated for the management of patients with stable COPD in clinical studies. The combination of β2-adrenergic receptor agonists and anticholinergics has been shown to provide superior bronchodilatory effect than either agent alone, possibly because of different mechanisms of action of these agents. The current treatment guidelines recommend the use of one or more long-acting bronchodilators for patients with moderate to severe stable COPD who remain symptomatic with single-agent bronchodilator therapy. The objective of this article is to review clinical data on combined bronchodilator therapy with β2-adrenergic receptor agonists and anticholinergics in patients with COPD."
CD012930,0,29605098,0,Possible involvement of acetylcholine-mediated inflammation in airway diseases.,"Inhaled bronchodilator treatment with a long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) reduces symptoms and the risk of exacerbations in COPD and asthma. However, increasing evidence from cell culture and animal studies suggests that anti-muscarinic drugs could also possess anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies have revealed that acetylcholine (ACh) can be synthesized and released from both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and the released ACh can potentiate airway inflammation and remodeling in airway diseases. However, these anti-inflammatory effects of anti-muscarinic drugs have not yet been confirmed in COPD and asthma patients. This review will focus on recent findings about the possible involvement of ACh in airway inflammation and remodeling, and the anti-inflammatory effect of anti-muscarinic drugs in airway diseases. Clarifying the acetylcholine-mediated inflammation could provide insights into the mechanisms of airway diseases, which could lead to future therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the disease progression and exacerbations."

In response to this problem, the World Health Organization and the US National Institutes of Health convened a panel of experts to draft a consensus strategy to treat patients with COPD. Called the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, they are designed to define and stage the severity of COPD, make recommendations for treatment, and to expand global awareness of the disease. The GOLD guidelines describe a multimodality approach to provide optimal care for the COPD patient population. This includes respiratory and rehabilitative therapy, nutrition services, psychosocial counseling, and surgical care. Bronchodilators form the cornerstone of pharmacologic treatment for COPD. These medications can significantly lessen dyspnea, enhance quality of life, increase airflow, and improve exercise performance. While bronchodilators decrease airway resistance and lessen hyperinflation in patients with COPD, they have not been shown to influence the decline in FEV1 over time or improve survival in this patient population. Recently, long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (beta2-agonists) such as formoterol and salmeterol and anticholinergic medications including tiotropium bromide have been developed which may further improve symptom management in COPD patients. This article discusses bronchodilator pharmacologic therapy for patients with COPD focusing on beta2-agonists, anticholinergics, and methylxanthines in the light of the recent GOLD consensus statements."
CD012930,0,22963554,0,Development of new drugs for COPD.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an increasing global health problem and cause of death. COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease predominantly affecting small airways and lung parenchyma that leads to progressive airway obstruction. However, current therapies fail to prevent either disease progression or mortality. The mainstay of current drug therapy is long-acting bronchodilators. Several once daily inhaled β(2)-agonists and muscarinic antagonists (and combinations) are now in development. No treatments effectively suppress chronic inflammation in COPD lungs. With better understanding of the inflammatory and destructive process in the pathophysiology of COPD, several new therapeutic targets have been identified. Several mediator antagonists or inhibitors tested in COPD have so far been disappointing, but CXCR2 antagonists that block pulmonary neutrophil and monocyte recruitment are more promising. Broad spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs may be more effective, and include inhibitors of the proinflammatory enzymes phosphodiesterase-4, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinases, NF-κB kinase and PI3 kinase-γ and -δ, but side effects after oral administration are a major limitation so that in future inhaled delivery may be necessary. A new promising approach is reversal of corticosteroid resistance through increasing histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) activity. This might be achieved by existing treatments such as theophylline, nortriptyline and macrolides, or more selectively by PI3 kinase-δ inhibitors. Thus although there have been major advances in the development of long-acting bronchodilators for COPD, it has proved difficult to find anti-inflammatory treatments that are safe and effective."
CD012930,0,19229704,1,Formoterol and tiotropium compared with tiotropium alone for treatment of COPD.,"Combined use of beta(2)-agonists and anticholinergic bronchodilators may have complementary benefits in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to compare combination treatment with formoterol (FORM) plus tiotropium (TIO) versus treatment with TIO alone in patients with COPD. In this active-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial, a total of 255 subjects with diagnosed COPD were randomized to 12 weeks of either a combination of FORM 12 microg twice-daily plus TIO 18 microg once-daily in the morning (QD AM) or monotherapy with TIO 18 microg QD AM. The primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve for forced expiratory volume in 1 second measured 0 to 4 hours after AM dosing (FEV(1) AUC(0-4h)). Significantly greater improvements in the FEV(1) AUC(0-4h) were seen with FORM + TIO (n = 116) versus TIO (n = 124) at all time points. The increase in FEV(1) 5 minutes after the first dose was 180 mL with FORM + TIO versus 40 mL with TIO (p < 0.001). At endpoint, FEV(1) AUC(0-4h) increased 340 mL with FORM + TIO versus 170 mL with TIO (p < 0.001). Improvements in trough FEV(1) with FORM + TIO versus TIO were 180 mL and 100 mL, respectively (p < 0.01). Significantly greater reductions from baseline in symptom scores (p < 0.05) and daytime albuterol use (p < 0.04) were seen at endpoint with combination FORM + TIO versus TIO monotherapy. Both treatments were well tolerated. This study demonstrated that concurrent treatment with FORM + TIO results in greater therapeutic benefits than TIO alone."
CD012930,0,29115881,0,A review of current and developing fixed-dose LABA/LAMA combinations for treating COPD.,"The current GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) recommendations suggest using long acting β2 agonists (LABA) and long acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) in combination for group B COPD patients with persistent symptoms, group C COPD patients with further exacerbations on LAMA therapy alone and for group D COPD patients with or without combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Thus, there is a lot of interest in developing LABA/LAMA combinations for maintenance therapy of chronic stable COPD. Areas covered: Many LABA/LAMA combinations have successfully been approved through carefully designed pivotal clinical trials. The current clinical use of LABA/LAMA combinations in COPD will continue to evolve as new trials with and without inhaled corticosteroids are completed. Expert opinion: Combining different classes of bronchodilators in a single inhaler is an attractive concept that can potentially improve patient adherence to therapy. Because LABA/LAMA combinations are the preferred treatment option for preventing COPD exacerbations in the updated GOLD guidelines for COPD, they will be clinically used. Future treatment of COPD should revolve around a personalized approach based on characterization of the COPD phenotype."

CD012930,0,29670345,0,Practical considerations when prescribing a long-acting muscarinic antagonist for patients with COPD.,"COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, progressive breathlessness, cough, and sputum production. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are one of the recommended first-choice therapeutic options for patients with COPD, and several new agents have been developed in recent years. A literature search identified 14 published randomized, placebo-controlled studies of the efficacy and safety of LAMAs in patients with COPD, with improvements seen in lung function, exacerbations, breathlessness, and health status. A greater weight of evidence currently exists for glycopyrronium (GLY) and tiotropium than for umeclidinium and aclidinium, especially in terms of exacerbation reductions. To date, there have been few head-to-head clinical studies of the different LAMAs. Available data indicate that GLY and aclidinium have similar efficacy to tiotropium in terms of improving lung function, dyspnea, exacerbations, and health status. Overall, evidence demonstrates that currently available LAMAs provide effective and generally well-tolerated therapy for patients with COPD. Delivery devices for the different LAMAs vary, which may affect individual patient's adherence to and preference for treatment. Subtle differences between individual therapeutic options may be important to individual patients and the final treatment choice should involve physician's and patient's experiences and preferences."

Siglecs are a family of lectins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and recognize sialic acid residues of glycoproteins. Most of Siglecs have intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM), implicating them in the suppression of immunoreceptor signaling. Siglec-5/14 may be involved in the negative regulation of innate immune responses. The aim of this study was to analyze Siglec-5/14 expression in induced sputum cells of COPD patients in the following treatment combinations: (1) a long-acting beta2-agonist, formoterol; (2) formoterol combined with a long-acting antimuscarinic agent, tiotropium; and (3) formoterol combined with an inhaled corticosteroid or formoterol combined with tiotropium and with an inhaled corticosteroid. Siglec expression was assessed in sputum cells by flow cytometry using a specific monoclonal antibody. Double staining of cells indicated that Siglec-5/14 is expressed in monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils, but not in lymphocytes. Siglec-5/14 expression was significantly higher in patients receiving combined therapy including inhaled corticosteroids compared with patients taking only formoterol or formoterol + tiotropium. Our results suggest that inhaled corticosteroids may exert beneficial or negative effects, depending on the patients' phenotype, through increased immunosuppressive Siglec-5 or immunoactivatory Siglec-14 receptors, respectively."

However, a relatively small reduction or change in lung function - such as those observed in mild to moderate COPD - may not always reflect the impact of the disease or intervention on patients' physical and psychological well-being. This paper examines the utility of various outcome measures that can be used in primary care to monitor and manage COPD. In particular, it demonstrates the importance of measuring patient-centred outcomes, such as health-related quality of life and exacerbations, which may reflect more accurately the effects of the disease and treatment on patients' everyday lives. Recent large-scale clinical trials of budesonide/formoterol and fluticasone/salmeterol combination therapies and tiotropium have utilised these outcome measures to show the significant benefits these treatments bestow to patients in the presence of relatively modest gains in lung function."

CD012930,0,22963553,0,Inhaled muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists for treatment of COPD.,"Bronchodilators, generally administered via metered dose or dry powder inhalers, are the mainstays of pharmacological treatment of stable COPD. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and anticholinergics are the bronchodilators primarily used in the chronic treatment of COPD. Anticholinergics act as muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are frequently preferred over beta-agonists for their minimal cardiac stimulatory effects and greater efficacy in most studies. Their therapeutic efficacy is based on the fact that vagally mediated bronchoconstriction is the major reversible component of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. However, bronchodilators are effective only on the reversible component of airflow obstruction, which by definition is limited, as COPD is characterized by a fixed or poorly reversible airflow obstruction. Inhaled anticholinergic antimuscarinic drugs approved for the treatment of COPD include ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide. Ipratropium bromide, the prototype of anticholinergic bronchodilators, is a short-acting agent. Oxitropium bromide is administered twice a day. Tiotropium bromide, the only long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LAMA) currently approved, is administered once a day. Newer LAMAs including aclidinium bromide and glycopyrrolate bromide are currently in phase III development for treatment of COPD. Some new LAMAs, including glycocpyrrolate, are suitable for once daily administration and, unlike tiotropium, have a rapid onset of action. New LAMAs and their combination with ultra-LABA and, possibly, inhaled corticosteroids, seem to open new perspectives in the management of COPD.

The Finnish COPD guideline was revised to acknowledge the progress in diagnosis and management of COPD. This Finnish COPD guideline in English language is a part of the original guideline and focuses on the diagnosis, assessment and pharmacotherapy of stable COPD. It is intended to be used mainly in primary health care but not forgetting respiratory specialists and other healthcare workers. The new recommendations and statements are based on the best evidence available from the medical literature, other published national guidelines and the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) report. This guideline introduces the diagnostic approach, differential diagnostics towards asthma, assessment and treatment strategy to control symptoms and to prevent exacerbations. The pharmacotherapy is based on the symptoms and a clinical phenotype of the individual patient. The guideline defines three clinically relevant phenotypes including the low and high exacerbation risk phenotypes and the neglected asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS). These clinical phenotypes can help clinicians to identify patients that respond to specific pharmacological interventions. For the low exacerbation risk phenotype, pharmacotherapy with short-acting β2 -agonists (salbutamol, terbutaline) or anticholinergics (ipratropium) or their combination (fenoterol-ipratropium) is recommended in patients with less symptoms. If short-acting bronchodilators are not enough to control symptoms, a long-acting β2 -agonist (formoterol, indacaterol, olodaterol or salmeterol) or a long-acting anticholinergic (muscarinic receptor antagonists; aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium, umeclidinium) or their combination is recommended. For the high exacerbation risk phenotype, pharmacotherapy with a long-acting anticholinergic or a fixed combination of an inhaled glucocorticoid and a long-acting β2 -agonist (budesonide-formoterol, beclomethasone dipropionate-formoterol, fluticasone propionate-salmeterol or fluticasone furoate-vilanterol) is recommended as a first choice. Other treatment options for this phenotype include combination of long-acting bronchodilators given from separate inhalers or as a fixed combination (glycopyrronium-indacaterol or umeclidinium-vilanterol) or a triple combination of an inhaled glucocorticoid, a long-acting β2 -agonist and a long-acting anticholinergic. If the patient has severe-to-very severe COPD (FEV1  < 50% predicted), chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations despite long-acting bronchodilators, the pharmacotherapy may include also roflumilast. ACOS is a phenotype of COPD in which there are features that comply with both asthma and COPD. Patients belonging to this phenotype have usually been excluded from studies evaluating the effects of drugs both in asthma and in COPD. Thus, evidence-based recommendation of treatment cannot be given. The treatment should cover both diseases. Generally, the therapy should include at least inhaled glucocorticoids (beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone furoate, fluticasone propionate or mometasone) combined with a long-acting bronchodilator (β2 -agonist or anticholinergic or both)."

However, the efficacy of combined therapy on walking distance, a surrogate measure of daily functional activity and morbidity remains unclear. The aim was, therefore, to quantify the benefit of this therapy on the six minute walk test. Secondary outcomes included change in lung function, symptoms, the BODE index and QOL. In a double-blind, crossover study, 38 participants with moderate to severe COPD on tiotropium were randomised to receive either formoterol or placebo for 6 weeks. Following a 2-week washout period, participants crossed over to the alternate arm of therapy for a further 6 weeks. Thirty-six participants, with an average age of 64.3 years and FEV1 predicted of 53%, completed the study. Combined therapy improved walking distance by a mean of 36 metres [95% CI: 2.4, 70.1; p = 0.04] compared with tiotropium.

Aclidinium showed subnanomolar affinity for the five human muscarinic receptors (M(1)-M(5)). [(3)H]Aclidinium dissociated slightly faster from M(2) and M(3) receptors than [(3)H]tiotropium but much more slowly than [(3)H]ipratropium. Its association rate for the M(3) receptor was similar to [(3)H]ipratropium and 2.6 times faster than [(3)H]tiotropium. Residence half-life of [(3)H]aclidinium at the M(2) receptor was shorter than at the M(3) receptor, demonstrating kinetic selectivity for the M(3) receptor. In isolated guinea pig trachea, aclidinium showed comparable potency to ipratropium and tiotropium, faster onset of action than tiotropium, and duration of action similar to tiotropium and significantly longer than ipratropium. Nebulized aclidinium inhibited bronchoconstriction induced by acetylcholine in guinea pigs in a concentration-dependent manner with an onset of action faster than tiotropium. Duration of action of aclidinium (t(1/2) = 29 h) was much longer than ipratropium (8 h) but shorter than tiotropium (64 h). In dogs, aclidinium induced a smaller and more transient increase in heart rate than tiotropium at comparable supratherapeutic doses. Therefore, under these conditions, aclidinium showed a greater therapeutic index than tiotropium (4.2 versus 1.6). These results indicate that aclidinium is a potent muscarinic antagonist with a fast onset of action, a long duration of effect, and a favorable cardiovascular safety profile."

No treatments reduce the progression or suppress the inflammation of COPD. With better understanding of the inflammatory and destructive process, several new targets have been identified. Several mediator antagonists tested in COPD have been disappointing, but of CXCR2 antagonists that block pulmonary neutrophil and monocyte recruitment may be more promising. Broad spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs may be more effective, and include inhibitors of PDE4, p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB, but side effects will be a major limitation so that inhaled delivery will be necessary. Perhaps the most promising approach is reversal corticosteroid resistance through increasing HDAC2 activity.

While previous studies have identified gender differences in other chronic disease management, few studies have examined how implementation of COPD guidelines differs between men and women. We performed a cross-sectional study of veterans admitted to Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals for COPD during October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2011. We collected information on baseline COPD medications during the 6 months prior to hospitalization and categorized therapies as ""appropriate"" or ""inappropriate"" based on current guidelines. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the differences in COPD medications between men and women, after controlling for baseline patient characteristics. We also examined the differences in hospital outcomes, including length of stay and hospital readmission. We identified 33,558 veterans, including 1149 women and 32,409 men who were admitted to 130 VA hospitals. Women were significantly less likely to have received inhaler therapies prior to admission, with lower rates of short-acting beta agonists, short-acting muscarinic antagonists, long-acting beta agonists, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists compared to men. Women also received fewer appropriate inhaler combinations (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.93) and more inappropriate combinations (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.17-1.51). Women and men were prescribed similar rates of inhaled steroid and oral steroids. Hospital outcomes were also similar between the two groups. These findings highlight a potential gender disparity in appropriate outpatient COPD therapy. Improving the quality of care for patients with COPD should include equitable implementation of guideline-based COPD management."

Pharmacologic treatment consists primarily in the relief of symptoms and preventing or minimizing the consequences of exacerbations. Central to the pharmacologic management of COPD is the use of bronchodilator therapy. Two major classes of agents are frequently used: β-adrenoceptor agonists and antimuscarinic agents. These drugs are used mainly in the inhalational form, primarily as rescue medication, but occasionally for maintenance in combination therapy. The availability of ""ultra-long""-acting β-adrenoceptor agonists and long-acting antimuscarinic agents opens the way for combinations of these agents to be used in maintenance therapy.

This recommendation is based on evidence demonstrating that ICS, especially when prescribed in fixed-dose combinations (FDC) with long-acting β2 agonists (LABA), improve quality of life (QoL), decrease exacerbations and hospitalisations, and have been associated with a trend towards a reduction in all-cause mortality. Audit shows that routine prescribing practice frequently uses inhaler therapies outside current guidelines recommendations; severe to very severe disease constitutes about 20% of all COPD patients, but up to 75% of COPD patients are prescribed an ICS, with significant numbers given ICS/LABA as first-line maintenance therapy. The role of ICS in the treatment paradigm for COPD is changing, driven by the growing evidence of increased risk of pneumonia, and the introduction of a new class of FDC; LABA and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), which simplify dual bronchodilation and present a plausible alternative therapy. As the evidence base for dual therapy bronchodilation expands, it is likely that maximal bronchodilation will move up the treatment algorithm and ICS reserved for those with more severe disease who are not controlled on dual therapy. This change has already manifested in local COPD algorithms, such as those at Tayside, and represents a significant change in recommended prescribing practice. This review reassesses the role of ICS in the shifting treatment paradigm, in the context of alternative treatment options that provide maximal bronchodilation."

The fixed-dose combination of aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate in a single inhaler seems to offer superior advantages over either drugs given alone or as separate inhalers concurrently. Since the fixed-dose combination needs to be given twice daily, it is likely to achieve control of symptoms most crucial to the quality of life in COPD, namely, the morning hours. This is reflected in significant trough FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) improvements after the dose. This paper reviews the various studies related to this combination put in the perspective of its safety and efficacy and potential benefits over other therapeutic options. However, there is a dearth of data on the long-term safety and efficacy in terms of improvement in lung function. This combination could emerge as an excellent option in the management of stable COPD if data on exacerbation rates and patient-reported outcomes become available from longer-term studies. Moreover, we need some more studies to define the ideal phenotype of COPD best suited for the use of this combination."

CD012930,0,23687444,0,Symptom variability in COPD: a narrative review.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has traditionally been considered an inexorably progressive disease, associated with a constant increase of symptoms that occur as the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) worsens, only intermittently interrupted by exacerbations. However, this paradigm has been challenged in recent decades by the available evidence. Recent studies have pointed out that COPD-related symptoms are not consistently perceived by patients in the same way, showing not only seasonal variation, but also changes in symptom perception during a week or even within a single day. According to the available data, patients experience the biggest increase in respiratory symptoms during the first hours of the early morning, followed by the nighttime. This variation over time is of considerable importance, since it impacts on daily life activities and health-related quality of life, as measured by a recently developed ad hoc questionnaire. Additionally, recent clinical trials have suggested that the use of rapid-onset long-acting bronchodilators may have an impact on morning symptoms, despite their current use as maintenance treatment for a determined period. Although this hypothesis is to be validated in future long-term clinical trials comparing fast-onset versus slow-onset inhaled drugs in COPD, it may bring forward a new concept of long-term bronchodilator therapy. At the present time, the two available long-acting, fast-onset bronchodilators used in the treatment of COPD are formoterol and the recently marketed indacaterol. Newer drugs have also been shown to have a rapid onset of action in preclinical studies. Health care professionals caring for COPD patients should consider this variation in the perception of symptoms during their clinical interview as a potential new target in the long-term treatment plan."

Methods This was a 52 week, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of UMEC 125 μg once daily delivered via a novel dry powder inhaler (nDPI) in Japanese patients with COPD. The primary endpoint was the incidence and severity of all adverse events (AEs) throughout the 52 week treatment period. Clinical trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT01702363. Results A total of 153 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 131 patients started treatment with UMEC 125 μg, and 111 patients (85%) completed the study. AEs did not differ greatly in incidence over the various time periods (Weeks 0 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36, and 37 to 52 of treatment) and did not increase with continued treatment. The incidence of drug-related AEs associated with the pharmacological effects of LAMAs (including constipation, blurred vision, and thirst) was low. Serious adverse events (SAEs) during the treatment period were reported in 17 patients (13%). SAEs reported in more than one patient were COPD exacerbation and pneumonia (3 patients each, 2%). One SAE of angina pectoris was considered to be drug related. No fatalities were reported during this study. Conclusions No new AEs were identified beyond those attributable to the pharmacological effects of LAMAs. UMEC 125 μg was well tolerated over 52 weeks of treatment in Japanese patients with COPD."
CD012930,0,24392807,0,Considerations for new dual-acting bronchodilator treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Current guidelines recommend treatment with one or more bronchodilators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Combination therapy with long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) should be recommended in patients who are not fully controlled with one of them. In this article, two closely related approaches to provide long-acting treatments are compared: the LABA/LAMA fixed-dose combination therapy, and the dual-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist and β2-adrenoceptor agonist (MABA). The author in that study concludes that both approaches have been shown to provide clinically enhanced bronchodilator activity that is superior to that offered by current standard treatment. LAMA/LABA fixed-dose combinations are expected to become a new standard in the treatment of COPD. It is important to know the characteristics of the different LAMA or LABA, the inhalation device and the duration of action, because diversity can help to personalize the treatment. Dose-finding studies are required. It is also required to investigate the existence of pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic interactions between the components as well as the safety profile. MABA represent an alternative to these combinations, but there is little clinical data yet reported. They have the potential to act as a useful platform for the development of triple therapy in one inhaler."
CD012930,0,25653503,0,Patient-reported outcomes and considerations in the management of COPD: focus on aclidinium.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex heterogeneous disease, in which several factors combine to give the final clinical expression. Both early and more recent studies have shown that forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), despite being an extremely important parameter to predict the progression of the disease, is a poor surrogate marker for symptoms perception. Accordingly, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have gained popularity as a measure of the impact of treatment from the patients' perspective, since they represent the individuals' perception of their health status, beyond any physiological limitations. Several such PROs, therefore, are currently included in multidimensional COPD evaluation. This multidimensional approach helps identify different patient types and individualize, up to a certain point, pharmacological treatment. In this multidimensional approach it is important to highlight the importance of long-acting bronchodilators in COPD treatment strategies. Long-acting bronchodilators are cost-effective and have been shown to achieve the greatest functional and clinical improvements in COPD. As a result, long-acting bronchodilators are now the main pharmacological treatment for COPD at all stages of the disease. Until recently, tiotropium was the leading bronchodilator for the treatment of COPD. The clinical development of this medication, unprecedented in inhaled therapy, involved tens of thousands of patients and yielded consistent outcomes in terms of lung function, symptoms, quality of life, exacerbations, and prognosis. However, new long-acting bronchodilators have recently been developed or are currently under development. In this review, we evaluate the effects of aclidinium bromide, a novel long-acting bronchodilator, on PROs in COPD. Aclidinium is a novel long-acting muscarinic antagonist with a good safety profile for the treatment of COPD, and has proven efficacy in both objective functional measurements and PROs. Comparison studies with tiotropium have shown it to have similar lung function improvement and a similar impact on PROs, including quality of life or symptom perception."

CD012930,0,19103479,0,Primary care of the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Italy.,"Using a general practice research database with general practitioner (GP) clinical records, it has been observed that among the 617,280 subjects registered with 400 Italian GPs, 15,229 (2.47%) patients were suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Of these, 67.7% had a chest radiograph at least once in a period of 10 years (1997-2006), while in the same period only 31.9% had a spirometry, 29.9% had a visit to a specialist, and 0.94% had a visit to an allergologist. From 1997 to 2006, 7.5% of patients with COPD, especially the oldest ones, were hospitalized at least once for the disease, although 44.0% of all patients with COPD were hospitalized for other pathologies. With regard to treatment, in 2006, 10,936 (71.1%) of COPD patients received at least one drug for their disease (drugs classified within the R03 therapeutic pharmacological subgroup of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification). In particular, salmeterol/fluticasone was prescribed 6441 times, tiotropium 4962, theophylline 3142, beclomethasone 2853, salbutamol 2256, formoterol 2191, salbutamol/beclomethasone 2129, oxitropium 1802 and formoterol/budesonide 1741 times. Based on these findings, the level of COPD management in Italy seems to fall short of recommended international COPD guidelines. In particular, it appears that GPs usually prescribe treatment without the use of spirometry, and/or without taking into account the severity of airway obstruction. It must also be noted that, in general, patients with COPD are undertreated."

This 2-part, phase I study evaluated the safety and tolerability of single ascending intravenous (IV) doses of aclidinium to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD; part I) and its absolute bioavailability (part II). Healthy male participants (N = 24) were randomized (1:1) in each part: 3-period crossover, placebo-controlled, single-ascending, alternating IV doses of aclidinium (25-400 µg) in part I and 2-period crossover, single-alternating IV and inhaled doses of aclidinium (200 µg) in part II. A ≥7-day washout separated treatment periods. Pharmacokinetic data were collected in both parts. Following IV or inhaled aclidinium, time to reach maximum plasma concentration following drug administration (t(max) ) was 5 to 7 minutes for all doses. After maximum plasma drug concentration (C(max)), aclidinium was rapidly cleared from plasma. Aclidinium absolute bioavailability was <5% following a single inhaled 200-µg dose. Urinary excretion of unchanged aclidinium was very low, with a greater amount of inactive metabolites excreted compared with aclidinium, all of which were recovered within 12 hours postdose. The MTD following IV administration was not reached; all single IV (25-400 µg) and inhaled doses (200 µg) were well tolerated. In conclusion, the low and short-lived bioavailability of aclidinium and the low incidence of systemic side effects contribute to its positive safety and tolerability profile."

Patients received tiotropium+olodaterol FDC 2.5/5 μg or 5/5 μg, tiotropium 2.5 μg or 5 μg, or olodaterol 5 μg delivered once-daily via Respimat inhaler over 52 weeks. Primary end points were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 3 h (AUC0-3) response, trough FEV1 response and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at 24 weeks. In total, 5162 patients (2624 in Study 1237.5 and 2538 in Study 1237.6) received treatment. Both FDCs significantly improved FEV1 AUC0-3 and trough FEV1 response versus the mono-components in both studies. Statistically significant improvements in SGRQ total score versus the mono-components were only seen for tiotropium+olodaterol FDC 5/5 μg. Incidence of adverse events was comparable between the FDCs and the mono-components.

CD012930,0,25673975,0,Patient considerations in the treatment of COPD: focus on the new combination inhaler umeclidinium/vilanterol.,"Medication adherence among patients with chronic diseases, such as COPD, may be suboptimal, and many factors contribute to this poor adherence. One major factor is the frequency of medication dosing. Once-daily dosing has been shown to be an important variable in medication adherence in chronic diseases, such as COPD. New inhalers that only require once-daily dosing are becoming more widely available. Combination once-daily inhalers that combine any two of the following three agents are now available: 1) a long-acting muscarinic antagonist; 2) a long acting beta2 agonist; and 3) an inhaled corticosteroid. A new once-daily inhaler with both a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, umeclidinium bromide, and a long acting beta2 agonist, vilanterol trifenatate, is now available worldwide for COPD treatment. It provides COPD patients convenience, efficacy, and a very favorable adverse-effects profile. Additional once-daily combination inhalers are available or will soon be available for COPD patients worldwide. The use of once-daily combination inhalers will likely become the standard maintenance management approach in the treatment of COPD because they improve medication adherence."

CD012930,0,22611179,0,Pharmacology and therapeutics of bronchodilators.,"Bronchodilators are central in the treatment of of airways disorders. They are the mainstay of the current management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are critical in the symptomatic management of asthma, although controversies around the use of these drugs remain. Bronchodilators work through their direct relaxation effect on airway smooth muscle cells. at present, three major classes of bronchodilators, β(2)-adrenoceptor (AR) agonists, muscarinic receptor antagonists, and xanthines are available and can be used individually or in combination. The use of the inhaled route is currently preferred to minimize systemic effects. Fast- and short-acting agents are best used for rescue of symptoms, whereas long-acting agents are best used for maintenance therapy. It has proven difficult to discover novel classes of bronchodilator drugs, although potential new targets are emerging. Consequently, the logical approach has been to improve the existing bronchodilators, although several novel broncholytic classes are under development. An important step in simplifying asthma and COPD management and improving adherence with prescribed therapy is to reduce the dose frequency to the minimum necessary to maintain disease control. Therefore, the incorporation of once-daily dose administration is an important strategy to improve adherence. Several once-daily β(2)-AR agonists or ultra-long-acting β(2)-AR-agonists (LABAs), such as indacaterol, olodaterol, and vilanterol, are already in the market or under development for the treatment of COPD and asthma, but current recommendations suggest the use of LABAs only in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid. In addition, some new potentially long-acting antimuscarinic agents, such as glycopyrronium bromide (NVA-237), aclidinium bromide, and umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719), are under development, as well as combinations of several classes of long-acting bronchodilator drugs, in an attempt to simplify treatment regimens as much as possible. This review will describe the pharmacology and therapeutics of old, new, and emerging classes of bronchodilator."
CD012930,0,22366196,0,Safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of aclidinium bromide administered twice daily in healthy volunteers.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive airway obstruction and increased cholinergic tone. The global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend long-acting anticholinergics for COPD maintenance treatment. Aclidinium bromide is a novel, long-acting muscarinic antagonist developed for the treatment of COPD. A phase I, randomized, single-blind, multiple-dose clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of twice-daily (BID) aclidinium in healthy subjects. Thirty healthy male and female subjects received aclidinium 200 μg, 400 μg, 800 μg, or placebo twice daily for 7 days. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 cohorts and 10 subjects in each cohort were randomized (8:2) to either aclidinium or placebo groups. Safety was assessed via adverse events (AEs), laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and ECGs. Plasma samples were obtained at multiple time points throughout the study and analyzed for aclidinium and its inactive acid and alcohol metabolites using a fully validated method of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 9 treatment-emergent AEs were reported (1, placebo; 3, aclidinium 400 μg; 5, aclidinium 800 μg), all of which were mild in severity. No serious AEs were reported. There were no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs. PK parameters on Day 7 following BID dosing of aclidinium showed that steady state was achieved for aclidinium and its metabolites. On Days 1 and 7, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of aclidinium were generally observed at the first PK time point (5 min postdose) and rapidly declined, with plasma concentrations generally less than 10% of Cmax by 6 h postdose in all aclidinium groups. Mean effective t(½) after the evening dose on Day 7 ranged from 4.6 to 7.0 h for aclidinium 400 μg and 800 μg, similar to the terminal t(½) observed on Day 1 (4.5-5.9 h). Exposure for aclidinium and both metabolites increased with increasing dose, with the increase in exposure being less than dose proportional between the 400 μg and 800 μg doses. Overall, all doses of aclidinium were safe and well tolerated throughout the study. Pharmacokinetic steady state was reached for aclidinium and both metabolites within the 7-day treatment period for all doses tested. Aclidinium bromide exhibited time-independent PK following dosing to steady state, indicating that similar concentration versus time profiles will occur after repeated administration at the same dose and frequency."

Here, we describe the in vivo preclinical efficacy and lung selectivity of a novel inhaled muscarinic antagonist, TD-4208 (biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid 1-(2-{[4-(4-carbamoylpiperidin-1-ylmethyl)benzoyl]methylamino}ethyl)piperidin-4-yl ester) and compare its profile to tiotropium and glycopyrronium. In anesthetized dogs, TD-4208, along with tiotropium and glycopyrronium, produced sustained inhibition of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction for up to 24 hours. In anesthetized rats, inhaled TD-4208 exhibited dose-dependent 24-hour bronchoprotection against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. The estimated 24-hour potency (expressed as concentration of dosing solution) was 45.0 µg/ml. The bronchoprotective potencies of TD-4208 and tiotropium were maintained after 7 days of once-daily dosing, whereas glycopyrronium showed a 6-fold loss in potency after repeat dosing. To assess systemic functional activity using a clinically relevant readout, the antisialagogue effect of compounds was also evaluated. The calculated lung selectivity index (i.e., ratio of antisialagogue and bronchoprotective potency) of TD-4208 was superior to glycopyrronium after both single and repeat dosing regimens and was superior to tiotropium after repeat dosing. In conclusion, the in vivo preclinical profile suggests that TD-4208 has the potential to be a long-acting bronchodilator for once-daily treatment of respiratory diseases. Its greater functional selectivity for the lung in preclinical models may translate to an improved tolerability profile compared with marketed muscarinic receptor antagonists."

Thirty-six patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were enrolled in this two-period trial. They were initially treated with formoterol+tiotropium for 4 weeks. After this first period, they were divided in two groups of 18 patients. Both groups continued with the initial treatment for further 4 weeks, but the first group received also placebo whereas the second group received oral theophylline. The combination therapy with formoterol+tiotropium induced a significant improvement in mean predose FEV(1) and FVC at the end of the first period, and a significant reduction in dyspnea score as measure by a visual analogic scale and in use of rescue salbutamol. The second period of treatment elicited a significant further improvement in lung function and reduction in dyspnea score and salbutamol use in both groups. On the contrary, differences in improvements in FEV(1) and FVC and reduction in dyspnea score and salbutamol use between theophylline and placebo arms at the end of the second treatment period were not significant, although 5 patients reported an important relief in dyspnea during the theophylline administration period. These findings question the importance of adding theophylline in stable COPD patients already treated with two long-acting bronchodilators, but also indicate the possibility that some of them can benefit from theophylline because of a symptomatic improvement."

CD012930,0,25061288,0,Differential pharmacology and clinical utility of emerging combination treatments in the management of COPD--role of umeclidinium/vilanterol.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Bronchodilator therapy is the cornerstone in COPD treatment. Bronchodilation in COPD is mainly achieved via administration of long- and ultralong-acting β2-agonists and with long-acting muscarinic antagonists. New combinations of bronchodilators with dual-acting muscarinic antagonist and β2-agonist properties have been licensed, and others are currently being developed with the aim of achieving once-daily dosing, and therefore may improve the likelihood of treatment compliance. These combination bronchodilators include glycopyrronium bromide/indacaterol maleate, umeclidinium (UMEC) bromide/vilanterol trifenatate (VI), aclidinium bromide/formoterol and tiotropium bromide/olodaterol (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany). This review will focus mainly on studies and clinical trials involving the novel fixed-dose combination of UMEC/VI at doses of 125/25 μg and 62.5/25 μg in patients with COPD. Data from large clinical trials involving more than 4,500 COPD patients indicate that UMEC/VI is an effective once-daily treatment in COPD with improved pulmonary function.

CD012930,0,23651244,0,Combination bronchodilator therapy in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with a substantial economic impact. Recent changes in the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidance refined the classification of patients for treatment using a combination of spirometry, assessment of symptoms, and/or frequency of exacerbations. The aim of treatment remains to reduce existing symptoms while decreasing the risk of future adverse health events. Long-acting bronchodilators are the mainstay of therapy due to their proven efficacy. GOLD guidelines recommend combining long-acting bronchodilators with differing mechanisms of action if the control of COPD is insufficient with monotherapy, and recent years have seen growing interest in the additional benefits that combination of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), typified by tiotropium, with long-acting β(2)-agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol and salmeterol. Most studies have examined free combinations of currently available LAMAs and LABAs, broadly showing a benefit in terms of lung function and other patient-reported outcomes, although evidence is limited at present. Several once- or twice-daily fixed-dose LAMA/LABA combinations are under development, most involving newly developed monotherapy components.

CD012930,0,24032416,0,Effects of aclidinium bromide in a cigarette smoke-exposed Guinea pig model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Long-acting muscarinic antagonists are widely used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition to bronchodilation, muscarinic antagonism may affect pulmonary histopathological changes. The effects of long-acting muscarinic antagonists have not been thoroughly evaluated in experimental models of COPD induced by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke (CS). We investigated the effects of aclidinium bromide on pulmonary function, airway remodeling, and lung inflammation in a CS-exposed model of COPD. A total of 36 guinea pigs were exposed to CS and 22 were sham exposed for 24 weeks. Animals were nebulized daily with vehicle, 10 μg/ml, or 30 μg/ml aclidinium, resulting in six experimental groups. Pulmonary function was assessed weekly by whole-body plethysmography, determining the enhanced pause (Penh) at baseline, after treatment, and after CS/sham exposure. Lung changes were evaluated by morphometry and immunohistochemistry. CS exposure increased Penh in all conditions. CS-exposed animals treated with aclidinium showed lower baseline Penh than untreated animals (P = 0.02). CS induced thickening of all bronchial wall layers, airspace enlargement, and inflammatory cell infiltrate in airways and septa. Treatment with aclidinium abrogated the CS-induced smooth muscle enlargement in small airways (P = 0.001), and tended to reduce airspace enlargement (P = 0.054). Aclidinium also attenuated CS-induced neutrophilia in alveolar septa (P = 0.04). We conclude that, in guinea pigs chronically exposed to CS, aclidinium has an antiremodeling effect on small airways, which is associated with improved respiratory function, and attenuates neutrophilic infiltration in alveolar septa. These results indicate that, in COPD, aclidinium may exert beneficial effects on lung structure in addition to its bronchodilator action."
CD012930,0,28594587,0,Response to Indacaterol/Glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) by Sex in Patients with COPD: A Pooled Analysis from the IGNITE Program.,"In this pooled analysis, we compared the effect of indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) by sex versus other commonly used chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments and placebo. Male and female patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD who had participated in six randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were analyzed by sex, and any differences noted. The effects of IND/GLY versus salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC), glycopyrronium, tiotropium and placebo, on lung function and the patient-reported outcomes (health status, dyspnea, rescue medication use and symptoms) were assessed by sex after 26 weeks treatment. The analysis population comprised 4719 men and 1389 women. Most baseline parameters differed significantly between men and women. Nonetheless, despite these differences in baseline characteristics, IND/GLY significantly improved lung function versus placebo (p < 0.0001) and all active comparators (p < 0.01) in men and women. Overall, IND/GLY showed better improvement in dyspnea and health status compared with all other treatments in both sex. Greater reduction of rescue medication use was observed with IND/GLY versus placebo and other treatments (all p < 0.01 expect IND/GLY versus SFC). Although some variability was observed, improvements in health status, dyspnea, rescue medication use and symptoms were generally larger in women than in men. Irrespective of sex, IND/GLY provided superior efficacy to monotherapy or SFC in both men and women. Small differences in efficacy response by sex were observed, which should be evaluated further in prospective clinical studies. Nevertheless, the benefits observed with IND/GLY confirm dual bronchodilator as the preferred therapy in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD regardless of sex."

The purpose of this review is to synthesize the evidence base in the past 10 years on the development of tiotropium and its efficacy compared to other able interventions such as long-acting beta agonists (LABAs), as well as to assess its safety profile and its effects on health-related outcomes in patients with COPD. Treatment with tiotropium bromide has generally improved patients' health-related quality of life, reduced the number of patients suffering from acute exacerbations, decreased the number of hospitalizations, improved dyspnea, and reduced adverse events compared to placebo. In the past decade, several studies have examined the safety and efficacy of tiotropium in comparison to placebo and to LABAs (salmeterol, formoterol, and indacaterol) over periods ranging from 3 months to 48 months of follow-up. Head-to-head comparisons of tiotropium 18μg (once daily) with salmeterol 50μg (twice daily) in well-controlled trials demonstrated that tiotropium was superior in reducing acute exacerbation events and in improving quality of life. In a few short-term studies, indacaterol was comparable to tiotropium in its efficacy in improving health-related outcomes. Although the safety record of tiotropium has been exemplary in comparison to placebo, anticholinergic events such as dry mouth can be encountered in some patients. While the long-term safety of tiotropium when delivered in the HandiHaler® has been well documented, its delivery using the Respimat® Soft Mist Inhaler™ was associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular complications, including increased mortality when compared to placebo. The exact mechanism for this is not known but is being investigated in a large multinational study that will evaluate the long-term safety of different doses of tiotropium delivered by the Respimat® soft mist inhaler versus the HandiHaler®. Further studies are required to investigate the efficacy and safety of tiotropium in comparison with novel LABAs such as indacaterol and vilanterol, and with other emerging novel anticholinergic agents such as aclidinium bromide and NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide)."

Umeclidinium/vilanterol improved pulmonary function to a significantly greater extent than placebo and each of the individual components. Moreover, umeclidinium/vilanterol was significantly more effective than once-daily tiotropium bromide monotherapy and a twice-daily fixed combination of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate at improving pulmonary function. Umeclidinium/vilanterol also had beneficial effects on dyspnoea, use of rescue medication, exacerbations, health-related quality of life and, in one study, exercise endurance. Umeclidinium/vilanterol is generally well tolerated in patients with COPD, with the most common adverse events in clinical trials being headache and nasopharyngitis. Umeclidinium/vilanterol was not associated with a clinically relevant increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events in patients with COPD, when data from several clinical trials were pooled. Thus, inhaled umeclidinium/vilanterol extends the treatment options currently available for the maintenance treatment of adults with COPD and has the convenience of once-daily administration."

After completing double-blind treatment and washout, a subset of subjects from each treatment group entered an open-label extension and received tiotropium 18microg once daily for 8 days. The primary efficacy variable was the trough bronchodilator effect: standardized area under the FEV1 curve between 22 and 24h post-dose (FEV1 AUC(22-24h)) on Day 1. Clinically relevant improvements versus placebo in FEV1 AUC(22-24h) were seen for 400 and 200microg doses on Day 1 and all doses on Day 7. All indacaterol doses significantly (P<0.05) increased FEV1 from 5min to 24h post-dose; the 400 and 200microg doses were most effective. All doses were well tolerated. Indacaterol trough FEV1 levels compared favorably with the improvement seen by Day 8 in subjects treated with tiotropium in the open-label extension. The results confirm that indacaterol has a 24-h duration of bronchodilator effect and a fast onset of action in COPD and suggest that indacaterol could be an effective once-daily inhaled beta2-agonist bronchodilator.

Our aim was to assess two important elements of intracellular signaling involved in regulation of inflammation in COPD in patients subjected to long-acting beta2-agonist or long-acting beta2-agonist plus long-acting antimuscarinic: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) protein, which has antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and activated (CREB-P) protein which has histone acetyltransferase activity and increases histone acetylation and transcriptional activation of chromatin. Twenty one stable COPD patients (18 males and 3 females, mean age 65 years) receiving 12 μg B.I.D formoterol were assayed before and after 3 month add-on therapy, consisting of 18 μg Q.D. tiotropium. In all patients, sputum induction, spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO were performed before and after therapy. Sputum cells were isolated and processed to isolate cytosolic and nuclear fractions. PPARγ, CREB, or CREB-P proteins were quantified in subcellular fractions using Western blot. Tiotropium add-on therapy improved respiratory parameters: FEV1 and lung volumes. After therapy mean expression of PPARγ in cell nuclei was significantly increased by about 180%, while CREB and phosphorylated CREB levels in cytosol and nuclei were decreased by about 30%. Our data show that the mechanism whereby tiotropium reduces exacerbations may be associated not only with persistent increase in airway functions and reduced hyperinflation mediated by muscarinic receptors, but also with possible anti-inflammatory effects of the drug, involving increased PPARγ and decreased CREB signaling."

Due to the success of muscarinic antagonists in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the elucidation that muscarinic receptors play a role in airway remodeling, muscarinic receptors represent an attractive therapeutic target in asthma. Although short-acting muscarinic antagonists are currently limited to their use in acute asthma and as alternative bronchodilators in individuals who experience side effects with β2-agonists, recent clinical trials indicate that the long-acting muscarinic antagonist, tiotropium, deserves consideration as a potential therapeutic agent for select populations.

CD012930,0,14718448,0,The role of long-acting bronchodilators in the management of stable COPD.,"Bronchodilators form the foundation of symptomatic treatment of COPD. Several long-acting bronchodilators are now available for use in COPD, but publications of large-scale studies of their efficacy have, for the most part, postdated the publication of major clinical guidelines. This article provides a critical review of large (> or =50 patients), double-blind, clinical trials of three long-acting bronchodilators in COPD (the once-daily anticholinergic tiotropium, and the twice-daily beta(2)-agonists formoterol and salmeterol) within the context of the objectives of treatment defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. Fourteen published studies were identified, of which 12 studies were published since the release of the GOLD guidelines. All three long-acting bronchodilators were found to effectively improve lung function; however, they differed in their effects on outcomes other than bronchodilation, with salmeterol demonstrating inconsistent efficacy compared with placebo in preventing exacerbations and improving health status, and only tiotropium demonstrating consistent superiority to the short-acting bronchodilator ipratropium. Based on this review, a treatment algorithm for the introduction of long-acting bronchodilators to patients with COPD is proposed, which includes the use of long-acting bronchodilators early in the treatment algorithm."

Clinical reports have demonstrated that LABAs (salmeterol, formoterol, indacaterol, olodaterol, vilanterol) and LAMAs (tiotropium, glycopyrronium, umeclidinium, aclidinium) are useful to improving symptoms and lung function, and to reducing exacerbation and hospitarization. LABAs expect salmeterol are strong partial agonists, and LAMAs are non-specific antagonists. Ca2+ dynamics and Ca2+ sensitization contribute to relaxation of airway smooth muscle in these bronchodilators. LABAs act on orthosteric and allosteric sites on the β2-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, LAMAs act not only on orthosteric site on the muscarinic receptors, but also allosteric site on the β2-adrenergic receptors, leading to enhancing β2-adrenergic action. Allosteric GPCR modulation is involved in the synergistic effects between LABAs and LAMAs."

A randomized crossover study.,"Standard spyrometric assessment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) only evaluates bronchial obstruction. However, airflow limitation and hyperinflation are the main pathophysiological factors responsible for dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance in patients with COPD. This study evaluated the effects of aclidinium bromide 400 μg and glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg on these parameters. Patients with stable severe/very severe COPD were randomized in this double-blind, double-dummy, crossover, Phase IV study. Patients received single doses of each drug on separate days. Primary endpoints were changes in residual volume (RV) and intra-thoracic gas volume (ITGV), assessed by full-body plethysmography. Other endpoints included changes variations in lung ventilation inhomogeneity (Phase III slope of single-breath nitrogen washout test, SBN2), dyspnoea visual analogue scale, and pulmonary specific total airway resistances. Assessments were performed at baseline and 5, 15, 30, 60, and 180 min post-administration. Thirty-seven patients were randomized (31 male; mean age 71 years). Aclidinium and glycopyrronium significantly improved ITGV versus baseline at all-time points (p < 0.05). Significant improvements in RV were observed after 5 min with aclidinium and after 60 min with glycopyrronium. RV improvements were significantly greater with aclidinium than glycopyrronium from 5 to 60 min post-administration (p < 0.05).

CD012930,0,25051662,0,[Up-to-date COPD treatment].,"The strategy for the treatment and management for COPD has markedly changed. COPD has been classified as a chronic respiratory disease characterized by an irreversible airflow obstruction, but active therapeutic interventions have not been established. However, the development of pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapy and the accumulation of clinical evidence have improved the situation. The newly developed long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) and beta-agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the combination of LABA/LAMA and ICS/LABA, and comprehensive respiratory rehabilitation have significantly improved the symptoms such as cough, sputum, and dyspnea, as well as exercise tolerance, daily activity, and quality of life, and prevent the exacerbation of COPD. Furthermore, LAMA and ICS/LABA can prevent disease progression and improve the severity and survival. It has been demonstrated that inflammation of the lung in COPD affects the whole body and increases co-morbidities, which affect the QOL and survival. We should treat co-morbidities simultaneously. We should view COPD as a preventable and treatable disease, and early, active interventions involving pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments not only improve symptoms, but also reduce disease progression and improve the survival of COPD patients."

In recognition of this, there is now extensive focus on early diagnosis, secondary prevention, and optimizing medical management of the disease. While established guidelines recognize different grades of disease severity and offer a structured basis for disease management based on symptoms and risk, it is becoming increasingly evident that COPD is a condition characterized by many phenotypes and its control in a single patient may require clinicians to have access to a broader spectrum of pharmacotherapies. This review summarizes recent developments in COPD management and compares established pharmacotherapy with new and emerging pharmacotherapies including long-acting muscarinic antagonists, long-acting β-2 sympathomimetic agonists, and fixed-dose combinations of long-acting muscarinic antagonists and long-acting β-2 sympathomimetic agonists as well as inhaled cortiocosteroids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and targeted anti-inflammatory drugs. We also review the available oral medications and new agents with novel mechanisms of action in early stages of development.

CD012930,0,25364503,0,COPD: maximization of bronchodilation.,"The most recent guidelines define COPD in a multidimensional way, nevertheless the diagnosis is still linked to the limitation of airflow, usually measured by the reduction in the FEV1/FVC ratio below 70%. However, the severity of obstruction is not directly correlated to symptoms or to invalidity determined by COPD. Thus, besides respiratory function, COPD should be evaluated based on symptoms, frequency and severity of exacerbations, patient's functional status and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Therapy is mainly aimed at increasing exercise tolerance and reducing dyspnea, with improvement of daily activities and HRQoL. This can be accomplished by a drug-induced reduction of pulmonary hyperinflation and exacerbations frequency and severity. All guidelines recommend bronchodilators as baseline therapy for all stages of COPD, and long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, both beta-2 agonist (LABA) and antimuscarinic (LAMA) drugs, are the most effective in regular treatment in the clinically stable phase. The effectiveness of bronchodilators should be evaluated in terms of functional (relief of bronchial obstruction and pulmonary hyperinflation), symptomatic (exercise tolerance and HRQoL), and clinical improvement (reduction in number or severity of exacerbations), while the absence of a spirometric response is not a reason for interrupting treatment, if there is subjective improvement in symptoms. Because LABA and LAMA act via different mechanisms of action, when administered in combination they can exert additional effects, thus optimizing (i.e. maximizing) sustained bronchodilation in COPD patients with severe airflow limitation, who cannot benefit (or can get only partial benefit) by therapy with a single bronchodilator. Recently, a fixed combination of ultra LABA/LAMA (indacaterol/glycopyrronium) has shown that it is possible to get a stable and persistent bronchodilation, which can help in avoiding undesirable fluctuations of bronchial calibre."

Human lung fibroblasts express muscarinic receptors and the present study aimed to explore their role in controlling collagen synthesis. MRC-5, HEL-299 and primary human lung fibroblasts (phLFb) were cultured. Incorporation of [(3)H]-proline into cellular proteins was determined as measure of collagen synthesis. In MRC-5 cells, the muscarinic agonist carbachol enhanced [(3)H]-proline incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner (effective concentration of 50%: 220 nM, increase at 10 microM by 40-55%, in a different series of experiments). Likewise, 10 microM oxotremorine caused an increase of approximately 65%. For comparison, transforming growth factor-beta1 (5 ng x mL(-1)) caused an increase of approximately 80%. Effects of carbachol on total [(3)H]-proline incorporation and collagenase-sensitive [(3)H]-proline fraction were similar. The effect of 10 microM carbachol was inhibited by tiotropium (inhibitory concentration of 50%: 110 pM), prevented by pertussis toxin and the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, PD 98059. Muscarinic agonists also enhanced [(3)H]-proline incorporation in a tiotropium-sensitive manner in HEL-299 cells and phLFb. In human lung fibroblasts, muscarinic receptors exert stimulatory effects on collagen synthesis. Prolonged blockade of muscarinic-induced collagen synthesis may contribute to reported beneficial long-term effects of anticholinergics in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

Tiotropium/olodaterol maintenance therapy improved lung function to a greater extent than the individual components or placebo and provided clinically meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life and dyspnoea in 12- and 52-week studies. Tiotropium/olodaterol consistently improved 24-h lung function in 6-week studies, providing greater benefits than the monotherapies, placebo or twice-daily fixed-dose fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. Inspiratory capacity and exercise endurance were also improved with tiotropium/olodaterol following 6 or 12 weeks' treatment.

CD012930,0,26937187,0,Exacerbations of COPD.,"Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are defined as sustained worsening of a patient's condition beyond normal day-to-day variations that is acute in onset, and that may also require a change in medication and/or hospitalization. Exacerbations have a significant and prolonged impact on health status and outcomes, and negative effects on pulmonary function. A significant proportion of exacerbations are unreported and therefore left untreated, leading to a poorer prognosis than those treated. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous, and various phenotypes have been proposed which differ in biologic basis, prognosis, and response to therapy. Identification of biomarkers could enable phenotype-driven approaches for the management and prevention of exacerbations. For example, several biomarkers of inflammation can help to identify exacerbations most likely to respond to oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, and patients with a frequent exacerbator phenotype, for whom preventative treatment is appropriate. Reducing the frequency of exacerbations would have a beneficial impact on patient outcomes and prognosis. Preventative strategies include modification of risk factors, treatment of comorbid conditions, the use of bronchodilator therapy with long-acting β2-agonists or long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and inhaled corticosteroids. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying COPD exacerbations will help to optimize use of the currently available and new interventions for preventing and treating exacerbations."

CD012930,0,27254954,0,[Role of ICS/LABA on COPD treatment].,"In the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchodilators such as long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long acting β agonist(LABA) play key roles for improving respiratory function and symptoms, and reducing risk of exacerbation. However, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a key medicine for bronchial asthma, is limitedly used in COPD treatment. Japanese Respiratory Society recommends to use ICS for severe COPD patients who have been frequently exacerbated, because previous clinical studies indicated that ICS reduces exacerbation in moderate to severe COPD patients. Asthma sometimes overlaps with COPD, and symptoms of those patients are not well controlled by the bronchodilation therapy alone. Therefore, ICS/LABA or ICS/LAMA should be prescribed to those overlapped patients. Concentration of exhaled nitrogen oxide and percentage of peripheral eosinophil may be good biomarkers for discriminating the COPD patients who have good response to ICS treatment."

In clinical studies aclidinium bromide achieved better beneficial effects than other bronchodilators; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. This study assessed the effect of aclidinium bromide combined with formoterol on COPD lung (n=20) and non-COPD lung (n=10) derived epithelial cells stimulated with TGF-β1+carbachol on: (i) the generation of mesenchymal cells in relation to epithelial cells, (II) extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and (iii) the interaction of ECM on the generation of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. TGF-β1+carbachol enhanced the generation of mesenchymal cells, which was significantly reduced by aclidinium bromide or formoterol. The effect of combined drugs was additive. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase and Smad by specific inhibitors or aclidinium bromide reduced the generation of mesenchymal cells. In mesenchymal cells, TGF-β1+carbachol induced the deposition of collagen-I and fibronectin which was prevented by both drugs dose-dependently. Formoterol alone reduced collagen-I deposition via cAMP, this however, was overruled by TGF-β1+carbachol and rescued by aclidinium bromide. Inhibition of fibronectin was cAMP independent, but involved p38 MAP kinase and Smad. Seeding epithelial cells on ECM collagen-I and fibronectin induced mesenchymal cell generation, which was reduced by aclidinium bromide and formoterol. Our results suggest that the beneficial effect of aclidinium bromide and formoterol involves cAMP affecting both, the accumulation of mesenchymal cells and ECM remodeling, which may explain the beneficial effect of the drugs on lung function in COPD."

The effect of bronchodilators on nocturnal hypoxemia is not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a single dose of Formoterol or Tiotropium, administered in the evening, could improve nocturnal hypoxemia in patients with stable middle/severe COPD. Thirty-seven patients (25 M/12 F; mean age 68.97 +/- 8.57, range 50-78; mean FEV1% of predicted 46.29 +/- 9.2) with PaO2 > 60 mmHg, but with significant oxygen desaturation during sleep and apnea/hypopnea index < or = 10 were selected. They randomly underwent three consecutive nocturnal pulsoxymetry: baseline and after taking placebo and 12 microg of Formoterol (20 pts) or 18 microg of Tiotropium (17 pts) in the evening. FEV1 and IC, measured after 1 h of taking bronchodilators, were significantly higher than placebo. The variation, with regards to baseline values, in mean heart rate and Lowest SpO2% measured after Tiotropium (-1.68 +/- 4.01 and 3.23 +/- 8.58 respectively) was higher (p < 0.05) than placebo (-0.108 +/- 2.85 and 0.29 +/- 7.05 respectively). Moreover, the trend time of SpO2% (measured by pulse-oximeter at each hour of total time registration) after Tiotropium was significantly higher than baseline or placebo (p < 0.01). Instead, the trend time of SpO2% after Formoterol, except for an initial transient hypoxemia fall, was similar to baseline condition and after placebo. Also the trend time of heart rate resulted significantly lower in the Tiotropium group, but higher in the Formoterol group. In conclusion, Formoterol does not seem to influence the nocturnal hypoxemia in stable COPD patients probably for the worsening V/Q ratio. On the contrary, a single dose of tiotropium seems to decrease the severity in the nocturnal desaturations in stable COPD patients probably due to the reduction in the nocturnal bronchial colinergic tone."

We tested the type of effect ex vivo on isolated human bronchi and then in vivo in COPD patients. The analysis of the interaction between aclidinium and formoterol in vitro was measured by applying the Unified Theory, whereas that in COPD patients was measured by applying the Bliss Independence criterion. Aclidinium and formoterol administered alone completely relaxed human isolated bronchial tissues sub-maximally pre-contracted with ACh in a concentration-dependent manner with similar potency (EC50: aclidinium 4.64 ± 0.78 nM, formoterol 2.71 ± 0.21), whereas the interaction of aclidinium plus formoterol produced moderate to strong synergism. Changes in FEV1 values showed that inhaled aclidinium and formoterol induced a significant and time-dependent bronchodilatory effect during the study time. The inhalation of aclidinium and formoterol in combination significantly anticipated at 5 min post-administration the bronchodilatory effect of FEV1, compared with the effect of drugs administered alone. There was a synergistic interaction for FEV1 at 5 min and from 120 min to 240 min post-inhalation, whereas from 30 min to 60 min post-administration the drug interaction was additive. This study shows that aclidinium and formoterol can produce a significant synergistic interaction that may have a role also in the clinic setting."

The issue to prescribe an appropriate inhalation therapy to COPD patients with significant handling or coordination difficulties represents a common clinical experience; in the latter case, the choice of an inadequate inhalation device may jeopardize the adherence to the treatment and eventually lead to its ineffectiveness. Treatment options that do not require particular timing for coordination between activation and/or inhalation or require high flow thresholds to be activated should represent the best treatment option for these patients. Nebulized bronchodilators, usually used only in acute conditions such as COPD exacerbations, could fulfill this gap, enabling an adequate drug administration during tidal breathing and without the need for patients' cooperation.

In addition, tiotropium reduces exacerbation frequency, dyspnoea and improves exercise capacity. As the latter has been associated with airway inflammation then this suggests that, in addition to the well-known anti-bronchoconstrictor effect, tiotropium might also display anti-inflammatory properties. With our current state of knowledge, however, it is not necessary to postulate an anti-inflammatory effect for tiotropium (Spiriva), rather inhibition of smooth muscle constriction with subsequent effects on lung hyperinflation (and possibly pulmonary circulation) can explain the effects on exacerbation frequency, dyspnoea and exercise capacity.

CD012930,0,26929634,0,New combinations in the treatment of COPD: rationale for aclidinium-formoterol.,"The current guidelines on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) recommend the prominent use of bronchodilators, including long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), while inhaled corticosteroids are recommended only in patients with severe disease or frequent exacerbations. LABA-LAMA combinations are indicated when single bronchodilators are insufficient to control COPD. A number of LABA-LAMA combinations are available, based on twice-daily or once-daily administration according to the 12- or 24-hour duration of action, respectively. The aclidinium-formoterol combination is based on the new LAMA aclidinium bromide, which has a high selectivity for M3 muscarinic receptors and a fast onset of action, and the well-known LABA formoterol. Both drugs require twice-daily administration. The fixed-dose combination of aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg has shown in randomized controlled trials fast and sustained bronchodilation that was greater than either monotherapy and provided clinically significant improvements in dyspnea and health status compared with placebo, also reducing the use of rescue medications. The overall incidence of adverse events was low and comparable to placebo. These data define the aclidinium-formoterol fixed-dose combination as a new treatment option for patients with COPD. The need for twice-daily administration could be an apparent disadvantage compared to the available once-daily LABA-LAMA combinations, but the immediately perceived benefit in reducing dyspnea due to the fast onset of action, as well as reported correct patient use and satisfaction with the Genuair inhaler might prove useful in favoring adherence."

CD012930,0,22222945,0,Beyond lung function in COPD management: effectiveness of LABA/LAMA combination therapy on patient-centred outcomes.,"Bronchodilators are central to the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical studies combining different classes of bronchodilators, in particular a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA), have demonstrated greater improvements in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1) in patients with COPD than monotherapy. FEV1 has served as an important diagnostic measurement of COPD, and the majority of clinical studies of currently available pharmacotherapies grade effectiveness of treatment regimens based on improvements in FEV1. However, FEV1 alone may not adequately reflect the overall health status of the patient. Published evidence suggests that LABA/LAMA combination therapies demonstrate greater improvements in patient-centred outcomes such as dyspnoea, symptoms, rescue medication use, and quality of life than individual drugs used alone. Evaluating patient-centred outcomes associated with COPD is likely to play an important role in future research as a measure of overall treatment effectiveness. Raising awareness of the importance of outcomes beyond lung function alone, particularly in primary care where most patients initially present themselves for medical evaluation, should form a fundamental part of a more holistic approach to COPD management."

With better understanding of the inflammatory and destructive processes in the pathophysiology of COPD, several new targets have been identified. Several mediator antagonists tested in COPD patients have so far been disappointing, but CXC receptor 2 antagonists that block pulmonary neutrophil and monocyte recruitment may be more promising. Broad-spectrum antiinflammatory drugs, including inhibitors of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 4, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, and phosphoinositide-3-kinase-gamma, may be more effective, but the side effects will be a major limitation so that inhaled delivery may be necessary.

In any case, trials comparing UMEC/VI with other dual bronchodilator FDCs, and also with inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β-agonist FDCs, are needed to assess the advantages, if any, of UMEC/VI FDC over other therapies."

CD012930,0,18270687,0,"Pulmonary fibroblasts, an emerging target for anti-obstructive drugs.","Fibrotic alterations are part of the airway re-modelling processes observed in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is increasing evidence that in addition to acute bronchodilatory effects, classical anti-obstructive drugs such as muscarinic antagonists and beta-adrenoceptor agonists may also modulate long-term re-modelling processes. The present review aims to summarise muscarinic and beta-adrenergic effects on pulmonary fibroblasts. Recent experimental evidence demonstrated muscarinic stimulatory effects on pulmonary fibroblasts, and long-term blockade of these pro-fibrotic effects may contribute to the beneficial effects of muscarinic antagonists, as observed particularly for the long-acting muscarinic antagonist tiotropium. On the other hand, beta-adrenoceptor agonists, via activation of adenylyl cyclase, can also exert various inhibitory effects on pulmonary fibroblasts, and these anti-fibrotic effects are mimicked by other agents that cause an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors or EP2 prostanoid receptor agonists. In addition, the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, protein kinase A and exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac) and potential interactions between these cellular signalling pathways are discussed."

CD012930,0,23409722,0,Long-acting beta-agonists and their association with inhaled corticosteroids in COPD.,"Inhaled bronchodilators, including beta(2)-agonists and antimuscaric receptor antagonists, are the mainstay of pharmacotherapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The short-acting beta(2)-agonists, including salbutamol, and fenoterol, have a rapid onset of action, a bronchodilating effect for 3-6 h and are used on demand. The long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs), including salmeterol and formoterol, have 12-hour duration of action and are used with a twice-daily dosing regimen for long-term COPD treatment. Unlike salmeterol, formoterol has a rapid onset of action. Pharmacological characteristics required by novel inhaled LABAs include 24 h bronchodilator effect in vivo which would make them suitable for once daily administration (ultra-LABA), high potency and selectivity for beta(2)-adrenoceptors, rapid onset of action, low oral bioavailability (< 5%) after inhalation, and high systemic clearance. Indacaterol, which has been approved for long-term treatment of COPD in Europe and in the USA, has a 24-h duration of action and a once-daily dosing regimen. Newer ultra-LABAs, including olodaterol, vilanterol, milveterol, carmoterol, and abediterol, are in development. Combination with ICS (fluticasone/salmeterol, budesonide/formoterol, beclomethasone/formoterol) appears to provide an additional benefit over the monocomponent therapy, although the extent of this benefit is variable and often not clinically significant in all the endpoints assessed. In patients with COPD, treatment with ICS is associated with increased risk of pneumonia which should be carefully considered when assessing the risk/benefit ratio of ICS/LABA combinations. Subphenotyping of patients with COPD (e.g., frequent exacerbations, sputum eosinophilia, mixed asthma/COPD phenotype) might help identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from addition of ICS to bronchodilating treatment. Ultra-LABA/ long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) combination treatment is under development and is likely to become a standard pharmacological strategy for COPD. Dual-pharmacology inhaled muscarinic antagonist-beta(2) agonist (MABA) molecules provide a new approach to the treatment of COPD."

This was a randomized, open-label, three-period crossover, single- and repeat-dose study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of inhaled UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg (delivering 55/22 μg) and UMEC/VI 125/25 μg (delivering 113/22 μg) compared with their monotherapy components (UMEC 62.5 μg, UMEC 125 μg and, VI 25 μg [delivering 55, 113, and 22 μg, respectively]) in healthy Chinese subjects (n=20). UMEC and VI were rapidly absorbed following single and repeat dosing (time to maximum plasma concentration [tmax]: UMEC = 5 min; VI = 5 min). The median tlast was 2–4 h for UMEC and 1–2 h for VI following single doses of UMEC/VI and UMEC monotherapy (both doses). UMEC reached steady-state prior to Day 10; steady-state for VI could not be assessed. UMEC accumulation following repeat dosing was 11–34% based on Cmax and 19–59% based on area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 2 h (AUC(0-2)). VI accumulation following repeat dosing was 25–66% based on Cmax and 17–43% based on AUC(0-2). The evidence was not sufficient to suggest that systemic exposure was substantially different between UMEC/VI combination therapy and the constituent monotherapies following single or repeat dosing. Following both single- and repeat-dose administration, the inter-subject coefficient of variation for all UMEC PK parameter estimates ranged from 12% to 165% for all treatments, indicating a wide range of variability in inhaled PK parameters. Twelve subjects experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE). Six subjects experienced ≥1 treatment-related AE; the most commonly reported treatment-related AE was chest discomfort (n=3 [15%]). No clinically important changes in vital signs or electrocardiogram parameters were reported.

Understanding of current resource use, treatment strategies and outcomes can improve future COPD management, for patient benefit and to aid efficient service delivery. This study aimed to describe exacerbation frequency, pharmacotherapy and health resource use in COPD management in routine UK primary care. A retrospective, observational study using routine clinical records of 511 patients with COPD, was undertaken in 10 General Practices in England.

Following incubation of aclidinium in pooled samples of human, rat, guinea pig or dog plasma, the rate of hydrolysis was quantified by reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Tiotropium and ipratropium were used as comparators. The in vitro biochemical profile of the hydrolysis metabolites of aclidinium was assessed in human M(1) to M(5) muscarinic receptors and in a standard selectivity panel (85 G protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs], ion channels and enzymes).

Many pivotal trials have shown that all of these FDCs are more effective than monotherapies in inducing bronchodilation and do not amplify the possible adverse events (AEs) that are characteristic of LAMAs and LABAs when used as monotherapy. Unfortunately, these clinical trials have included a very small and highly selected fraction of the COPD patient population. Therefore, it is questionable whether such data can be extrapolated to a larger, 'real-life' population of patients with COPD, especially given that COPD patients with co-morbidities are often excluded from clinical trials, COPD is a major risk factor for most cardiovascular diseases, and both LAMAs and LABAs have a high potential to impact cardiac activities. All clinical trials have been conducted under widely varying conditions and, consequently, AE rates of a drug observed in a clinical trial cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The primary variable was the percentage of patients with an increase in FEV(1) of ≥10% above baseline at 30 minutes post-dose. Other assessments included change from baseline in FEV(1) and dyspnea over 3 hours post-dose. A total of 115 patients entered the study.

There was a trend to an increase in calories and metabolic equivalents of task (METs) after formoterol and a decrease after tiotropium, but changes were not statistically significant. Total energy expenditure for each 6-MWT was not changed by formoterol, but decreased in significant manner 6h after the inhalation of tiotropium. Active energy expenditure at physical activity level of more than 3 METs decreased significantly after tiotropium at each 6-MWT, but not after formoterol. We did not find any significant correlation between the changes in lung function and those of parameters recorded with SenseWear Armband.

To demonstrate similar benefits with a nebulized LABA, a placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution in subjects receiving tiotropium as a maintenance treatment for COPD. After a 7-14-day screening period using tiotropium 18 microg once daily, subjects with diagnosed COPD (> or = 25% to <65% predicted FEV(1)) were randomized to receive 20 microg formoterol fumarate inhalation solution twice daily for nebulization plus tiotropium (FFIS/TIO) or nebulized placebo twice daily plus tiotropium (PLA/TIO) for 6 weeks. Efficacy was assessed with spirometry at each visit (Day 1, Week 1, 3, 6), the transition dyspnea index (TDI), and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Baseline characteristics were comparable, including mean FEV(1)% predicted. At Week 6, FEV(1) AUC(0-3) was 1.52 L for FFIS/TIO-treated subjects vs. 1.34 L for PLA/TIO-treated subjects (p<0.0001). The mean TDI scores in the FFIS/TIO and PLA/TIO groups were 2.30 and 0.16, respectively (p=0.0002). SGRQ did not change significantly with 6 weeks treatment, with the exception of FFIS/TIO improvements in symptom score vs. PLA/TIO (p=0.04).

CD012930,0,22726538,0,Clinical trial design in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: current perspectives and considerations with regard to blinding of tiotropium.,"Randomised, double-blind, controlled trials are considered the gold standard for evaluating a pharmacological agent, as they minimise any potential bias. However, it is not always possible to perform double-blind trials, particularly for medications delivered via specific devices, e.g. inhalers. In such cases, open-label studies can be employed instead. Methods used to minimise any potential bias introduced by open-label study design include randomisation, crossover study design, and objective measurements of primary efficacy and safety variables. Concise reviews analysing the effect of blinding procedures of comparator drugs on outcomes in respiratory trials are limited. Here, we compare data from different chronic obstructive pulmonary disease trials with once-daily indacaterol versus a blinded or non-blinded comparator. The clinical trial programme for indacaterol, a once-daily, long-acting β2-agonist, used tiotropium as a comparator either in an open-label or blinded fashion. Data from these studies showed that the effects of tiotropium were consistent for forced expiratory volume in 1 second, an objective measure, across blinded and non-blinded studies. The data were consistent with previous studies of double-blind tiotropium, suggesting that the open-label use of tiotropium did not introduce treatment bias. The effect of tiotropium on subjective measures (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire; transition dyspnoea index) varied slightly across blinded and non-blinded studies, indicating that minimal bias was introduced by using open-label tiotropium. Importantly, the studies used randomised, open-label tiotropium patients to treatment allocation, a method shown to minimise bias to a greater degree than blinding. In conclusion, it is important when reporting a clinical trial to be transparent about who was blinded and how the blinding was performed; if the design is open-label, additional efforts must be made to minimise risk of bias. If these recommendations are followed, and the data are considered in the full knowledge of any potential sources of bias, results with tiotropium suggest that data from open-label studies can provide valuable and credible evidence of the effects of therapy."

CD012930,0,24669382,0,Glycopyrronium for inhalation. COPD: another antimuscarinic with cardiac adverse effects that require monitoring.,"The most effective way of slowing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) progression is to eliminate exposure to the inhaled triggering factor, which is usually tobacco smoke. At best, inhaled bronchodilators have only a limited impact on the symptoms of COPD. In the absence of a better alternative, salbutamol, a beta-2 agonist, or ipratropium, an antimuscarinic, are tried first, despite their adverse effects. ""Long-acting"" beta-2 agonists are an option for patients with permanent symptoms, especially dyspnoea that disrupts sleep. Glycopyrronium, a long-acting antimuscarinic, is authorised in the European Union for maintenance treatment of adults with COPD. Clinical evaluation does not include any trials versus salbutamol. It is based on three trials, in a total of 2051 patients that compared glycopyrronium versus placebo and sometimes versus tiotropium, another long-acting inhaled antimuscarinic. Mortality rates were similar in the different arms of these trials. There was no difference in efficacy between glycopyrronium and tiotropium. In two of these trials, which lasted at least 26 weeks, ""serious"" cardiac adverse events were more frequent with glycopyrronium than with placebo or tiotropium. However, the number of events was too small to determine the precise cardiac harms associated with glycopyrronium. The European Medicines Agency has therefore asked for a specific registry to be created. The adverse effect profile of glycopyrronium appears similar to that of inhaled antimuscarinics, including atropinic disorders and upper respiratory infections. The inhaler is simple to use and does not require hand-breath coordination. In practice, glycopyrronium does not provide a therapeutic advantage in the treatment of patients with COPD. When an inhaled long-acting drug is contemplated, it is best to choose a beta-2 agonist (formoterol or salmeterol), used either continuously or on demand."

Because the potential of tiotropium for additive effects is yet unknown, the acute effects of adding this anticholinergic agent to formoterol were also explored. A total of 20 outpatients with stable COPD were enrolled. Single doses of 12 microg formoterol, 18 microg tiotropium, and 12 microg formoterol+18 microg tiotropium were given. Serial measurements of FEV1 were performed over 24 h. Formoterol, either alone or in combination with tiotropium, elicited a significantly faster onset of action and showed a trend for a greater maximum bronchodilation than tiotropium alone. At 24 h, mean FEV1 continued to be significantly higher than pre-dosing value following tiotropium and formoterol+tiotropium. These findings indicate that formoterol and tiotropium have different profiles that make both agents attractive alternatives in the treatment of stable COPD. Since tiotropium ensures prolonged bronchodilation, whereas formoterol adds fast onset and a greater peak effect, the two drugs appear complementary."

Besides its proven direct bronchodilatory activity, recent clinical studies demonstrated that tiotropium is able to reduce the exacerbation rate and impact the clinical course of COPD. One significant pathological feature believed to be causative for the progressive nature of COPD is chronic pulmonary inflammation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of tiotropium on cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for four days with increasing exposure time for up to 6h per day to elicit pulmonary inflammation and mediator release. One hour before smoke exposure, animals were treated with tiotropium by inhalation (0.01-0.3mg/mL) for 5 min; 18h after the last CS exposure a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Tiotropium concentration-dependently inhibited pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation with an IC(50) of 0.058 mg/mL and a maximum inhibition of 60% at 0.3mg/mL. Furthermore, the CS-induced pulmonary release of leukotriene B(4), interleukin-6, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha and -2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha was dose-dependently reduced. The bronchodilatory activity of tiotropium against acetycholine-induced bronchoconstriction was found to be in the same dose range as the anti-inflammatory activity with an IC(50) of 0.045 mg/mL and a maximum bronchodilation of 90% at 0.3mg/mL. Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of tiotropium on the course of COPD shown in patients may be associated with an anti-inflammatory activity."

Dynamic hyperinflation is the pathophysiological disorder responsible for dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance in COPD. Formoterol is faster than salmeterol in diminishing air-trapping. It has been shown that treatment with formoterol and tiotropium in COPD patients improves FEV(1), FVC, IC, symptoms score and quality of life in comparison with tiotropium applied alone. Among LABA and inhaled glucocorticosteroids combinations, those containing formoterol have a more beneficial effect on the ability to perform simple morning activities (budesonide/formoterol was better than fluticasone/salmeterol). Beclomethasone/formoterol - 400/24 mcg/die, in comparison with fluticasone/salmeterol - 500/100 mcg/die significantly reduced air-trapping and dyspnea in COPD patients. The comparison of budesonide/formoterol - 400/12 mcg 2 x die with beclomethasone/ /formoterol - 200/12 mcg 2 x die has shown similar influence of both combinations on FEV(1), dyspnea, 6-minute walk test, symptoms score and quality of life. The addition of budesonide and formoterol combination to tiotropium gives further benefits: reduces number of exacerbations, improves FEV1, symptoms score and performance of simple morning routines. Doctors should pay more attention to symptoms and limitations in simple activities in the morning and adequately adjust the treatment."

CD012930,0,23534447,0,Emerging role of long acting muscarinic antagonists for asthma.,"Acetlycholine is involved in the control of airway smooth muscle constriction and in recruitment of inflammatory cells via neuronal and paracrine effects on muscarinic type 3 receptors. Long acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are well established in guidelines for COPD but are not currently licensed for use in asthma. There are emerging data from key clinical trials to show that LAMA may confer bronchodilator effects and improved control when used in addition to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) alone or in conjunction with long acting β-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA). Further studies in persistent asthmatic patients are required to evaluate ICS sparing effects of LAMA looking particularly at airway hyper-responsiveness and surrogate inflammatory markers, in addition to evaluation of possible synergy between LAMA and LABA when given together. Future possible development of combination inhalers comprising ICS/LAMA or ICS/LAMA/LABA will require long term studies looking at asthma control and exacerbations in both adult and paediatric patients."

Trials of maintenance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatments focus on improvement in lung function and reductions in exacerbations, while patients are much more concerned about symptoms and health status. Our aim was to investigate the effects of tiotropium + olodaterol on patient-reported health outcomes, breathlessness and night-time rescue medication use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compared to placebo, tiotropium or olodaterol monotherapy. Two pairs of replicate, phase III studies of 12 (OTEMTO 1 + 2) and 52 weeks' (TONADO 1 + 2) duration were evaluated, in which patients received either tiotropium + olodaterol 2.5/5 or 5/5 μg, tiotropium 2.5 or 5 μg, olodaterol 5 μg or placebo, all delivered once daily via Respimat inhaler. Patient-reported outcomes included breathlessness assessed by transition dyspnoea index focal score, health status assessed by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score and night-time rescue medication use at 12 or 24 weeks. Outcomes from the pooled study data are reported. Overall, 1621 and 5162 patients were treated in the OTEMTO and TONADO trials, respectively. Significantly larger improvements in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and transition dyspnoea index focal scores were observed and a greater proportion of patients were responders to therapy (based on minimum clinically important differences in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and transition dyspnoea index) with tiotropium + olodaterol compared to either monotherapy or to placebo. Tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 µg significantly reduced night-time rescue medication usage."
CD012930,0,25801643,0,Long-acting muscarinic antagonists for the prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have important consequences for lung function, health status and mortality. Furthermore, they are associated with high economic costs, predominantly related to hospitalization. They are managed acutely with short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics; however, a large proportion of COPD exacerbations are unreported and therefore untreated or self-managed. There is evidence to suggest that these unreported exacerbations also have important consequences for health status; therefore, reducing exacerbation risk is an important goal in the management of COPD. Current guidelines recommend long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) as first-line bronchodilator therapy in patients with stable COPD who have a high risk of exacerbation or increased symptoms. To date, three LAMAs, tiotropium bromide, aclidinium bromide and glycopyrronium bromide, have been approved as maintenance bronchodilator treatments for stable COPD. These all provide clinically significant improvements in lung function, reduce symptoms and improve health status compared with placebo in patients with COPD. This paper reviews evidence from randomized, controlled clinical trials demonstrating that tiotropium, aclidinium and glycopyrronium reduce exacerbation risk in patients with COPD. Reductions were seen irrespective of the exacerbation measure used, whether time to first event or annualized exacerbation rate. Furthermore, studies with aclidinium suggest LAMAs can reduce exacerbation risk irrespective of whether exacerbation events are assessed, using an event-based approach or a symptom-based method which includes unreported events. Together these results demonstrate that LAMAs have the potential to provide clinical benefit in the management of exacerbations in patients with stable COPD."

More recently bronchoscopic treatments are emerging for COPD. Among them endobronchial valves (EBV) and endobronchial coils (EBC), next to endobronchial stents, sclerosing agents, targeted lung denervation and liquid nitrogen metered cryospray.

CD012930,0,23922496,0,Indacaterol: a comprehensive review.,"At present there is no cure for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, some nonpharmacologic treatments, such as rehabilitation and lung volume reduction surgery, as well as pharmacologic intervention, can relieve some of the patient's symptoms and improve quality of life, while also reducing the rate of exacerbations and hospitalizations. There needs to be a paradigm shift away from the unjustified nihilistic approach to COPD towards considering it a preventable and treatable disease. After patients quit smoking and start to lead healthier lifestyles, long-acting bronchodilators, such as long-acting beta-adrenergic agents (LABA) and long-acting antimuscarinic agents (LAMA), are recommended as the cornerstone of treatment for COPD, either as monotherapy or in combination. COPD is characterized by a reduced maximum expiratory flow and slow forced emptying of the lungs, which progress over time and are not completely reversible. In this condition, gas gets trapped in the lungs and pulmonary hyperinflation occurs. LABA and LAMA improve airway patency and deflate the lungs. Indacaterol is the first once-daily LABA approved for treatment of COPD, and is administered by inhalation through the Breezhaler® device. The speed of bronchodilation is similar to that with salbutamol (ie, about five minutes) and longer (ie, 24 hours) than that with traditional LABA, with the same 12-hour effect as salmeterol and formoterol, both of which require twice-daily administration. This is why indacaterol has been called the ""ultra-LABA"". On the one hand, the fast onset of action provides immediate relief of symptoms, and on the other, its constant 24-hour bronchodilation provides ""pharmacologic stenting"" which facilitates lung emptying, thereby decreasing trapped gas and pulmonary hyperinflation. Once-daily administration of a fast and long-acting bronchodilator can improve patient adherence with therapy, which is known to be a major problem for many medical treatments. Dose-finding trials have shown that 75 μg is the minimum dose needed to achieve clinically important improvement. However, indacaterol 150 μg and 300 μg achieve an even greater improvement in lung function and patient-oriented outcomes. Further, these two doses of indacaterol significantly reduce pulmonary hyperinflation, thereby improving exercise tolerance and ability to perform day-to-day activities. It is more effective on lung volumes at the 300 μg dose than formoterol, and better than salmeterol and tiotropium at the 150 μg dose, at least in the acute setting. It is noteworthy that few studies document these results in patients with COPD and moderate airflow obstruction. These are exactly the kind of patients our research should be concentrating on, in view of the accelerated decay in forced expiratory volume in one second at this stage of the disease. Finally, all the relevant studies show that indacaterol is consistently well tolerated by patients with COPD at every stage, and that it has a high safety profile."
CD012930,0,27442618,0,Morning and night symptoms in primary care COPD patients: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study. An UNLOCK study from the IPCRG.,"COPD symptoms show a diurnal variability. However, morning and night variability has generally not been taken into consideration in disease management plans. The aims of this study were to cross-sectionally assess morning and night symptom prevalence and correlation with health status and disease severity in COPD, and to determine to what extent they could predict longitudinal outcomes, exacerbations and health status. A further aim is to explore whether the CCQ is able to depict this morning/night symptomatology. We included 2,269 primary care COPD patients (58% male, 49% current smokers, with a mean age of 65±11 years) from a Dutch Asthma/COPD service. Spirometry, patient history, the Clinical COPD Questionnaire(CCQ) and the Asthma Control Questionnaire(ACQ) were assessed; we used the latter to evaluate morning (question 2) and night symptoms (question 1). A total of 1159 (51.9%) patients reported morning symptoms (ACQ question 2>0) and 879 (39.4%) had night complaints (ACQ question 1>0). Patients with morning/night symptoms were mostly smokers and had on average poorer lung function, higher CCQ scores and used more rescue inhalers (P<0.0001). Patients using long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) had less night symptoms, showing a possible favourable effect. Only a small proportion of stable or slightly unstable patients (CCQ total scores <2) had severe morning symptoms (ACQ 2⩾4: n=19, 1.1%) or severe night symptoms (ACQ 1⩾4: n=11, 0.7%). Night symptoms seemed to predict future exacerbations; however, baseline exacerbations were the strongest predictors (n=346, OR:4.13, CI: 2.45-6.95, P<0.000). Morning symptoms increased the odds of poor health status at follow-up (n=346, OR:12.22, CI:4.76-31.39, P<0.000). Morning and night symptoms in COPD patients are common, and they are associated with poor health status and predicted future exacerbations. Our study showed that patients with morning/night symptoms have higher scores in CCQ, and therefore we do not really miss patients with high morning/night symptomatology when we only measure CCQ. Severe morning symptoms predicted worsening of COPD health status."

CD012930,0,18686730,0,Formoterol in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Bronchodilators represent the hallmark of symptomatic treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). There are four categories of bronchodilators: anticholinergics, methylxanthines, short-acting beta2-agonists, and long-acting beta2-agonists such as formoterol. Significant research has been performed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of formoterol in the therapeutic field of COPD. Formoterol exhibits a rapid onset of bronchodilation similar to that observed with salbutamol, yet its long bronchodilatory duration is comparable to salmeterol. In addition, formoterol presents with a clear superiority in lung function improvement compared with either ipratropium bromide or oral theophylline, while its efficacy improves when administered in combination with ipratropium. Formoterol has been shown to better reduce dynamic hyperinflation, which is responsible for exercise intolerance and dyspnea in COPD patients, compared with other bronchodilators, whereas it exerts synergistic effect with tiotropium. Moreover, formoterol reduces exacerbations, increases days free of use of rescue medication and improves patients' quality of life and disease symptoms. Formoterol has a favorable safety profile and is better tolerated than theophylline. Collectively, data extracted from multicenter clinical trials support formoterol as a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of COPD."
CD012930,0,22217233,0,Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder: a review of its use in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"The anticholinergic agent tiotropium bromide (Spiriva®) is a long-acting bronchodilator that is indicated for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder, administered using the HandiHaler® device, in patients with COPD, as well as reviewing its pharmacological properties and the results of pharmacoeconomic analyses. Shorter-term placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD demonstrated significantly higher trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) responses with tiotropium bromide than with placebo, confirming it has a duration of action of ≥24 hours and is suitable for once-daily administration. Lung function improved to a greater extent with tiotropium bromide than with ipratropium bromide or, in most instances, salmeterol. Indacaterol was shown to be noninferior to tiotropium bromide in terms of the trough FEV(1) response. The large, 4-year UPLIFT® trial did not show a significant reduction in the annual rate of decline in FEV(1) with tiotropium bromide versus placebo in patients with COPD, although subgroup analyses demonstrated a significantly lower rate of decline with tiotropium bromide than with placebo in some patient groups (e.g. patients with moderate COPD, patients aged ≥50 years, patients not receiving maintenance therapy at baseline). Tiotropium bromide prevented exacerbations in patients with COPD, with a significantly lower exacerbation rate and a significantly longer time to first exacerbation seen with tiotropium bromide than with placebo or salmeterol. Exacerbation rates did not significantly differ between patients receiving tiotropium bromide and those receiving salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. Tiotropium bromide also had beneficial effects on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and other endpoints, such as dyspnoea and rescue medication use. Combination therapy with tiotropium bromide plus formoterol with or without budesonide improved lung function to a significantly greater extent than tiotropium bromide alone in patients with COPD. In addition, exacerbation rates were lower and HR-QOL was improved with tiotropium bromide plus budesonide/formoterol versus tiotropium bromide alone. Although the addition of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate to tiotropium bromide did not reduce the COPD exacerbation rate, it did improve lung function and HR-QOL. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder is generally well tolerated in patients with COPD, with anticholinergic adverse events (e.g. dry mouth, constipation, gastrointestinal obstruction, dysuria) among the most commonly reported adverse events. The UPLIFT® trial showed no significant difference between tiotropium bromide and placebo recipients in the risk of stroke, and the risk of serious cardiac adverse events (including congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction) was significantly lower with tiotropium bromide than with placebo. The absence of a detrimental effect on cardiovascular outcomes was supported by the results of a meta-analysis and pooled analyses. In addition, on-treatment mortality was lower with tiotropium bromide than with placebo in the UPLIFT® trial. Pooled analyses showed significantly lower cardiovascular mortality with tiotropium bromide than with placebo, with a meta-analysis demonstrating no significant difference between patients receiving tiotropium bromide and controls in cardiovascular mortality. Results of modelled pharmacoeconomic analyses conducted from a healthcare payer perspective in several developed countries suggest that tiotropium bromide is a cost-effective option in patients with COPD. In conclusion, tiotropium bromide inhalation powder is a useful option for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD."
CD012930,0,27013871,0,A cross-sectional study to assess inhalation device handling and patient satisfaction in COPD.,"Delivery of inhaled medications via an inhaler device underpins the effectiveness of treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Correct inhaler technique among patients is also a predictor of achieving treatment compliance and adherence. Reporting of patient satisfaction with inhalers is therefore gaining increasing attention and is now recognized as an important patient-reported outcome in clinical trials involving patients with COPD or asthma. In this cross-sectional study, we use the validated Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire (PASAPQ) to assess the handling and satisfaction for Respimat(®) Soft Mist™ Inhaler (SMI) compared with the Breezhaler(®) dry powder inhaler (DPI) among patients with COPD in Spain. Patients were already assigned to therapy with either SPIRIVA(®) (tiotropium) Respimat(®) or with Hirobriz(®)/Onbrez(®)/Oslif(®) (indacaterol) Breezhaler(®) for at least 3 but not more than 6 months before completing the PASAPQ at a single visit to the study site. The primary endpoint of the trial was the mean total PASAPQ score. Secondary endpoints were the performance score domain of the PASAPQ, the convenience score domain of the PASAPQ, and the overall satisfaction score of the PASAPQ. For the primary endpoint, the mean PASAPQ total score in the Respimat(®) and Breezhaler(®) groups was 80.7 and 79.9, respectively (difference of 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.9 to 4.5; P=0.67). The mean total performance scores were 82.5 and 78.2 (difference of 4.3, 95% CI -0.3 to 8.9; P=0.06), and the mean total convenience scores were 78.6 and 81.9 (difference of -3.3, 95% CI -7.0 to 0.4; P=0.08) for the Respimat(®) and Breezhaler(®) groups, respectively. Patients gave the Respimat(®) SMI and the Breezhaler(®) DPI overall satisfaction PASAPQ scores of 6.0 and 5.9, respectively, which shows that patients were satisfied with these inhalers."
CD012930,0,20525722,0,Aclidinium inhibits cholinergic and tobacco smoke-induced MUC5AC in human airways.,"Mucus hypersecretion and mucin MUC5AC overexpression are pathological features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study examines the inhibitory effect of aclidinium, a new long-acting muscarinic antagonist, on MUC5AC expression in human airway epithelial cells. MUC5AC mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein expression (ELISA and immunohistochemistry) were studied in human bronchial tissue and differentiated human airway epithelial cells activated with carbachol (100 μM) or cigarette smoke extract in the absence or presence of aclidinium. Carbachol increased MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression in human bronchus and cultured epithelial cells. Aclidinium inhibited the carbachol-induced MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression with potency (half maximal inhibitory concentration) ~1 nM in human bronchus and cultured airway epithelial cells. AG1478, a selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, inhibited carbachol-induced MUC5AC responses, indicating EGFR transactivation. Aclidinium inhibited carbachol-induced phospho-EGFR and phospho-p44/42 MAPK expression. In cultured airway epithelial cells transfected with small interfering (si)RNA against muscarinic receptor subtypes, siRNA-M3 but not siRNA-M2 blocked carbachol-induced MUC5AC expression. Cigarette smoke-induced MUC5AC upregulation in cultured airway epithelial cells was suppressed by aclidinium. In conclusion, aclidinium decreases carbachol and tobacco smoke-induced MUC5AC overexpression in human airway epithelial cells. This effect may contribute to the clinical efficacy of aclidinium in mucus hypersecretory diseases including COPD."

In two 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group studies, patients with COPD were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily umeclidinium (UMEC; 62.5 μg and 125 μg) or placebo (PBO), added to twice-daily fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL; 250/50 μg). In both studies, the primary efficacy measure was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Day 85. Secondary endpoints were weighted-mean (WM) FEV1 over 0-6 hours post-dose (Day 84) and rescue albuterol use. Health-related quality of life outcomes (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ] and COPD assessment test [CAT]) were also examined. Safety was assessed throughout. Both UMEC+FP/SAL doses provided statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 (Day 85: 0.127-0.148 L) versus PBO+FP/SAL. Similarly, both UMEC+FP/SAL doses provided statistically-significant improvements in 0-6 hours post-dose WM FEV1 versus PBO+FP/SAL (Day 84: 0.144-0.165 L). Rescue use over Weeks 1-12 decreased with UMEC+FP/SAL in both studies versus PBO+FP/SAL (Study 1, 0.3 puffs/day [both doses]; Study 2, 0.5 puffs/day [UMEC 125+FP/SAL]). Decreases from baseline in CAT score were generally larger for both doses of UMEC+FP/SAL versus PBO+FP/SAL (except for Day 84 Study 2). In Study 1, no differences in SGRQ score were observed between UMEC+FP/SAL and PBO+FP/SAL; however, in Study 2, statistically significant improvements were observed with UMEC 62.5+FP/SAL (Day 28) and UMEC 125+FP/SAL (Days 28 and 84) versus PBO+FP/SAL. The incidence of on-treatment adverse events across all treatment groups was 37-41% in Study 1 and 36-38% in Study 2. Overall, these data indicate that the combination of UMEC+FP/SAL can provide additional benefits over FP/SAL alone in patients with COPD."

In this study we analyzed native and activated cell profiles in sputum of 22 stable COPD patients receiving formoterol (F) or formoterol + tiotropium (F + T) for 3 months. Cells were isolated from induced sputum and were examined on Coulter flow cytometer using fluorescent antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, CD25, CD127, and HLA-DR antigens. Cell profiles and cell activation were assessed by analysis of HLA-DR, CD25, and CD127 co-expression in double-stained samples. Tregs were defined as CD4⁺CD25(high) CD127(low) cells. We found that the combined therapy significantly decreased the CD8⁺ cell number (p < 0.01). At baseline, HLA-DR was expressed in about 10 % of sputum T or B cells and a higher expression was found on monocytes. The HLA-DR expression on lymphocytes, but not monocytes, was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in patients treated with F + T. Fractions of activated [CD4⁺ CD25⁺] cells were also significantly lower in the combined therapy group, except for the subpopulation of CD4⁺CD25(high) CD127(low) cells which was not altered. We conclude that tiotropium in add-on therapy to formoterol affects Treg cell profiles and decreases HLA-DR expression in airway lymphocytes."

Patients were randomised to one of five treatment sequences each consisting of twice-daily (BID) aclidinium 100 μg, 200 μg, 400 μg (via Genuair®*), formoterol 12 μg (via Aerolizer®) and matched placebo for 7 days, with a 5- to 9-day washout period. Primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) normalised area under the curve (AUC)0-12 on Day 7. Secondary endpoints were: change from baseline in FEV1 normalised AUC12-24, FEV1 normalised AUC0-24 and morning pre-dose FEV1 on Day 7. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Of 79 randomised patients, 68 (86.1%) completed the study. After 7 days of treatment, aclidinium and formoterol produced statistically significantly greater changes from baseline in FEV1 normalised AUC0-12 vs placebo (p<0.0001). FEV1 normalised AUC12-24, FEV1 normalised AUC0-24, and morning pre-dose FEV1 were also statistically significantly greater with all aclidinium doses vs placebo (p<0.0001). Improvements in primary and secondary endpoints were statistically significantly greater with aclidinium 400 μg vs 100 μg. The safety profile of aclidinium was comparable to placebo.

CD012930,0,20868661,0,Aclidinium bromide abrogates allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness and reduces eosinophilia in murine model of airway inflammation.,"Airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation characterize the airways of individuals with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hence, therapeutic approaches that attenuate such manifestations may offer promise in the management of these diseases. In the present study, we investigated whether a novel long-acting cholinergic antagonist, aclidinium bromide, modulates airway function and leukocyte trafficking in an Aspergillus fumigatus (Af)-induced murine model of asthma. Nebulized aclidinium (1 mg/ml) administration completely abrogated increases in methacholine-induced lung resistance in Af-exposed mice. Parallel assessment of dynamic compliance showed that aclidinium also completely restores methacholine-mediated decreases in naïve and Af-exposed mice. As evidenced by differential cell counts within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, aclidinium also diminished (51±4%) Af-induced airway eosinophil numbers with no significant change in other immune cell types. Further assessment of cytokine and total protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed that aclidinium had little effect on IL-4 or IL-6 levels in either Af-exposed or naïve mice but markedly decreased total protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These data suggest that aclidinium, a selective muscarinic antagonist, not only acts as a bronchodilator but could also act as an anti-inflammatory agent with potential clinical benefits in the treatment of COPD and asthma."

In clinical trials, these inhalers significantly improved lung function (trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second), patient-reported outcomes, and quality of life measures compared with placebo, their respective monocomponents, and tiotropium. The recorded adverse events of these new inhalers were also similar to those of their monocomponents or placebo. There are concerns regarding long-term complications (weight gain, osteoporosis, cataract) and increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia with the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The new LAMA/LABA inhalers could potentially reduce the use of ICS as part and parcel of maintenance therapy in COPD. Recent studies compared these LAMA/LABA inhalers with ICS/LABA combination inhalers in moderate-to-severe COPD. The results are promising and favor the LAMA/LABA inhalers, especially in the longer duration trials.

It represents a growing burden of health care cost, both from societal and economic perspectives. Short- and long-acting bronchodilators remain the mainstay of therapy in COPD patients. New fixed-dose combination inhalers with novel pharmacological combinations of long-acting β2-agonists and muscarinic antagonists and delivered once-daily through a variety of devices are currently being developed and licensed for the treatment of COPD.

CD012930,0,28134225,0,[New bronchodilation treatment options for patients with COPD].,"The main aim of treatment of patients with symptoms of airway obstruction is to improve their quality of life by reducing or removing the main symptoms. To get this effect, you must be able to control the bronchial smooth muscle. This is becoming more possible by the introduction of new inhaled particles, which acting Β2-adrenergic receptors or muscarinic receptors dilate bronchial lumen. New drugs to control Β2-adrenergic receptors exhibit a long duration of action - LABA (long-acting beta-agonist), for example indacaterol, vilanterol or olodaterol can be used once a day, because their action exceeds 24 hours. Similarly, new anticholinergic particles - LAMA (long-acting muscarinic antagonist), for example. tiotropium, glycopyrronium, aclidinium, umeclidinium - also exert their activity by 12-24 hours. Combined preparates LAMA-LABA represent a further significant advance in the treatment, as provided in this form tend to perform better than used alone. In turn, the new bi-functional molecule (dual pharmacophore), which discloses a dual effect by bronchodilating effects by antagonists at muscarinic receptors and agonists at Β2- adrenergic receptors, was described as MABA (muscarinic antagonist and Β2 agonist). The complementary nature of the two receptors was used in construction of this particle. It is expected that the introduction of this new therapy will allow more effective control of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD."

CD012930,0,25848244,0,Clinical potential of aclidinium bromide in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Three long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are now available in Europe, providing clinicians and patients with a choice of interventions, which is important in COPD, which is clinically a heterogeneous disease. The first LAMA, tiotropium, has been widely used over the last decade as a once-daily maintenance therapy in stable COPD to improve patients' health-related quality of life and to reduce the risk of exacerbations. Administered via the HandiHaler(®) device, it is safe and well tolerated. Another new once-daily LAMA, glycopyrronium, has also been shown to improve health status and reduce exacerbations, and is well tolerated. The subject of this review is a third LAMA, aclidinium bromide, which was approved as a twice-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment. In the pivotal Phase III clinical trials, patients receiving aclidinium achieved significantly greater improvements in lung function, reductions in breathlessness, and improvements in health status compared with placebo, for up to 24 weeks. In continuation studies, these improvements were sustained for up to 52 weeks. Pooled data showed exacerbation frequency was significantly reduced with aclidinium versus placebo. Preclinical and pharmacological studies demonstrating low systemic bioavailability and a low propensity to induce cardiac arrhythmias were translated into a favorable tolerability profile in the clinical trial program - the adverse event profile of aclidinium was similar to placebo, with a low incidence of anticholinergic and cardiac adverse events. While additional studies are needed to evaluate its full clinical potential, aclidinium is an important part of this recent expansion of LAMA therapeutic options, providing clinicians and patients with an effective and well-tolerated COPD treatment."
CD012930,0,26229457,0,Clinical role of dual bronchodilation with an indacaterol-glycopyrronium combination in the management of COPD: its impact on patient-related outcomes and quality of life.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the result of persistent and progressive pathologic abnormalities in the small airways, most often associated with alveolar loss. Smoking cessation is the most effective intervention to slow down the progression of COPD. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are prescribed for the symptomatic relief at any stage of disease severity. For patients whose COPD cannot be not sufficiently controlled with long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy, international guidelines suggest the possibility of associating a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), ie, dual bronchodilation. This is not a new concept as the combination of short-acting agents has been popular in the past. In recent years, several fixed-dose combinations containing a LAMA and a LABA in a single inhaler have been approved by regulatory authorities in several countries. Among the new LAMA/LABA combinations, the fixed-dose combination of indacaterol 110 µg/glycopyrronium 50 µg (QVA149) has been shown in a series of clinical trials to be as safe as the single components and placebo, and more effective than placebo and the single components with regard to lung function, symptoms, and patient-oriented outcomes. Furthermore, QVA149 achieved better bronchodilation than salmeterol 50 µg/fluticasone 500 µg twice daily. Compared with tiotropium, a well-recognized treatment for COPD, the percentage of patients that exceed the minimal clinical important difference for dyspnea and health-related quality of life measurements was superior with QVA149. Other patient-oriented outcomes, such as daily symptoms, night-time awakening, and use of rescue medication consistently favored QVA149. Finally, QVA149 was significantly superior to LAMAs for reducing all types of exacerbation. In conclusion, several years after introduction of dual bronchodilation, the fixed-dose combination of indacaterol 110 µg/glycopyrronium 50 µg in a single inhaler for once-daily administration via the Breezhaler device (QVA149) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment for COPD patients."

Previously, only one LAMA (tiotropium) was available for the treatment of COPD, necessitating the development of other therapeutic options due to the heterogeneity of COPD and patient responses to treatment. This article reviews the COPD management potential of aclidinium bromide, a LAMA administered twice daily (BID) by a multidose dry powder inhaler that is indicated for maintenance treatment of COPD. Aclidinium possesses kinetic selectivity for the M(3) versus M(2) receptor and is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to two major inactive metabolites, resulting in a low and transient systemic exposure and minimizing the potential for systemic side effects. A pharmacokinetic study with multiple doses of twice-daily aclidinium demonstrated the short half-life of aclidinium in plasma, suggesting that a steady state may be reached as early as the second day postdose. In a phase II study, twice-daily aclidinium 400 µg provided 24-hour bronchodilation, with significant improvements versus tiotropium during the second half of the day. In two phase III studies (ACCORD I and ATTAIN), both aclidinium 200 µg and 400 µg BID provided statistically significant improvements in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and other related lung function measurements. Improvements in peak FEV(1) on day 1 were comparable to those at study end, demonstrating that aclidinium provides maximal bronchodilation after the first dose that is maintained over time. Health status was significantly improved and dyspnea, nighttime and morning symptoms of COPD were likewise significantly reduced with aclidinium. Numerically greater improvements in efficacy were observed with the 400 µg dose compared with the lower dose, with similar safety profiles between the two doses and a low incidence of anticholinergic side effects. The approved therapeutic dose of aclidinium 400 µg BID is thus an effective new treatment option for patients with COPD."

CD012930,0,26504398,0,Pharmacologic rationale underlying the therapeutic effects of tiotropium/olodaterol in COPD.,"Bronchodilators are the most important drugs used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In particular, these therapeutic agents are mostly long-acting compounds utilized via inhalation, and include LAMA (long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists) and LABA (long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists). Because LAMA and LABA induce bronchodilation by distinct mechanisms of action, LABA/LAMA combinations provide a reciprocal potentiation of the pharmacological effects caused by each component. Hence, many COPD patients who do not achieve a satisfactory control of their symptoms using a single, either LAMA or LABA bronchodilator, can experience relevant benefits with the use of LAMA/LABA fixed combinations. Many different LAMA/LABA combinations have been recently developed and evaluated in randomized clinical trials. In this context, our review focuses on the pharmacological mechanisms underpinning the bronchodilation elicited by the LAMA tiotropium bromide and the LABA olodaterol.

Within short-acting bronchodilators, ipratropium (anticholinergic agent) is as effective as salbutamol (sympathomimetic agent) with fewer adverse effects. Presently, maintenance therapy is based on long-acting inhaled bronchodilators. Tiotropium (anticholinergic agent) once a day has a better efficacy to adverse effects ratio than salmeterol or formoterol (sympathomimetic agents) twice a day. Inhaled steroids (fluticasone, budesonide) are also able to improve lung function slightly and to relieve symptoms, but have no beneficial effect on the accelerated rate of decline in lung function that characterizes COPD. A short course (10 days) of systemic steroids is useful to treat an exacerbation. On the other hand, potential toxicity of oral steroids is a definite contra-indication for maintenance therapy."

CD012930,0,26792987,0,Specific role of combination aclidinium: formoterol in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Co-administration of a long-acting β2-agonist and a long acting muscarinic antagonist produces superior bronchodilation compared with their individual effects. Our preclinical data indicated that combining aclidinium bromide (ACLI) and formoterol fumarate (FORM) provides synergistic benefit on smooth muscle relaxation of both large and small human airways. Data from more than 2,000 patients in eleven clinical trials documented that ACLI/FORM, a twice-daily fixed-dose combination, produces a greater degree of bronchodilation than ACLI or FORM monotherapy alone and is safe and well tolerated. Two large key trials have shown that there is a benefit in using ACLI/FORM when the clinical target is the variability of symptoms and mainly nighttime and/or early morning symptoms. ACLI/FORM is the only long acting muscarinic antagonist/long acting β2-agonist fixed-dose combination that has been studied for this therapeutic indication."
CD012930,0,21509737,0,[New drugs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].,"Inhaled bronchodilators such as beta(2)-agonists and muscarinic antagonists help to prevent and control symptoms in COPD patients, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, improve health status and exercise tolerance and have an acceptable safety profile. For patients with moderate to severe COPD combining bronchodilators from different classes long acting beta(2)-agonists or long acting muscarinic antagonists (LABA/LAMA) are recommended. Indacaterol with 24 hours duration and fast onset of bronchodilation is the first once daily dosing LABA. Indacaterol used alone or in combination with LAMA may be advantageous through simplification of treatment regimens as well as improvement the efficacy. As COPD progresses and patient has repeated exacerbations triple therapy LABA/LAMA/ICS may be required. The addition of PDE4 inhibitor (roflumilast) to LABA or LAMA in patients with severe COPD, improves lung function and reduces exacerbation frequency. The reduction in exacerbation frequency is similar to that seen in the studies on bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids therapy. PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to play a role in severe COPD and they are effective particularly in combination with other pharmacological agents. Based on the results of studies combining different classes of the drugs seems to be an important step towards the goal of optimal control for COPD patients."

CD012930,0,23118536,0,Profile of glycopyrronium for once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe COPD.,"Bronchodilators are central in the symptomatic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting β(2)-agonists (LABAs) are the main classes of long-acting bronchodilators. To date, tiotropium is the only once-daily LAMA available for the treatment of COPD. Glycopyrronium is a novel LAMA, currently in development for COPD. Phase II studies have shown that glycopyrronium 50 μg once daily provides clinically significant 24-hour bronchodilation with a rapid onset of action, which is faster than that of tiotropium, and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The Phase III GLycopyrronium bromide in COPD airWays (GLOW) program has now confirmed the long-term efficacy and tolerability of glycopyrronium 50 μg once daily. The three studies included in this program have further shown that the effect of glycopyrronium versus placebo is similar to that of tiotropium in reducing dyspnea and the risk of exacerbations, as well as improving lung function, exercise tolerance, and health status in patients with COPD. The safety profile of glycopyrronium is also similar to that of tiotropium in terms of overall incidence of adverse events and muscarinic side effects. Glycopyrronium could be an alternative choice to tiotropium, and like tiotropium, has the potential to be used as a monotherapy or combination therapy. Phase II studies have shown that a fixed-dose combination of glycopyrronium and the 24-hour LABA indacaterol, produces rapid and sustained bronchodilation compared with indacaterol monotherapy in patients with COPD. Phase III studies are currently ongoing to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of this combination."

CD012930,0,27981495,0,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Individualized Therapy: Tailored Approach to Symptom Management.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. COPD is typified by persistent, progressive airflow limitation and a range of respiratory and systemic symptoms such as breathlessness, coughing, wheezing, depression, anxiety, general fatigue, and sleeping difficulties. Despite receiving treatment for COPD, many patients suffer from regular symptoms that affect their daily lives and lead to increased morbidity. These symptoms vary in severity, frequency, and type, and can occur at any time throughout the 24-h day, with over half of patients with COPD experiencing symptoms in the morning, during the day, and at nighttime. Despite the prevalence of symptoms, patient and physician perception of the impact of COPD symptoms on patients' lives is not always in concordance. Dual bronchodilator therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting beta agonist (LABA) has the potential to treat the symptoms of COPD in addition to improving lung function. This review therefore examines the burden of symptoms experienced throughout the day by patients with COPD and the evidence for combined LAMA/LABA treatment in terms of symptom management. As patients with COPD experience varying symptoms throughout the course of their disease, the role of tailoring treatment to the individual needs of the patient is also examined. We conclude that the symptoms of COPD are troublesome, variable, can occur during all parts of the 24-h day, and have a substantial impact on patients' health status and quality of life. In order to provide effective, patient-orientated care, patients with COPD should be evaluated on the basis of lung function, the frequency of symptoms, and patient-perceived impact of symptoms on their lives. Therapy should be chosen carefully based on individualized assessment, ensuring personalization to the individual needs of the patient."

CD012930,0,19624783,0,Optimising treatment for COPD--new strategies for combination therapy.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multi-component disease characterised by airflow limitation and airway inflammation. Exacerbations of COPD have a considerable impact on the quality of life, daily activities and general well-being of patients and are a great burden on the health system. Thus, the aims of COPD management include not only relieving symptoms and preventing disease progression but also preventing and treating exacerbations. Attention towards the day-to-day burden of the disease is also required in light of evidence that suggests COPD may be variable throughout the day with morning being the time when symptoms are most severe and patients' ability to perform regular morning activities the most problematic. While available therapies improve clinical symptoms and decrease airway inflammation, they do not unequivocally slow long-term progression or address all disease components. With the burden of COPD continuing to increase, research into new and improved treatment strategies to optimise pharmacotherapy is ongoing - in particular, combination therapies, with a view to their complementary modes of action enabling multiple components of the disease to be addressed. Evidence from recent clinical trials indicates that triple therapy, combining an anticholinergic with an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta(2)-agonist, may provide clinical benefits additional to those associated with each treatment alone in patients with more severe COPD. This article reviews the evidence for treatment strategies used in COPD with a focus on combination therapies and introduces the 3-month CLIMB study (Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Symbicort as an Add-on Treatment to Spiriva in Patients With Severe COPD) which investigated the potential treatment benefits of combining tiotropium with budesonide/formoterol in patients with COPD with regard to lung function, exacerbations, symptoms and morning activities."

We investigated whether ACh promotes Th17 cells in COPD. ACh, IL-17A, IL-22, RORγt, FOXP3 expression and AChIL-17A, AChIL-22, AChRORγt coexpression was evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from COPD patients (n=16), healthy smokers (HS) (n=12) and healthy control subjects (HC) (n=13) (cultured for 48 h with PMA) by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we studied the effect of Tiotropium (Spiriva®) (100 nM) and Olodaterol (1nM) alone or in combination, and of hemicholinium-3 (50 μM) on AChIL-17A, AChIL-22, AChRORγt, and FOXP3 expression in CD3+PBT-cells of PBMC from COPD patients (n=6) cultured for 48 h with PMA. CD3+PBT-cells expressing ACh, IL-17A, IL-22 and RORγt together with CD3+PBT-cells co-expressing AChIL-17A, AChIL-22 and AChRORγt were significantly increased in COPD patients compared to HC and HS subjects with higher levels in HS than in HC without a significant difference. CD3+FOXP3+PBT-cells were increased in HS than in HC and COPD. Tiotropium and Olodaterol reduced the percentage of CD3+PBT-cells co-expressing AChIL-17A, AChIL-22, and AChRORγt while increased the CD3+FOXP3+PBT-cells in PBMC from COPD patients, cultured in vitro for 48 h, with an additive effect when used in combination. Hemicholnium-3 reduced the percentage of ACh+IL-17A+, ACh+IL-22+, and ACh+RORγt+ while it did not affect FOXP3+ expression in CD3+PBT-cells from cultured PBMC from COPD patients.

A total of 71 COPD patients (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 37% predicted) participated in a randomised, double-blind, three-way, crossover study and received tiotropium 18 microg q.d., formoterol 12 microg b.i.d. or both combined q.d. for three 6-week periods. The end-points were 24-h spirometry (FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC)) at the end of each treatment, rescue salbutamol and safety. Compared with baseline (FEV1 prior to the first dose in the first period), tiotropium produced a significantly greater improvement in average daytime FEV1 (0-12 h) than formoterol (127 versus 86 mL), while average night-time FEV1 (12-24 h) was not different (tiotropium 43 mL, formoterol 38 mL). The most pronounced effects were provided by combination therapy (daytime 234 mL, night-time 86 mL); both differed significantly from single-agent therapies. Changes in FVC mirrored the FEV1 results. Compared with both single agents, daytime salbutamol use was significantly lower during combination therapy (tiotropium plus formoterol 1.81 puffs.day(-1), tiotropium 2.41 puffs x day(-1), formoterol 2.37 puffs x day(-1)). All treatments were well tolerated. In conclusion, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, tiotropium q.d. achieved a greater improvement in daytime and comparable improvement in night-time lung function compared with formoterol b.i.d. A combination of both drugs q.d. was most effective and provided an additive effect throughout the 24-h dosing interval."

CD012930,0,20035022,0,The constitutive activity of the human muscarinic M3 receptor unmasks differences in the pharmacology of anticholinergics.,"An activator protein 1-driven luciferase reporter assay was developed to monitor the activation of the human muscarinic M3 receptor (hM3-R) and evaluate functional potencies of different anticholinergics in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This assay proved to be superior to previously used functional assays [i.e., inositol phosphate accumulation (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 330:660-668, 2009)], thanks to the longer incubation times that allow reaching of pseudoequilibrium for ligands with slower dissociation kinetics, the long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Interestingly, within this system the hM3-R efficiently signaled in an agonist-independent manner. All the antagonists tested were able to inhibit the hM3-R constitutive activity in a concentration-dependent fashion, behaving as full inverse agonists. Curiously, significant differences in potency as antagonists (against carbachol) and inverse agonists were seen for some compounds (N-methyl scopolamine and tiotropium). Given the potential for inverse agonists to cause receptor up-regulation, the effect of chronic exposure to anticholinergics on the expression levels of hM3-R was also tested. Again, significant differences were seen, with some ligands (e.g., tiotropium) producing less than half of the receptor up-regulation caused by other anticholinergics. This study shows that anticholinergics can exhibit differential behaviors, which depend on the pathway investigated, and therefore provides evidence that the molecular mechanism of inverse agonism is likely to be more complex than the stabilization of a single inactive receptor conformation. In addition, differences in the potential of anticholinergics to induce hM3-R up-regulation might have clinical relevance, because many are on the market or in clinical trials as chronic treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for example."

CD012930,0,28860739,0,The comparative effectiveness of initiating fluticasone/salmeterol combination therapy via pMDI versus DPI in reducing exacerbations and treatment escalation in COPD: a UK database study.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a complex progressive disease, is currently the third leading cause of death worldwide. One recommended treatment option is fixed-dose combination therapy of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting β-agonist. Clinical trials suggest pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) show similar efficacy and safety profiles in COPD. Real-world observational studies have shown that combination therapy has significantly greater odds of achieving asthma control when delivered via pMDIs. Our aim was to compare effectiveness, in terms of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) prescriptions, for COPD patients initiating fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol xinafoate (SAL) via pMDI versus DPI at two doses of FP (500 and 1,000 μg/d) using a real-life, historical matched cohort study. COPD patients with ≥2 years continuous practice data, ≥2 prescriptions for FP/SAL via pMDI/DPI, and no prescription for ICS were selected from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database. Patients were matched 1:1. Rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations and odds of LAMA prescription were analyzed using conditional Poisson and logistic regression, respectively. Of 472 patients on 500 μg/d, we observed fewer moderate/severe exacerbations in patients using pMDI (99 [42%]) versus DPI (115 [49%]) (adjusted rate ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.54, 0.93), an important result since the pMDI is not licensed for COPD in the UK, USA, or China. At 1,000 μg/d, we observed lower LAMA prescription for pMDI (adjusted odds ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.55, 0.91), but no difference in exacerbation rates, potentially due to higher dose of ICS overcoming low lung delivery from the DPI."

CD012930,0,23818799,0,The clinical and economic burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the USA.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the USA. In 2010, the cost of COPD in the USA was projected to be approximately US$50 billion, which includes $20 billion in indirect costs and $30 billion in direct health care expenditures. These costs can be expected to continue to rise with this progressive disease. Costs increase with increasing severity of disease, and hospital stays account for the majority of these costs. Patients are diagnosed with COPD following a multifactorial assessment that includes spirometry, clinical presentation, symptomatology, and risk factors. Smoking cessation interventions are the most influential factor in COPD management. The primary goal of chronic COPD management is stabilization of chronic disease and prevention of acute exacerbations. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of COPD therapy. Patients with few symptoms and low exacerbation risk should be treated with a short-acting bronchodilator as needed for breathlessness. Progression of symptoms, as well as possible decline in forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1), warrant the use of long-acting bronchodilators. For patients with frequent exacerbations with or without consistent symptoms, inhaled corticosteroids should be considered in addition to a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and may even consist of ""triple therapy"" with all three agents with more severe disease. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors may be an option in patients with frequent exacerbations and symptoms of chronic bronchitis.

CD012930,0,26343937,0,Therapeutic approaches to asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndromes.,"The recognition that there are some patients with features of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has highlighted the need to develop more specific treatments for these clinical phenotypes. Some patients with COPD have predominantly eosinophilic inflammation and might respond to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and newly developed specific antieosinophil therapies, including blocking antibodies against IL-5, IL-13, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, as well as oral chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells antagonists. Other patients have severe asthma or are asthmatic patients who smoke with features of COPD-induced inflammation and might benefit from treatments targeting neutrophils, including macrolides, CXCR2 antagonists, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, p38 mitogen-activating protein kinase inhibitors, and antibodies against IL-1 and IL-17. Other patients appear to have largely fixed obstruction with little inflammation and might respond to long-acting bronchodilators, including long-acting muscarinic antagonists, to reduce hyperinflation. Highly selected patients with severe asthma might benefit from bronchial thermoplasty. Some patients with overlap syndromes can be conveniently treated with triple fixed-dose combination inhaler therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting β2-agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist, several of which are now in development. Corticosteroid resistance is a feature of asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, and understanding the various molecular mechanisms of this resistance has identified novel therapeutic targets and presented the prospect of therapies that can restore corticosteroid responsiveness."

Two investigators independently searched for eligible articles using the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Articles in authors' reference files were also regarded as candidates. The eligibility criteria for the current meta-analysis were original trials written in English comparing the impact of LAMA + LABA and LABA + ICS for COPD patients. A pooled value for the continuous value was calculated using the genetic inverse variance method for mean difference. Incidence of events was evaluated using the odds ratio (OR). Minimal clinically important difference were 50 mL for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ), four points for St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and one point for transition dyspnoea index (TDI). We included seven randomized controlled trials and one cross-over trial with follow-up period of 6-26 weeks. Compared with LABA + ICS, LAMA + LABA led to significantly greater improvements of trough FEV1 by 71 (95% CI: 48-95) mL, TDI by 0.38 points (95% CI: 0.17-0.58), less exacerbations with an OR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62-0.96) and less pneumonia with an OR of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.12-0.68). Frequencies of any adverse event, serious adverse event, adverse event leading to discontinuation, all-cause death and change of total score of SGRQ were not different in both arms. LAMA + LABA might be a better option for treating COPD than LABA + ICS."

CD012930,0,19863370,0,Combination of formoterol and tiotropium in the treatment of COPD: effects on lung function.,"Bronchodilators are central in symptomatic management of all stages of COPD. For patients whose COPD is not sufficiently controlled by monotherapy, combining an inhaled anticholinergic and a ss(2)-agonist is a convenient way of delivering treatment and obtaining better lung function and improved symptoms. Formoterol (beta(2)-agonist) and tiotropium (anticholinergic) are long-acting bronchodilators with different mechanisms of action. Formoterol has a fast onset and a bronchodilator effect of approximately 12 h, while tiotropium has a 24-h bronchodilator effect and is given once daily. Currently, there is no documentation that tiotropium is superior to formoterol or the contrary, but a combination of tiotropium and formoterol is more effective than single drugs alone in inducing bronchodilation and a bronchodilator-mediated symptom benefit in patients suffering from COPD. Once-daily or twice-daily formoterol, added to tiotropium, are both better than tiotropium alone, but the published evidence suggests twice-daily formoterol is the best add-on option."

CD012930,0,26089659,0,LAMA/LABA vs ICS/LABA in the treatment of COPD in Japan based on the disease phenotypes.,"In the combined use of bronchodilators of different classes, ie, long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), bronchodilation is obtained both directly, through LABA-mediated stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors, and indirectly, through LAMA-mediated inhibition of acetylcholine action at muscarinic receptors. The clinical trial data for LABAs/LAMAs in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continue to be promising, and these combinations will provide the convenience of delivering the two major bronchodilator classes, recommended as first-line maintenance options in COPD treatment guidelines. COPD is a complex condition that has pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations. These clinical manifestations are highly variable, and several are associated with different responses to currently available therapies. The concept of a COPD phenotype is rapidly evolving from one focusing on the clinical characteristics to one linking the underlying biology to the phenotype of the disease. Identification of the peculiarities of the different COPD phenotypes will permit us to implement a more personalized treatment in which the patient's characteristics, together with his or her genotype, will be key to choosing the best treatment option. At present in Japan, fixed combinations of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and LABAs are frequently prescribed in the earlier stages of COPD. However, ICSs increase the risk of pneumonia. Notably, 10%-30% of patients with COPD with or without a history of asthma have persistent circulating and airway eosinophilia associated with an increased risk of exacerbations and sensitivity to steroids. Thus, sputum or blood eosinophil counts might identify a subpopulation in which ICSs could have potentially deleterious effects as well as a subpopulation that benefits from ICSs. In this review, I propose one plausible approach to position ICSs and LABAs/LAMAs in clinical practice, based on both the extent of airflow obstruction and the presence of an asthma component or airway eosinophilic inflammation. This approach is a tentative move toward personalized treatment for COPD patients, and with progress in knowledge and developments in physiology, lung imaging, medical biology, and genetics, identification of COPD phenotypes that provide prognostic and therapeutic information that can affect clinically meaningful outcomes is an urgent medical need."

Areas covered: This review highlights the potential application of umeclidinium, a long acting muscarinic antagonist, as a novel therapeutic approach for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, despite maximal therapy. Expert opinion: Umeclidinium, similarly to tiotropium, which has been recently included in guidelines, may act by contrasting cholinergic activation in airways, preventing or at least reducing smooth muscle cells contraction and the consequent bronchoconstriction. This is similar to what occurs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for which umeclidinium has been regularly approved. However, available data is not sufficient and further studies are needed before regulatory approval can be sought, since only phase II clinical trials have been conducted at present.

The study consisted of a screening visit and two study days separated by at least one week. Functional parameters were measured before and 30, and 120 min after inhalation of single study drug. Both tiotropium and budesonide/formoterol induced significant changes in functional parameters after 30 and 120 min. However, the impact of tiotropium on the degree of pulmonary hyperinflation was larger than that of budesonide/formoterol, although only differences in IC and TGV between the two treatments were significant (P<0.05), at least after 120 min, whereas those in RV were not significant. The documentation that tiotropium is able to modify IC even after an acute administration indicates its capacity of influencing expiratory flow limitation in a very fast manner and this is an important finding. In fact, changes in IC after bronchodilators in patients with COPD with expiratory flow limitation at rest may represent an objective tool for prescribing these drugs to attain symptomatic improvement and better quality of life, even in the absence of a significant increase in FEV(1)."

The principal inhaled bronchodilator treatments are beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics, used singularly or in combination. There is good evidence that regular treatment with long-acting bronchodilators is more effective and convenient than treatment with short-acting bronchodilators. Long-acting agents include the twice-daily beta-2 agonists formoterol and salmeterol, the once-daily anticholinergic tiotropium, and, more recently, the once-daily beta-2 agonist indacaterol. Long-acting bronchodilators have been shown to improve multiple clinical outcomes in COPD in comparison to short-acting agents including lung function, symptoms, dyspnea, quality of life, and exacerbations. Studies of head-to-head comparisons of long-acting bronchodilators are scant but indicate superior bronchodilation of tiotropium over salmeterol, while preliminary data from trials with the novel once-daily beta-2 agonist indacaterol indicate superior bronchodilation and clinical efficacy over twice-daily long-acting beta-2 agonists and at least equipotent bronchodilation as once-daily tiotropium. These recent therapeutic developments in COPD represent a change of paradigm with a shift from short-acting bronchodilators with multiple dosing per day to reduced dosing frequency and prolonged duration of action including once-daily treatment. This review summarizes relevant data and landmark studies comparing the efficacy of short-acting versus longer-acting bronchodilators in COPD, including new data for once-daily indacaterol, and discusses potential mechanism underlying the improved efficacy of long-acting versus short-acting bronchodilators."

Twenty-one (19 males, mean age 72+/-8 years, mean FEV1 38+/-14% of predicted values) patients with mild to moderate AECOPD were enrolled. Patients received formoterol (12 microg deliver via Modulite b.i.d.), tiotropium (18 microg dry powder capsules delivered via HandiHaler once daily), and their combination, in randomized sequence. Serial measurements of FEV1, FVC, IC, SpO2 and HR were performed over 24h. Formoterol, tiotropium, and their combination significantly improved the area under curves (AUCs) for FEV1, FVC and IC over 12 and 24h. The mean FEV1, FVC and IC AUC(0-12h) and AUC(0-24h) after formoterol and tiotropium combination were significantly higher than formoterol and tiotropium alone, whereas the differences between the two single drugs were not statistically significant. Formoterol, either alone or in combination with tiotropium, elicited a significantly faster onset of action, and combination elicited a greater maximum bronchodilation than both single drugs in terms of FEV1 and FVC. After 24h the bronchodilating effect of the three treatments disappeared, with the exception of the combination on FEV1. The results of this study have documented that, although the time course of the effects of evaluated drugs differs significantly from that in stable COPD, with a shorter bronchodilation both for tiotropium and formoterol, these two long-acting bronchodilators appear to also be complementary in mild to moderate AECOPD."

For patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, long-acting bronchodilators are the mainstay of therapy; as symptoms progress, guidelines recommend combining bronchodilators from different classes to improve efficacy. Inhaled long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) have been licensed for the treatment of COPD since the late 1990s and include formoterol and salmeterol. They improve lung function, symptoms of breathlessness and exercise limitation, health-related quality of life, and may reduce the rate of exacerbations, although not all patients achieve clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms or health related quality of life. In addition, LABAs have an acceptable safety profile, and are not associated with an increased risk of respiratory mortality, although adverse effects such as palpitations and tremor may limit the dose that can be tolerated. Formoterol and salmeterol have 12-hour durations of action; however, sustained bronchodilation is desirable in COPD. A LABA with a 24-hour duration of action could provide improvements in efficacy, compared with twice-daily LABAs, and the once-daily dosing regimen could help improve compliance. It is also desirable that a new LABA should demonstrate fast onset of action, and a safety profile at least comparable to existing LABAs.A number of novel LABAs with once-daily profiles are in development which may be judged against these criteria. Indacaterol, a LABA with a 24-hour duration of bronchodilation and fast onset of action, is the most advanced of these. Preliminary results from large clinical trials suggest indacaterol improves lung function compared with placebo and other long-acting bronchodilators. Other LABAs with a 24-hour duration of bronchodilation include carmoterol, vilanterol trifenatate and oldaterol, with early results indicating potential for once-daily dosing in humans.The introduction of once-daily LABAs also provides the opportunity to develop combination inhalers of two or more classes of once-daily long-acting bronchodilators, which may be advantageous for COPD patients through simplification of treatment regimens as well as improvements in efficacy. Once-daily LABAs used both alone and in combination with long-acting muscarinic antagonists represent a promising advance in the treatment of COPD, and are likely to further improve outcomes for patients."
CD012930,0,24945236,0,Respiratory pharmacotherapy use in patients newly diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a primary care setting in the UK: a retrospective cohort study.,"This retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze the prescribing practices of general practitioners treating patients with newly diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to assess characteristics associated with initial pharmacotherapy. Patients were identified in the General Practice Research Database, a population-based UK electronic medical record (EMR) with data from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Patient characteristics, prescribed COPD pharmacotherapies (≤12 months before diagnosis and within 3 months following diagnosis), co-morbidities, hospitalizations, and events indicative of a possible COPD exacerbation (≤12 months before diagnosis) were analyzed in 7881 patients with newly diagnosed COPD. Most patients (64.4%) were prescribed COPD pharmacotherapy in the 12 months before diagnosis. Following diagnosis, COPD pharmacotherapy was prescribed within 3 months in 85.0% of patients. Short-acting bronchodilators alone (22.9%) or inhaled corticosteroids + long-acting beta-2 agonists (ICS+LABA, 22.1%) were prescribed most frequently. Compared with other pharmacotherapies, the prevalence of severe airflow limitation was highest in patients prescribed ICS+LABA+long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Moderate-to-severe dyspnea was identified most frequently in patients prescribed a LAMA-containing regimen. Patients prescribed an ICS-containing regimen had a higher prevalence of asthma or possible exacerbations recorded in the EMR than those not prescribed ICS. In conclusion, pharmacotherapy prescribed at initial COPD diagnosis varied by disease severity indicators as assessed by airflow limitation, dyspnea, history of asthma, and possible exacerbations. Frequent prescription of COPD pharmacotherapies before the first-recorded COPD diagnosis indicates a delay between obstructive lung disease presentation in primary care practice and assignment of a medical diagnosis."

CD012930,0,23991316,0,The role of indacaterol for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,"Indacaterol is the first long-acting β2-agonist (LABAs) approved for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that allows for once-daily (OD) administration. It is rapidly acting, with an onset of action in 5 minutes, like salbutamol and formoterol but with a sustained bronchodilator effect, that last for 24 hours, like tiotropium. In long-term clinical studies (12 weeks to 1 year) in patients with moderate to severe COPD, OD indacaterol 150 or 300 μg improved lung function (primary endpoint) significantly more than placebo, and improvements were significantly greater than twice-daily formoterol 12 μg or salmeterol 50 μg, and noninferior to OD tiotropium bromide 18 μg. Indacaterol was well tolerated at all doses and with a good overall safety profile. Cost-utility analyses show that indacaterol 150 μg has lower total costs and better outcomes than tiotropium and salmeterol. These findings suggest that indacaterol can be considered a first choice drug in the treatment of the patient with mild/moderate stable COPD. However, in people with COPD who remain symptomatic on treatment with indacaterol, adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) is the preferable option. In any case, it is advisable to combine indacaterol with a OD inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), such as mometasone furoate or ciclesonide, in patients with low FEV1, and, in those patients who have many symptoms and a high risk of exacerbations, to combine it with a LAMA and a OD ICS."

An inhaled, fixed-dose combination of two 24-hour bronchodilators, the LAMA umeclidinium and the LABA vilanterol, is under development as a once-daily treatment for COPD. The efficacy of both mono-components has already been demonstrated. The information currently available suggests that umeclidinium/vilanterol is an effective once-daily dual bronchodilator fixed-dose combination in the treatment of COPD. However, it remains to be seen if it compares favorably with current therapies. Moreover, the question remains whether umeclidinium/vilanterol fixed-dose combination, which significantly improves FEV1, is also associated with improvements in other outcome measures that are important to COPD patients."

Pulmonary function tests, COPD assessment test (CAT), and multifrequency FOT with MostGraph-01 were performed at the beginning and after 8 weeks of treatment with indacaterol or tiotropium. The resistance index, resistance at 5 Hz (R5), resistance at 20 Hz (R20), reactance index, reactance at 5 Hz (X5), resonant frequency (Fres), and low-frequency reactance area (ALX) were determined at whole-breath, inspiratory, and expiratory phases. Eighty-two patients (mean age: 73 years; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1): 61.6%±19.0% predicted) were randomized to indacaterol or tiotropium treatment. Both bronchodilators improved airflow limitation, with mean trough improvements in FEV1 of 165 mL and 80 mL in the indacaterol and tiotropium groups, respectively. The CAT score decreased in the indacaterol group (P<0.001; 11.2±6.6 to 7.5±5.6).

Although the efficacy of LAMAs and LABAs has been well established through randomized controlled trials (RCTs), questions remain regarding their cardiovascular (CV) safety. Furthermore, while the safety of LAMA and LABA monotherapy has been extensively studied, data are lacking for LAMA/LABA combination therapy, and the majority of the studies that have reported on the CV safety of LAMA/LABA combination therapy were not specifically designed to assess this. Evaluation of CV safety for COPD treatments is important because many patients with COPD have underlying CV comorbidities. However, severe CV and other comorbidities are often exclusion criteria for RCTs, contributing to a lack in external validity and generalizability. Real-world observational studies are another important tool to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COPD therapies in a broader population of patients and can improve upon the external validity limitations of RCTs. We examine what is already known regarding the CV and cerebrovascular safety of LAMA/LABA combination therapy from RCTs and real-world observational studies, and explore the advantages and limitations of data derived from each study type.

Pharmacotherapy is used in patients with COPD to prevent and control symptoms, reduce both the frequency and severity of exacerbations, improve health status, and increase exercise tolerance. These strategies are intended to address management issues which promote both current disease control and a reduction in the risk of disease deterioration in the future. At the present time, long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are available for maintenance therapy in patients with persistent symptoms. Tiotropium was the first LAMA to be approved for management of COPD, and many studies have described its beneficial effects on multiple clinically relevant outcomes. Glycopyrronium bromide (NVA237), a new LAMA, has been developed and received regulatory approval for management of COPD in a number of countries around the world. Results from pivotal Phase III trials suggest that NVA237 is safe and well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe COPD, and provides rapid and sustained improvements in lung function. Further, these changes are associated with statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in dyspnea, health-related quality of life, and exercise tolerance. Treatment with NVA237 also results in a significant reduction in risk of exacerbations and the need for rescue medication, and has been comparable with tiotropium with respect to safety and efficacy outcomes. Finally, emerging data indicate that NVA237 is efficacious both as monotherapy and in combination with indacaterol."

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to identify all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 12. Four RCTs were eligible for inclusion (three RCTs with moderate-to-severe COPD patients and one RCT with only severe COPD patients). Trough FEV₁ at weeks 12 and 26 were not significantly different between indacaterol and tiotropium by the standardized mean difference with 0.014 (95% CI, -0.036, 0.063, I²= 23.5%) and with 0.037 (95% CI, -0.059 to 0.133, I²= 0%) along with differences in means of 0.003L and 0.014L, respectively.

Combining bronchodilators is an effective approach, as they demonstrate synergic action at a cellular level and have additive clinical benefits and fewer adverse events compared with increased doses of the monocomponents. Novel fixed-dose combinations of long-acting β2-agonists/long-acting muscarinic antagonists in one inhaler have been approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. This review focuses on published clinical trials about the fixed-dose combination of umeclidinium/vilanterol trifenatate in patients with COPD. Results from six studies (five of them of 12 weeks' duration and one that lasted 1 year, including more than 6,000 patients in total) showed that umeclidinium/vilanterol trifenatate improved lung function, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life and decreased the exacerbation rate with no serious adverse events. More longstanding trials are needed to evaluate the effect of the drug on disease progression and compare it directly with other fixed-dose combinations."

Although there has been a slight reduction in mortality in recent decades, COPD is still a serious health problem that has enormous costs and utilizes significant medical resources. There have been a number of pharmacologic interventions that have been developed for the treatment of COPD. Current guidelines recommend the use of long-acting bronchodilators for the treatment of moderate and severe stage COPD, since they have been shown to improve lung function, respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Indacaterol is a once-daily beta2-agonist (β2-agonist) delivered by a single-dose dry powder inhaler used for the treatment of COPD. It is currently approved at a dose of 75 μg in the United States and a dose of 150 μg with a maximal dose of 300 μg in Europe and other countries. Several studies show that indacaterol was statistically superior to both long-acting β2-agonist, formoterol and salmeterol, as well as, noninferior to tiotropium. Indacaterol is generally well tolerated and has a good safety profile. Other studies show that there is an additive bronchodilator response with the addition of indacaterol to tiotropium, which would provide a once-daily treatment option for patient with moderate to severe COPD. This review discusses the pharmacokinetic, comparative efficacy and safety data for indacaterol."
CD012930,0,20381630,0,The scientific rationale for combining long-acting beta2-agonists and muscarinic antagonists in COPD.,"Bronchodilators are the cornerstone of pharmacological management of COPD. For patients whose conditions are not sufficiently controlled by monotherapy, combining bronchodilators of different classes, in particular an inhaled muscarinic antagonist with an inhaled beta(2)-agonist, seems a convenient way of delivering treatment and obtaining superior results. When administered as combination therapy, short-acting bronchodilators provide superior bronchodilation compared with individual agents given alone. More recently, long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) and muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) have been introduced, and current guidelines recommend regular use of these agents alone or as concurrent therapy in COPD to maximize bronchodilation. In particular, the combination of a LABA plus LAMA seems to play an important role. This article illustrates the scientific rationale for combining LABAs and LAMAs in COPD, reviews the clinical evidence to support these agents given in combination, and discusses their potential role in the management of patients with COPD."

However, current therapies fail to prevent disease progression or mortality. The mainstay of current drug therapy are long-acting bronchodilators; several longer-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists and muscarinic antagonists (and combinations) are now in development. No treatments have so far been shown to suppress chronic inflammation in COPD lungs. With better understanding of the inflammatory and destructive process in the pathophysiology of COPD, several new targets have been identified. Several mediator antagonists tested in COPD have so far been disappointing, but CXCR2 antagonists that block pulmonary neutrophil and monocyte recruitment may be more promising. Broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs may be more effective, and include inhibitors of the enzymes phosphodiesterase-4, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, NF-kappaB kinase and phosphoinositide 3 kinase-gamma and -delta, but side effects will be a major limitation so that inhaled delivery may be necessary. Perhaps the most promising approach is reversal of corticosteroid resistance through increasing histone deacetylase-2 activity. This might be achieved by theophylline-like drugs, phosphoinositide 3 kinase-delta inhibitors, more effective antioxidants and non-antibiotic macrolides."

From the perspective of the Czech Republic COPD was responsible for 21 000 acute hospitalizations and 3 500 deaths, mortality reaches 33/100 000 in 2015. Early stages of disease may be associated with a significant reduction of exercise capacity and the reduction of activities of daily living. Moreover early stages of bronchial obstruction are associated with the fastest lung function decline. Finally, early elimination of the risk of inhalation exposure is able to influence the course of the disease and to reduce its mortality. Most current treatment strategies and national recommendations attributed central role to bronchodilator drugs. Long-acting bronchodilators (LAMA and LABA) creates an essential component of the treatment of symptomatic individuals in the Czech COPD guidelines as well. Actual version of this document constitutes as standard therapy: long-lasting inhaled bronchodilators, targeted efforts to eliminate inhalation risk, vaccination, regular exercise, repeated inhalation technique training, identification, and treatment of relevant comorbidities. All other drugs (inhaled-corticosteroids, mucoactive medication, roflumilast, antibiotics), and non-pharmacological (lung volume reductions, nutrition support, long-term oxygen, home non-invasive ventilation, lung transplantation, palliative care) procedures are intended for a specific subgroups of patients only. The newest type of bronchodilator therapy is represented by a fixed dual bronchodilation. Currently we can use four original drug combinations: titropium + olodaterol, glycopyrronium + indacaterol, umeklidinium + vilanterol and aclidinium + formoterol in the Czech Republic. This area is an enterprising research. For example comprehensive scientific program covering eight studies on 15 000 COPD patients (TOviTO) assess the therapeutic benefits of tiotropium + olodaterolu in terms of lung function, quality of life, exercise tolerance, daily physical activity and the incidence of acute exacerbations. Meanwhile the published results of analyzed studies TONADO, OTEMTO, VIVACITO, and the first results of the study DYNAGITO have showed that fixed dual bronchodilation should be a mandatory treatment to all the symptomatic COPD patients. Unfortunately ""face to face"" comparison of different drug combinations is still missing. However, the treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol combination has been demonstrated to significantly (35 %) reduce the occurrence of clinically significant deterioration, which may lead to the stabilization of this multicomponent disease.Key words: COPD - hospitalizations - inhaled bronchodilators - mortality - treatment."

Phase III pivotal trials have documented that olodaterol Respimat Soft Mist inhaler 5 μg induces fast onset of bronchodilation, comparable with formoterol at day 1. Moreover, significant lung function improvements have been documented up to 48 weeks in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Olodaterol was generally well tolerated and had an acceptable cardiovascular and respiratory adverse event profile. Regrettably, the clinical development of olodaterol is however still too partial to draw any firm conclusions on the positioning of this ultra-LABA as monotherapy in the management of COPD. Waiting for further data on the impact of olodaterol on different patient-reported outcomes, which however are widely available for indacaterol, and mainly for a head-to-head comparison between these two ultra-LABAs and between olodaterol long-acting antimuscarinic antagonists other than tiotropium, we believe it is correct to follow the clinical indications of indacaterol also for olodaterol. In any case, the parallel bronchodilating modes of action of olodaterol and tiotropium make them an attractive combination in COPD. The results from the ongoing large TOviTO Phase III trial program have documented the efficacy and safety of olodaterol/tiotropium fixed-dose combination as maintenance therapy in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. In particular, olodaterol/tiotropium fixed-dose combination provides a convincing alternative for patients remaining symptomatic with olodaterol monotherapy."

This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of indacaterol 150 and 300 μg once daily in adults with moderate to severe COPD, as well as reviewing indacaterol's pharmacological properties and results of a cost-utility analysis. Indacaterol has a fast onset of action after the first dose and is effective over 24 hours, allowing for once-daily administration. In short-term trials (≤21 days) in patients with COPD, once-daily indacaterol 150 or 300 μg significantly improved lung function, exercise endurance and lung hyperinflation relative to placebo. In large, longer-term clinical studies (12 weeks to 1 year) in patients with moderate to severe COPD, once-daily indacaterol 150 or 300 μg improved lung function (primary endpoint) significantly more than placebo, and improvements were significantly greater than twice-daily formoterol 12 μg or salmeterol 50 μg, and noninferior to once-daily tiotropium bromide 18 μg (all agents were administered via inhalation). Overall, indacaterol improved dyspnoea, use of rescue medication and general health status significantly more than placebo, salmeterol or tiotropium bromide, and the degree of improvement in these endpoints was similar to or greater than that achieved with formoterol. Improvements were sustained over the long term (1 year), with no evidence of tolerance. Combination therapy with indacaterol plus tiotropium bromide improved lung function, dyspnoea, rescue medication use and general health status significantly more than tiotropium bromide alone in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Indacaterol is generally well tolerated when used alone or in combination with tiotropium bromide in patients with COPD and has not been associated with any safety issues. The most common adverse event in clinical trials was COPD worsening, which occurred more commonly with placebo than indacaterol. Indacaterol was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events. In a cost-utility analysis from a German healthcare payer perspective, once-daily indacaterol 150 μg was dominant (i.e. more effective with lower total costs) to once-daily tiotropium bromide 18 μg and twice-daily salmeterol 50 μg in the treatment of patients with COPD. In conclusion, indacaterol provides a valuable option for the maintenance treatment of adults with COPD."

CD012930,0,20861599,0,Innovations to achieve excellence in COPD diagnosis and treatment in primary care.,"Recognition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often missed or delayed in primary care. Once recognized, COPD is often undertreated or episodically treated, focusing on acute exacerbations without establishing maintenance treatment to control ongoing disease. Diagnostic and therapeutic pessimism result in missed opportunities to reduce exacerbations, maintain physical functioning, and reduce emergent health care requirements. Proactive diagnosis and evidence-based management can alleviate the impact of COPD on patients' lives. Smoking cessation has been proven to slow the rate of lung function decline. Maintenance pharmacotherapy and immunizations reduce exacerbations. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves respiratory symptoms and physical functioning and reduces rehospitalizations after exacerbations. Self-management education improves health-related quality of life and reduces inpatient and emergency care usage. Maintenance treatment with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators is appropriate beginning in moderate COPD to maintain airway patency and reduce exacerbations. Tiotropium is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to treat bronchospasm and reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD; salmeterol/fluticasone is FDA approved to treat airflow obstruction in COPD and reduce exacerbations in patients with a history of exacerbations. Other maintenance long-acting bronchodilators-salmeterol, formoterol, and budesonide/formoterol-are FDA approved to treat airway obstruction in COPD but lack an approved indication against exacerbations. FDA warnings on the use of long-acting beta-adrenergic agents (LABAs) in asthma specifically exempt COPD and do not apply to LABA/inhaled corticosteroid combinations used in COPD. The actual effectiveness achieved in practice with any COPD therapies depends on patients' inhaler technique, adherence, and persistence. Medication usage rates and inhaler proficiency may be improved by concordance, in which the health care provider and patient collaborate to make treatment plans sustainable in the patient's daily life. Practice redesign for whole-patient primary care provides additional tools for comprehensive COPD management. Innovations such as group visits and the patient-centered medical home provide newer ways to interact with COPD patients and their families. Patient-focused and evidence-based options enable primary care practices to manage COPD longitudinally and improve patient outcomes through the course of the disease."
CD012930,0,26316169,0,"Escalation and De-escalation of Therapy in COPD: Myths, Realities and Perspectives.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) guidelines and strategies suggest escalating treatment, mainly depending on the severity of airflow obstruction. However, some de-escalation of therapy in COPD would be appropriate, although we still do not know when we should switch, step-up or step-down treatments in our patients. Unfortunately, trials comparing different strategies of step-up and step-down treatment (e.g. treatment initiation with one single agent and then further step-up if symptoms are not controlled versus initial use of double or triple therapy, possibly with lower doses of the individual components, or the role of N-acetylcysteine in combination therapy for a step-down approach) are still lacking. In general, there is a large and often inappropriate use of the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) combination. However, the withdrawal of the ICS in COPD patients at low risk of exacerbation can be safe, provided that patients are under regular treatment with long-acting bronchodilators. Maximising the treatment in patients with a degree of clinical instability by including an ICS in the therapeutic regimen is useful to control the disease, but may not be needed during periods of clinical stability. In patients with severe but stable COPD, the withdrawal of the ICS from triple therapy [LABA + long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) + ICS] is possible, but not when the patient has been hospitalised for an acute exacerbation of COPD. We must still establish how long we should wait before withdrawing the ICS. It is still unclear whether the same is true when only the LABA or the LAMA is withdrawn while continuing treatment with the other bronchodilator and the ICS. In any case, we strongly believe that it is always better to avoid a therapeutic step-up progression when it is not needed rather than being forced subsequently into a step-down approach in which the outcome is always unpredictable."

A novel bronchodilator, indacaterol, satisfies the requirements of an efficacious LABA: it has a relatively longer duration of action compared with existing LABAs and a fast onset of action. This review is a presentation of data on indacaterol with respect to its molecular characteristics as well as comparisons with other long-acting bronchodilators. Data from 12 relevant trials show that once-daily indacaterol provides significant, consistent and clinically important improvements in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), significant improvements in breathlessness and health status at least as good as or better than tiotropium, salmeterol and formoterol, and reduction in requirement for relief medication compared with tiotropium, salmeterol and formoterol."

Naturally, researchers focused on improving efficiency of existent molecules. A new beta-2 adrenergic class was born recently: the ultra-LABA's. First player that was already adopted in current practice is indacaterol. Indacaterol is a beta-2 adrenergic rapidly acting, with an onset of action in 5 minutes, like salbutamol and formoterol but with a sustained bronchodilator effect, that last for 24 hours, like tiotropium. Indacaterol clinical study program, INERGIZE, followed three main directions: prove superiority over placebo, evaluate indacaterol among others established bronchodilators routinely used in COPD management and establish long-term safety profile. In patients with moderate-severe COPD, indacaterol, both 150 and 300 microg showed a rapidly and sustained improvement in pulmonary function, increasing FEV1 with 130-180 ml (p < 0.001) versus placebo (INLIGHT 1). Comparing to salmeterol, there was a superior improvement in FEV1, that starts from day 1 and last unchanged till the end of study (p < 0.01 vs salmeterol; INLIGHT 2). Over 12 mcg formoterol twice daily, 300 microg indacaterolul, once daily showed superiority in improving pulmonary (p < 0.001 vs formoterol; Involve), that is present form day 2, with no ceiling effects over one year, unlike formoterol. As an outcome for secondary objectives, indacaterol proved superior improvement in breathlessness at 12 weeks, (TDI score, p < 0.01 vs formoterol). Regarding exacerbations, indacaterol was at least as effective in reducing exacerbations, as formoterol. Open-label study over tiotropium, INHANCE, compared indacaterol, 150 and 300 microg, with tiotropium, 18 microg, both once daily, for 6 month. At 12 weeks, primary objective for all indacaterol studies, both indacaterol doses showed FEV1 improvement of 180 ml versus 140 ml for tiotropium (p < or = 0.01). % of patients with improvement in TDI score > 1 unit at the end of the study was in favour of indacaterol 300 microg (p < or = 0.01). Authors conclusion was that once daily indacaterol is at least as effective as tiotropium, in its symptoms and health status. The availability of a new once daily bronchodilator, that maximize efficiency of beta-2 adrenergics may provide clinicians with more flexibility in treating COPD, and may increase adherence to treatments for patients."

Combining bronchodilators that work through different mechanisms is recommended in patients with continuous symptoms. We conducted this study to confirm and further investigate the efficacy and safety of nebulized formoterol as an add-on therapy to maintenance tiotropium in patients with COPD. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (NCT00507234) was conducted at 24 US sites from March to October 2007 in 155 patients aged > or =40 years with post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) > or =25% to <65% predicted normal. COPD patients receiving open-label tiotropium bromide 18 microg once daily during a 1- to 2-week run-in period were randomized to receive either formoterol fumarate inhalation solution 20 microg or placebo by nebulization twice daily for 6 weeks while continuing treatment with tiotropium. Outcomes included serial spirometry, inspiratory capacity (IC), baseline dyspnoea index/transition dyspnoea index (BDI/TDI), daily symptom scores, salbutamol (albuterol) use and health status measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The primary efficacy endpoint was standardized absolute FEV(1) area under the curve over 3 hours (AUC(0-3)) at week 6. Treatment groups (formoterol plus tiotropium, n = 78; placebo plus tiotropium, n = 77) were comparable at baseline. At 6 weeks, FEV(1) AUC(0-3) was significantly greater in the formoterol group compared with the placebo group (1.57 vs 1.38 L [p < 0.0001]). Similarly, formoterol plus tiotropium improved other lung function measures, including FEV(1), forced vital capacity and post-dose IC at day 1, and maintained efficacy through week 6. Formoterol plus tiotropium decreased rescue albuterol use throughout the study (p < 0.05). Mean TDI, SGRQ and most symptom scores did not differ between the two treatment groups. Overall, 37% of formoterol plus tiotropium recipients experienced adverse events versus 51% of those receiving placebo plus tiotropium.

CD012930,0,22854200,0,The Influence of receptor kinetics on the onset and duration of action and the therapeutic index of NVA237 and tiotropium.,"Studies under nonphysiological conditions suggest that long receptor residency time is responsible for the 24-h duration of action of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium. Our aim was to determine how clinically relevant dissociation rates under more physiological conditions influence the differences in onset of action between tiotropium and 3-[(cyclopentylhydroxyphenylacetyl oxy]-1,1-dimethyl-pyrrolidinium bromide (NVA237), a once-daily dry-powder formulation of the LAMA glycopyrronium bromide in development for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, we have investigated kinetic selectivity at each of the muscarinic receptor subtypes to determine whether the improved cardiovascular therapeutic index obtained with NVA237 in animal models is attributable to differences in kinetic rate constants. The binding of radioligand [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine was measured in the presence/absence of several concentrations of unlabeled competitors, and data were analyzed using a competition kinetic model to provide on/off rates for the competitor. We found shorter dissociation half-lives for NVA237 and tiotropium under physiological (11.4 and 46.2 min, respectively) versus nonphysiological conditions (173 and 462 min, respectively). NVA237 had a more rapid onset of action (3-4.8 times) versus tiotropium, determined in an vitro calcium and rat tracheal strip assay. Simulations suggested that the more rapid onset of NVA237 action could be explained by differences in kinetic parameters. NVA237 had greater equilibrium binding and kinetic selectivity for muscarinic type 3 (M3) versus muscarinic type 2 (M2) receptors, with a faster off rate from M2 versus M3 receptors than tiotropium, potentially affording it a more favorable therapeutic index. This study suggests that the 24-h duration of action of NVA237 and tiotropium is not solely the result of their slow dissociation from the M3 receptor and highlights the importance of conducting in vitro experiments in conditions reflecting those in vivo."

In the early stages of development of a maintenance bronchodilator, the goals are to identify a molecule with the theoretically 'ideal' profile of fast onset and prolonged duration of action in comparison with existing agents, while minimizing non-specific activity at organs outside the lungs. The move towards increasing duration of bronchodilator action is generally paralleled by improved effects on clinical outcomes, and the advent of more potent agents seems likely to provide an opportunity to reduce overreliance on the use of inhaled corticosteroids in treating COPD. In terms of onset of action, an immediately perceived benefit in reducing dyspnea, although not definitively demonstrated, might prove useful in increasing adherence, which is very poor among patients with COPD. Once-daily administration may also be helpful in this respect. Shared decision-making between patient and physician in the choice of treatment is important in optimizing adherence and, thus, treatment effectiveness."
CD012930,0,22659487,0,Bronchodilators modulate inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by neutrophilic airway inflammation and oxidative stress. Leukotriene B₄ (LTB₄), a potent proinflammatory mediator, is synthesized by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), which is activated by the presence of lipid hydroperoxides resulting from oxidative stress on biological membranes. We proposed to evaluate the effect of a four week treatment with two different bronchodilators of common practice in COPD treatment, on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular superoxide anions, and of LTB₄ by peripheral blood neutrophils obtained from COPD subjects. 24 subjects among the COPD outpatients were enrolled, and randomized to receive either formoterol (12 μg bid) or tiotropium (18 μg od). Peripheral blood neutrophils were obtained at the start and at the end of the treatment, and production of superoxide anions and of LTB₄ were evaluated as previously published. The results obtained showed a decrease in the unstimulated production of superoxide by isolated neutrophils in both groups, but tiotropium only was effective in modulating the production of LTB₄, while formoterol caused an increased production of superoxide in response to fMLP, when compared to values obtained before treatment. In conclusion, tiotropium showed a better antiinflammatory activity profile when compared to formoterol in a clinical setting, reducing superoxide and LTB₄ production by peripheral neutrophils obtained from COPD subjects."

In phase III studies, QVA149 significantly improved bronchodilation versus indacaterol, glycopyrronium or tiotropium alone and the LABA/inhaled corticosteroid fixed-dose combination salmeterol/fluticasone. These improvements in lung function, which were rapid in onset and maintained during long-term treatment, were generally associated with significant improvements in dyspnoea, health status, COPD exacerbation risk, patient symptoms, and rescue medication use. The SHINE and ILLUMINATE studies in low (exacerbation) risk patients with moderate to severe disease suggest that QVA149 may offer more symptomatic relief than tiotropium and salmeterol/fluticasone. Similarly, the SPARK study in high (exacerbation) risk patients with severe or very severe disease showed that QVA149 was more effective than glycopyrronium in preventing moderate to severe exacerbations, and suggests that QVA149 may offer more symptomatic relief than LAMA monotherapy. Another phase III study comparing QVA149 with salmeterol/fluticasone in high-risk patients with moderate to very severe disease (FLAME) is ongoing. QVA149 is generally well tolerated, with no new safety signals identified compared with its monocomponents. Bronchodilators remain central to the symptomatic management of COPD. When dual bronchodilation is indicated, QVA149 offers the convenience of two bronchodilators in a single inhaler coupled with a simple, once-daily dosing regimen that may encourage better treatment adherence. Therefore, it is a valuable option in the treatment of COPD."
CD012930,0,16113424,0,Reducing the frequency and severity of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Exacerbations contribute significantly to impaired health status in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but current therapy can prevent these episodes. Immunization against, for example, influenza offers specific prophylaxis for a minority of episodes. Pulmonary rehabilitation reduces hospital attendance, but its effect wanes. Inhaled bronchodilators such as tiotropium produce similar reductions in exacerbation frequency. Database studies show an association between prescription of inhaled corticosteroids and reduced hospitalization in the older population, a finding confirmed by randomized trials in patients with an FEV(1) of less than 50% predicted. Three 1-year randomized clinical trials studied the effect of combining a long-acting beta-agonist with an inhaled corticosteroids. In these studies, exacerbation frequency was lower with therapy than placebo. Combination therapy had a similar effect to its monocomponents in the trial of inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonists study using salmeterol and fluticasone. However, when patients with more severe COPD (an FEV(1) of less than 36% predicted) were studied using a combination of budesonide and formoterol, a clear improvement was seen in the overall exacerbation rate compared with the beta-agonist alone. In addition, the time to first exacerbation was increased compared with either drug alone. Health status changes mirrored these effects. In summary, combination therapy can effectively prevent exacerbations in patients with more advanced COPD."

Therefore, the incorporation of once-daily dose administration is an important strategy to improve adherence and is a regimen preferred by most patients, which may also lead to enhancement of compliance, and may have advantages leading to improved overall clinical outcomes. Once-daily beta2-agonists or ultra long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) such as carmoterol, indacaterol, GSK-159797, GSK-597901, GSK-159802, GSK-642444 and GSK-678007 are under development for the treatment of asthma and COPD.

In any case, the current opinion is that it will be advantageous to develop inhalers containing combination of several classes of long-acting bronchodilator drugs in an attempt to simplify treatment regimens as much as possible. Consequently, several options for once-daily dual-action ultra LABA+LAMA combination products are currently being evaluated. A different approach is to have a dimer molecule in which both pharmacologies are present (these molecules are known as M3 antagonist-beta2 agonist (MABA) bronchodilators).

ISSs from HC, HS and COPD as well as rhTGF-β1 were also tested in neutrophil adhesion and in mAChR2, mAChR3 and ChAT expression experiments in human bronchial epithelial cells (16-HBE). Finally, we evaluated the effects of Olodaterol (a novel inhaled β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist) and Tiotropium Spiriva®, alone or in combination, on neutrophil adhesion and mAChRs and ChAT expression in stimulated 16-HBE. The results showed that 1) TGF-β1 and ACh concentrations are increased in ISSs from COPD in comparison to HC and HS, and TGF-β1 in HS is higher than in HC; 2) ISSs from COPD and HS caused increased neutrophil adhesion to 16-HBE when compared to ISSs from HC. The effect of ISSs from COPD was significantly reduced by TGF-β1 depletion or by the pretreatment with Olodaterol or Tiotropium alone or in combination, while the effect of ISSs from HS was significantly reduced by the pretreatment with Olodaterol alone; 3) mAChR2, mAChR3 and ChAT expression was increased in 16-HBE stimulated with ISSs from COPD and TGF-β1 depletion significantly reduced this effect on mAChR3 and ChAT expression; 4) rhTGF-β1 increased mAChR2, mAChR3 and ChAT expression in 16-HBE; 5) Olodaterol did not affect the expression of mAChRs and ChAT in 16-HBE. Our findings support the use of β₂ long-acting and anticholinergic drugs to control the bronchoconstriction and TGF-β1-mediated neutrophilic inflammation in COPD."

Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, such as long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), are the cornerstone of maintenance therapy for patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD. For patients not sufficiently controlled on a single long-acting bronchodilator, a combination of different bronchodilators has shown a significant increase in lung function. Tiotropium, a once-daily dosing LAMA, demonstrated sustained improvements in lung function as well as improved health-related quality of life, reduced exacerbations, and increased survival without altering the rate of decline in the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) with fairly tolerable side effects. Olodaterol is a once-daily dosing LABA that has proven to be effective in improving lung function, reducing rescue medication use, and improving dyspnea and health-related quality of life, as well as improving exercise endurance with an acceptable safety profile. The combination of olodaterol and tiotropium provided additional improvements in lung function greater than monotherapy with each drug alone. Several well-designed randomized trials confirmed that the synergistic effect of both drugs in combination was able to improve lung function and health-related quality of life without a significant increase in adverse effects. The objective of this paper is to review available evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of tiotropium, olodaterol, and their combination in patients with COPD."

LAMAs inhibit the parasympathetic muscarinic pathway, while LABAs, as sympathomimetics, reduce airway smooth muscle (ASM) tone. As well as directly controlling the constriction and relaxation of ASM, muscarinic and adrenergic receptors are found on inflammatory cells, and drugs that target these receptors may also reduce inflammation in COPD. Evidence suggests that the muscarinic and adrenergic pathways cross-talk at the level of neuronal input to the ASM via second-messenger pathways within ASM cells. Although the cross-talk is not completely understood, pharmacologically targeting both pathways in COPD can maximize bronchodilation. Combining LAMAs and LABAs demonstrated improved efficacy compared with the individual therapies and so, for greater convenience, several fixed-dose combinations for once-daily use have been developed.

CD012930,0,19478135,0,Preclinical evaluation of long-acting muscarinic antagonists: comparison of tiotropium and investigational drugs.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive airflow limitation caused by persistent inflammatory processes in the airways. An increased cholinergic tone mediates different pathophysiological features of COPD, such as bronchoconstriction and mucus hypersecretion, mostly through activation of the human muscarinic M(3) receptor (hM(3)) subtype. Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva) is a well established muscarinic antagonist in the pharmacological management of COPD with a once-daily posology. The rationale behind the sustained bronchodilation obtained with tiotropium consists in its slow dissociation from hM(3) receptors. In this study, we performed a comprehensive preclinical comparison of tiotropium with other long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) currently in clinical development, namely aclidinium bromide and glycopyrrolate. The different muscarinic antagonists were characterized for their 1) affinity toward the different human muscarinic receptor subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and kinetics of receptor dissociation, 2) potency in inhibiting the agonist-induced activation of muscarinic receptors through measurement of second messengers, and 3) efficacy and duration of bronchoprotection, as tested in a model of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction in anesthetized dogs over a period of 24 h. All of the tested LAMAs showed high affinity and potency toward the hM(3) receptor (tiotropium, pA(2) = 10.4; aclidinium, pA(2) = 9.6; and glycopyrrolate, pA(2) = 9.7). However, dissociation half-lives of the LAMAs from the hM(3) receptor differed significantly (tiotropium, t((1/2)) = 27 h; aclidinium, t((1/2)) = 10.7 h; and glycopyrrolate, t((1/2)) = 6.1 h). In line with their kinetic properties at the hM(3), the tested LAMAs provided different levels of bronchoprotection in the in vivo setting 24 h after administration (tiotropium = 35%, aclidinium = 21%, and glycopyrrolate = 0% at 24 h) when applied at equieffective doses."

This article reviews the bronchodilator properties of indacaterol compared with other treatments used in COPD. Data from five published placebo-controlled studies were reviewed. Two 14-day crossover studies, the first comparing indacaterol 300 µg od with salmeterol 50 µg twice daily (bid), the second comparing indacaterol 150 µg and 300 µg od with tiotropium 18 µg od, assessed forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at 24 h postdose (trough). Third, a 14-day crossover study evaluated trough FEV(1) following indacaterol 300 µg dosed morning or evening compared with salmeterol 50 µg bid. Fourth, a single-dose study of indacaterol 150 and 300 µg measured FEV(1) at 5 min postdose compared with salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg and salbutamol 200 µg. Finally, data from a 1-year study with indacaterol 300 µg and formoterol 12 µg bid were examined to determine whether bronchodilation was maintained long term. In the first two studies, indacaterol increased trough FEV(1) after 14 days by a statistically significant and clinically relevant margin over placebo; indacaterol had a greater effect than salmeterol and a similar effect to tiotropium. In the third study, indacaterol had the same effect on trough FEV(1) whether dosed in the morning or evening. In the fourth study, the onset of the bronchodilator effect of indacaterol was similar to that of salbutamol. In the fifth study, the bronchodilator effect of indacaterol on trough FEV(1) was maintained at a significant and clinically relevant level over 52 weeks, whereas the bronchodilator effect of formoterol diminished over time. To conclude, indacaterol is a highly effective bronchodilator that is superior to or at least as effective as other available long-acting bronchodilators for COPD."
CD012930,0,10188785,0,"Tiotropium bromide (Ba 679 BR), a novel long-acting muscarinic antagonist for the treatment of obstructive airways disease.","Tiotropium bromide (Ba 679 BR) is a novel potent and long-lasting muscarinic antagonist that has been developed for the treatment of chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD). Binding studies with [3H]tiotropium bromide in human lung have confirmed that this is a potent muscarinic antagonist with equal affinity for M1-, M2- and M3-receptors and is approximately 10-fold more potent than ipratropium bromide. Tiotropium bromide dissociates very slowly from lung muscarinic receptors compared with ipratropium bromide. In vitro tiotropium bromide has a potent inhibitory effect against cholinergic nerve-induced contraction of guinea-pig and human airways, that has a slower onset than atropine or ipratropium bromide. After washout, however, tiotropium bromide dissociates extremely slowly compared with the dissociation of atropine and ipratropium bromide. Measurement of acetylcholine (ACh) release from guinea-pig trachea shows that tiotropium bromide, ipratropium bromide and atropine all increase ACh release on neural stimulation and that this effect is washed out equally quickly for the three antagonists. This confirms binding studies to transfected human muscarinic receptors which suggested that tiotropium bromide dissociates slowly from M3-receptors (on airway smooth muscle) but rapidly from M2 autoreceptors (on cholinergic nerve terminals). Clinical studies with inhaled tiotropium bromide confirm that it is a potent and long-lasting bronchodilator in COPD and asthma. Furthermore, it protects against cholinergic bronchoconstriction for > 24 h. This suggests that tiotropium bromide will be a useful bronchodilator, particularly in patients with COPD, and may be suitable for daily dosing. The selectivity for M3- over M2-receptors may also confer a clinical advantage."

The choice among the three medications allows a patient to use the same inhalation device even when the regimen is changed from single-bronchodilator therapy to dual-bronchodilator therapy. In addition, the quick bronchodilation effect and once-daily administration can improve patient adherence to medical treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To our knowledge, as of November 2014, the safety and the efficacy of QVA149 have been evaluated in 14 randomized controlled trials. The 14 trials generally showed good safety profiles, and there were better or not-inferior bronchodilator effects of QVA149 when compared with placebo, or other inhaled medication. According to the Japanese Respiratory Society guidelines, QVA149 is a combination of the two first-line bronchodilators. Our meta-analysis indicated that QVA149 is superior to the salmeterol-fluticasone combination to treat COPD in respect of the frequency of adverse effects, exacerbation, pneumonia, and improvement of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Thus, we believe that QVA149 can be a key medication for COPD treatments."

We investigated the efficacy and safety of roflumilast used concomitantly with long-acting β(2)-agonists (LABAs) to reduce exacerbations, and the influence of exacerbation history. Pooled data were analysed from two 12-month, placebo-controlled roflumilast (500 μg once daily) studies involving 3,091 patients with severe-to-very severe COPD. Approximately half of patients used concomitant LABAs; 39% used concomitant short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs); 27% were frequent exacerbators (two or more exacerbations per year). Roflumilast reduced the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations, with LABA (rate ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91; p=0.001) or without LABA (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99; p=0.039) and prolonged time both to first (p=0.035 with LABA, p=0.300 without LABA) and second (p=0.018 with LABA, p=0.049 without LABA) exacerbations. Frequent exacerbators experienced a reduction in moderate or severe exacerbations (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.91; p=0.002). Similarly, roflumilast remained effective with concomitant SAMA. No differences arose in adverse events between these subgroups. Roflumilast may be used to reduce exacerbations and improve dyspnoea and lung function, without increasing adverse events in COPD patients receiving concomitant LABAs."

CD012930,0,17399972,0,Tiotropium is less likely to induce oxygen desaturation in stable COPD patients compared to long-acting beta2-agonists.,"In a three-way crossover pilot study, the acute effects of tiotropium 18 microg inhalation on the respiratory function and arterial blood gas tensions of 30 patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were compared with those of salmeterol 50 microg and formoterol 12 microg. In each study day, lung function and arterial blood gas analyses were performed before and up to 180 min after inhalation. All treatments significantly improved lung function, increased DLco, decreased PaO2, and increased P(A-a)O2, with no change in PaCO2. The effects of salmeterol and tiotropium on PaO2 were slower in onset and more prolonged than those of formoterol but PaO2AUC0-180 min was significantly greater for formoterol and salmeterol than for tiotropium. It is likely that the significant but small decreases in PaO2 and increases in P(A-a)O2 have been caused by pulmonary vasodilator effects. Since the three agents were similar in inducing bronchodilation, we believe that tiotropium is preferable in patients with hypoxemia caused by stable COPD because it seems to carry a smaller risk of worsening systemic hypoxemia."

Each stage was followed by evaluation of COPD symptoms using the St-George's Hospital questionnaire, daily requirements for short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA), heart rate (HR), forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV-1) before and after SABA test, hemoglobin saturation with oxygen in arterial blood during pulse oxymetry before and after 6 min walking test, blood surfactant protein D level (SP-D). The control group was comprised of 34 healthy men (mean age 62.3 ± 5.8 yr). Patients with moderately severe COPD experienced worsening of clinical symptoms (p < 0.001), required more SABA (p < 0.001), had increased HR (p = 0.01) and SP-D levels (p = 0.01) whereas FEV-1 (p = 0.05) decreased during stage 2 as compared with stage 1. Positive dynamics of all these variables except COPD symptoms and HR was observed at stage 3. Alteration in the extent of basal therapy in patients with stage III COPD did not result in dynamics of clinical and laboratory characteristics. The data obtained suggest the necessity of combined therapy with LABD or triple basal therapy of moderately severe COPD and the possibility of therapy with one or two LABD having different sites of action in the patients with clinically stable stage II COPD."

We review the safety and efficacy data obtained during its development. In a dose-finding study, formoterol inhalation solution (FFIS) was similar to the formoterol originator, Foradil 12 microg DPI (FA) in patients with COPD. In a 12-week efficacy study, FFIS manifested a rapid onset of action and FEV(1) peak, AUC(0-12), and trough levels similar to FA. No loss of efficacy, tachyphylaxis, was observed over 12 weeks of regular administration. In placebo-controlled studies in COPD patients receiving maintenance tiotropium, the addition of FFIS significantly augmented bronchodilation over the 6-week treatment duration, signifying that nebulized formoterol can further improve lung function in patients who are receiving tiotropium without an observed increase in adverse reactions. The safety profile of FFIS during 12-week and 1-year studies revealed adverse events that were similar to those of placebo and FA. Cardiac rhythm studies, including frequent ECGs and Holter monitoring, did not indicate any increase in rate or rhythm disturbances greater than placebo or FA. We conclude that maintenance use of Perforomist is appropriate for patients with COPD who require or prefer a nebulizer for management of their disease."

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists such as glycopyrronium and tiotropium, along with long-acting beta-2 agonists such as indacaterol, formoterol and salmeterol are the pillars of pharmacological therapy for the long-term management of patients with COPD. Glycopyrronium, the quaternary ammonium ion of glycopyrronium bromide, acts as a competitive antagonist by selectively binding to the muscarinic receptors in the bronchial smooth musculature, thus inhibiting acetylcholine-mediated bronchoconstriction. Glycopyrronium is an inhaled once-daily long-acting muscarinic antagonist recently approved for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD. Glycopyrronium is administered by a single-dose, dry-powder inhaler, the Breezhaler® device, designed specifically to have a low internal resistance, be easy to use and confirm efficient drug delivery in patients with a wide range of COPD severities, irrespective of the age.

CD012930,0,20496300,0,Preventing hospitalization for COPD exacerbations.,"Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Recognition of the importance of COPD exacerbations has led to the knowledge that prevention of exacerbations and early treatment are important goals of COPD therapy. Preventive management of COPD aiming at reducing exacerbations complicated by hospital admissions includes vaccination, avoiding pollutant exposure, and, when indicated, long-term oxygen therapy. Landmark studies have shown benefits of long-acting inhaled bronchodilators and combined long-acting inhaled bronchodilators with corticosteroids. The combination of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist with a long-acting beta (2) agonist and inhaled corticosteroids offers the best possibility to reduce the risk of exacerbations requiring hospital admissions. Pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients at risk of being hospitalized and regular physical activity have been shown to be associated with a lower risk of hospital admissions. Recent advances in the delivery of evidence-based care including a collaborative multicomponent self-management intervention can reduce the risk of COPD hospital admissions. If physicians meet best practice, this will have potential clinical implications, including a reduction of hospitalizations. Novel pharmacological therapy, which can prevent disease progression and exacerbations, is still needed. New self-management strategies such as a written action plan that helps patients recognize their exacerbation and promptly access treatment may have great potential. This needs to be evaluated in a properly designed randomized clinical trial before it becomes the standard of care for COPD patients."

We investigated whether acetylcholine (ACh) generates oxidative/nitrosative stress in bronchial epithelial cells during airway inflammation of COPD and evaluated the effects of Tiotropium, a once-daily antimuscarinic drug, and Olodaterol, a long-acting β2-agonist on these mechanisms. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16-HBE) were stimulated (4h, 37°C) with induced sputum supernatants (ISSs) from healthy controls (HC) (n=10), healthy smokers (HS) (n=10) or COPD patients (n=10), as well as with ACh (from 1μM to 100μM). The activation of STAT-1 pathway (STAT-1Ser727 and STAT-1Tyr701) and iNOS was evaluated in the cell lysates by Western blot analysis as well as nitrotyrosine levels by ELISA, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Finally, the effect of Tiotropium (Spiriva®) (100nM), alone or in combination with Olodaterol (1nM), was tested in this model. ISSs from COPD patients significantly increased the phosphorylation of STAT-1Ser727 and STAT-1Tyr701, iNOS and ROS/Nitrotyrosine when compared with ISSs from HC or HS subjects in 16-HBE cells. Furthermore, synthetic ACh increased all these parameters in stimulated 16HBE when compared with untreated cells. Tiotropium and Olodaterol reduced the oxidative/nitrosative stress generated by ACh and ISSs.

CD012930,0,27613392,0,Pharmacological strategies to reduce exacerbation risk in COPD: a narrative review.,"Identifying patients at risk of exacerbations and managing them appropriately to reduce this risk represents an important clinical challenge. Numerous treatments have been assessed for the prevention of exacerbations and their efficacy may differ by patient phenotype. Given their centrality in the treatment of COPD, there is strong rationale for maximizing bronchodilation as an initial strategy to reduce exacerbation risk irrespective of patient phenotype. Therefore, in patients assessed as frequent exacerbators (>1 exacerbation/year) we propose initial bronchodilator treatment with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/ long-acting β2-agonist (LABA). For those patients who continue to experience >1 exacerbation/year despite maximal bronchodilation, we advocate treating according to patient phenotype. Based on currently available data on adding inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to a LABA, ICS might be added to a LABA/LAMA combination in exacerbating patients who have an asthma-COPD overlap syndrome or high blood eosinophil counts, while in exacerbators with chronic bronchitis, consideration should be given to treating with a phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibitor (roflumilast) or high-dose mucolytic agents. For those patients who experience frequent bacterial exacerbations and/or bronchiectasis, addition of mucolytic agents or a macrolide antibiotic (e.g. azithromycin) should be considered.

This review focuses on the clinical evidence for the benefit of LABA/LAMA FDCs compared with monocomponent treatments, and also compared with active comparators that are widely used for the treatment of COPD, namely tiotropium and salmeterol-fluticasone. Novel FDC dual bronchodilators include QVA149 and umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI). Long term clinical trials show that QVA149 and UMEC/VI are superior to monocomponent therapy in terms of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), although the FEV1 improvement was limited to approximately 80-90% of the added monocomponent values. This suggests that the effect of combining a LABA and a LAMA is not fully additive. LABA/LAMA FDC were associated with the largest mean changes in symptoms and health status that were above the minimal clinically important difference, in contrast to the monocomponents. Furthermore, these LABA/LAMA FDCs demonstrated superiority over the active comparators tiotropium and salmeterol-fluticasone in terms of trough FEV1 and patient-reported outcomes. LABA/LAMA FDCs offer a simplified means of maximizing bronchodilation for COPD patients, with the improvements in lung function being mirrored by benefits in terms of symptoms and exacerbations. The use of LABA/LAMA FDCs in clinical practice is set to grow and further studies are needed to define their optimal place in treatment guidelines."

CD012930,0,25445928,0,Differences in the efficacy and safety among inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) combinations in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Role of ICS.,"Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are frequently recommended for the treatment of asthma and COPD, often in combination with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), depending on the severity of the disease and/or on the specific phenotype. Several ICS/LABA combinations are currently available that differ in their pharmacokinetic characteristics and dose of both components. Thus, this review assesses differences in the efficacy and the safety profiles of the ICS components in the two more frequently used ICS/LABA combinations (budesonide/formoterol and fluticasone/salmeterol) for the management of COPD. Whereas the basic mechanism of action is similar for all ICS (binding with the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor, which mediates both genomic and non genomic effects), the pharmacokinetic and characteristics of ICS are quite different in terms of receptor affinity, bioavailability, lipophilicity and drug persistence in the airways. Fluticasone persists longer in airway mucus and requires more time to dissolve in the lining fluid and then enter the airway wall, whereas budesonide is cleared more quickly from the airways. Comparative efficacy of the two major ICS/LABA combinations recommended for the treatment of COPD show similar efficacy in terms of reduction of exacerbations, improvement in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and quality of life. One retrospective cohort study suggested a greater efficacy for the budesonide/formoterol combination on hospital or emergency department admissions, oral corticosteroid courses, and addition of tiotropium, and an observational real-life study reported a greater reduction of COPD exacerbations with budesonide/formoterol than with fluticasom/salmeterol combination. Among the potential side effects of chronic ICS treatment in patients with COPD, recently the use of fluticasone or fluticasone/salmeterol combination has been associated with a higher prevalence of pneumonia in the major long-term studies. On the other hand, no similar increased risk of pneumonia has been reported in patients with COPD treated with the budesonide/formoterol combination. A recent population-based cohort study from the Quebec database showed that the adjusted odds ratio for having severe pneumonia was higher for fluticasone (2.1) than for budesonide (1.17) or other ICS (1.41). Of the ICS studied, only fluticasone demonstrated a dose-related increase in risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. This difference between fluticasone and budesonide may be explained by the longer retention of fluticasone in the airways, with potentially greater inhibition of type-1 innate immunity. Therefore, the risk:benefit ratio should be evaluated thoroughly when choosing an ICS/LABA combination for patients with COPD."
CD012930,0,24953015,0,Extrafine beclomethasone/formoterol in severe COPD patients with history of exacerbations.,"The FORWARD study is a randomised, double-blind trial that compares the efficacy and safety of 48 weeks treatment with extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate (BDP/FOR), 100/6 μg pMDI, 2 inhalations BID, vs. FOR 12 μg pMDI, 1 inhalation BID, in severe COPD patients with a history of exacerbations. Co-primary endpoints were exacerbation rate over 48 weeks and pre-dose morning FEV(1) at 12 weeks. The ITT population included 1186 patients (69% males, mean age 64 years) with severe airflow limitation (mean post-bronchodilator FEV(1) 42% predicted). Salbutamol as rescue therapy, theophylline and tiotropium (if stable regimen prior to screening) were allowed. Compared to FOR, BDP/FOR: (1) reduced the exacerbation rate (rate ratio: 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.62-0.84], p < 0.001); (2) improved pre-dose morning FEV(1) (mean difference: 0.069 L [0.043-0.095] p < 0.001); (3) prolonged the time to first exacerbation; (4) improved the SGRQ total score. The percentage of patients with adverse events was similar (52.1% with BDP/FOR and 49.2% with FOR). Pneumonia incidence was low, slightly higher with BDP/FOR (3.8%) than with FOR (1.8%). No difference for laboratory values, ECG or vital signs. Extrafine BDP/FOR significantly reduces the exacerbation rate and improves lung function of patients with severe COPD and history of exacerbations as compared to FOR alone."
CD012930,0,23835951,0,Altered histone deacetylase activity and iNOS expression in cells isolated from induced sputum of COPD patients treated with tiotropium.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the only major disease with increasing death rate. In COPD, progressive reduction in quality of life is closely related to the increasing limitation of airflow due to chronic bronchitis, cell hyperplasia, fibrosis, and irreversible lung damage. Signaling pathways involved in inflammatory processes in COPD and inflammatory response to therapy are unknown. Our aim was to isolate cells from induced sputum of COPD patients treated with formoterol or formoterol + tiotropium and assess enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) acetylated histone 4 (AcH4) and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). HDACs are important in signal transduction and inflammation. iNOS is generating nitric oxide (NO) relevant to blood pressure regulation, inflammation and infections. Thirty stable COPD patients (21 males and 9 females, mean age 67 years) receiving 12 μg b.i.d. formoterol were assayed before and after 3 months add-on therapy consisting of 18 μg q.i.d. tiotropium. In all patients, spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO were performed before and after tiotropium therapy and all patients were subjected to sputum induction. Sputum cells were isolated and processed to obtain cytosolic and nuclear fractions. HDAC activity was measured in nuclear fraction using colorimetric assay. Expression AcH4 and iNOS was quantified using Western blot. In patients receiving both drugs, FEV1 and lung volumes significantly improved compared with formoterol-only treated patients. Mean HDAC activity was slightly decreased (P < 0.05), while AcH4 levels and iNOS expression were significantly elevated in tiotropium-treated patients (increase by about 65 %; P < 0.01 and 77 %; P < 0.01 respectively). Our data show that beneficial effects of tiotropium in add-on therapy to formoterol may be related to altered histone signaling and increased iNOS expression."

The cornerstone of pharmacological treatment for COPD is bronchodilation. Inhaled glycopyrronium bromide is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist developed as a maintenance treatment for patients with COPD. Phase III trials have shown that glycopyrronium produces rapid and sustained bronchodilation with an efficacy similar to tiotropium and is well tolerated, with a low incidence of muscarinic side effects in patients with moderate to severe COPD. A combination of glycopyrronium bromide with indacaterol maleate (QVA149) has recently been approved as a once-daily maintenance therapy in adult patients with COPD. Phase III trials (the IGNITE program) with QVA149 have demonstrated significant improvements in lung function versus placebo, glycopyrronium, and tiotropium in patients with moderate to severe COPD, with no safety concerns of note. Hence QVA149 is a safe treatment option for moderate to severe COPD patients in whom long-acting muscarinic antagonist monotherapy is inadequate."

COPD is both preventable and treatable by an effective management including risk factor reduction, prevention, assessment, and treatment of acute exacerbations and co-morbidities. The available agents approved for COPD treatment are long-acting or ultra-long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) bronchodilators, as well as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with LABAs. ICS use has been restricted only to selected COPD patients by the most recent documents, mainly based on the risk of exacerbations. However, several observational studies showed a high rate of prescription of ICS in COPD, irrespective of clinical recommendations, questioning the efficacy of these compounds in unselected patients with COPD and leading to possible increase risk of side effects related to ICS use. After examining the low levels of adherence in primary care and in the clinical settings to national and international recommendations for the treatment of COPD in different countries, the most common drivers of the prevailing use of ICS are critically reviewed here by examining their pros and cons, aimed at identifying evidence-based drivers for a proper selection of patients who may benefit from the proper use of ICS."

The increasing hyperinflation results in dyspnea along with associated inability to engage in the activities of daily living. The American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society (ERS) and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) treatment guidelines all place bronchodilators as the foundation of pharmacological management of COPD. In patients with moderate-to-very-severe respiratory impairment, adding regular treatment with one or more long-acting bronchodilators is recommended [long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs)]. A growing body of evidence shows that LAMA and LABA co-administration is more effective than either drug class alone in managing stable COPD to improve lung function, symptoms and health status. Recently, new drug applications (NDAs) for a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of umeclidinium (UMEC), a LAMA, and vilanterol (VI), a LABA, at UMEC/VI doses of 125/25 and 62.5/25 µg have been submitted by sponsors to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

CD012930,0,15350163,0,Tiotropium bromide. A review of its use as maintenance therapy in patients with COPD.,"Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva) is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that maintains bronchodilation for at least 24 hours, allowing once-daily administration. The active moiety is the tiotropium cation (tiotropium); tiotropium bromide 22.5 micrograms is equivalent to 18 micrograms of tiotropium cation. Greater improvements in lung function from baseline (primary endpoint mean trough FEV(1)) were observed with inhaled tiotropium 18 micrograms once daily than with placebo in 6-month and 1-year randomized, double-blind trials in patients with COPD. Tiotropium improved lung function (trough FEV(1) response) more effectively than ipratropium bromide (ipratropium) 40 micrograms four times daily in 1-year clinical trials, and was at least as effective as salmeterol 50 micrograms 12-hourly in 6-month trials. Preliminary data suggest that tiotropium alone or in combination with once-daily formoterol has a greater bronchodilator effect than twice-daily formoterol in patients with COPD. Improvements in patients' perception of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) or dyspnea were greater with tiotropium than with placebo or ipratropium, and were similar to those with salmeterol. Reductions in the frequency and severity of acute exacerbations and in the use of rescue medication were also greater with tiotropium than with ipratropium or placebo. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis with tiotropium during 1-year clinical trials. Inhaled tiotropium was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. Apart from dry mouth, the type and incidence of adverse events with tiotropium were similar to those with ipratropium, salmeterol or placebo in patients with COPD. In conclusion, inhaled tiotropium 18 micrograms once daily improved lung function, dyspnea, and HR-QOL, and decreased the incidence of acute COPD exacerbations and the use of rescue medication relative to placebo or ipratropium in clinical trials in patients with COPD. Tiotropium was at least as effective as salmeterol in terms of bronchodilator efficacy and improvements in dyspnea or HR-QOL. With the exception of dry mouth, the tolerability profile of tiotropium was similar to that with placebo, ipratropium, or salmeterol. Consequently, inhaled tiotropium is likely to be a valuable option for first-line, long-term maintenance therapy in the management of bronchoconstriction in patients with symptomatic COPD. Tiotropium bromide has a quaternary ammonium structure and acts as an anticholinergic bronchodilator; the active moiety is the tiotropium cation (tiotropium). A 22.5 micrograms dose of tiotropium bromide provides 18 micrograms of tiotropium. Orally inhaled tiotropium bromide antagonizes the muscarinic M(1), M(2), and M(3) receptors located in airway smooth muscle, reversing vagally mediated bronchoconstriction. Receptor binding assays and in vitro tests indicate that tiotropium bromide is kinetically selective for M(1) and M(3) receptors over the M(2) receptor, unlike ipratropium bromide, which is nonselective. Animal and in vitro studies showed that tiotropium bromide was more potent ( approximate, equals 20-fold) than ipratropium bromide in displacing [(3)H]N-methylscopolamine (NMS) from muscarinic receptors, and had a more sustained protective effect (>70% inhibition) against NMS binding. Tiotropium bromide was a more potent inhibitor of bronchial contraction than atropine ( approximate, equals 23-fold), and had a slower onset and markedly longer duration of action than atropine or an equipotent dose of ipratropium bromide. Aerosol particle penetration is improved with tiotropium, without delaying mucus clearance from the lungs. Tiotropium 4.5-36 micrograms once daily for 4 weeks increased mean trough and average FEV(1) and FVC and mean PEFR values from baseline compared with placebo, with no evidence of tachyphylaxis. Improvements in trough FEV(1) from baseline with tiotropium 4.5-36 micrograms were not dose dependent. Based on a lack of dose response, the optimal once-daily tiotropium dosage is 18 micrograms. Steady-state trough FEV(1) values are achieved within 48 hours of commencing tiotrochodilation (for >/=24 hours) and an attenuation of the nocturnal decline in FEV(1) that were unaffected by timing of the daily tiotropium dose were seen in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with stable COPD. The drug improved static and dynamic lung hyperinflation (evidenced by reduced trapped air volume and increased tidal volume and end-of-exercise inspiratory capacity), and improved exertional dyspnea (during activities of daily living and exertion) and exercise tolerance compared with placebo in randomized, double-blind studies. In patients with stable COPD, improved sleep-related oxygen desaturation that was unaffected by the timing of the daily dose was seen with tiotropium but not with placebo. Clinically significant treatment-related disorders of conduction or rhythm, or changes in heart rate were not observed with tiotropium in this patient group. Mean maximal plasma concentrations (C(max)) were observed within 5 minutes of inhalation of a single dose of tiotropium 18 micrograms in patients with COPD. Plasma drug levels declined to minimum concentrations (C(min)) within 1 hour of treatment in healthy volunteers. Mean steady-state C(max) concentrations (16 ng/L) were achieved after 2-3 weeks of once-daily inhaled tiotropium 18 micrograms in elderly patients with COPD; tiotropium does not appear to accumulate once steady-state has been achieved.The estimated absolute bioavailability of tiotropium at steady state in healthy volunteers was approximately 20-25%, and approximately 72% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. Excretion of tiotropium is predominantly renal (through active secretion by the kidneys), although in vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 (CYP) oxidation (possibly involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes) may have a minor role. In patients with COPD, renal excretion of the unchanged drug at 24 hours (Ae(24)) was approximately 7%. The mean plasma elimination half-life after single or multiple doses in healthy volunteers and elderly patients with COPD was approximately 5-6 days. The renal clearance and urinary excretion of tiotropium decrease with increasing age; however, these changes are not considered to be clinically significant. Because of altered steady-state C(max), C(min), area under the concentration-time curve, and Ae(24) values, caution is required with tiotropium administration in patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of tiotropium in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment have not been studied. Tiotropium does not interact with drugs such as cimetidine or ranitidine, which are also eliminated by active renal secretion. Orally inhaled tiotropium bromide has been evaluated as a bronchodilator for the management of patients with COPD in randomized, double-blind 6-month and 1-year trials, and in several shorter studies. In clinical trials, COPD was diagnosed according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines. The bronchodilator effect was expressed as the trough FEV(1) response (the mean change in FEV(1) from baseline measured 1 hour prior to and immediately before a scheduled dose), and was the primary endpoint in all but two clinical trials. The bronchodilator effect with tiotropium 18 micrograms once daily was superior to that with placebo in several well designed trials in patients with COPD. Moreover, greater improvements in mean peak and average FEV(1) responses occurred with tiotropium but not with placebo. Mean trough, peak, and average FVC responses, and weekly mean morning and evening PEFR values were also improved to a greater extent with tiotropium than with placebo. Tiotropium demonstrated a greater bronchodilator effect than ipratropium bromide (hereafter referred to as ipratropium when used at approved dosages) 40 micrograms four times daily in two 1-year trials in patients with COPD. Mean peak and average FEV(1), mean trough FVC responses, and weekly mean morning and evening PEFR values were also increased to a greater extent with tiotropium than with ipratropium. In one of the two 6-month trials that compared the efficacy of tiotropium with that of inhaled salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily, greater improvements from baseline in mean trough, peak, and average FEV(1) and FVC responses were seen with tiotropium than with salmeterol. Increases in weekly mean evening, but not morning, PEFR values were generally greater with tiotropium than salmeterol. In the second trial, improvement in the primary endpoint (mean trough FEV(1) response from baseline) with tiotropium or salmeterol was similar, although peak and average responses were superior with tiotropium. Preliminary results from a 6-week crossover study in patients with COPD suggested that tiotropium alone or in combination with once-daily formoterol improved mean trough and average FEV(1) and trough FVC values from baseline to a greater extent than twice-daily formoterol. More patients achieved a clinically important improvement (increase of >/=1 unit) in the transitional dyspnea index focal score (a measure of dyspnea-related impairment) with tiotropium than with placebo in the 1-year trials. Tiotropium was superior to ipratropium in 1-year trials, and was at least as effective as salmeterol in 6-month trials, in achieving a clinically important improvement in focal scores. Tiotropium recipients experienced fewer COPD exacerbations than placebo or ipratropium recipients and had fewer and shorter COPD-related hospitalizations compared with placebo recipients. Unlike salmeterol, tiotropium lengthened the time to onset of the first exacerbation and decreased the number of exacerbations compared with placebo in two 6-month trials. Similar proportions of tiotropium, salmeterol, and placebo recipients required COPD-related hospitalizations. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
CD012930,0,22316354,0,Budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler®: a review of its use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly heterogeneous, progressive inflammatory disease that imposes considerable economic and healthcare burdens on society, with the disease predicted to remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in the future. Current pharmacological treatment can improve symptoms of the disease, but not progression. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines recommend that patients with moderate COPD should use one or more long-acting bronchodilators (e.g. a long-acting β(2)-agonist) as required and, for those with severe and very severe disease who are experiencing repeated COPD exacerbations, an inhaled corticosteroid should be added as required. Budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler® (Symbicort® Turbuhaler®) is a dry powder inhaler (DPI) that combines these two classes of drugs in a single inhaler, thereby making administration easier and more convenient. Budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler® (delivered dose 320 μg/9 μg) is recommended for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second <50% of predicted value) and a history of repeated exacerbations, who have significant symptoms despite regular therapy with long-acting bronchodilators. This article reviews the pharmacological properties and clinical use of budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler® in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD. Budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler® (320 μg/9 μg twice daily) was effective and well tolerated in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD participating in large, multicentre trials of up to 12 months' duration. Budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler® improved lung function, exacerbation rates, COPD symptom scores and health status from baseline to a significantly greater extent than placebo and, in general, than the individual monotherapies in these trials. Moreover, as reflected in the faster onset of action of formoterol than salmeterol, budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler® was more effective than salmeterol/fluticasone propionate DPI at improving the patient's ability to perform morning activities in a short-term study. In the 12-week CLIMB trial, adding budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler® to inhaled tiotropium bromide therapy was significantly more effective than adding placebo to tiotropium bromide therapy. Thus, inhaled budesonide/formoterol, either alone or as add-on therapy to other medications, continues to be a useful option for the management of COPD."

Data were pooled from the aclidinium 400 μg twice-daily (BID) and placebo arms (N  =  2,521) and stratified by Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) group (A, B, C and D). Results showed that fewer patients experienced ≥1 exacerbation with aclidinium (any severity: 12.5%; moderate to severe: 10.9%) compared with placebo (any severity: 15.7%; moderate to severe: 13.3%) and the odds of experiencing ≥1 exacerbation of any severity were reduced in patients receiving aclidinium (odds ratio  =   0.78, p  =  0.039). Furthermore, aclidinium reduced the rate of exacerbations compared with placebo (any severity: rate ratio  =  0.79, p  =  0.026; moderate to severe: 0.80, p  =  0.044). The time to first exacerbation of any severity was delayed with aclidinium compared with placebo (hazard ratio  =  0.79, p  =  0.026) and there was a numerical delay in time to first moderate-to-severe exacerbation. Finally, the effects of aclidinium on exacerbations versus placebo were greater in patients in GOLD Groups B and D; however, it is of note that only 10.7% of patients were classified in Group A or C. In summary, the results indicate that aclidinium 400 μg BID reduces the frequency of COPD exacerbations compared with placebo and that these effects are greater in symptomatic patients."

Using nationwide Danish health registries, we identified all Danish adults with a prescription for long-acting bronchodilators and/or ICS from 2000 to 2016. We investigated the total use of long-acting bronchodilators and ICS, the proportion of current users and the rate of new users over time. Finally, we assessed treatment persistence. We included 23,061,681 prescriptions for long-acting bronchodilators and ICS issued to 805,860 individuals from 2000 to 2016. Over this period, the total annual amount of prescribed long-acting bronchodilators and ICS increased by 39%.

Although this class of compounds is generally considered to be safe and well tolerated in COPD patients the cardiovascular safety of tiotropium has recently been questioned. We describe a rat in vivo model that allows the concurrent assessment of muscarinic antagonist potency, bronchodilator efficacy and a potential for side effects, and we use this model to compare tiotropium with NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide), a recently approved inhaled muscarinic antagonist for COPD. Anaesthetized Brown Norway rats were dosed intratracheally at 1 or 6h prior to receiving increasing doses of intravenous methacholine. Changes in airway resistance and cardiovascular function were recorded and therapeutic indices were calculated against the ED50 values for the inhibition of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. At both time points studied, greater therapeutic indices for hypotension and bradycardia were observed with glycopyrronium (19.5 and 28.5 fold at 1h; >200 fold at 6h) than with tiotropium (1.5 and 4.2 fold at 1h; 4.6 and 5.5 fold at 6h). Pharmacokinetic, protein plasma binding and rat muscarinic receptor binding properties for both compounds were determined and used to generate an integrated model of systemic M2 muscarinic receptor occupancy, which predicted significantly higher M2 receptor blockade at ED50 doses with tiotropium than with glycopyrronium.

Indacaterol was the first agent of the novel family of very long-acting β2-agonists to be used as an inhaled bronchodilator for COPD and provides 24-hour therapeutic action, thus allowing once-daily administration. Data from clinical trials show that indacaterol has a bronchodilator effect similar to that of the anticholinergic tiotropium bromide and slightly higher efficacy compared with the long-acting β2-agonists, salmeterol and formoterol. Moreover, the safety profile is excellent and comparable with that of placebo. Concerning adherence with drug treatment and real-life management in respect to long-acting β2-agonists, once-daily dosing makes indacaterol more convenient for COPD patients and is likely to enhance patient adherence.

This review will survey the preclinical profiles of tiotropium and nine inhaled development candidates as well as literature reports of other preclinical compounds specifically designed as inhaled antimuscarinic agents for the treatment of COPD. The design strategies employed lay behind three common principles: high potency and slow reversibility at the M(3) receptor and low systemic exposure. In addition to their effectiveness as bronchodilators, the differentiation of these agents in the clinic may be linked to their potential to be utilized in combination with other therapeutics.

The primary endpoint was trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) at the end of each study's treatment period (Day 8/Day 15). A population model-based analysis using total daily UMEC dose was used for the primary analysis comparing QD and BID dosing. A physiological effect (E(max)) model was optimal in defining the relationship between UMEC dose and the primary endpoint, demonstrating a clear monotonic dose response over QD and BID dosing regimens. UMEC doses ≥62.5 mcg QD were differentiated from lower doses and BID dosing did not provide benefit over QD dosing. The potency (ED(50)) estimate was 33 mcg with QD dosing.

A long-acting beta-2 agonist, no advantages in COPD.","In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchodilator drugs have only modest symptomatic efficacy. There is no evidence that they slow disease progression. A short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol is the first-choice treatment, used either on demand or on a regular basis. Long-acting beta2 agonists are an option for patients with nocturnal symptoms. Indacaterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist that is inhaled once a day. Indacaterol has not been compared with a short-acting beta-2 agonist. Clinical evaluation is based on 4 double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials, 3 of which also included a group treated with another long-acting bronchodilator (formoterol, salmeterol or tiotropium. The symptomatic efficacy of indacaterol was only modest, and similar to that of other long-acting bronchodilators. Indacaterol has the known adverse effect profile of beta-2 agonists. Some adverse effects seem to be more frequent than with other long-acting bronchodilators, including post-inhalation cough, hyperglycaemia, respiratory tract infections, and possibly cardiac disorders. There is no evidence that once-daily inhalation has any advantages over twice-daily inhalation, even in terms of convenience. In addition, as efficacy is limited, there is a risk that patients will use the drug more frequently, resulting in additional adverse effects. The nebulizer used to inhale the powder in the capsules is similar to the one provided with Foradil (formoterol. In practice, indacaterol offers no therapeutic advantage over existing treatments for patients with COPD. It is better to use the best-documented drugs and, if necessary, to add non-drug measures. Eliminating exposure to toxic agents, especially tobacco smoke, remains the only treatment with a proven benefit on the course of COPD."

CD012930,0,24928173,0,The in vitro and in vivo profile of aclidinium bromide in comparison with glycopyrronium bromide.,"This study characterised the in vitro and in vivo profiles of two novel long-acting muscarinic antagonists, aclidinium bromide and glycopyrronium bromide, using tiotropium bromide and ipratropium bromide as comparators. All four antagonists had high affinity for the five muscarinic receptor sub-types (M1-M5); aclidinium had comparable affinity to tiotropium but higher affinity than glycopyrronium and ipratropium for all receptors. Glycopyrronium dissociated faster from recombinant M3 receptors than aclidinium and tiotropium but more slowly than ipratropium; all four compounds dissociated more rapidly from M2 receptors than from M3 receptors. In vitro, aclidinium, glycopyrronium and tiotropium had a long duration of action at native M3 receptors (>8 h versus 42 min for ipratropium). In vivo, all compounds were equi-potent at reversing acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Aclidinium, glycopyrronium and ipratropium had a faster onset of bronchodilator action than tiotropium. Aclidinium had a longer duration of action than glycopyronnium (time to 50% recovery of effect [t½ offset] = 29 h and 13 h, respectively); these compare with a t½ offset of 64 h and 8 h for tiotropium and ipratropium, respectively. Aclidinium was less potent than glycopyrronium and tiotropium at inhibiting salivation in conscious rats (dose required to produce half-maximal effect [ED50] = 38, 0.74 and 0.88 μg/kg, respectively) and was more rapidly hydrolysed in rat, guinea pig and human plasma compared with glycopyrronium or tiotropium. These results indicate that while aclidinium and glycopyrronium are both potent antagonists at muscarinic receptors with similar kinetic selectivity for M3 receptors versus M2, aclidinium has a longer dissociation half-life at M3 receptors and a longer duration of bronchodilator action in vivo than glycopyrronium. The rapid plasma hydrolysis of aclidinium, coupled to its kinetic selectivity, may confer a reduced propensity for systemic anticholinergic side effects with aclidinium versus glycopyrronium and tiotropium."
CD012930,0,23748050,0,The Novartis view on emerging drugs and novel targets for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating lung disease characterized by airflow limitation and chronic inflammation in the lungs. The mainstay of drug therapy for COPD is represented by long-acting bronchodilators, an important aspect of Novartis' development program. Novel once-daily dosing bronchodilators, such as the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) glycopyrronium and the LAMA/long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) fixed-dose combination QVA149, have been shown to provide significant benefits to patients with COPD in terms of improvement in lung function, exercise tolerance, health-related quality of life, symptoms and reduction in the rate of exacerbations. Despite the benefits provided by these new treatment options, prevention of disease progression and control of exacerbations in certain patient phenotypes remain key challenges in the treatment of COPD. In order to address these needs and gain new insights into the complexity of COPD, Novartis is, in addition to bronchodilator-only therapies, developing LABA/inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) combinations to target inflammation, such as QMF149, as well as non-steroid based anti-inflammatory agents against key novel targets. These commitments are central to the Novartis' final goal of improving the standard of care in respiratory medicine and offering a better quality of life to patients with COPD."

Indacaterol was developed using a combination of informed drug design and molecular chemistry to generate a β2-adrenergic agonist with a fast onset and long duration of action, enabling once-daily dosing with an acceptable safety profile. Early preclinical studies with indacaterol demonstrated these characteristics, and this promising molecule was taken into clinical development, originally for asthma treatment. Subsequent safety concerns over LABA monotherapy in patients with asthma redirected indacaterol's development to centre on COPD, where a good evidence base and guideline recommendations for bronchodilator monotherapy existed. Clinical development was initially complicated by different inhaler devices and differing doses of indacaterol. Using a phase III innovative adaptive-design clinical trial (INHANCE), indacaterol 150 and 300 μg once-daily doses were selected to be taken forward into the phase III INERGIZE programme. This programme delivered placebo-controlled and active-comparator data, including comparisons with formoterol, tiotropium and salmeterol/fluticasone, as well as the use of indacaterol in combination with tiotropium. Together, these studies provided a comprehensive assessment of the benefit-risk profile of indacaterol, allowing for regulatory submission.

CD012930,0,20496301,0,Mono- and combination therapy of long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids in advanced COPD.,"Beta-2 adrenergic agonists are sympathomimetic agents that stimulate bronchodilation by activation of adenyl cyclase to produce cyclic 3'5' adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) have a 3- to 6-hour duration of action, and the duration of action of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) exceeds 12 hours. Because of their rapid onset of action, SABAs are effective for rescue from symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). LABAs-salmeterol and formoterol-have been shown to significantly improve lung function, health status, and symptom reduction, compared with ipratropium. Despite safety concerns over the use of LABAs as monotherapy in asthma the use of these medications in COPD has generally been described as safe. Novel bronchodilators for COPD in late-stage development include the beta-agonists indacterol and carmoterol. Parasympathetic activity in the large and medium-size airways is mediated through the muscarinic receptors and results in airway smooth-muscle contraction, mucus secretion, and possibly increased ciliary activity. Although short-acting ipratropium has been used as monotherapy or in combination with albuterol the use of long-acting antimuscarinics is superior in improving health outcomes. The use of tiotropium results in improved health status, dyspnea, and exercise capacity, and reduced hyperinflation and COPD exacerbation rate in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Analysis of prospective clinical trial data shows a mortality reduction in subjects treated with tiotropium, despite retrospective review of insurance claims that show an enhanced mortality. Theophylline is a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that acts as both a weak bronchodilator and a respiratory stimulant. Novel approaches include using the inhalation route to reduce side effects and combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). However, because of its potential adverse effects and narrow therapeutic index, it should only be used when symptoms persist despite optimal bronchodilator therapy. Current guidelines highlight that for COPD patients uncontrolled by bronchodilator monotherapy, combination therapy is recommended. These include LABA/ICS and LAMA/LABA combinations. Bronchodilators and their combination with ICS are central to the management of COPD. The choice of agents is based primarily on disease stage, individual response, cost, side effect profile, and availability."
CD012930,0,27143870,0,Dual therapy strategies for COPD: the scientific rationale for LAMA + LABA.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure worldwide. Relaxation of airway smooth muscle with inhaled bronchodilators is the cornerstone of treatment for stable COPD, with inhaled corticosteroids reserved for those with a history of exacerbations. Tiotropium has occupied center stage in COPD treatment for over 10 years and improves lung function, quality of life, exercise endurance, and reduces the risk of COPD exacerbation. Long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) improve lung function, reduce dynamic hyperinflation, increase exercise tolerance, health-related quality of life, and reduce acute exacerbation of COPD. The combination of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and LABAs is thought to leverage different pathways to induce bronchodilation using submaximal drug doses, increasing the benefits and minimizing receptor-specific side effects. Umeclidinium/vilanterol is the first combination of LAMA/LABA to be approved for use in stable COPD in USA and Europe. Additionally, indacaterol/glycopyrronium and aclidinium/formoterol have been approved in Europe and in numerous locations outside USA. Several other agents are in the late stages of development, most of which offer once-daily dosing. The benefits of new LAMA/LABA combinations include improved pulmonary function, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life, and in some cases, reduced exacerbations. These evolving treatments will provide new opportunities and challenges in the management of COPD."

CD012930,0,15350154,0,A benefit-risk assessment of inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists in the management of obstructive pulmonary disease.,"The two inhaled long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, salmeterol and formoterol, have been studied extensively since their introduction in the early 1990s. In this review we consider the evidence for their efficacy and safety in adults with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by reviewing long-term prospective studies in which these drugs have been compared with placebo or an alternative bronchodilator. We have also assessed safety, including data from postmarketing surveillance studies and case-control studies using large databases. In patients with asthma, salmeterol and formoterol increase lung function, reduce asthmatic symptoms and improve quality of life when compared with placebo. Both drugs protect against exercise-induced asthma, although some tolerance develops with regular use. Tolerance to the bronchodilator effects of formoterol has also been seen, although this is small and most of the beneficial effects are maintained long-term. Both drugs have been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations but only in studies in which most patients were taking an inhaled corticosteroid. Adding a long-acting beta2-agonist provided better control than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid in several studies. Long-acting beta2-agonists also provide better asthma control than use of regular short-acting beta2-agonists and theophylline. Their relative efficacy compared with leukotriene antagonists is uncertain as yet. Formoterol appears to be at least as safe and effective as a short-acting beta2-agonist when used on an 'as required' basis. In patients with COPD, both salmeterol and formoterol offer improved lung function and reduced COPD symptoms compared with placebo, and quality of life has been improved in some studies. Some tolerance to the bronchodilating effect of salmeterol was seen in one study. Most studies have not found a significant reduction in exacerbations in COPD. Both drugs have provided greater benefit than ipratropium bromide or theophylline; there are limited data on tiotropium bromide. The long-acting beta2-agonists cause predictable adverse effects including headache, tremor, palpitations, muscle cramps and a fall in serum potassium concentration. Salmeterol can also cause paradoxical bronchospasm. There is some evidence that serious adverse events including dysrhythmias and life-threatening asthma episodes can occur; however, the incidence of such events is very low but may be increased in patients not taking an inhaled corticosteroid. Salmeterol 50 microg twice daily and formoterol 12 microg twice daily are effective and safe in treating patients with asthma and COPD. Higher doses cause more adverse effects, although serious adverse events are rare."

A single dose healthy volunteer study was conducted to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of inhaled umeclidinium (500 µg) and vilanterol (50 µg) when administered separately and in combination using a novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI). Co-administration of single inhaled doses of umeclidinium and vilanterol to healthy Japanese subjects was well tolerated and not associated with meaningful changes in systemic exposure or PD effects compared with administration of either compound individually. Pharmacokinetic assessments showed rapid absorption for both drugs (Tmax = 5 min for both umeclidinium and vilanterol) followed by rapid elimination with median tlast of 4-5 h for umeclidinium and median tlast of 1.5-2.0 h for vilanterol. Assessments of pharmacokinetic interaction were inconclusive since for umeclidinium, Cmax following combination was higher than umeclidinium alone but not AUC whereas for vilanterol, AUC following combination was higher than vilanterol alone but not Cmax. There were no obvious trends observed between individual maximum supine heart rate and umeclidinium Cmax or vilanterol Cmax when delivered as umeclidinium 500 µg and vilanterol 50 µg combination or when delivered as umeclidinium or vilanterol alone."
CD012930,0,26648711,0,Applying the wisdom of stepping down inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD: a proposed algorithm for clinical practice.,"Current guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) recommend limiting the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to patients with more severe disease and/or increased exacerbation risk. However, there are discrepancies between guidelines and real-life practice, as ICS are being overprescribed. In light of the increasing concerns about the clinical benefit and long-term risks associated with ICS use, therapy needs to be carefully weighed on a case-by-case basis, including in patients already on ICS. Several studies sought out to determine the effects of withdrawing ICS in patients with COPD. Early studies have deterred clinicians from reducing ICS in patients with COPD as they reported that an abrupt withdrawal of ICS precipitates exacerbations, and results in a deterioration in lung function and symptoms. However, these studies were fraught with numerous methodological limitations. Recently, two randomized controlled trials and a real-life prospective study revealed that ICS can be safely withdrawn in certain patients. Of these, the WISDOM (Withdrawal of Inhaled Steroids During Optimized Bronchodilator Management) trial was the largest and first to examine stepwise withdrawal of ICS in patients with COPD receiving maintenance therapy of long-acting bronchodilators (ie, tiotropium and salmeterol). Even with therapy being in line with the current guidelines, the findings of the WISDOM trial indicate that not all patients benefit from including ICS in their treatment regimen. Indeed, only certain COPD phenotypes seem to benefit from ICS therapy, and validated markers that predict ICS response are urgently warranted in clinical practice. Furthermore, we are now better equipped with a larger armamentarium of novel and more effective long-acting β2-agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist combinations that can be considered by clinicians to optimize bronchodilation and allow for safer ICS withdrawal. In addition to providing a review of the aforementioned, this perspective article proposes an algorithm for the stepwise withdrawal of ICS in real-life clinical practice."
CD012930,0,26789695,0,Safety of long acting muscarinic antagonists: are all these drugs always and equally safe?,"Inhaled bronchodilators - such as long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) - are central to the pharmacological management of symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. LAMAs are considered to be safe drugs at recommended dosages. In the present issue of the Journal safety of umeclidinium, a recently marketed LAMA, at twice the recommended dosage, has been evaluated with good results in a Japanese, COPD population. However, because muscarinic receptors are expressed not only in the lungs but also at the level of heart, digestive and urinary apparatus, the potential exists for LAMAs to cause adverse events related to stimulation of receptors in these organs. Head-to-head and post-marketing vigilance studies are required to determine the profile risk of these drugs, ultimately, and whether differences exist between currently available LAMAs."

CD012930,0,19436693,0,Study design considerations in a large COPD trial comparing effects of tiotropium with salmeterol on exacerbations.,"Currently available long-acting inhaled bronchodilators (tiotropium, salmeterol, formoterol) have demonstrated beneficial effects on exacerbations in placebo-controlled trials. However, there have been no direct comparisons of these drugs with exacerbations as the primary outcome and consequently COPD treatment guidelines do not indicate a preference for either bronchodilator. Therefore, an international, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group clinical trial has been designed to investigate the comparative efficacy of 2 long-acting bronchodilators tiotropium 18 microg daily and salmeterol 50 microg bid on exacerbations. The trial will include at least 6800 randomized patients with diagnosis of COPD, >or= 10 pack-year history of smoking, post-bronchodilator FEV(1) <or= 70% predicted, and a history of exacerbations in the previous year. The primary endpoint is time to first COPD exacerbation. Secondary endpoints include number of exacerbations and time to premature discontinuation of trial medication. The trial has been designed to address several of the challenges in studying exacerbations in a controlled trial by a symptom and event-based definition of exacerbations, frequent follow-up contacts, selection of time to first event as the primary endpoint and using exposure adjusted analysis when examining number of events. Other challenges in designing exacerbation trials such as differential discontinuation and follow-up of discontinued patients are discussed."
CD012930,0,23553509,0,Aclidinium bromide twice daily for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review.,"The inhaled, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, aclidinium bromide, was indicated in July 2012 in Europe and the USA for the maintenance of bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. Although initially investigated as a once-daily agent, a lower than expected improvement in trough forced expiratory volume over 1 s prompted re-evaluation as a twice-daily (b.i.d.) regimen. The dose approved for use in Europe, 400 μg b.i.d., achieved statistically significant improvements in lung function, reductions in breathlessness, and improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for up to 24 weeks of treatment in the pivotal phase 3 trials (AClidinium in Chronic Obstructive Respiratory Disease I [ACCORD COPD I] [12 weeks] and Aclidinium To Treat Airway obstruction In COPD patieNts [ATTAIN] [24 weeks]). These improvements were sustained during maintenance therapy of up to 52 weeks. Pooled data from the ATTAIN and ACCORD studies (both included a placebo arm) showed that exacerbation frequency was significantly reduced, although neither study was prospectively designed to evaluate this endpoint. Pharmacological and preclinical studies demonstrated the low systemic bioavailability of aclidinium and the low propensity to induce cardiac arrhythmias. The good tolerability of aclidinium was confirmed in the phase 3 program up to 52 weeks of treatment. The adverse event (AE) profile of the approved dose, 400 μg b.i.d., was similar to that of placebo, with a low incidence of anticholinergic and cardiac AEs. Aclidinium is delivered via the Genuair(®) multidose dry powder inhaler (Almirall Sofotec GmBH, Bad Homburg, Germany). The device is simple to use with multiple feedback mechanisms ensuring consistent dose delivery. In summary, aclidinium 400 μg b.i.d. is effective for the treatment of patients with COPD, offering improvements in lung function, breathlessness, and HRQoL, with a good safety profile and a low incidence of anticholinergic and cardiac AEs."

Tiotropium, the first LAMA available for use in COPD, has been shown to be an effective bronchodilator and is generally safe and well tolerated. However, tiotropium has limitations that include a high incidence of dry mouth, slow onset of action and, in some studies, a part of the patient population did not achieve clinically significant bronchodilation. It also remains unclear whether tiotropium reduces progressive deterioration of lung function in patients with COPD. An ideal LAMA would provide clinically meaningful bronchodilation, deliver symptom relief, prevent disease progression, improve exercise tolerance and health status, prevent and treat complications and exacerbations and reduce mortality risk. A 24-h duration of action, rapid onset of action and a good safety and tolerability profile are also desirable. The once-daily LAMA, NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide), may meet some of these characteristics. NVA237 has high selectivity for the muscarinic type-3 (M(3)) receptor which might potentially result in a higher therapeutic index than tiotropium, which is less selective for M(3). Phase II studies showed that NVA237 once daily provides clinically significant 24-h bronchodilation with a rapid onset of action and a favourable safety and tolerability profile. Phase III studies are ongoing that will assess the long-term safety and efficacy of NVA237."
