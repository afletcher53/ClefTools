CD011420,0,17460055,0,"Three-year longitudinal study of genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Tuscany, Italy.","The genetic diversity of 829 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated during a 3-year period in Tuscany, Italy, a country with a low prevalence of tuberculosis, from 480 Italian-born and 349 foreign-born patients was determined by spoligotyping. The predominant spoligotype families were T (30.2% of isolates), Haarlem (19.9%), and the Latino-American and Mediterranean family (LAM) (11.2%); the remaining isolates were distributed among the Beijing (6.5%), S (4.2%), East Africa-India (EAI) (3.0%), Bovis (2.3%), Central Asia (CAS) (2.1%), Africanum (1.3%), and X (1.2%) families or were undefined (2.7%) or orphan (14.1%) isolates. Isolates of the families T, Haarlem, Bovis, and X were distributed among Italian- and foreign-born patients almost proportionally to the patients' numbers. Isolates of the LAM family were prevalent in foreign-born people (13.5%, versus 9.6% in Italian-born patients). Isolates of the S family were found almost exclusively in Italian-born patients, while strains of families EAI and CAS were isolated almost exclusively from foreign-born patients; Africanum isolates were all from African-born patients. The isolates of the Beijing family showed a trend to a steady increase during the survey. The prevalence of Beijing strains was 11.7% among foreign-born people and 2.7% among Italian-born patients. The Beijing strains were typed by the standardized IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism assay, which yielded a total of 38 distinct IS6110 patterns; 21 isolates (39.6%) occurred in six distinct clusters; of these, three contained two isolates and the other three contained four, five and six isolates, thus demonstrating that Beijing strains caused several tuberculosis outbreaks in the region. These findings indicate that transmission of Beijing strains between immigrants and the autochthonous population has occurred frequently and suggests an ongoing active transmission of the Beijing genotype in the region."

CD011420,0,16011144,0,Influence of the washing buffer composition on the sensitivity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using mycobacterial glycolipids as capture antigens.,"Immunogenic glycolipids from the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are potential capture antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the serodiagnostis of tuberculosis. Typically, washing steps in ELISAs are performed with buffers containing a detergent. However, Tween-20, the most commonly added detergent, was reported to be able to remove the coating of certain glycolipid antigens from microtitre wells. In order to determine the influence of the washing buffer composition on the results, we measured serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) against three mycobacterial glycolipids by ELISA, conducting three separate experiments with three different buffers: Tris-buffered saline (TBS), TBS plus 0.02% Tween-20 (TBS-Tween), or TBS plus 0.3% bovine serum albumin (TBS-BSA). The capture antigens applied were lipoarabinomannan with the basic arabinose-containing motif (AraLAM), the mannose-capped version of lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), and trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate (cord factor). All ELISAs achieved acceptable specificities around 95%. The sensitivities, however, varied widely, depending upon the sort of washing buffer used. In 38 patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis and control groups of 79 patients with non-tuberculosis lung disease and 92 healthy volunteers, the anti-cord factor ELISA achieved 100%, 31.6%, and 60.5% with TBS, TBS-Tween, and TBS-BSA, respectively. Corresponding sensitivity values for AraLAM were 39.5%, 26.3%, and 23.7%, and for ManLAM 94.7%, 65.8%, and 55.3%. We conclude that Tween-20 or BSA should be omitted from the washing buffer in ELISAs, when the capture antigen is of lipid nature."

The tuberculin skin test (TST) is inaccurate because of the high incidence of anergy in skin testing in HD patients and its inability to differentiate latent from eradicated TB infection. In this study, use of serum antilipoarabinomannan (anti-LAM) antibody detection for the diagnosis of latent TB in a dialysis population was evaluated."

CD011420,0,16034117,0,Mycobacterium tuberculosis regulates CD1 antigen presentation pathways through TLR-2.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a major pathogen of worldwide importance, which releases lipid Ags that are presented to human T cells during the course of tuberculosis infections. Here we report that cellular infection with live M. tuberculosis or exposure to mycobacterial cell wall products converted CD1- myeloid precursors into competent APCs that expressed group 1 CD1 proteins (CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c). The appearance of group 1 CD1 proteins at the surface of infected or activated cells occurred via transcriptional regulation, and new CD1 protein synthesis and was accompanied by down-regulation of CD1d transcripts and protein. Isolation of CD1-inducing factors from M. tuberculosis using normal phase chromatography, as well as the use of purified natural and synthetic compounds, showed that this process involved polar lipids that signaled through TLR-2, and we found that TLR-2 was necessary for the up-regulation of CD1 protein expression. Thus, mycobacterial cell wall lipids provide two distinct signals for the activation of lipid-reactive T cells: lipid Ags that activate T cell receptors and lipid adjuvants that activate APCs through TLR-2. These dual activation signals may represent a system for selectively promoting the presentation of exogenous foreign lipids by those myeloid APCs, which come into direct contact with pathogens."

CD011420,0,7767101,0,[The possibilities for improving the serological diagnosis of active tuberculosis by using new mycobacterial antigens and immunoblot and ELISA technics].,"The study concerns 264 cases among which: 119 active lung tb. eliminating and 11 cases not-eliminating M. Tuberculosis; 17 cases of extrarespiratory tb. confirmed by bacteriology and/or by anatomopathology; 18 cases of bone-joint non-tb disease; 38 cases of chronic lung disease other than tb; 61 healthy persons (controls). Sera from these cases were collected before treatment and submitted concomitantly to two different methods: (1) Mycodot test (immunoblot) with lipoarabinomannan (LAM) as antigen, on nitrocellulose discs (Dynagen, Cambridge, MA, USA); (2) ELISA test with antigen 60 (A60) (ANDA-Biologicals, Strasbourg, France) and with antigen I.C. (Cantacuzino Institute, Bucharest). The results were estimated on terms of sensitivity and specificity. As for sensitivity the results show 74-90%. the highest values were reached in ELISA with A60 IgA. The specificity of the Mycodot test was highest: 90-100% in the two successive experiments. The active tb diagnosis discrimination capacity of the studied methods allows the following classification: 1. Mycodot test with LAM antigen 2. ELISA with A60-Ig G complex 3. ELISA with I.C. antigen The Mycodot test is more advantageous being more rapid and more simple to perform."
CD011420,0,1371954,0,Specific inhibition of mRNA accumulation for lymphokines in human T cell line Jurkat by mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan antigen.,"The immunomodulatory effect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived lipoarabinomannan (LAM) on mitogen/antigen-induced expression of mRNAs for a number of cytokines in human monocytic cell line Mono-Mac-6 and in T cell line Jurkat was investigated. Interestingly, LAM exhibited a down-regulatory effect on the accumulation of mRNAs for IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) in T cells co-stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin-P (PHA) and 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristyl-13-acetate (PMA). In human Mono-Mac-6 cells. LAM has a weak inhibitory effect on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA accumulation for IL-1 beta, a slight stimulatory effect on mRNAs accumulation for IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but clearly no effect on mRNA accumulation for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). These findings imply that LAM may contribute to the immunologic defects associated with a number of mycobacterial infections by modulating these mediators."
CD011420,0,11677227,0,The role of the embA and embB gene products in the biosynthesis of the terminal hexaarabinofuranosyl motif of Mycobacterium smegmatis arabinogalactan.,"The emb genes are conserved among different mycobacteria. In Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, they belong to an operon comprising three genes, embC, embA, and embB. The EmbB protein has been proposed to be the target of ethambutol, a drug which is known to inhibit the synthesis of the arabinan portion of the mycobacterial cell wall arabinogalactan (AG). To further define the role of EmbB protein in arabinan biosynthesis, embA, -B, and -C genes were inactivated individually by homologous recombination in M. smegmatis. All three mutants were viable, and among the three, the slowest growing embB(-) mutant encountered profound morphological changes and exhibited a higher sensitivity to hydrophobic drugs and detergents, presumably due to an increase in cell wall permeability. Furthermore, chemical analyses showed that there was a diminution in the arabinose content of arabinogalactan from the embA(-) and embB(-) mutants. Specifically, in comparison with the wild-type strain, the crucial terminal hexaarabinofuranosyl motif, which is a template for mycolylation, was altered in both embA(-) and embB(-) mutants. Detailed nuclear magnetic resonance studies coupled with enzyme digestion, chromatography, and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the disaccharide beta-d-Ara(f)-(1-->2)-alpha-d-Ara(f) extension from the 3-position of the 3,5-linked alpha-d-Ara(f) residue is markedly diminished. As a consequence, a linear terminal beta-d-Ara(f)-(1-->2)-alpha-d-Ara(f)-(1-->5)-alpha-d-Ara(f)-(1-->5)-alpha-d-Ara(f) is formed, a motif which is a recognized, nonreducing terminal feature of lipoarabinomannan but not of normal AG. Upon complementation with the embB and embA wild-type genes, the phenotype of the mutants reverted to wild-type, in that normal AG was resynthesized. Our results clearly show that both EmbA and EmbB proteins are involved in the formation of the proper terminal hexaarabinofuranoside motif in AG, thus paving the way for future studies to identify the complete array of arabinosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of mycobacterial cell wall arabinan."

CD011420,0,12522045,0,Specificity and diversity of antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis arabinomannan.,"Arabinomannan (AM) is a polysaccharide antigen of the mycobacterial capsule. However, it is uncertain whether AM constitutes an immunologically distinct fraction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this study, we analyzed the repertoire and specificity of antibodies to AM by using AM-binding murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and human serum samples. Murine MAbs were found to be diverse in their specificity to AM and cross-reactivity with other arabinose-containing mycobacterial polysaccharides, with MAb 9d8 binding exclusively to AM. Human antibodies to AM were detected in serum samples from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), as well as in those from healthy, purified protein derivative-negative controls, with significantly higher titers among patients. The binding of human antibodies to AM was inhibited by MAb 9d8 in three patients with TB but not in controls. MAb 5c11, which recognizes other mycobacterial arabinose-containing carbohydrates in addition to AM, inhibited the binding of serum samples from 75% of patients and 76% of controls. Analysis of human antibodies with murine MAbs to human V(H) determinants demonstrated diversity among antibodies to AM with qualitative and quantitative differences compared with antibodies to lipoarabinomannan. In summary, our study suggests that antibodies to AM are diverse and heterogeneous with respect to antigen recognition and V(H) determinant expression, with human serum samples containing different subsets of antibodies to AM with the specificities of AM-binding murine MAbs. One MAb and a subset of human antibodies bind AM specifically, suggesting that this polysaccharide is antigenically distinct and is expressed in human infection."
CD011420,0,22507872,0,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis ManLAM inhibits T-cell-receptor signaling by interference with ZAP-70, Lck and LAT phosphorylation.","Immune evasion is required for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survive in the face of robust CD4(+) T cell responses. We have shown previously that M. tuberculosis cell wall glycolipids, including mannose capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), directly inhibit polyclonal murine CD4(+) T cell activation by blocking ZAP-70 phosphorylation. We extended these studies to antigen-specific murine CD4(+) T cells and primary human T cells and found that ManLAM inhibited them as well. Lck and LAT phosphorylation also were inhibited by ManLAM without affecting their localization to lipid rafts. Inhibition of proximal TCR signaling was temperature sensitive, suggesting that ManLAM insertion into T cell membranes was required. Thus, M. tuberculosis ManLAM inhibits antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell activation by interfering with very early events in TCR signaling through ManLAM's insertion in T cell membranes."

CD011420,0,23190246,0,"Point-of-care diagnosis of tuberculosis: past, present and future.","Diagnosis represents only one aspect of tuberculosis (TB) control but is perhaps one of the most challenging. The drawbacks of current tools highlight several unmet needs in TB diagnosis, that is, necessity for accuracy, rapidity of diagnosis, affordability, simplicity and the ability to generate same-day results at point-of-care (POC). When a return visit is required to access test results, time to treatment is prolonged, and default rates are significant. However, a good diagnostic tool is also critically dependent on obtaining an adequate biological sample. Here, we review the accuracy and potential impact of established and newer potential POC diagnostic tests for TB, including smear microscopy, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid) and the Determine TB lipoarabinomannan antigen test (Alere). Novel experimental approaches and detection technologies for POC diagnosis of active TB, including nucleic acid amplification tests, detection of volatile organic compounds or metabolites, mass spectroscopy, microfluidics, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, electrochemical approaches, and aptamers among others, are discussed. We also discuss future applications, including the potential POC diagnosis of drug-resistant TB and presumed latent TB infection. Challenges to the development and roll-out of POC tests for TB are also reviewed."
CD011420,0,11964144,0,Characterization of a putative alpha-mannosyltransferase involved in phosphatidylinositol trimannoside biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs), lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) are an important class of bacterial factors termed modulins that are found in tuberculosis and leprosy. Although their structures are well established, little is known with respect to the molecular aspects of the biosynthetic machinery involved in the synthesis of these glycolipids. On the basis of sequence similarity to other glycosyltransferases and our previous studies defining an alpha-mannosyltransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, named PimB [Schaeffer, Khoo, Besra, Chatterjee, Brennan, Belisle and Inamine (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 31625-31631], which catalysed the formation of triacyl (Ac(3))-PIM(2) (i.e. the dimannoside), we have identified a related gene from M. tuberculosis CDC1551, now designated pimC. The use of a cell-free assay containing GDP-[(14)C]mannose, amphomycin and membranes from Myobacterium smegmatis overexpressing PimC led to the synthesis of a new alkali-labile PIM product. Fast-atom-bombardment MS established the identity of the new enzymically synthesized product as Ac(3)PIM(3) (i.e. the trimannoside). The results indicate that pimC encodes an alpha-mannosyltransferase involved in Ac(3)PIM(3) biosynthesis. However, inactivation of pimC in Myobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) did not affect the production of higher PIMs, LM and LAM when compared with wild-type M. bovis BCG, suggesting the existence of redundant gene(s) or an alternate pathway that may compensate for this PimC deficiency. Further analyses, which compared the distribution of pimC in a panel of M. tuberculosis strains, revealed that pimC was present in only 22% of the clinical isolates examined."
CD011420,0,22710249,1,Rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis biomarkers in a sandwich immunoassay format using a waveguide-based optical biosensor.,"Early diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) remains an elusive challenge, especially in individuals with disseminated TB and HIV co-infection. Recent studies have shown a promise for the direct detection of pathogen-specific biomarkers such as lipoarabinomannan (LAM) for the diagnosis of TB in HIV-positive individuals. Currently, traditional immunoassay platforms that suffer from poor sensitivity and high non-specific interactions are used for the detection of such biomarkers. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the development of sandwich immunoassays for the direct detection of three TB-specific biomarkers, namely LAM, early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT6) and antigen 85 complex (Ag85), using a waveguide-based optical biosensor platform. Combining detection within the evanescent field of a planar optical waveguide with functional surfaces that reduce non-specific interactions allows for the ultra-sensitive and quantitative detection of biomarkers (an order of magnitude enhanced sensitivity, as compared to plate-based ELISA) in complex patient samples (urine, serum) within a short time. We also demonstrate the detection of LAM in urine from a small sample of subjects being treated for TB using this approach with excellent sensitivity and 100% corroboration with disease status. These results suggest that pathogen-specific biomarkers can be applied for the rapid and effective diagnosis of disease. It is likely that detection of a combination of biomarkers offers greater reliability of diagnosis, rather than detection of any single pathogen biomarker. NCT00341601."
CD011420,0,25674511,0,Clinical utility of anti-lipoarabinomannan antibodies testing for the diagnosis of tuberculous arthritis.,"Diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is often challenging. In this work we discuss the utility of an assay for Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antibody detection in synovial fluid. LAM is one of the three major groups of lipopolysaccharides within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) cell wall. An ELISA based test was used to investigate the presence of antibodies against LAM in an immunocompetent patient with knee arthritis. The symptoms resolved after isoniazid treatment. LAM positivity has been used as a diagnostic tool for TB in different settings, including veterinary field. The test could be of some value to diagnose tuberculous arthritis in selected patients when gold standard test returned negative although further investigations are welcome."
CD011420,0,12922145,0,Mycobacterium tuberculosis arabinomannan-protein conjugates protect against tuberculosis.,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a major structural surface component of mycobacteria. Arabinomannan (AM) oligosaccharides derived from LAM of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv were isolated and covalently conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) or to short-term culture filtrate proteins (antigen 85B (Ag85B) or a 75kDa protein) from M. tuberculosis strain Harlingen. The different AM oligosaccharide (AMOs)-protein conjugate vaccine candidates proved to be highly immunogenic, inducing boosterable IgG responses against the AMOs portion of the conjugates in rabbits and guinea-pigs. Proliferation of T-cells from C57BL/6 mice immunized with the conjugates was seen upon in vitro stimulation with PPD. In C57BL/6 mice subcutaneous immunization with the AMOs-antigen 85B conjugate in alum provided significant protection compared to sham (alum only) immunized mice (P < 0.021) as estimated by long term survival against intravenous challenge with 10(5) M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Subcutaneous immunization followed by nasal boost with an AMOs-TT conjugate in Eurocine L3 adjuvant provided high (P < 0.025) protection as determined by long term survival after intranasal challenge with 10(5) virulent M. tuberculosis strain Harlingen. This level of protection was comparable to that obtained with the conventional live attenuated BCG vaccine. In guinea-pigs, immunization with AMOs-Ag85B in Eurocine L3 adjuvant followed by aerogenic challenge with M. tuberculosis H37Rv resulted in increased survival and reduced pathology in lungs and spleens relative to non-immunized animals."
CD011420,0,25176311,0,Dectin-2 is a direct receptor for mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan of mycobacteria.,"Mycobacteria possess various immunomodulatory molecules on the cell wall. Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (Man-LAM), a major lipoglycan of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has long been known to have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on host immunity. However, the direct Man-LAM receptor that explains its pleiotropic activities has not been clearly identified. Here, we report that a C-type lectin receptor Dectin-2 (gene symbol Clec4n) is a direct receptor for Man-LAM. Man-LAM activated bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to produce pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas it was completely abrogated in Clec4n(-/-) BMDCs. Man-LAM promoted antigen-specific T cell responses through Dectin-2 on DCs. Furthermore, Man-LAM induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) as an adjuvant in mice, whereas Clec4n(-/-) mice were resistant. Upon mycobacterial infection, Clec4n(-/-) mice showed augmented lung pathology. These results demonstrate that Dectin-2 contributes to host immunity against mycobacterial infection through the recognition of Man-LAM."

CD011420,0,16569358,0,Serological markers of pulmonary tuberculosis and of response to anti-tuberculosis treatment in a patient population in Guinea.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate serological correlates of active tuberculosis and of response to antituberculosis treatment in a cohort of HIV-negative patients with pulmonary tuberculosis studied at diagnosis and during treatment at the Service de Pneumo-Phtisiologie, Centre Hospitalier-Universitaire Ignace Deen, Conakry, Republic of Guinea. Two similar cohorts of HIV-negative healthy households of patients and healthy community controls were included in the study. Plasma samples were obtained from 168 untreated tuberculosis patients, 167 healthy household controls, and 168 healthy community controls. Serial plasma samples were also obtained from the tuberculosis patients at 2 and 8 months after initiation of chemotherapy. IgG antibody levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using ten purified M. tuberculosis antigens. ELISA results were analysed by comparing geometric means of data. Of the ten antigens tested, five (14kDa Ag, 19kDa Ag, AlaDH, MS, and MPT83) elicited similar antibody responses in untreated TB patients and controls. In contrast, levels of three antibodies (ESAT-6, LAM, and 38kDa Ag) were higher in untreated TB patients than in household or community controls (p<0.0001). Levels were higher in untreated patients than in community controls also for the anti-Rv2626c antibody (p = 0.0001) and, at a lower significance level, for the anti-FdxA antibody (p<0.025). Antibody levels against ESAT-6 and Rv2626c decreased during therapy, while antibody levels to the 38 kDa antigen and LAM increased during therapy; FdxA antibody levels did not vary with treatment. Neither severity of presentation nor chest X-ray patterns affected levels of these antibodies before treatment. In contrast, after the 8-month therapeutic course, patients who presented with moderate/severe disease had higher levels of anti-ESAT-6, anti-FdxA, and anti-38kDa antibodies than those of patients with mild disease onset. Patients with bilateral lung lesions had significantly higher anti-38kDa and anti-LAM levels, both at diagnosis and after 8-month treatment, than patients with lesions involving only one lung. Antibodies to alanine dehydrogenase and malate synthetase measured at initiation of treatment were higher in tuberculosis patients who subsequently failed therapy than in those who were cured. The main conclusions of the study are: a) plasma levels of antibodies to a number of M. tuberculosis represent serological correlates of active disease; b) these correlates are affected in an antigen-specific fashion by anti-tuberculosis treatment; c) particular serological markers may be predictive of treatment outcome."
CD011420,0,7910594,0,Mycobacterium tuberculosis alters expression of adhesion molecules on monocytic cells.,"The host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is characterized by interactions between mononuclear cells, with recruitment and fusion of these cells culminating in granuloma formation. In addition, the host response to M. tuberculosis requires CD4+ T-cell reactivity, mediated by antigen-independent as well as antigen-dependent mechanisms. Thus, we hypothesized that cell adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1; CD54) would participate in the response to infection with M. tuberculosis. Exposure of THP-1 cells derived from a monocyte/macrophage cell line to M. tuberculosis (1:1 bacterium/cell ratio) elicited a sustained increase (660% +/- 49% above resting level) in the expression of ICAM-1 that continued for at least 72 h. Neither the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1; CD106) nor that of the integrins lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) or CR3 (CD11b/CD18) was increased to a similar extent at corresponding time points. The increase in ICAM-1 protein expression was accompanied by an increase in steady-state mRNA (Northern [RNA] analysis). Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha but not interleukin 1 alpha or interleukin 1 beta substantially abrogated the response to M. tuberculosis consistent with a paracrine or autocrine response. Continuous upregulation of the expression of ICAM-1 on mononuclear phagocytes induced by M. tuberculosis may mediate the recruitment of monocytes and enhance the antigen presentation of M. tuberculosis, thus permitting the generation and maintenance of the host response."
CD011420,0,21742243,0,[New tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis].,"Over the last decade, molecular biology techniques for identifying mycobacteria in pulmonary secretions have become more and more sensitive and rapid, even in smear negative samples. Nuclear amplification techniques also allow the rapid detection of resistance to first or second line anti-tuberculous drugs. The sensitivity of these techniques for non respiratory samples is yet to be determined. The diagnosis of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) has also increased in sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value through the use of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), which are tending to replace the tuberculin skin test, except for children aged under five. These tests, however, do have limitations which are important for the clinician; especially their inability to distinguish active from latent tuberculosis and their inability, in most circumstances, to exclude a diagnosis of active TB."
CD011420,0,17085575,0,"Glycosylation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain Pa5196 type IV pilins with mycobacterium-like alpha-1,5-linked d-Araf oligosaccharides.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium that uses polar type IV pili for adherence to various materials and for rapid colonization of surfaces via twitching motility. Within the P. aeruginosa species, five distinct alleles encoding variants of the structural subunit PilA varying in amino acid sequence, length, and presence of posttranslational modifications have been identified. In this work, a combination of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to identify a novel glycan modification on the pilins of the group IV strain Pa5196. Group IV pilins continued to be modified in a lipopolysaccharide (wbpM) mutant of Pa5196, showing that, unlike group I strains, the pilins of group IV are not modified with the O-antigen unit of the background strain. Instead, the pilin glycan was determined to be an unusual homo-oligomer of alpha-1,5-linked d-arabinofuranose (d-Araf). This sugar is uncommon in prokaryotes, occurring mainly in the cell wall arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) polymers of mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. Antibodies raised against M. tuberculosis LAM specifically identified the glycosylated pilins from Pa5196, confirming that the glycan is antigenically, as well as chemically, identical to those of Mycobacterium. P. aeruginosa Pa5196, a rapidly growing strain of low virulence that expresses large amounts of glycosylated type IV pilins on its surface, represents a genetically tractable model system for elucidation of alternate pathways for biosynthesis of d-Araf and its polymerization into mycobacterium-like alpha-1,5-linked oligosaccharides."
CD011420,0,18056384,0,Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens specifically modulate CCR2 and MCP-1/CCL2 on lymphoid cells from human pulmonary hilar lymph nodes.,"Macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Such a response, although extensively studied using animal models and cells from human blood, has not been characterized in cells from pulmonary hilar lymph nodes (PHLN). We characterized populations of myeloid APC from PHLN and determined their expression of CCR2, CCR5, CCR7, CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86 as well as the cytokine/chemokine microenvironment before and after purified protein derivative (PPD) and mannosilated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) stimulation. Results show that there are at least three APC populations in PHLN, defined as CD14highHLA-DRlow/-, CD14dimHLA-DRdim, and CD14-HLA-DRhigh/dendritic cells (DC), with the largest number represented by CD14dimHLA-DRdim cells (where dim indicates intermediate levels). CD14-HLA-DRhigh/DC expressed higher levels of costimulatory molecules and lower levels of CCR2 and CCR5, but all cell populations showed similar CCR7 levels. PPD and ManLAM specifically down-regulated CCR2 expression but not that of CCR5 and CCR7, and such down-regulation was observed on all APC populations. Mtb Ag did not affect the expression of costimulatory molecules. PPD but not ManLAM specifically induced MCP-1/CCL2 production, which was likely associated with the induction of IFN-gamma because this cytokine was highly induced by PPD. We characterized, for the first time, different APC from human PHLN and show that Mtb Ag exert fine and specific regulation of molecules closely associated with the immune response to Mtb infection. Because knowledge of this response in secondary lymphoid tissues is still poorly understood in humans, such studies are necessary and important for a better understanding of lymphoid cell microenvironment and migrating capacities and their role in the immunopathogenesis of tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,9553708,0,The immunological response of llamas (Lama glama) following experimental infection with Mycobacterium bovis.,"Llamas were experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis in order to evaluate the axillary skin test and the ELISA as diagnostic procedures for tuberculosis in llamas (Lama glama). Six llamas were given a single intratracheal challenge with 1 of 2 doses of a recent field isolate of M. bovis and 2 llamas were left as noninfected controls. This resulted in a progressive disease in some animals with 1 mortality as early as 68 d post-infection (PI). The tuberculin skin test, at the axillary site, was positive in 4 of 5 infected llamas at 80 d PI. At 143 d PI, all 3 surviving lamas were positive, including the one which had not responded at 80 d PI. The application of skin and serological tests throughout the course of this experiment adds support for the need to further evaluate the skin test and its anamnestic effect on serodiagnosis since serological responses were generally not observed in the absence of skin testing or antibiotic treatment. The wide variation in M. bovis antigens recognized by the serological response would indicate that a diagnostic panel should include multiple antigens such as MPB70 and lipoarabinomannan (LAM). While skin testing or serology alone may be of limited value to diagnose tuberculosis in llamas, together they may offer an enhanced potential for immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis."

As a result of a high intrinsic tolerance of the etiological agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, towards most antibiotics and xenobiotics, the search for such new compounds is far from trivial. Further exacerbated by the rapid generation and spread of drug resistant M. tuberculosis and fuelled by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, halting the tuberculosis epidemic is of paramount importance. As part of our program to design new 2-aza-anthraquinones with anti-mycobacterial activity, various dialkyltetrahydrobenzo[g]pyrimido[4,5-c]isoquinolinetetraones were designed and synthesised. The compounds were submitted to a biological evaluation in which the activity against M.tb H37Rv(lux) was observed, as well as the acute toxicity towards J774 A.1 macrophages. From these results, the selectivity index was calculated. Furthermore, the activity of the most promising compounds was further studied against a multi-drug resistant LAM-1 strain and against intracellular replicating M.tb. The study was further extended with a comet assay and a VITOTOX™ assay to investigate the possibility of observable genotoxic effects caused by these compounds."
CD011420,0,17446277,0,A peptide mimetic of the mycobacterial mannosylated lipoarabinomannan: characterization and potential applications.,"Mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), a complex lipoglycan, is a major component of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of tuberculosis (TB), and is an antigen used for serological diagnosis of TB. Screening random phage-display peptide libraries with anti-ManLAM mAb CS40 for peptide epitope mimics (mimotopes) led to the isolation of a panel of peptides. One of these peptides (B11) was characterized as a ManLAM mimotope: it bound the anti-ManLAM CS40 mAb and competed with ManLAM for antibody binding. Mice immunized with keyhole limpet haemocyanin-conjugated B11 peptide in a proper adjuvant developed antibodies that recognized ManLAM. Competition experiments demonstrated that the B11 peptide inhibited binding of mAb CS40 to ManLAM in a concentration-dependent manner. The data indicated that the affinity of CS40 mAb to B11 (K(D) 1.33 x 10(-8)) is higher than its affinity to ManLAM (K(D) 3.00 x 10(-7)). The sera of TB patients, as well as the sera of mice experimentally infected with M. tuberculosis, contained significant levels of antibodies that recognized both the B11 peptide and ManLAM. The specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA B11-based test were similar to those of the ELISA ManLAM-based test, indicating that the B11 antigen could be a good substitute for ManLAM serology for the diagnosis of TB."

CD011420,0,23147148,0,Tuberculosis in a southern Brazilian prison.,"The occurrence of tuberculosis (TB) in prisons has been described as an alarming public health problem in many countries, especially in developing nations. The objective of this study was to conduct a survey among prisoners with TB respiratory symptoms in order to estimate the incidence of the disease, to analyze the drug susceptibility profile and genotype the isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the city of Charqueadas, southern of Brazil. The TB incidence was 55/1,900 inhabitants in the prison; this corresponds to an incidence of 3,789/100,000 inhabitants, with a prevalence of 72/1,900 (4,960/100,000 inhabitants). Drug susceptibility test was performed and, among the analyzed isolates, 85% were susceptible to all drugs tested and 15% were resistant to at least one drug, of which 89% were resistant only to isoniazid (INH) or in combination with another drug. The genotype classification of spoligotyping analysis showed that 40% of the isolates belong to LAM family, 22% to T family, 17.5% to Haarlem family, 12.5% to U family and 3% to X family. The shared international spoligotypes most frequently found were 729 (27%), 50 (9.5%), 42 (8%), 53 (8%) and 863 (8%). In conclusion, it was observed that TB in this specific population had been caused, mostly, by strains that have been transmitted in the last few years, as demonstrated by the large level of genotype clustering. In addition, it was found specific large clusters, which were not often found in the general population from the same period and in the same region."

CD011420,0,19651855,0,Role of phosphatidylinositol mannosides in the interaction between mycobacteria and DC-SIGN.,"The C-type lectin dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is the major receptor on DCs for mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Recently, we have shown that although the mannose caps of the mycobacterial surface glycolipid lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) are essential for the binding to DC-SIGN, genetic removal of these caps did not diminish the interaction of whole mycobacteria with DC-SIGN and DCs. Here we investigated the role of the structurally related glycolipids phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) as possible ligands for DC-SIGN. In a binding assay with both synthetic and natural PIMs, DC-SIGN exhibited a high affinity for hexamannosylated PIM(6), which contains terminal alpha(1-->2)-linked mannosyl residues identical to the mannose cap on ManLAM, but not for di- and tetramannosylated PIM(2) and PIM(4), respectively. To determine the role of PIM(6) in the binding of whole mycobacteria to DC-SIGN, a mutant strain of M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin deficient in the production of PIM(6) (Delta pimE) was created, as well as a double knockout deficient in the production of both PIM(6) and the mannose caps on LAM (Delta pimE Delta capA). Compared to the wild-type strain, both mutant strains bound similarly well to DC-SIGN and DCs. Furthermore, the wild-type and mutant strains induced comparable levels of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12p40 when used to stimulate DCs. Hence, we conclude that, like ManLAM, PIM(6) represents a bona fide DC-SIGN ligand but that other, as-yet-unknown, ligands dominate in the interaction between mycobacteria and DCs."
CD011420,0,19651854,0,Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall glycolipids directly inhibit CD4+ T-cell activation by interfering with proximal T-cell-receptor signaling.,"Immune evasion is required for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survive in the face of robust adaptive CD4(+) T-cell responses. We have previously shown that M. tuberculosis can indirectly inhibit CD4(+) T cells by suppressing the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen-presenting cell function of macrophages. This study was undertaken to determine if M. tuberculosis could directly inhibit CD4(+) T-cell activation. Murine CD4(+) T cells were purified from spleens by negative immunoaffinity selection followed by flow sorting. Purified CD4(+) T cells were activated for 16 to 48 h with CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibodies in the presence or absence of M. tuberculosis and its subcellular fractions. CD4(+) T-cell activation was measured by interleukin 2 production, proliferation, and expression of activation markers, all of which were decreased in the presence of M. tuberculosis. Fractionation identified that M. tuberculosis cell wall glycolipids, specifically, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan, were potent inhibitors. Glycolipid-mediated inhibition was not dependent on Toll-like receptor signaling and could be bypassed through stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. ZAP-70 phosphorylation was decreased in the presence of M. tuberculosis glycolipids, indicating that M. tuberculosis glycolipids directly inhibited CD4(+) T-cell activation by interfering with proximal T-cell-receptor signaling."

CD011420,0,9316929,0,Detection of lipoarabinomannan antibodies in patients with newly acquired tuberculosis and patients with relapse tuberculosis.,"A commercially available dot immunoassay that employs the lipoarabinomannan antigen was evaluated for the serologic diagnosis of tuberculosis. The test showed a high specificity (100%); however, its sensitivity was low (18.5%). Antibodies to lipoarabinomannan were detected in the sera of 7 of 71 patients with newly acquired tuberculosis and in sera of 10 of 21 patients with relapse tuberculosis. It has been shown by others that sera from patients with relapse tuberculosis had a higher concentration of antibodies and reacted with a greater variety of antigens (native culture filtrates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv) than did sera from patients with newly acquired tuberculosis. Our data confirm the results of these previous studies as far as lipoarabinomannan is concerned. We conclude that the differences in the production of antibodies shown by the two groups of tuberculous patients (new and relapse) must be taken into account when assessing the usefulness of serologic tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,12071842,0,Lipid-restricted recognition of mycobacterial lipoglycans by human pulmonary surfactant protein A: a surface-plasmon-resonance study.,"The human pulmonary surfactant protein A (hSP-A), a member of the mammalian collectin family, is thought to play a key defensive role against airborne invading pulmonary pathogens, among which is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the aetiologic agent of tuberculosis. hSP-A has been shown to promote the uptake and the phagocytosis of pathogenic bacilli through the recognition and the binding of carbohydrate motifs on the invading pathogen surface. Recently we identified lipomannan and mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), two major mycobacterial cell-wall lipoglycans, as potential ligands for binding of hSP-A. We demonstrated that both the terminal mannose residues and the fatty acids are critical for binding, whereas the inner arabinosyl and mannosyl domains do not participate. In the present study we developed a surface-plasmon-resonance assay to analyse the molecular basis for the recognition of ManLAM by hSP-A and to try to define further the role of the lipidic aglycone moiety. Binding of ManLAM to immobilized hSP-A was consistent with the simplest one-to-one interaction model involving a single class of carbohydrate-binding site. This observation strongly suggests that the lipid moiety of ManLAM does not directly interact with hSP-A, but is rather responsible for the macromolecular organization of the lipoglycan, which may be necessary for efficient recognition of the terminal mannosyl epitopes. The indirect, structural role of the lipoglycan lipidic component is further supported by the complete lack of interaction with hSP-A in the presence of a low concentration of mild detergent."

Recent studies indicate that a lipoarabinomannan (LAM) assay (Clearview-TB(R)-ELISA) may have some utility for the diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected patients; however, the precise subgroup that may benefit from this technology requires clarification. The utility of LAM in sputum samples has, hitherto, not been evaluated."
CD011420,0,10337017,0,Use of a whole blood assay to evaluate in vitro T cell responses to new leprosy skin test antigens in leprosy patients and healthy subjects.,"Development of an immunological tool to detect infection with Mycobacterium leprae would greatly benefit leprosy control programmes, as demonstrated by the contribution of the tuberculin test to tuberculosis control. In a new approach to develop a 'tuberculin-like' reagent for use in leprosy, two new fractions of M. leprae depleted of cross-reactive and immunomodulatory lipids- MLSA-LAM (cytosol-derived) and MLCwA (cell wall-derived)-have been produced in a form suitable for use as skin test reagents. T cell responses (interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lymphoproliferation) to these two new fractions were evaluated in a leprosy-endemic area of Nepal using a simple in vitro whole blood test. The two fractions were shown to be highly potent T cell antigens in subjects exposed to M. leprae-paucibacillary leprosy patients and household contacts. Responses to the fractions decreased towards the lepromatous pole of leprosy. Endemic control subjects also showed high responses to the fractions, indicating high exposure to M. leprae, or cross-reactive mycobacterial antigens, in this Nepali population. The new fractions, depleted of lipids and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) gave enhanced responses compared with a standard M. leprae sonicate. The cell wall fraction appeared a more potent antigen than the cytosol fraction, which may be due to the predominance of the 65-kD GroEL antigen in the cell wall. The whole blood assay proved a robust field tool and a useful way of evaluating such reagents prior to clinical trials."
CD011420,0,1462120,0,"Induction of cellular immune reactions by A36, an antigen complex of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis: comparison of A36 and johnin components.","Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) is a chronic enteritis syndrome of ruminants, which is due to infection by Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. Cutaneous testing with proteins extracted from a mycobacterial culture fluid (johnin-PPD) is currently used to evaluate the cellular immune status. We have compared the components of johnin-PPD with those of the A36 complex, a thermostable macromolecular antigen (TMA) present in the cytoplasm and associated with the cell wall of M. paratuberculosis. The presence in the johnin-PPD of fifteen A36 components has been shown by Western blotting. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies, which bind respectively to the 65-kDa M. leprae heat shock protein, the 28-kDa M. leprae superoxide dismutase, and M. tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan, recognized components of the johnin-PPD. The ability of A36 to trigger delayed hypersensitivity reactions in sensitized rabbits, and to induce the proliferation of T lymphocytes from the lymph nodes of A36-sensitized mice, matched that of johnin-PPD. The homology levels of T epitopes between A36 and the TMA complexes of M. phlei, M. bovis, M. tuberculosis and M. avium were estimated, in a lymphoproliferation assay, to be 51, 52, 59 and 94% respectively. A strong cross-reactivity of A36 with an M. leprae sonicate was also observed by cutaneous testing. The A36 components within the 45.2-26.8-kDa and the 21.6-19.8-kDa ranges were proved to induce the proliferation of T lymphocytes from sensitized mice. This work supports the possible use of the A36 complex, and of some of its components, for cutaneous tests and lymphocyte proliferation assays, in order to monitor cellular immunity in Johne's disease."
CD011420,0,7863264,0,Composition and immunoreactivity of the A60 complex and other cell fractions from Mycobacterium bovis BCG.,"Surface static cultures of Mycobacterium bovis BCG contained cells embedded in an extracellular matrix, whose mechanical removal yielded free cells that were pressure disrupted and fractionated into cytoplasm and walls. Cell envelopes were either mechanically disrupted or extracted with detergents. Intracellular and extracellular fractions were analysed for proteins, polysaccharides, and antigen 6O (A60), a major complex immunodominant in tuberculosis. A60 was present in extracellular matrix, cytoplasm and walls: it represented a substantial portion of the proteins and polysaccharides of these fractions. While the protein/polysaccharide ratio varied according to the origin of A60 preparations, the electrophoretic patterns of A60 proteins (which accounted for the immunogenicity of the complex) remained unchanged. Western blots pointed to the proteins present within the 29-45 kDa range as the A60 components endowed with the highest immunogenicity level. Since the most heavily stained protein bands in SDS-PAGE patterns were located outside the region best recognized by antisera, a striking discordance was found between concentration and immunogenicity patterns of A60 proteins. The electrophoretic patterns of A60- and non-A60-proteins from cytoplasm were also different. A60 complexes in dot blots and some electrophoresed A60 proteins reacted with monoclonal antibodies directed against lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a highly immunogenic polymer of cell envelope. This contaminating compound was removed from A60 with organic solvents and detergents. SDS-PAGE and Western blot patterns of proteins from delipidated A60 were similar to those of native A60 proteins."

CD011420,0,9233632,0,Differential induction of apoptosis by virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis in resistant and susceptible murine macrophages: role of nitric oxide and mycobacterial products.,"Resistance and susceptibility of macrophages to mycobacteria are under the control of the Bcg/Nramp1 gene, which also controls the NO- production in response to macrophage activators. There is recent evidence indicating that mycobacteria induces apoptosis in infected macrophages. Using murine macrophage lines, congenic at the Bcg/Nramp1 gene, this report shows that B10R are more prone than B10S macrophages to undergo apoptosis after exposure to live virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) or PPD, as determined by cell viability, DNA fragmentation, hypoploidy, and the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling assay. Induction of apoptosis correlated with NO- production. Aminoguanidine and anti-TNF-alpha inhibited NO- production and apoptosis. B10R and B10S macrophages were equally affected by sodium nitroprusside, a donor of NO-, but its effect, mainly in B10R cells, was enhanced by the presence of Mtb. Nonvirulent mycobacteria induced lower levels of NO- and did not cause cell death. Killed Mtb, mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), and LPS rescued macrophages from apoptosis albeit induce NO-. These findings suggest the existence of opposite pathways: metabolically active mycobacteria promotes apoptosis whereas their structural components inhibit it. Apoptosis may be a critical mechanism by which Nramp1 gene controls the macrophage infection with virulent mycobacteria."

CD011420,0,11489920,0,Role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Rab5 effectors in phagosomal biogenesis and mycobacterial phagosome maturation arrest.,"Phagosomal biogenesis is a fundamental biological process of particular significance for the function of phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells. The precise mechanisms governing maturation of phagosomes into phagolysosomes are not completely understood. Here, we applied the property of pathogenic mycobacteria to cause phagosome maturation arrest in infected macrophages as a tool to dissect critical steps in phagosomal biogenesis. We report the requirement for 3-phosphoinositides and acquisition of Rab5 effector early endosome autoantigen (EEA1) as essential molecular events necessary for phagosomal maturation. Unlike the model phagosomes containing latex beads, which transiently recruited EEA1, mycobacterial phagosomes excluded this regulator of vesicular trafficking that controls membrane tethering and fusion processes within the endosomal pathway and is recruited to endosomal membranes via binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns[3]P). Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3'(OH)-kinase (PI-3K) activity diminished EEA1 recruitment to newly formed latex bead phagosomes and blocked phagosomal acquisition of late endocytic properties, indicating that generation of PtdIns(3)P plays a role in phagosomal maturation. Microinjection into macrophages of antibodies against EEA1 and the PI-3K hVPS34 reduced acquisition of late endocytic markers by latex bead phagosomes, demonstrating an essential role of these Rab5 effectors in phagosomal biogenesis. The mechanism of EEA1 exclusion from mycobacterial phagosomes was investigated using mycobacterial products. Coating of latex beads with the major mycobacterial cell envelope glycosylated phosphatidylinositol lipoarabinomannan isolated from the virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, inhibited recruitment of EEA1 to latex bead phagosomes, and diminished their maturation. These findings define the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and EEA1 recruitment as: (a) important regulatory events in phagosomal maturation and (b) critical molecular targets affected by M. tuberculosis. This study also identifies mycobacterial phosphoinositides as products with specialized toxic properties, interfering with discrete trafficking stages in phagosomal maturation."

CD011420,0,22362849,1,Diagnostic accuracy of a urine lipoarabinomannan strip-test for TB detection in HIV-infected hospitalised patients.,"Lack of point-of-care tests for tuberculosis (TB) result in diagnostic delay, and increased mortality and healthcare-related costs. The urine Determine(TM) TB-LAM point-of-care strip-test was evaluated in 335 prospectively-recruited hospitalised patients with suspected TB-HIV co-infection (group 1) and from 88 HIV-infected hospitalised patients with non-TB diagnoses (group 2). Cut-off point-specific analyses were performed using: 1) a microbiological reference standard (culture positive versus negative); and 2) a composite reference standard (exclusion of patients with clinical-TB from the culture-negative group). Using the microbiological reference and the manufacturer-recommended grade-1 cut-off point, LAM sensitivity and specificity was 66% (95% CI 57-74%). By contrast, using the composite reference sensitivity was 60% (95% CI 53-67%) and specificity improved to 96% (95% CI 89-100%) (p=0.001). The same pattern was seen when the grade-2 cut-off point was used (specificity 75% versus 96%; p=0.01). In group two patients specificity was poor using the grade-1 cut-off point, but improved significantly when the grade-2 cut-off point was used (90% versus 99%; p=0.009). The grade-2 cut-off point also offered superior inter-reader reliability (p=0.002). Sensitivity was highest in those with a CD4 <200 cells per mL. LAM combined with smear-microscopy was able to rule-in TB in 71% of Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture-positive patients. This preliminary study indicates that the LAM strip-test may be a potentially useful rapid rule-in test for TB in hospitalised patients with advanced immunosuppression. The grade 2, but not the manufacturer-recommended grade 1 cut-off point, offered superior rule-in utility and inter-reader reliability. Larger studies to evaluate cut-off points and diagnostic accuracy are urgently required."

CD011420,0,9545696,0,[Usefulness of MycoDot test for the detection of anti-mycobacterial antibodies as an aid in the diagnosis of experimental Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex infections in mice].,"The MycoDot is a new diagnostic kit for tuberculosis which was devised by DynaGen Inc., USA. The MycoDot test is based on the detection of anti-mycobacterial antibodies in the serum samples of patients by employing plastic combs coated with lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen which is a highly immunogenic lipopolysaccharide presenting in the cell wall of all species of mycobacteria. It has been reported that healthy infected and BCG-vaccinated individuals do not react to the MycoDot test, while a positive reaction occurs in patients with active tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteriosis with good sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of MycoDot test for the detection of anti-LAM antibodies in sera of mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. avium complex (MAC). By using the MycoDot test, anti-LAM antibodies were positive in 2 out of 4 mice infected with M. tuberculosis 2 weeks before, while all of M. intracellulare-infected mice were negative at the same phase of infection. On the other hand, anti-mycobacterial (MB) antibodies were detected in the serum samples of mice infected with M. intracellulare as well as M. tuberculosis by home-made ELISA testing using whole cells of test mycobacteria as antigen. In the next experiment, mice were infected with M. avium. All the serum samples of mice obtained at 13 weeks after infection were negative for anti-LAM antibodies in MycoDot test, whereas they reacted positively to anti-MB antibodies in ELISA test. These results indicate that the MycoDot test is capable of detecting M. tuberculosis infection but not MAC infection induced in mice."
CD011420,0,16540297,0,Level of antibodies against mycobacterial glycolipid in the effusion for diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion.,"Diagnosing tuberculous pleural effusion (pTB) is often difficult because the culturing of tubercle bacilli results in a negative test in the majority of cases. Serological tests for the detection of antibodies to tuberculous glycolipid (TBGL) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) have been introduced for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. We examined the levels of these antibodies, adenosine deaminase (ADA) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the pleural effusion and compared their diagnostic values in pTB."
CD011420,0,1624801,0,Cytokine production induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan. Relationship to chemical structure.,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a major cell wall component of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, exhibits a wide spectrum of immunoregulatory effects. To identify cytokines produced by human PBMC in response to LAM, we used PCR amplification to detect cytokine mRNA. LAM-induced transcription of mRNA for cytokines characteristically produced by macrophages, including TNF, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. In contrast, LAM did not induce transcription of mRNA for cytokines produced predominantly by lymphocytes, such as lymphotoxin, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, or IL-4. Measurement of concentrations of TNF, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-4 in cell culture supernatants indicated that cytokine release correlated with mRNA patterns. Lipomannan (LM) and phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIM) are simpler versions of LAM. LM lacks arabinan, whereas PIM lacks both arabinan and most mannan residues. LAM, LM, and PIM induced transcription of cytokine mRNA, elicited cytokine production, and suppressed Ag-induced T cell proliferation, indicating that most of the biologic activity of LAM was associated with the phosphatidylinositol end of the molecule. In support of this conclusion, deacylation of LAM abrogated its capacity to induce cytokine production and suppress Ag-induced proliferation. The production of macrophage-derived cytokines induced by LAM may mediate clinical manifestations of tuberculosis such as fever, weight loss, and tissue necrosis, as well as immunoregulatory effects such as inhibition of Ag-induced proliferation and hyperglobulinemia."
CD011420,0,21383969,0,The C-terminal domain of the Arabinosyltransferase Mycobacterium tuberculosis EmbC is a lectin-like carbohydrate binding module.,"The D-arabinan-containing polymers arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) are essential components of the unique cell envelope of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Biosynthesis of AG and LAM involves a series of membrane-embedded arabinofuranosyl (Araf) transferases whose structures are largely uncharacterised, despite the fact that several of them are pharmacological targets of ethambutol, a frontline drug in tuberculosis therapy. Herein, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of the ethambutol-sensitive Araf transferase M. tuberculosis EmbC, which is essential for LAM synthesis. The structure of the C-terminal domain of EmbC (EmbC(CT)) encompasses two sub-domains of different folds, of which subdomain II shows distinct similarity to lectin-like carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM). Co-crystallisation with a cell wall-derived di-arabinoside acceptor analogue and structural comparison with ligand-bound CBMs suggest that EmbC(CT) contains two separate carbohydrate binding sites, associated with subdomains I and II, respectively. Single-residue substitution of conserved tryptophan residues (Trp868, Trp985) at these respective sites inhibited EmbC-catalysed extension of LAM. The same substitutions differentially abrogated binding of di- and penta-arabinofuranoside acceptor analogues to EmbC(CT), linking the loss of activity to compromised acceptor substrate binding, indicating the presence of two separate carbohydrate binding sites, and demonstrating that subdomain II indeed functions as a carbohydrate-binding module. This work provides the first step towards unravelling the structure and function of a GT-C-type glycosyltransferase that is essential in M. tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,9008280,0,Human humoral responses to antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: immunodominance of high-molecular-mass antigens.,"The selection of antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for most studies of humoral responses in tuberculosis patients has been restricted to molecules that were either immunodominant in immunized animals or amenable to biochemical purification rather than those that were reactive with the human immune system. Delineation of antigens that elicit humoral responses during the natural course of disease progression in humans has been hindered by the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to conserved regions on ubiquitous prokaryotic antigens in sera from healthy individuals and tuberculosis patients. The levels of cross-reactive antibodies in the sera were reduced by preadsorption with Escherichia coli lysates, prior to studying their reactivity against a large panel of M. tuberculosis antigens to which the human immune system may be exposed during natural infection and disease. Thus, reactivity against pools of secreted, cellular, and cell wall-associated antigens of M. tuberculosis was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Initial results suggested that the secreted protein preparation contained antigens most frequently recognized by the humoral responses of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The culture filtrate proteins were subsequently size fractionated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, characterized by reaction with murine monoclonal antibodies to known antigens of M. tuberculosis by an ELISA, and assessed for reactivity with tuberculous and nontuberculous sera. Results show that a secreted antigen of 88 kDa elicits a strong antibody response in a high percentage of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. This and other antigens identified on the basis of their reactivity with patient sera may prove useful for developing serodiagnosis for tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,8260665,0,Diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis by detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies to purified protein derivative and lipoarabinomannan antigen in cerebrospinal fluid.,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of immunoglobulin G (IgG) activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sera was conducted prospectively in 27 patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) by using purified protein derivative (PPD) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigens, from January 1989 to August 1990. 29 patients with aseptic meningitis and 49 patients with non-inflammatory neurological illnesses served as controls. All patients had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head before a lumbar puncture. The IgG antibodies to the antigens were significantly elevated in TBM, and the reactivity was more frequently positive in the CSF than in the sera, suggesting a local synthesis of IgG in the central nervous system (CNS). The sensitivity and the specificity for the diagnosis of TBM were 59.2% and 93.9% for PPD antigen, and 85.2% and 95.9% for LAM antigen, respectively. Assay of IgG reactivity to LAM antigen was clinically very useful for the early diagnosis of TBM and was superior to PPD for detecting the serological evidence of TBM."
CD011420,0,9780265,0,Enhanced responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens by human alveolar lymphocytes during active pulmonary tuberculosis.,"Responses to mycobacterial and nonmycobacterial antigens were examined in bronchoalveolar cells (BAC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (n=16) and healthy subjects (n=23). DNA synthesis in BAC (but not PBMC) from tuberculosis patients was significantly increased in response to the mycobacterial antigens purified protein derivative (PPD), antigen 85, and mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan but not to nonmycobacterial antigens. The response to PPD was also increased in enriched alveolar lymphocytes from tuberculosis patients (P<.05). The frequency of interferon-gamma but not interleukin-4- or -10-producing cells by ELISAspot was increased in PPD-stimulated BAC from patients with tuberculosis (P<.05). Accessory function of alveolar macrophages for T lymphocyte responses was similar and suppressive activity was variably decreased in tuberculosis patients. Thus, there is compartmentalization of mycobacterial antigen-specific lymphocytes to the lungs during active tuberculosis that on challenge produce a Th1-type cytokine host response."

It has been questioned if infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) affect assay specificity. We set forth to investigate if the test detects LAM in urine from a Danish cystic fibrosis (CF) population characterized by a high NTM prevalence and negligible TB exposure.
CD011420,0,24448419,0,Biological evaluation of diazene derivatives as anti-tubercular compounds.,"Despite efforts made in chemotherapeutic research in the past and present, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the etiological agent of tuberculosis, still causes more than a million deadly casualties each year, second only to HIV. The rapid generation and spread of drug resistant strains, a problem exacerbated by co-infection with HIV demands further efforts in the investigation of novel classes of anti-tubercular compounds. A library of eight substituted diazenecarboxamides, three carbamoyldiazenecarboxylates and four diazene-1,2-dicarboxamides was synthesized in a straightforward manner followed by a biological evaluation of the compounds. We observed minimal inhibitory concentrations below 10 μg/mL against the H37Rv lab strain of M.tb. Three compounds that showed a potency of 90% growth inhibition of M.tb at a concentration lower than 10 μg/mL were further evaluated and showed potency against other clinically relevant mycobacterial species such as Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium ulcerans. The selected compounds were examined for acute cell toxicity on a murine macrophage like monocyte cell line J774 A.1 in which the cell viability was reduced by 50% at concentrations ranging from 7.4 μg/mL to 20.7 μg/mL. Neither of the three compounds showed signs of genotoxicity by VITOTOX or by Comet assay. The study was complemented by demonstration of the inhibition of intracellular replication of M.tb H37Rv inside J774 A.1 cells at 2 μg/mL concentration and the susceptibility of a MDR LAM-1 strain at concentrations between 5 and 1 μg/mL of the most active compound."
CD011420,0,1287946,0,"Does antibody to mycobacterial antigens, including lipoarabinomannan, limit dissemination in childhood tuberculosis?","Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G responses to a variety of mycobacterial antigens were measured in children from the UK, in children with tuberculosis from Hyderabad, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh, classified according to whether the disease was disseminated or localized, and in non-tuberculous controls. Anti-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) IgG responses in UK children showed a marked trough between 6 months and 3 years coincident with the reported peak incidence of disseminated tuberculosis. Geometric mean IgG responses to sonicates of slow-growing mycobacteria (rich in LAM) in 36 children with disseminated tuberculosis were markedly lower than in 99 children with localized tuberculous lesions (for Mycobacterium scrofulaceum P < 0.01, for M. tuberculosis P < 0.01, and for M. vaccae P < 0.01). Responses to purified LAM were also lower in the disseminated tuberculosis group (P < 0.05) but there was no difference between the groups in their response to mycobacterial 65 kDa protein. Multiple regression analysis showed that the reduced response to sonicated mycobacterial antigens and to LAM in children with disseminated disease was independent of age, nutritional status, skin test reactivity, duration of previous symptoms, and city of origin. There was no evidence for sequestration of antibody to immune complexes. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that children with low levels of antibody to sonicated mycobacterial antigen and to LAM, or those who cannot mount an antibody response, are predisposed to dissemination. A role for antibody in preventing disseminated forms of tuberculosis in childhood has implications for the development of improved vaccines and for the optimum timing of vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin."
CD011420,0,19049470,0,Chemical synthesis of all phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) glycans from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and problems with the BCG tuberculosis vaccine to protect humans against TB have prompted investigations into alternative approaches to combat this disease by exploring novel bacterial drug targets and vaccines. Phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) are biologically important glycoconjugates and represent common essential precursors of more complex mycobacterial cell wall glycolipids including lipomannan (LM), lipoarabinomannan (LAM), and mannan capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM). Synthetic PIMs constitute important biochemical tools to elucidate the biosynthesis of this class of molecules, to reveal PIM interactions with host cells, and to investigate the function of PIMs as potential antigens and/or adjuvants for vaccine development. Here, we report the efficient synthesis of all PIMs including phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylinositol mono- to hexa-mannoside (PIM1 to PIM6). Robust synthetic protocols were developed for utilizing bicyclic and tricyclic orthoesters as well as mannosyl phosphates as glycosylating agents. Each synthetic PIM was equipped with a thiol-linker for immobilization on surfaces and carrier proteins for biological and immunological studies. The synthetic PIMs were immobilized on microarray slides to elucidate differences in binding to the dendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) receptor. Synthetic PIMs served as immune stimulators during immunization experiments in C57BL/6 mice when coupled to the model antigen keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH)."
CD011420,0,11295196,1,Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis by detection of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan in urine.,"There is an urgent need for improved tools for laboratory diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB). Here, we describe two methods, a catch-up ELISA and a dipstick test based on the detection in urine of lipoarabinomannan (LAM). LAM is a major and specific glycolipid component of the outer mycobacterial cell wall. Preliminary experiments showed that LAM is excreted in the urine of mice injected intraperitoneally with a crude cell wall preparation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Both methods were highly sensitive, detecting LAM at concentrations of 1 ng/ml and 5 pg/ml, respectively. Of 15 patients with active TB, all showed intermediate to high levels of LAM in their urine (absorbance values from 0.3 to 1.2, mean 0.74). Only one sample showed an absorbance value below the chosen cut off value of 0.4. All but one of the urine samples from 26 healthy nursing workers exhibited OD value below 0.4 cut off. These methods may prove valuable for rapid and simple diagnosis of TB in particular in developing countries lacking biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities."
CD011420,0,9009287,0,Analysis of culture filtrate and cell wall-associated antigens of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis with monoclonal antibodies.,"Proteins secreted by Mycobacterium species have been suggested as major immune targets in the early phase of infection. In this study, we sought to identify specific antigens in culture filtrates and in soluble cell extracts of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. The release of antigens into the culture medium during growth of the bacilli and the distribution of specific epitopes within the Mycobacterium species were investigated by immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against M. paratuberculosis antigens. MAb B6A interacted with a cellular antigen with an apparent molecular mass of 34.5 kDa in lysates of M. paratuberculosis. MAb B6A did not interact with lysates from any other mycobacterial species, suggesting recognition of an M. paratuberculosis species-specific epitope. MAb FL1-A1 reacted with an antigen of 44.3 kDa in M. paratuberculosis and a 9-kDa antigen in Mycobacterium kansasii. MAb PII-B1 reacted with concanavalin A (ConA)-binding cellular and filtrate molecules of M. paratuberculosis and with lysates of Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium avium 18. The affinity-purified glycosylated antigens migrated as a diffuse band of between 35 and 45.6 kDa and reacted strongly with ovine and bovine paratuberculosis serum and polyclonal serum against M. tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan antigens. These glycoconjugates were the earliest antigens detected in culture filtrates of M. paratuberculosis. Deglycosylation of the ConA-binding molecules with alpha-mannosidase enzyme abolished the reaction with MAb PII-B1 and with bovine but not ovine paratuberculosis serum, suggesting selective immunogenicity in the different animal species."

CD011420,0,11931640,0,"Ppm1, a novel polyprenol monophosphomannose synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","Dolichol monophosphomannose (DPM) is an ever-present donor of mannose (Man) in various eukaryotic glycosylation processes. Intriguingly, the related polyprenol monophosphomannose (PPM) is involved in the biosynthesis of lipomannan and lipoarabinomanan, key bacterial factors termed modulins that are found in mycobacteria. Based on similarities to known DPM synthases, we have identified and characterized the PPM synthase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, now termed Mt-Ppm1. In the present study, we demonstrate that Mt-Ppm1 possesses an unusual two-domain architecture, by which the second domain is sufficient for PPM synthesis. However, when overexpressed separately in mycobacteria, domain 1 of Mt-Ppm1 appears to increase the synthesis of PPM. Interestingly, other mycobacteria such as M. smegmatis, M. avium and M. leprae produce two distinct proteins, which are similar to the two domains found in Mt-Ppm1. Using an in vitro assay, we also demonstrate that Mt-Ppm1 transfers Man from GDP-Man to a structurally diverse range of lipid monophosphate acceptors. The identification of the PPM synthase as a key enzyme in lipoarabinomannan biosynthesis now provides an attractive candidate for gene disruption to generate mutants for subsequent immunological studies. PPM synthase can also be exploited as a target for specific inhibitors of M. tuberculosis."

CD011420,0,12595462,0,Role of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and kappaB cis-regulatory elements on the IRF-1 and iNOS promoter regions in mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan induction of nitric oxide.,"Nitric oxide (NO(.)) produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an important host defense molecule against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mononuclear phagocytes. The objective of this study was to determine the role of the IkappaBalpha kinase-nuclear factor kappaB (IKK-NF-kappaB) signaling pathway in the induction of iNOS and NO(.) by a mycobacterial cell wall lipoglycan known as mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) in mouse macrophages costimulated with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). NF-kappaB was activated by ManLAM as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, by immunofluorescence of translocated NF-kappaB in intact cells, and by a reporter gene driven by four NF-kappaB-binding elements. Transduction of an IkappaBalpha mutant (Ser32/36Ala) significantly inhibited NO(.) expression induced by IFN-gamma plus ManLAM. An activated SCF complex, a heterotetramer (Skp1, Cul-1, beta-TrCP [F-box protein], and ROC1) involved with ubiquitination, is also required for iNOS-NO(.) induction. Two NF-kappaB-binding sites (kappaBI and kappaBII) present on the 5'-flanking region of the iNOS promoter bound ManLAM-induced NF-kappaB similarly. By use of reporter constructs in which one or both sites are mutated, both NF-kappaB-binding positions were essential in iNOS induction by IFN-gamma plus ManLAM. IFN-gamma-induced activation of the IRF-1 transcriptional complex is a necessary component in host defense against tuberculosis. Although the 5'-flanking region of the IRF-1 promoter contains an NF-kappaB-binding site and ManLAM-induced NF-kappaB also binds to this site, ManLAM was unable to induce IRF-1 expression. The influence of mitogen-activated protein kinases on IFN-gamma plus ManLAM induction of iNOS-NO(.) is not due to any effects on ManLAM induction of NF-kappaB."

CD011420,0,19559650,0,Development and evaluation of a novel multiple-antigen ELISA for serodiagnosis of tuberculosis.,"In this study, we describe the development and evaluation of a novel multiple-antigen ELISA for rapid diagnosis and screening of active tuberculosis (TB). The humoral immune responses of 136 active TB patients and 57 healthy subjects against antigens Rv3425, 38kDa and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv were examined by ELISA. Three essential results were obtained. (i) Rv3425 antigen is a potential candidate for serodiagnosis of active TB. Of 136 active TB patients, Rv3425 antigen provided a sensitivity of 31.6%, lower than that of LAM antigen, but higher than that of 38kDa antigen, with an overall specificity of 100%. (ii) For 62 smear-negative pulmonary TB patients and 15 extra-pulmonary TB patients, the multiple-antigen test provided a sensitivity of 43.5% and 26.7%, respectively, representing an improvement over acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear-based diagnosis. (iii) Compared with the single-antigen ELISA and the two available commercial kits, the multiple-antigen test offered the highest accuracy (71.0%). In conclusion, the multiple-antigen ELSIA test based on Rv3425, 38kDa, and LAM antigens is a potentially useful tool for the serodiagnosis and screening of active TB. Combinations of Rv3425 with other mycobacterial antigens may also be worthy of further investigation."
CD011420,0,7496934,0,Immunological analysis of the components of the antigen complex A60 of Mycobacterium bovis BCG.,"The antigen complex of A60 of Mycobacterium bovis BCG was analyzed by different immunological techniques to assess its relevance to tuberculosis and the involvement of its components in the immune reactions elicited in humans by tuberculous infection. A60 is composed of about 30 components, of which 8 were identified by available monoclonal antibodies (lipoarabinomannan, a glycolipid, and proteins of 65, 40, 38, 35, 19, and 14 kDa). The majority (87.5%) of anti-mycobacterial antibodies in sera from tuberculosis patients was directed against A60. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis indicated that the majority of the highly antigenic proteins present in mycobacterial homogenates were components of the A60 complex. A small percentage (7.8%) of A60 epitopes proved to be species specific. Thus, A60 proteins of 66, 41, 38, 37, 35, 34, 32, and 22 kDa were found to contain B-cell epitopes specific for M. bovis and not shared by Mycobacterium leprae oR Mycobacterium avium."

This study examined when this rise occurred, whether there was recognition of new antigen binding sites (epitopes) on the same or different antigens, and how long specific antibody persisted. Forty patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis provided serum before and during treatment. Antibody levels were measured using a monoclonal antibody competition assay to epitopes restricted to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for lipoarabinomannan. Significant increases in antibody levels were apparent after 7 days of treatment. Five samples (12.5%) had positive titers to all epitopes at the start of treatment, and this increased to 23 (58%) during treatment. Antibody to epitopes with the poorest sensitivity (the TB23 epitope of the 19-kDa antigen and the TB78 epitope of hsp65) showed the greatest increases after treatment. Antibody to these two epitopes was also absent in some patients with relapsed tuberculosis until after treatment. Antibody titers showed a biphasic response, with a fall at 2 to 3 months of treatment. Sera from two patients showed changes in the affinity of epitope-specific antibody during treatment, whereas the majority did not. Those infected with isoniazid-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis showed a late rise in antibody. Antibody to the TB68 epitope of the 16-kDa alpha-crystallin homolog was short-lived, but it recurred with bacteriological relapse during treatment. Positive antibody titers persisted for at least 3 to 18 months after treatment. Diagnostic tests for tuberculosis should be evaluated using only pretreatment sera. Delayed antigenic recognition could be due to active suppression and/or failure to engage internal antigens of M. tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,19654261,0,"AftD, a novel essential arabinofuranosyltransferase from mycobacteria.","Arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) are the two major cell wall (lipo)polysaccharides of mycobacteria. They share arabinan chains made of linear segments of alpha-1,5-linked D-Araf residues with some alpha-1,3-branching, the biosynthesis of which offers opportunities for new chemotherapeutics. In search of the missing arabinofuranosyltransferases (AraTs) responsible for the formation of the arabinan domains of AG and LAM in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we identified Rv0236c (AftD) as a putative membrane-associated polyprenyl-dependent glycosyltransferase. AftD is 1400 amino acid-long, making it the largest predicted glycosyltransferase of its class in the M. tuberculosis genome. Assays using cell-free extracts from recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis and Corynebacterium glutamicum strains expressing different levels of aftD indicated that this gene encodes a functional AraT with alpha-1,3-branching activity on linear alpha-1,5-linked neoglycolipid acceptors in vitro. The disruption of aftD in M. smegmatis resulted in cell death and a decrease in its activity caused defects in cell division, reduced growth, alteration of colonial morphology, and accumulation of trehalose dimycolates in the cell envelope. Overexpression of aftD in M. smegmatis, in contrast, induced the accumulation of two arabinosylated compounds with carbohydrate backbones reminiscent of that of LAM and a degree of arabinosylation dependent on aftD expression levels. Altogether, our results thus indicate that AftD is an essential AraT involved in the synthesis of the arabinan domain of major mycobacterial cell envelope (lipo)polysaccharides."
CD011420,0,17709420,0,Mycobacterium tuberculosis-induced gamma interferon production by natural killer cells requires cross talk with antigen-presenting cells involving Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 and the mannose receptor in tuberculous pleurisy.,"Tuberculous pleurisy allows the study of human cells at the site of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In this study, we found that among pleural fluid (PF) lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells are a major source of early gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) upon M. tuberculosis stimulation, leading us to investigate the mechanisms and molecules involved in this process. We show that the whole bacterium is the best inducer of IFN-gamma, although a high-molecular-weight fraction of culture filtrate proteins from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and the whole-cell lysate also induce its expression. The mannose receptor seems to mediate the inhibitory effect of mannosylated lipoarabinomannan, and Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 agonists activate NK cells but do not induce IFN-gamma like M. tuberculosis does. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) and NK cells bind M. tuberculosis, and although interleukin-12 is required, it is not sufficient to induce IFN-gamma expression, indicating that NK cell-APC contact takes place. Indeed, major histocompatibility complex class I, adhesion, and costimulatory molecules as well as NK receptors regulate IFN-gamma induction. The signaling pathway is partially inhibited by dexamethasone and sensitive to Ca2+ flux and cyclosporine. Inhibition of p38 and extracellular-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways reduces the number of IFN-gamma+ NK cells. Phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) is detected in ex vivo PF-NK cells, and M. tuberculosis triggers p-p38 in PF-NK cells at the same time that binding between NK and M. tuberculosis reaches its maximum value. Thus, interplay between M. tuberculosis and NK cells/APC triggering IFN-gamma would be expected to play a beneficial role in tuberculous pleurisy by helping to maintain a type 1 profile."
CD011420,0,16817794,0,Evaluation of serological diagnosis tests for tuberculosis in hemodialysis patients.,"Patients receiving hemodialysis are generally considered to be at increased risk of developing tuberculosis. In the current study, in order to evaluate the usefulness of serological tests in dialysis patients, serum antibodies for tuberculous glycolipids antigen (TBGL) and for lipoarabinomannan (LAM) were measured in hemodialysis patients. The present study included 243 hemodialysis patients. Serum antibodies for TBGL and LAM were measured. Tuberculin skin tests were carried out and chest X-rays evaluated at the same time. There were no patients with active tuberculosis at the time of blood sampling. Thirty-six patients (14.8%) and 25 patients (10.3%) were positive for anti-TBGL antibody and anti-LAM antibody, respectively. One hundred and fifty-five patients (63.8%) were positive for tuberculin skin testing and 123 patients (50.6%) had old pulmonary tuberculosis on their chest X-ray. There was no significant correlation between the results of anti-TBGL antibody and anti-LAM antibody. There were no relationships among the results of tuberculin skin test and the two serological tests. However, positivity of anti-TBGL antibody and anti-LAM antibody was significantly higher in patients with findings of old tuberculosis on the chest X-ray than those without findings. The current results show that these serological tests are positive more frequently in hemodialysis patients without any proof of active tuberculosis than in healthy subjects (2%) and careful interpretation is necessary for relevant results."

Globomycin treatment, Triton X-114 separation and mass spectrometry analyses clarified a property of the Rv0679c protein as a lipoprotein. In addition, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid treatment of the lysate revealed an association of the recombinant Rv0679c protein with carbohydrates. The Rv0679c protein homolog of Mycobacterium bovis BCG was also expressed as the protein associated with lipids and carbohydrates. In Western blot analysis, each of the protein homolog and Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) was detected as a similar pattern by anti-Rv0679c and anti-LAM antibodies, respectively. Interestingly, the Rv0679c protein was detected in commercially available LAM purified from M. tuberculosis. Inhibition assay of LAM synthesis in M. bovis BCG by ethambutol showed an altered migration pattern of the Rv0679c protein to low molecular mass similar to that of LAM. The results suggest that the Rv0679c protein exists as a tight complex with LAM in M. tuberculosis/M. bovis BCG."
CD011420,0,19876393,0,High content screening identifies decaprenyl-phosphoribose 2' epimerase as a target for intracellular antimycobacterial inhibitors.,"A critical feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of human tuberculosis (TB), is its ability to survive and multiply within macrophages, making these host cells an ideal niche for persisting microbes. Killing the intracellular tubercle bacilli is a key requirement for efficient tuberculosis treatment, yet identifying potent inhibitors has been hampered by labor-intensive techniques and lack of validated targets. Here, we present the development of a phenotypic cell-based assay that uses automated confocal fluorescence microscopy for high throughput screening of chemicals that interfere with the replication of M. tuberculosis within macrophages. Screening a library of 57,000 small molecules led to the identification of 135 active compounds with potent intracellular anti-mycobacterial efficacy and no host cell toxicity. Among these, the dinitrobenzamide derivatives (DNB) showed high activity against M. tuberculosis, including extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains. More importantly, we demonstrate that incubation of M. tuberculosis with DNB inhibited the formation of both lipoarabinomannan and arabinogalactan, attributable to the inhibition of decaprenyl-phospho-arabinose synthesis catalyzed by the decaprenyl-phosphoribose 2' epimerase DprE1/DprE2. Inhibition of this new target will likely contribute to new therapeutic solutions against emerging XDR-TB. Beyond validating the high throughput/content screening approach, our results open new avenues for finding the next generation of antimicrobials."
CD011420,0,11238218,0,Cell-mediated immune response to tuberculosis antigens: comparison of skin testing and measurement of in vitro gamma interferon production in whole-blood culture.,"Although delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing with tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) is the standard for tuberculosis screening, its variability suggests the need for a more sensitive, noninvasive test. An in vitro whole-blood assay has been proposed as an alternative. Using health care worker volunteers, we confirmed the correlation between PPD skin test (PPD-ST) results (positive, induration of >15 mm) and a standardized gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) assay, QuantiFERON-TB (Q-IFN), manufactured by CSL Biosciences in Australia, and we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture subfractions as potential substitutes for PPD. Twenty healthy volunteers with positive PPD-ST results and 20 PPD-ST-negative controls were enrolled. Whole blood was cultured with human PPD antigens (HuPPD), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) PPD, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and four M. tuberculosis culture subfractions: low-molecular-weight culture, filtrate, culture filtrate without lipoarabinomannan, soluble cell wall proteins, and cytosolic proteins, all developed from M. tuberculosis strain H(37)RV. Secretion of IFN-gamma (expressed as international units per milliliter) was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. The PPD or subculture fraction response as a percentage of the PHA response was used to determine positivity. Sixteen of 20 PPD-ST-positive individuals were classified as M. tuberculosis positive by Q-IFN, and 1 was classified as MAC positive. Sixteen of 20 PPD-ST-negative individuals were M. tuberculosis negative by Q-IFN, 2 were MAC positive, and 2 were M. tuberculosis positive. The tuberculosis culture subfractions stimulated IFN-gamma production in PPD-ST-positive volunteers, and significant differences could be seen between the two PPD-ST groups with all subfractions except soluble cell wall protein; however, the response was variable and no better than the Q-IFN PPD. The agreement between the Q-IFN test and the PPD-ST was good (Cohen's kappa = 0.73). The Q-IFN assay can be a useful tool in further studies of immune responses to M. tuberculosis antigens."
CD011420,0,10834989,0,Development of antigen detection assay for diagnosis of tuberculosis using sputum samples.,"The rising incidence of tuberculosis worldwide means an increasing burden on diagnostic facilities, so tests simpler than Ziehl-Neelsen staining are needed. Such tests should be objective, reproducible, and have at least as good a detection limit as 10(4) bacteria/ml. A capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detection of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in human sputum samples. As a capture antibody, we used a murine monoclonal antibody against LAM, with rabbit antiserum against Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a source of detector antibodies. The sensitivity of the capture ELISA was evaluated by using purified LAM and M. tuberculosis whole cells. We were able to detect 1 ng of purified LAM/ml and 10(4) M. tuberculosis whole cells/ml. LAM could also be detected in culture filtrate of a 3-week-old culture of M. tuberculosis. The culture filtrate contained approximately 100 microgram of LAM/ml. The detection limit in sputum pretreated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and proteinase K was 10(4) M. tuberculosis whole cells per ml. Thirty-one (91%) of 34 sputum samples from 18 Vietnamese patients with tuberculosis (32 smear positive and 2 smear negative) were positive in the LAM detection assay. In contrast, none of the 25 sputum samples from 21 nontuberculous patients was positive. This specific and sensitive assay for the detection of LAM in sputum is potentially useful for the diagnosis of tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,7664183,0,Intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin G and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific humoral immune response in tuberculous meningitis.,"Local synthesis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the central nervous system was investigated in 10 patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM), 15 patients with aseptic meningitis (AM), and 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis only (PTBO). The IgG synthesis rate for patients with TBM was 56.4 +/- 18.9 mg/day (mean +/- standard deviation), which was significantly higher than that for patients with AM (8.0 +/- 6.7 mg/day, P < 0.001) and that for patients with PTBO (7.5 +/- 4.4 mg/day, P < 0.001). Therefore, the increased IgG synthesis rate in the central nervous system provided supporting evidence for differentiating the diagnosis of TBM from that of AM (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 83.3%). Simultaneous measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of IgG seroreactivity to lipoarabinomannan and purified protein derivative antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) demonstrated seropositivity in all 6 patients with TBM, 4 of 15 patients with AM, and 4 of 10 patients with PBTO. All patients showing false-positive reactivity in CSF demonstrated seropositivity in sera and normal ranges for IgG synthesis rates in CSF. Also, the semiquantitive measurement of IgG antibody (Ab) titers in these patients demonstrated higher IgG Ab titers in serum than in CSF except for one patient with a highly elevated albumin quotient, suggesting a leaky blood-brain barrier. The results strongly suggested that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific IgG Abs were diffusible through the blood-brain barrier, which addresses the pitfall of serological tests for the early diagnosis of TBM. The serological detection of IgG Abs to lipoarabinomannan and purified protein derivative antigens in CSF could be misleading in the presence of simultaneously elevated of IgG Abs in serum."
CD011420,0,9472660,0,IgG subclass distribution of antibody responses to protein and polysaccharide mycobacterial antigens in leprosy and tuberculosis patients.,"Immunoenzymatic assays were developed for the measurement of antibodies against mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a cell-free proteic extract (CFX) of Mycobacterium leprae, and the 38-kD protein antigen of M. tuberculosis. Sera from 108 leprosy patients, belonging to all clinical-immunological forms of the spectrum, and 81 patients with localized or disseminated tuberculosis (TB) were tested for antibodies of the four IgG subclasses. Standard calibration curves were used to allow comparisons between results of different isotypes and specificities. Mean concentrations of total IgG antibodies were higher in the overall leprosy population than in TB patients. In leprosy, levels of anti-CFX increased from tuberculoid toward lepromatous forms, with a clear switch from IgG1 to IgG2 subclass predominance. A similar IgG1 to IgG2 conversion was observed in anti-LAM antibodies, although total levels of anti-LAM were similar in patients with tuberculoid and lepromatous forms. In TB, antibodies against polysaccharide and protein antigens were both predominantly of IgG1 subclass, whatever the patient's clinical status, although lower in disseminated forms, probably due to concomitant HIV infection. A hypergammaglobulinaemia was also found in most leprosy and TB patients. In TB this was due to increased IgG1 and IgG3, especially in HIV co-infected patients. Based on the current knowledge of the influence of T cell-secreted cytokines on human immunoglobulin isotype expression, these results do not fit with a putative role of Th1 (such as found in TB and tuberculoid leprosy (TT)) and Th2 (such as found in leprosy lepromatous (LL) leprosy) environment in the isotypy of antibody responses in mycobacterial infections. Nor do variations of isotypy according to pathological conditions seem to be related to the biochemical nature of antigens, since antibodies to LAM and protein antigens had comparable evolutions of their subclass distribution. Other factors are to be investigated in order to understand better the significance and possible roles of antibodies in mycobacterial diseases."
CD011420,0,20223296,0,Single nucleotide polymorphisms in cell wall biosynthesis-associated genes and phylogeny of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages.,"To investigate specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of different lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cell wall biosynthesis-associated genes encoding antigen 85 complex (fbpA, fbpB, and fbpC) and mannosyltransferase (pimB) were analyzed. Genetically diversified and predominant M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis genotypes identified in Taiwan (26 Beijing and 44 non-Beijing) were included in the study. Sequence analyses revealed that nine novel SNPs were found within main lineages of M. tuberculosis complex, including East-African-Indian (EAI), Beijing, Central-Asian (CAS), Bovis, and one lineage containing Latin American and Mediterranean (LAM), Haarlem and T. Specifically, a SNP in pimB codon 270 was identified in EAI, fbpA codon 156 in ancestral Beijing, fbpB codon 238 in modern Beijing, fbpA codon 4 and fbpC codon 158 in CAS, fbpA codon 311 in M. bovis and an additional SNP in fbpB codon 140 in M. bovis-BCG, and pimB codon 107 in other spoligotypes lineages including an additional SNP in fbpC codon 103 in LAM. In addition, we proved that isolates with spoligotype shared type (ST) no. 523 (carrying all 43 spacers), designated as unknown lineage in an international spoligotyping database (SpolDB4), belong to an early ancestral Beijing sublineage. Accordingly, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using those SNPs, and an evolutionary hypothesis for lineages of M. tuberculosis was proposed. These novel lineage-specific SNPs will be informative genetic markers in molecular epidemiological and evolutionary studies of M. tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,15560754,0,Peptide mimotopes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis carbohydrate immunodeterminants.,"Cell-surface saccharides of Mycobacterium tuberculosis appear to be crucial factors in tuberculosis pathogenicity and could be useful antigens in tuberculosis immunodiagnosis. In the present study, we report the successful antigenic and immunogenic mimicry of mannose-containing cell-wall compounds of M. tuberculosis by dodecamer peptides identified by phage-display technology. Using a rabbit antiserum raised against M. tuberculosis cell-surface saccharides as a target for biopanning, peptides with three different consensus sequences were identified. Phage-displayed and chemically synthesized peptides bound to the anticarbohydrate antiserum. Rabbit antibodies elicited against the peptide QEPLMGTVPIRAGGGS recognize the mannosylated M. tuberculosis cell-wall antigens arabinomannan and lipoarabinomannan, and the glycosylated recombinant protein alanine/proline-rich antigen. Furthermore, antibodies were also able to react with mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not with phosphatidylinositol dimannosides or arabinogalactan from mycobacteria. These results suggest that the immunogenic peptide mimics oligomannosidic epitopes. Interestingly, this report provides evidence that, in contrast with previously known carbohydrate mimotopes, no aromatic residues are necessary in a peptide sequence for mimicking unusual glycoconjugates synthesized by mycobacteria. The possible usefulness of the identified peptide mimotopes as surrogate reagents for immunodiagnosis and for the study of functional roles of the native non-peptide epitopes is discussed."
CD011420,0,17158455,0,The Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell-surface glycoprotein apa as a potential adhesin to colonize target cells via the innate immune system pulmonary C-type lectin surfactant protein A.,"Tuberculosis is still a major health problem, and understanding the mechanism by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) invades and colonizes its host target cells remains an important issue for the control of infection. The innate immune system C-type lectins (C-TLs), including the human pulmonary surfactant protein A (PSP-A), have been recently identified as determinant players in the early recognition of the invading pathogen and in mounting the host defense response. Although the antigenic lipoglycan mannosylated lipoarabinomannan is currently considered to be the major C-TL target on the mycobacterial surface, the recognition by some C-TLs of the only mycobacterial species composing the ""Mtb complex"" indicates that mannosylated lipoarabinomannan cannot account alone for this specificity. Thus, we searched for the mycobacterial molecules targeted by human PSP-A, focusing our attention on the Mtb surface glycoproteins. We developed an original functional proteomic approach based on a lectin blot assay using crude human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a source of physiological PSP-A. Combined with selective cell-surface protein extraction and mass spectrometry peptide mapping, this strategy allowed us to identify the Apa (alanine- and proline-rich antigenic) glycoprotein as new potential target for PSP-A. This result was supported by direct binding of PSP-A to purified Apa. Moreover, EDTA addition or deglycosylation of purified Apa samples completely abolished the interaction, demonstrating that the interaction is calcium- and mannose-dependent, as expected. Finally, we provide convincing evidence that Apa, formerly considered as mainly secreted, is associated with the cell wall for a sufficiently long time to aid in the attachment of PSP-A. Because, to date, Apa seems to be restricted to the Mtb complex strains, we propose that it may account for the selective recognition of those strains by PSP-A and other immune system C-TLs containing homologous functional domains."
CD011420,0,17253979,0,Intermediate maturation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis LAM-activated human dendritic cells.,"Contrasting observations raise the question of the role of mycobacterial derived products as compared with the whole bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis on maturation and function of human dendritic cells (DCs). DC-SIGN has been identified as the key DC receptor for M. tuberculosis through its interaction with the mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM). Although ManLAM is a major mycobacterial component released from infected antigen-presenting cells, there is no formal evidence yet for an effect of ManLAM per se on DC maturation and function. DCs activated with purified ManLAM displayed an intermediate maturation phenotype as compared with lipopolysaccharide fully matured DCs with reduced expression of MHC class I and class II molecules, CD83 and CD86 and of the chemokine receptor CCR7. They were sensitive to autologous natural killer (NK) lysis, thus behaving like immature DCs. However, ManLAM-activated DCs lost phagocytic activity and triggered priming of naive T-cells, confirming their intermediate maturation. Partial maturation of ManLAM-activated DCs was overcome by triggering the CD40/CD40L pathway as a second signal, which completed maturation phenotypically and abolished autologous NK lysis susceptibility. Altogether, these data provide evidence that ManLAM may induce a partial maturation phenotype on non-infected bystander DCs during infection suggesting that ManLAM released from infected cells might impair adaptive immune response towards M. tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,23038254,0,A small multidrug resistance-like transporter involved in the arabinosylation of arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan in mycobacteria.,"The biosynthesis of the major cell envelope glycoconjugates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is topologically split across the plasma membrane, yet nothing is known of the transporters required for the translocation of lipid-linked sugar donors and oligosaccharide intermediates from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic side of the membrane in mycobacteria. One of the mechanisms used by prokaryotes to translocate lipid-linked phosphate sugars across the plasma membrane relies on translocases that share resemblance with small multidrug resistance transporters. The presence of an small multidrug resistance-like gene, Rv3789, located immediately upstream from dprE1/dprE2 responsible for the formation of decaprenyl-monophosphoryl-β-D-arabinose (DPA) in the genome of M. tuberculosis led us to investigate its potential involvement in the formation of the major arabinosylated glycopolymers, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and arabinogalactan (AG). Disruption of the ortholog of Rv3789 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in a reduction of the arabinose content of both AG and LAM that accompanied the accumulation of DPA in the mutant cells. Interestingly, AG and LAM synthesis was restored in the mutant not only upon expression of Rv3789 but also upon that of the undecaprenyl phosphate aminoarabinose flippase arnE/F genes from Escherichia coli. A bacterial two-hybrid system further indicated that Rv3789 interacts in vivo with the galactosyltransferase that initiates the elongation of the galactan domain of AG. Biochemical and genetic evidence is thus consistent with Rv3789 belonging to an AG biosynthetic complex, where its role is to reorient DPA to the periplasm, allowing this arabinose donor to then be used in the buildup of the arabinan domains of AG and LAM."

CD011420,0,10806179,1,Diagnosis of tuberculosis by a visually detectable immunoassay for lipoarabinomannan.,"Recovery of tubercle bacilli from sputum, tissue, or body fluid is the standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) although this process is technically demanding and relatively insensitive. We have developed a simplified, visually detectable, colloidal gold-based serological assay to qualitatively detect IgG directed against the mycobacterial cell wall component lipoarabinomannan (LAM). The objective of this investigation is to determine the accuracy of this assay in patients with active pulmonary TB and in control patients with or without latent infection. In patients with active TB, the sensitivity of anti-LAM IgG was 85 to 93%. In five patients with active TB who were smear-negative, all tested positive for anti-LAM IgG. The specificity of the test depended on the presence of tuberculous infection. In U.S. citizens comprised of young healthy adults and rheumatology patients, the specificity was 100%. In an at-risk population for tuberculous infection who were either tuberculin skin test-negative or positive, the specificity was 89%. The negative and positive predictive values of the test were 98% and 52%, respectively. We conclude that anti-LAM IgG immunoassay is relatively sensitive and specific for active TB and thus, a potentially useful screening test for active TB."
CD011420,0,10499822,0,Tuberculosis II: the failure of the BCG vaccine.,"BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) is an attenuated pathogen characterized by its capacity to induce cellular and humoral immune responses primarily against a nonpeptidic antigen, lipoarabinomannan. Immune responses against this substance contribute to the immunoprotection of the patient if the production of IL-2 and INF-gamma is not impaired. The most adequate production of INF-gamma and IL-2 is obtained by immunoreactivity against proteinic antigens. The formation of IgG-type antibodies and of cellular immunity against mycobacterial peptidic and proteinic antigens is an additional immunological response essential for a good protection. This is achieved by the BCG vaccine in only a small proportion of the vaccinees. A vaccine adjuvant that also finds application as an immunotherapeutic agent is composed of proteinic antigens such as sonicates of Mycobacterium vaccae and antigen 60 of Mycobacterium bovis. These enhance the beneficial Th1-pole of the immune response. In addition, A60 induces the formation of antibodies against species-specific proteinic antigens. Despite the questioning of its innocuousness and efficacy, the BCG vaccine was imposed worldwide in 1950 by medical and political organizations that showed no concern for these questions. The contemporary structures of research administration in this area make it unlikely that the efficacious means recently developed to complement the action of the vaccine and of chemotherapies to face the surge of tuberculosis (TB) will be readily adopted."

CD011420,0,12471129,0,Conservation of CD1 intracellular trafficking patterns between mammalian species.,"Dendritic cells (DC) are potent APCs that sample Ags from the surrounding environment and present them to naive T cells using cell surface Ag-presenting molecules. The DC in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues express high levels of CD1, a cell surface glycoprotein capable of presenting lipids and glycolipids to T cells. Distinct group 1 CD1 isoforms (CD1a, -b, -c) in man are known to traffic to different parts of the endocytic system where microbial Ags may be sampled. Guinea pigs are the only known rodent species that express the group 1 CD1 proteins. Therefore, we examined the expression and trafficking of guinea pig CD1 (gpCD1) isoforms on isolated DC. Confocal microscopy using mAbs specific for individual gpCD1 isoforms revealed differential trafficking of two distinct CD1b isoforms within DC. Colocalization of MHC class II was observed with the gpCD1b1 isoform, consistent with localization in the late endosomes of DC. In contrast, the gpCD1b3 isoform lacks an endosomal sorting motif and remains on the cell surface. Following incubation with Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan, colocalization of endocytosed lipoarabinomannan with the gpCD1b1 isoform was observed but not with the gpCD1b3 isoform, which remained primarily on the cell surface. These data demonstrate that guinea pig DC express CD1 isoforms with unique trafficking patterns that recapitulate the patterns seen for human CD1 isoforms. This suggests evolutionary pressure for a conserved mechanism in mammals that allows CD1 to sample lipid Ags from various subcompartments of the endocytic system."
CD011420,0,24859782,0,Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan antibodies are associated to rheumatoid arthritis in Sardinian patients.,"Little is known regarding the environmental factors at play in igniting rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoimmunity, although an association between Mycobacteria and RA has been documented. This pilot study focused on examining a possible involvement of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and Mycobacterium avium ss. paratuberculosis (MAP) in RA. We measured out the serum levels of IgG antibody against different mycobacterial antigens in Sardinian patients and controls, by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The population study was composed of 61 RA patients under different therapies and 52 healthy controls, whereas the antigens tested were MTB lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), MAP heath shock protein 70, and MAP protein tyrosine phosphatase. The frequencies of anti-ManLAM antibodies were higher in the RA group (23 %) compared to the healthy controls (5.7 %) (AUC = 0.7; p < 0.0001), whereas serum reactivity to MAP antigens was not observed. ManLAM antigen was also detected in the plasma of three RA patients (which were anti-ManLAM antibody positive) by Western blot analysis using anti-Man-LAM monoclonal antibodies. The data produced corroborate the hypothesis of a potential association between MTB ManLAM and RA disease, but so far, further studies are necessary to understand its role in RA pathogenesis."
CD011420,0,1308483,0,Demonstration of PGL-I & LAM-B antigens in paraffin sections of leprosy skin lesions.,"An investigation on the demonstration of PGL-I and LAM-B antigens in thirty-four paraffin embedded skin biopsies taken from leprosy patients who covered the whole spectrum of the disease and in four control specimens was carried out. Neither the PGL-I antigen nor the LAM-B antigen was demonstrated in the normal skin specimens that were used as negative control; and only the LAM-B antigen appeared in the tuberculosis specimens in which the PGL-I antigen was negative. The PGL-I antigen was demonstrated on thirty-three leprosy samples except one TT sample and the LAM-B antigen, on all samples by immunochemical staining technique. The antigens were identified as intracytoplasmic bacillary staining, in solitary, granular as well as debris patterns; and as soluble antigenic staining, in vacuolar or amorphous pattern. In LL and BL cases, the antigens were detected predominantly from macrophages and peripheral nerves in all five staining patterns; in BB cases, from macrophages mostly in the granular as well as debris patterns, from the nerves in the vacuolar pattern; while in TT and the majority of BT cases, they were mainly from nerve remnants inside the granuloma in the vacuolar or amorphous staining pattern. In addition, it is interesting to note that the immunochemical staining was able to differentiate the foamy change from the hydropic degeneration. We also found that the antigens distributed in arrector pili muscles and the walls of muscular vessels were obviously related to the unmyelinated nerve fibers innervating the smooth muscle cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011420,0,8808264,0,[Basic studies on tuberculosis and tubercle bacilli in U.S.-Japan medical cooperative program tuberculosis panel].,"The U.S.-Japan Medical Cooperative Program has been started in 1965 and Tuberculosis Panel is one of the most important field of the programs. In this lecture, the recent advances in the basic studies on tuberculosis researches which were reported in Tuberculosis panel of the program were summarized. The host defence mechanisms against M. tuberculosis infection were the most important subject. The role of Th1-mediated cytokins such as IL-2, IFN gamma and TNF beta in the host-defence mechanism against mycobacterial infection was extensively discussed. Bcg gene of the mice is the example case for the genetic background of host against mycobacterial infection. The virulence factor, however of M. tuberculosis is still unknown. The technique of molecular biology was applied to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The PCR and RFLP methods are the useful strategies for the rapid diagnosis and analysis of the mode of infection with M. tuberculosis. The development of detection techniques of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli is also urgently required. Another approach by molecular biology to tuberculosis research is the cloning of gene of tuberculin protein and the production recombinant protein of M. tuberculosis. The amino acid sequences of several proteins have been determined and their immunological properties of recombinant proteins were investigated. The immunological functions of lipid fractions of tubercle bacilli such as cord factor (TDM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) have been described. Especially the immunomodulating activities and the role of TDM as diagnostic antigen in the tuberculosis patients were described. The adjuvant activity of mycobacterial cell wall was well established and the minimum structural requirement was reported to be N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP). The several MDP derivatives were selected as the cytokine inducers. Especially MDP-Lys (L18) was widely used as drug for the increasing the number of white blood cells and platelets in cancer patients. The effectiveness of MDP derivatives on the stimulating of mucosal immunity was also recently reported. The preventing activities of virus infection and cancer metastasis of MDP derivatives were shown in mice models."
CD011420,0,2116239,0,[Detection of serum antibody against lipoarabinomannan-B in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra)].,"The serum antibody to lipoarabinomannan-B(LAM-B) purified from mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra) was tested by ELISA in 250 sera, including sera from patients as follows: tuberculosis 96, tubercular pleurisy 11, renal tuberculosis 2, bone and joint tuberculosis 33, tubercular meningitis 16, pulmonary cancer 22, leprosy 20 and normal subjects 50. The positive rate of pulmonary tuberculosis is 69.8%, which is of a similar extent in sera from patients with tuberculosis of miscellaneous organs to be tested except tubercular meningitis, in which only 18.8% positive rate was observed, indicating the blockage of antibody releasing from pathologic foci into blood stream by blood-brain barrier. The positive rates of leprosy and normal subjects are 50.0% and 2.0% respectively. No antibody was found among 22 patients with pulmonary cancer. It is suggested that the existence of an active tubercular lesion in the host might be the basic prerequisite for a positive LAM-B antibody detection. Although LAM-B is a common antigen of both mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium leprae, the low prevalence of leprosy in China makes little influence of the practicability of using this ELISA in epidemiological study and in clinic as a adjutant tool for tuberculosis diagnosis and differential diagnosis."
CD011420,0,9423870,0,MPB70 and MPB83 as indicators of protein localization in mycobacterial cells.,"Culture fluids after growth of Mycobacterium bovis BCG on Sauton medium contain actively secreted proteins and proteins released by bacterial lysis. BCG culture fluids and sonicates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis were tested after separation by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The localization of marker proteins was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting with selected monoclonal antibodies of known specificities. Soluble secreted proteins (MPB64 and proteins of the antigen 85 complex) and three heat shock proteins (DnaK, GroEL, and GroES) were recovered in a single peak after gel filtration, indicating their occurrence as a free monomer in the culture fluid and cytosol, respectively. Other constituents eluted in two distinct peaks during gel filtration. The first peak corresponded to the void volume, indicating complex formation between several proteins or attachment to lipids in the surface layer or the cytoplasmic membrane; the second peak corresponded to the expected monomer size indicated by SDS-PAGE under conditions that separate proteins from each other during sample preparation. The two-peak group contained constituents with known lipid contents, the 19- and 38-kDa lipoproteins and lipoarabinomannan. The 26-kDa form of MPB83 behaved similarly. After extraction with Triton X-114, these constituents entered into the detergent phase, confirming the lipoprotein nature of 26-kDa MPB83. The MPB83 molecule was shown to be available on the surface of BCG Tokyo bacilli for reaction with monoclonal antibody MBS43 by flow cytometry."
CD011420,0,8866984,0,Serodiagnosis of tuberculosis.,"To overcome limitations of the conventional laboratory tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, attempts have been made in the past to develop a good serodiagnostic test. Until the availability of ELISA results obtained with various immunological techniques were of limited use. Even with ELISA, early attempts to estimate specific antimycobacterial antibodies in the serum were based on the use of crude mycobacterial antigens resulting in a very high false positivity. Better results were obtained with purified antigens. Various purified and semipurified antigens which when used in the ELISA test for estimating antibodies in the serum and other body fluids in cases of tuberculosis have given encouraging results. These include a glycolipid antigen from Myc. bovis BCG (ST = 88%, SP = 96%), antigen '5' (ST = 72%, SP = 91%) and a 38 Kd protein antigen (ST = 83%). Estimation of various mycobacterial antigens in different clinical specimens has also been studied using ELISA technique. Encouraging results have been obtained with the detection of a 43 Kd antigen, Lipoarabinomannan antigen and antigen '5' in the serum, CSF and other body fluids of cases of tuberculosis (ST = 80-100%, SP = 93-100%). The serological tests by detecting specific mycobacterial antigens and antibodies can be of great help in diagnosing the smear negative tuberculosis as these are rapid, inexpensive and simple to perform."
CD011420,0,25005431,0,Prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in a dairy cattle farm and a research farm in Ghana.,"The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and to identify the mycobacterial species causing BTB in a dairy farm and research farm. Six hundred and eighty-five cattle were screened for BTB by using the Comparative intradermal tuberculin test (CTT). Positive reactors were slaughtered and carcasses were taken for isolation of mycobacterial species. This was followed by speciation of isolates using both standard conventional and molecular assays. Seventeen of the cattle were positive by CTT, giving a crude BTB prevalence of 2.48% among cattle from the two farms. Six of the 17 samples (35.30%) yielded positive acid-fast bacilli cultures and three of the isolates were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), which were sub-divided into two Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensu scrito (Mtb) and one Mycobacterium africanum; the remaining three were Mycobacterium other than tuberculoisis (MOTT). Spoligotyping further characterised the two Mtb isolates as Ghana (spoligotype Data Base 4 number 53) and Latin American Mediterranean (LAM), whilst spoligotyping and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis typed the M. africanum as West African 1. Microseq 500 analysis identified two of the MOTT as Mycobacterium flavescens and Mycobacterium Moriokaense respectively, whilst the remaining one could not be identified. This study observed the prevalence of bovine TB among cattle from two farms in Ghana as 2.48% and confirms the public health importance of M. africanum as a pathogen in Ghana."
CD011420,0,16760317,0,Immune responses to defined antigens of Mycobacterium bovis in cattle experimentally infected with Mycobacterium kansasii.,"Cross-reactive responses elicited by exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria often confound the interpretation of antemortem tests for Mycobacterium bovis infection of cattle. The use of specific proteins (e.g., ESAT-6, CFP-10, and MPB83), however, generally enhances the specificity of bovine tuberculosis tests. While genes for these proteins are absent from many nontuberculous mycobacteria, they are present in M. kansasii. Instillation of M. kansasii into the tonsillar crypts of calves elicited delayed-type hypersensitivity and in vitro gamma interferon and nitrite concentration responses of leukocytes to M. avium and M. bovis purified protein derivatives (PPDs). While the responses of M. kansasii-inoculated calves to M. avium and M. bovis PPDs were approximately equivalent, the responses of M. bovis-inoculated calves to M. bovis PPD exceeded their respective responses to M. avium PPD. The gamma interferon and nitrite responses of M. kansasii-inoculated calves to recombinant ESAT-6-CFP-10 (rESAT-6-CFP-10) exceeded corresponding responses of noninoculated calves as early as 15 and 30 days after inoculation, respectively, and persisted throughout the study. The gamma interferon and nitrite responses of M. bovis-inoculated calves to rESAT-6-CFP-10 exceeded the corresponding responses of M. kansasii-inoculated calves beginning 30 days after inoculation. By using a lipoarabinomannan-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, specific serum antibodies were detected as early as 50 days after challenge with M. kansasii. By a multiantigen print immunoassay and immunoblotting, serum antibodies to MPB83, but not ESAT-6 or CFP-10, were detected in M. kansasii-inoculated calves; however, responses to MPB83 were notably weaker than those elicited by M. bovis infection. These findings indicate that M. kansasii infection of calves elicits specific responses that may confound the interpretation of bovine tuberculosis tests."

Commercially available ELISA-based assays (Pathozyme Tb complex plus, Myco G, A and M--Omega Diagnostic) were used. Tests were performed and cut off established according to manufacturer instruction. Mean IgG level against 38 + 16kDa was significantly higher in neurotuberculosis group compared to control (p<0.05). Sensitivity of the test in detecting neurotuberculosis was of 42% and specificity of 96%. Mean IgG, IgA and IgM against 38kDa + LAM level was higher in TB group compared to NTB in CSF. No difference was observed between TB and NTB group in pleural effusion. Antimycobacterial antibody levels were non-significantly increased in pericardial fluid in TB. The findings of the study indicate that TB is associated with the presence of detectable levels of antibodies in the CSF and pericardial effusion. Anti 38kDa + 16kDa IgG test can be used in combination with other diagnostic methods to increase diagnostic accuracy of neurotuberculosis."
CD011420,0,11345220,1,Diagnostic evaluation of urinary lipoarabinomannan at an Ethiopian tuberculosis centre.,"Direct capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for lipoarabinomannan (LAM) was performed on urine samples from 200 tuberculosis (TB) patients and 800 non-TB patients routinely diagnosed among consecutive suspects in an Ethiopian TB centre. 50 healthy Ethiopians, 50 healthy individuals and 100 non-TB patients from Norway served as controls. Of the TB patients, 139 (69.5%) were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). In the remaining cases the diagnosis was based on suggestive clinical findings. All Ethiopian non-TB patients were AFB negative and showed no clinical evidence of TB. In the Ethiopian groups, 148 (74%) of the TB patients, 105 (13.1%) of the non-TB patients and 5 (10%) of the healthy controls were positive by the LAM-ELISA. 113 (81.3%) of AFB positives and 35 (57.4%) of AFB-negative TB patients had positive LAM-ELISA. In the Norwegian groups all were LAM negative. The sensitivity and specificity of the LAM-ELISA for TB patients versus Ethiopian non-TB patients were 74% and 86.9%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 58.5% and 93.0%. This study suggests that detection of LAM in the urine of TB patients may improve case finding and that diagnostic tests based on this principle may serve as valuable supplemental tools in TB control."
CD011420,0,24614769,0,When smear and molecular diagnostics fail: identification of tuberculosis in advanced HIV infection using the newly developed urine lipoarabinomannan lateral-flow assay.,"In HIV infection, progression of immunodeficiency is associated with increased risk of paucibacillary and disseminated forms of tuberculosis (TB). As a result, the clinical presentation may be atypical and the conventional diagnostic assays often unreliable, resulting in significant treatment delays. Here, we report a case of HIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and TB meningitis. Although the smear and molecular assays were negative, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in our patient using the new Determine-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) lateral-flow urine 'dip-stick' assay. This case report illustrates the clinical value of this assay for the diagnosis of TB in a subgroup of HIV-infected patients with advanced immunodeficiency. Also, although two recent studies have evaluated the use of the Determine TB-LAM assay in clinical settings, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of TB diagnosed using this novel assay."
CD011420,0,16139316,1,Detection of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan with an antigen-capture ELISA in unprocessed urine of Tanzanian patients with suspected tuberculosis.,"A direct antigen-capture ELISA based on the detection of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in unprocessed urine was evaluated for its usefulness in clinical practice. In Tanzania, 231 patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and 103 healthy volunteers were screened with standard TB tests and with the new LAM-ELISA. Of 132 patients with confirmed pulmonary mycobacterial disease (positive sputum culture), 106 were positive using the LAM-ELISA (sensitivity 80.3%). In comparison, the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum microscopy was 62.1% (82 of 132 confirmed cases). Of the 231 patients, 17 were both culture- and AFB-negative, but had typical radiographic signs of pulmonary mycobacterial infection and did not respond to antibiotic treatment. Of these 17 patients, 13 (76.5%) had positive LAM-ELISA test results. To define the specificity of the assay, urine samples from 103 healthy volunteers were also screened using LAM-ELISA. All but one had an optical density below the cut-off (specificity 99%). Of interest was a significant correlation between level of microscopic density of mycobacteria in sputum and LAM antigen concentration in urine (chi2=8.44). The LAM-ELISA is a field-adapted tool that can improve screening standards in countries with a high incidence of TB."

CD011420,0,24572295,0,Aptamer against mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan inhibits virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in mice and rhesus monkeys.,"The major surface lipoglycan of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), is an immunosuppressive epitope of M. tb. We used systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to generate an aptamer (ZXL1) that specifically bound to ManLAM from the virulent M. tb strain H37Rv. Aptamer ZXL1 had the highest binding affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 436.3 ± 37.84 nmol/l, and competed with the mannose receptor for binding to ManLAM and M. tb H37Rv. ZXL1 significantly inhibited the ManLAM-induced immunosuppression of CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and enhanced the M. tb antigen-presenting activity of DCs for naive CD4(+) Th1 cell activation. More importantly, we demonstrated that injection of aptamer ZXL1 significantly reduced the progression of M. tb H37Rv infections and bacterial loads in lungs of mice and rhesus monkeys. These results suggest that the aptamer ZXL1 is a new potential antimycobacterial agent and tuberculosis vaccine immune adjuvant."
CD011420,0,11402004,0,Homogeneity of antibody responses in tuberculosis patients.,"The goals of the present study were twofold: (i) to compare the repertoires of antigens in culture filtrates of in vitro-grown Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are recognized by antibodies from noncavitary and cavitary tuberculosis (TB) patients and (ii) to determine the extent of variation that exists between the antigen profiles recognized by individual TB patients. Lipoarabinomannan-free culture filtrate proteins of M. tuberculosis were fractionated by one-dimensional (1-D) and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the Western blots were probed with sera from non-human immunodeficiency virus (non-HIV)-infected cavitary and noncavitary TB patients and from HIV-infected, noncavitary TB patients. In contrast to earlier studies based on recombinant antigens of M. tuberculosis which suggested that antibody responses in TB patients were heterogeneous (K. Lyashchenko et al., 1998, Infect. Immun. 66:3936-3940, 1998), our studies with native culture filtrate proteins show that the antibody responses in TB patients show significant homogeneity in being directed against a well-defined subset of antigens. Thus, there is a well-defined subset of culture filtrate antigens that elicits antibodies during noncavitary and cavitary disease. In addition, another set of antigens is recognized primarily by cavitary TB patients. The mapping with individual patient sera presented here suggests that serodiagnostic tests based on the subset of antigens recognized during both noncavitary and cavitary TB will enhance the sensitivity of antibody detection in TB patients, especially in difficult-to-diagnose, smear-negative, noncavitary TB patients."
CD011420,0,2674558,0,"The role of cytokines in the immunopathology of tuberculosis, and the regulation of agalactosyl IgG.","Tuberculosis is characterised by necrosis in the lesions and in skin-test sites, and by fever and weight loss. In contrast, other diseases with chronic T cell mediated responses, such as uncomplicated leprosy and sarcoidosis, have non-necrotising lesions with little systemic upset. Crude sonicates of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae prepare skin sites for TNF-mediated damage via a pathway which unexpectedly appears to involve CD8+ T cells, and both mycobacteria contain potent triggers of TNF release (lipoarabinomannan and peptidoglycan derivatives). These observations can partially explain the pathology of tuberculosis, but fail to explain why similar events do not normally occur in leprosy. It now seems likely that the answer lies in the existence of novel regulatory pathways. A recently recognised correlate (or consequence) of diseases characterised by T cell-dependent tissue-damaging pathology and cytokine release, is an increase in the level of agalactosyl IgG. This behaves like a T cell-dependent acute phase reactant, and is raised in tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease, but not in sarcoidosis or uncomplicated leprosy. Thus it may act as a marker for a type of pathology of very broad significance, though its functional role remains obscure."

CD011420,0,8910503,0,Truncated structural variants of lipoarabinomannan in ethambutol drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Inhibition of arabinan biosynthesis by ethambutol.,"The anti-tuberculosis drug, ethambutol (Emb), was previously shown to inhibit the synthesis of arabinans of both the cell wall arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria. However, an Emb-resistant mutant, isolated by consecutive passage of the Mycobacterium smegmatis parent strain in media containing increasing concentrations of Emb, while synthesizing a normal version of AG, produced truncated forms of LAM when maintained on 10 microg/ml Emb (Mikusová, K., Slayden, R. A., Besra, G. S., and Brennan, P. J. (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39, 2482-2489). We have now isolated and characterized the truncated LAMs made by both the resistant mutant and a recombinant strain transfected with a plasmid containing the emb region from Mycobacterium avium which encodes for Emb resistance. By chemical analysis, endoarabinanase digestion, high pH anion exchange chromatography, and mass spectrometry analyses, truncation was demonstrated as primarily a consequence of selective and partial inhibition of the synthesis of the linear arabinan terminal motif, which constitutes a substantial portion of the arabinan termini in LAM but not of AG. However, at higher concentrations, Emb also affected the general biosynthesis of arabinan destined for both AG and LAM, resulting in severely truncated LAM as well as AG with a reduced Ara:Gal ratio. The results suggested that Emb exerts its antimycobacterial effect by inhibiting an array of arabinosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of arabinans unique to the mycobacterial cell wall. It was further concluded that the uniquely branched terminal Ara6 motif common to both AG and LAM is an essential structural entity for a functional cell wall and, consequently, that the biosynthetic machinery responsible for its synthesis is the effective target of Emb in its role as a potent anti-tuberculosis drug."
CD011420,0,11920324,0,Expression of human immunodeficiency virus coreceptors CXC chemokine receptor 4 and CC chemokine receptor 5 on monocytes is down-regulated during human endotoxemia.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in monocytes in vitro. To test the hypothesis that an LPS effect on CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), known coreceptors for HIV, contributes to this effect, 8 healthy men were intravenously injected with Escherichia coli LPS (4 ng/kg), and monocyte CXCR4 and CCR5 expression was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. LPS induced a decrease in the fraction of peripheral blood monocytes expressing CXCR4 and CCR5, reaching a nadir after 2 h (both P<.001 vs. baseline). In whole blood in vitro, not only LPS but also lipoarabinomannan (a cell wall component of Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and lipoteichoic acid (a cell wall component of Staphylococcus aureus) down-regulated the expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 on monocytes (all P<.05). Exposure of monocytes to (myco)bacterial agents may render them relatively resistant to infection with HIV by an effect on HIV coreceptors."

All three MAbs bound to surface epitopes of M. tuberculosis as shown by whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy. One immunoglobulin M (IgM) MAb bound to lipoarabinomannan, the second IgM MAb bound to mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, and the third MAb, an IgG3, bound to a surface epitope of an uncertain nature. The MAbs demonstrated different cross-reactivity patterns with other mycobacteria. Two of the MAbs were used to develop a modified ELISA spot assay for the detection of mycobacteria."
CD011420,0,18204122,0,Heterogeneity of antibody response to myobacterial antigens in different clinical manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis.,"Different clinical outcomes of tuberculosis can be related to the balance between cell-mediated and humoral immunity. In this prospective study we examined the humoral immune responses to recombinant and native mycobacterial antigens in relation to clinical presentations of pulmonary TB. Two hundred and fifteen serum samples were examined including: non-cavitary (n=120), cavitary (n=65), caseous pneumonia (n=12), and disseminated TB (n=18). ELISA tests detecting IgG, IgA, and IgM against antigens: 38 kDa and 16 kDa, 38 kDa and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) were used. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to find the association between the antibody level and demographic or clinical characteristics. The relationships among specific antibody profiles and the phase of the disease in relation to demographic (age and sex) and clinico-radiological factors were investigated by measuring serum antibody levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM) to 38 kDa and 16 kDa recombinant M. tuberculosis antigens and to LAM - native mycobacterial antigen. The results show that the radiological extent of the disease is the strongest factor associated with IgG antibody production. Patients with more extensive pulmonary TB showed higher titers of IgG antibody to M. tuberculosis antigens (P<0.0001). The highest IgG and IgA level were observed in fibro-cavernous TB. The presence of cavity was associated only with IgG anti 38+16 kDa (P<0.001). IgA level was the highest in caseous pneumonia. IgM antibody production was not associated with any clinical and radiological factor, but only with the male gender. Age was independently and inversely associated with IgG anti 38 kDa+LAM level and IgM anti 38 kDa+LAM. We conclude that the humoral immune response to mycobacterial antigens is highly heterogeneous and varies with the stage of TB. IgG antibody level is higher in most advanced and extensive forms of the disease."

CD011420,0,8936990,0,[The expression of ICAM-1 on macrophages stimulated with Mycobacterium avium complex and its control by some regulatory cytokines].,"The interaction of LFA-1 on T lymphocytes with ICAM-1 on antigen presenting cells (APCs) is critical in determining conjugate formation between the APCs and T cells as well as activation of T cells. Recently, it was found that stimulation of THP-1 cells, a human monocyte M phi cell line, with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or its lipoarabinomannan, elicited the increase in the ICAM-1 expression. In addition, in cases of lepromatous leprosy patients with a serious defect in the M. leprae antigen-specific cellular immunity, keratinocytes in the leprosy lesions were lacking in the ICAM-1 expression. Therefore, ICAM-1 seems to participate in the host response to mycobacterial infections. Here, we studied the mode of the expression of ICAM-1 molecules on murine peritoneal M phis in response to stimulation with M. avium complex (MAC). In addition, the regulatory effect of some cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on the ICAM-1 expression was studied. Monolayer cultures of peptone-starch induced murine peritoneal M phis were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium in the presence of MAC with or without test agents. At intervals, the M phis were stained with anti-ICAM-1 antibody (Ab) and then treated with alkaline phosphatase (Ap)-conjugated anti-1g Ab. After color development with NBT-BCIP substrate, percentage of the blue-stained (ICAM-1 positive) M phis was determined microscopically. The concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-10, and TGF-beta in the M phi culture fluid was measured by ELISA using capture Ab, biotin-labelled capping Ab, and Ap-conjugated streptavidin. When M phis infected with MAC organisms were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum or in serum-free GPI medium, a significant increase in their ICAM-1 expression was observed, reaching the peak at days 1 to 3, thereafter rapidly decreased and returned to the normal level by day 14. Further addition of TNF-alpha caused no significant change in the mode of the MAC-induced expression of ICAM-1. A transient increase in the IL-10 production of MAC-infected M phis was observed during the first 3-days cultivation, as in the case of TNF-alpha. On the other hand, TGF-beta production of the Mø population was initiated from day 3, and therafter increased gradually until day 14. ICAM-1 expression of the MAC-infected M phis was not influenced by the addition of IL-10, while anti-IL-10 Ab retarded the decline of ICAM-1 expression at day 7. On the other hand, the addition of TCF-beta attenuated the MAC infection-induced increase in the ICAM-1 expression significantly. In addition, anti-TGF-beta Ab significantly delayed the reduction of the ICAM-1 expression of MAC-infected M phis during days 3 to 7. These results indicate that, in the MAC-infected M phis. TGF-beta rather than IL-10 play important roles as a mediators for the late-phase down-regulation of ICAM-1 expression which had been transiently elevated by the action of TNF-alpha in the early phase of the Mø cultivation."
CD011420,0,22363820,0,A bispecific antibody based assay shows potential for detecting tuberculosis in resource constrained laboratory settings.,"The re-emergence of tuberculosis (TB) as a global public health threat highlights the necessity of rapid, simple and inexpensive point-of-care detection of the disease. Early diagnosis of TB is vital not only for preventing the spread of the disease but also for timely initiation of treatment. The later in turn will reduce the possible emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is an important non-protein antigen of the bacterial cell wall, which is found to be present in different body fluids of infected patients including blood, urine and sputum. We have developed a bispecific monoclonal antibody with predetermined specificities towards the LAM antigen and a reporter molecule horseradish peroxidase (HRPO). The developed antibody was subsequently used to design a simple low cost immunoswab based assay to detect LAM antigen. The limit of detection for spiked synthetic LAM was found to be 5.0 ng/ml (bovine urine), 0.5 ng/ml (rabbit serum) and 0.005 ng/ml (saline) and that for bacterial LAM from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was found to be 0.5 ng/ml (rabbit serum). The assay was evaluated with 21 stored clinical serum samples (14 were positive and 7 were negative in terms of anti-LAM titer). In addition, all 14 positive samples were culture positive. The assay showed 100% specificity and 64% sensitivity (95% confidence interval). In addition to good specificity, the end point could be read visually within two hours of sample collection. The reported assay might be used as a rapid tool for detecting TB in resource constrained laboratory settings."

CD011420,0,12758196,0,"Structure, function, and biogenesis of the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","Much of the early structural definition of the cell wall of Mycobacterium spp. was initiated in the 1960s and 1970s. There was a long period of inactivity, but more recent developments in NMR and mass spectral analysis and definition of the M. tuberculosis genome have resulted in a thorough understanding, not only of the structure of the mycobacterial cell wall and its lipids but also the basic genetics and biosynthesis. Our understanding nowadays of cell-wall architecture amounts to a massive ""core"" comprised of peptidoglycan covalently attached via a linker unit (L-Rha-D-GlcNAc-P) to a linear galactofuran, in turn attached to several strands of a highly branched arabinofuran, in turn attached to mycolic acids. The mycolic acids are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the membrane and provide a truly special lipid barrier responsible for many of the physiological and disease-inducing aspects of M. tuberculosis. Intercalated within this lipid environment are the lipids that have intrigued researchers for over five decades: the phthiocerol dimycocerosate, cord factor/dimycolyltrehalose, the sulfolipids, the phosphatidylinositol mannosides, etc. Knowledge of their roles in ""signaling"" events, in pathogenesis, and in the immune response is now emerging, sometimes piecemeal and sometimes in an organized fashion. Some of the more intriguing observations are those demonstrating that mycolic acids are recognized by CD1-restricted T-cells, that antigen 85, one of the most powerful protective antigens of M. tuberculosis, is a mycolyltransferase, and that lipoarabinomannan (LAM), when ""capped"" with short mannose oligosaccharides, is involved in phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis. Definition of the genome of M. tuberculosis has greatly aided efforts to define the biosynthetic pathways for all of these exotic molecules: the mycolic acids, the mycocerosates, phthiocerol, LAM, and the polyprenyl phosphates. For example, we know that synthesis of the entire core is initiated on a decaprenyl-P with synthesis of the linker unit, and then there is concomitant extension of the galactan and arabinan chains while this intermediate is transported through the cytoplasmic membrane. The final steps in these events, the attachment of mycolic acids and ligation to peptidoglycan, await definition and will prove to be excellent targets for a new generation of anti-tuberculosis drugs."
CD011420,0,2501348,0,Levels of antibody to defined antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in tuberculous meningitis.,"The aim of the study was to develop an antibody immunoassay for tuberculous meningitis with a sensitivity greater than that of the initial bacterial smear while maintaining a 100% specificity. Antibody titers to five purified antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were measured in cerebrospinal fluid by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Seventy-four patients with tuberculous meningitis (26 culture positive) were compared with 26 patients with purulent meningitis, 69 patients with suspected but excluded tuberculous meningitis, and 29 patients with other neurological diseases. Antibody responses to both the 14-kilodalton (kDa) antigen and lipoarabinomannan were immunodominant, accounting for 74% of those with any antibody titer to a soluble extract of M. tuberculosis. A sensitivity of 61% was achieved (77% for the culture-positive samples) by using immunoglobulin G titers to lipoarabinomannan and the 14-, 19-, and 38-kDa antigens. Thus, estimation of levels of antibody in cerebrospinal fluid to selected mycobacterial antigens would be valuable in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. The possible reasons for the immunodominance of the 14-kDa antigen and lipoarabinomannan in the pathogenesis of tuberculous meningitis are discussed."

More than 90% of the cells present after 1 week of in vitro expansion were CD3(+). T cells were expanded from purified protein derivative-negative controls, persons with latent tuberculosis, and BCG-vaccinated individuals. T cells expanded with nonmycobacterial antigens enhanced the intracellular growth of BCG in suboptimal cultures of macrophages. T cells expanded with live BCG or lysates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly inhibited intracellular BCG. Recent intradermal BCG vaccination significantly enhanced the inhibitory activity of T cells expanded with mycobacterial antigens (P < 0.02), consistent with the induction of memory-immune inhibitory T-cell responses. Selected mycobacterial antigens (Mtb41 > lipoarabinomannan > 38kd > Ag85B > Mtb39) expanded inhibitory T cells, demonstrating the involvement of antigen-specific T cells in intracellular BCG inhibition. We studied the T-cell subsets and molecular mechanisms involved in the memory-immune inhibition of intracellular BCG. Mycobacteria-specific gammadelta T cells were the most potent inhibitors of intracellular BCG growth. Direct contact between T cells and macrophages was necessary for the BCG growth-enhancing and inhibitory activities mediated by control and mycobacteria-specific T cells, respectively. Increases in tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, transforming growth factor beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression were associated with the enhancement of intracellular BCG growth. Increases in gamma interferon, FAS, FAS ligand, perforin, granzyme, and granulysin mRNA expression were associated with intracellular BCG inhibition. These culture systems provide in vitro models for studying the opposing T-cell mechanisms involved in mycobacterial survival and protective host immunity."

CD011420,0,25588651,0,Evaluation of antigen-specific immunoglobulin g responses in pulmonary tuberculosis patients and contacts.,"This study aimed to evaluate the serodiagnostic potential of immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients, recent TB contacts with latent TB infection (LTBI), and healthy subjects. Infections were assessed using tuberculin skin tests, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube tests, drug susceptibility testing, and molecular genotyping of clinical isolates. Serum IgG responses to selective M. tuberculosis antigens, including the 38-kDa and 16-kDa antigens, lipoarabinomannan (LAM), and recombinant early secreted antigen target 6 kDa (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 kDa (CFP-10), were determined. We found that the serum IgG responses to all antigens might differentiate between active TB and LTBI, with LAM having the highest diagnostic value (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.7756, P < 0.001). Recurrent TB cases showed significantly higher IgG responses to 38 kDa, CFP-10 (P < 0.01), and LAM (P < 0.05) than new cases, and male patients had higher levels of antigen-specific IgG than females (P < 0.05). Conversely, drug resistance and patient body mass index did not affect IgG responses (P > 0.05). LAM-specific IgG responses differentiated between acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive and -negative patients (P < 0.01), whereas antigen-specific IgG responses did not vary with the M. tuberculosis genotype (P > 0.05). Significantly higher IgG responses to 38 kDa and 16 kDa were observed in AFB smear-negative patients than in controls. These results suggest that assessment of serum IgG responses to selective purified M. tuberculosis antigens may help improve the diagnosis of active TB, particularly for sputum smear-negative patients or recurrent cases, and these may also help to differentiate between active TB and LTBI."
CD011420,0,19892432,0,DC-SIGN and mannosylated surface structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a deceptive liaison.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is recognized by pattern recognition receptors on macrophages and dendritic cells, thereby triggering phagocytosis, antigen presentation to T cells and cytokine secretion. The dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is a calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding protein with specificity for mannose-containing glycoconjugates and fucose-containing Lewis antigens. Mannosylated moieties of the mycobacterial cell wall, such as mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (manLAM) or higher-order phosphatidylinositol-mannosides (PIMs) of Mtb, were previously shown to bind to DC-SIGN on immature dendritic cells and macrophage subpopulations. This interaction reportedly impaired dendritic cell maturation, modulated cytokine secretion by phagocytes and dendritic cells and was postulated to cause suppression of protective immunity to TB. However, experimental Mtb infections in mice transgenic for human DC-SIGN revealed that, instead of favoring immune evasion of mycobacteria, DC-SIGN may promote host protection by limiting tissue pathology. Furthermore, infection studies with mycobacterial strains genetically engineered to lack manLAM or PIMs demonstrated that the manLAM/PIM-DC-SIGN interaction was not critical for cytokine secretion in vitro and protective immunity in vivo. The dominant Mtb-derived ligands for DC-SIGN are presently unknown, and a major role of DC-SIGN in the immune response to Mtb infection may lie in its capacity to maintain a balanced inflammatory state during chronic TB."
CD011420,0,18085168,0,Recent advances in immunodiagnosis of leprosy.,"Although prevalence of leprosy is considerably reduced, the unabated emergence of about 300,000 cases worldwide indicates that the source of infection and transmission are not being addressed. Early diagnosis and treatment still remain the cornerstone of leprosy control. Many diagnostic issues hinder the correct and timely diagnosis and classification of leprosy. Delayed and missed diagnosis of infectious leprosy patients and the lack of tests to measure asymptomatic M. leprae infection in contacts also hamper the assessment of transmission of M. leprae infection. An important goal would be the development of improved diagnostic tools to diagnose difficult cases and to detect M. leprae infection before clinical manifestation. The search for an ideal immunodiagnostic tool for leprosy had gone through various phases and development over the years, with inherent limitations in the sensitivity and specificity of the immunodiagnostic tests for leprosy. With improvement in technology many modifications of previously used PGL-1 assay in the form of rapid and less expensive techniques, such as dipstick, ELISA, ML flow test, have been introduced. Many new skin test antigens with potential for improving their efficiency, such as MLSA LAM, MLCwA and their fractionates, have been studied. After the completion of genome sequencing of M. leprae in 2000, many genes that were studied in M. tuberculosis and found potential for the immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis, such as CFP-10 and ESAT-6 proteins, have been investigated in M. leprae also. Genes that are unique to M. leprae with no homologous in M. tuberculosis have been explored for novel M. leprae-specific antigens. In order to overcome the problem of cross-reactivity, a number of workers have synthesized overlapping short peptides of different M. leprae recombinant proteins and studied their sequence divergence and attempted to identify M. leprae-specific B- and T-cell epitopes. This review makes an effort to present an overview of all these developments in the field of immunodiagnosis of leprosy."
CD011420,0,8816382,0,CD1c restricts responses of mycobacteria-specific T cells. Evidence for antigen presentation by a second member of the human CD1 family.,"Previous studies suggest that CD1 is a family of Ag-presenting molecules distantly related to those encoded by the MHC. However, of the four known human CD1 proteins, only CD1b has been shown to restrict Ag-specific T cell responses. In this study, we have shown that a second member of the human CD1 family, CD1c, could also mediate Ag presentation to T cells. Three T cell lines recognizing mycobacterial Ags in a CD1c-restricted manner were isolated from normal donor blood. These T cells were MHC unrestricted, and their recognition of Ag was independent of the products of the transporter associated with Ag presentation-1/2 and DMA/B genes that are generally required for Ag presentation by MHC-encoded Ag-presenting molecules. Furthermore, unlike MHC-restricted responses to peptides, the CD1c-restricted T cell lines recognized protease-resistant mycobacterial lipid Ags. These T cell lines also showed significant cytotoxicity toward CD1c-expressing target cells even in the absence of mycobacterial Ags, which was shown by clonal analysis to be mediated by a subpopulation of T cells directly reactive to CD1c molecules. Our findings establish the ability of a second member of the CD1 family to restrict responses of Ag-specific T cells, and thus support the general hypothesis that the CD1 family comprises a third lineage of Ag-presenting molecules that presents a novel class of foreign and self Ags to MHC-unrestricted T cells."

Among patients with positive initial anti-PGL-I IgM, a significant decrease in this antibody was seen over time (p less than 0.01), whether assayed by PGL-I or ND-BSA. The two antigens showed good agreement in the detection of decrease in anti-PGL-I IgM. The greatest decrease was seen in patients with a high initial anti-PGL-I IgM and a high bacterial index (BI). Patients with a declining BI were seen to have generally declining antibody levels to PGL-I and to LAM; in those patients with a fluctuating BI, antibody levels were less predictable. We conclude that antibodies to PGL-I and LAM can be useful in following response to therapy in leprosy patients and that either the native PGL-I or ND-BSA can serve as antigen for the ELISA."
CD011420,0,23102462,0,[Production and evaluation of a purified protein derivative from an Argentine strain of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis].,"Purified Protein Derivatives (PPDs) are non-defined antigens prepared from mycobacteria cultures. They are usually employed to evaluate the specific cellular immune response both in animals and humans. Bovine and avian PPDs are usually employed as antigens in mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis and paratuberculosis. Nevertheless, PPD from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, (PPDj) is neither commonly used nor frequently available. However, PPD from Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium is in fact used. We aimed to obtain and evaluate the performance of a PPDj from a local isolate of MAP using the ãInterferon-release assay. The stimulation of ãInterferon-release was significantly different between infected and control cattle when this antigen, named PPDj-IB, was used. Stimulation in the infected animals was similar with both antigens (PPDa and PPDj-IB). However, some animals were positively stimulated with PPDj-IB and not with PPDa. We demonstrated by Western blot that two antigenic molecules, lipoarabinoman and APA/ModD antigen were differentially represented in both PPDs. This could explain the difference in stimulation induction of yIFN observed at individual level. Although PPDj-IB could not improve PPDa performance, we could easily produce an effective purified protein derivative for in vitro assays."
CD011420,0,2467001,0,Use of an antigen-capture assay for characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan.,"Monoclonal antibodies directed to six separate antigen molecules of Mycobacterium leprae have been tested in an antigen-capture assay based on combined use of polyclonal (""capture"") and monoclonal (""detector"") antibody reagents. This approach provides a potentially versatile, sensitive and specific assay for detection and relative quantitation of M. leprae antigens. Characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM-B) by the antigen-capture assay indicates that some of the antigenic determinants present on LAM-B from M. leprae may be either absent altogether or present at much lower concentrations on the corresponding LAM-B structure form M. tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,3147152,0,The inhibitory effects of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan and polysaccharides upon polyclonal and monoclonal human T cell proliferation.,"Lipoarabinomannan from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was able to inhibit antigen induced T cell proliferation of human CD4+ T cell clones specific for influenza virus. The inhibitory effect was also present when peripheral human T cells were stimulated with crude mycobacterial antigen extracts. Non-specific T cell stimulation, i.e. IL-2, PHA and anti-CD3 antibodies coupled to beads, was not affected. The inhibitory property was also found when arabinomannan and arabinogalactan of mycobacterial origin were tested but not with other unrelated polysaccharides used as controls. The effect appears to be related to the processing of the antigen by the antigen-presenting cells, since it was evident when T cell clones were stimulated with whole virus, whereas stimulation with a synthetic peptide containing the relevant epitope was not inhibitable."
CD011420,0,3091602,0,Structure and antigenicity of the phosphorylated lipopolysaccharide antigens from the leprosy and tubercle bacilli.,"A family of major arabinose- and mannose-containing phosphorylated lipopolysaccharides was isolated from Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The only antigenic member of the family, lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-B, was purified by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography in detergent and recovered in large quantities (15 mg/g of bacteria). It yielded a broad diffuse band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but appeared homogeneous by this criterion and gel filtration. Besides arabinose and mannose, it contained glycerol and a polyol phosphate and was acylated by lactate, succinate, palmitate, and 10-methyloctadecanoate. The phosphate was released by alkalinolysis and identified by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as myoinositol 1-phosphate. Thus, the group-specific ""arabinomannan"" of the genus Mycobacterium in the native state is acylated, contains the substituents of phosphatidylinositol, and is apparently membrane associated. LAM-B is one of the dominant immunogens of the leprosy bacillus reacting readily with antibodies from lepromatous leprosy patients and monoclonal antibodies in plate and nitrocellulose enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and on electrophoretic immunoblots. It is immunologically cross-reactive with a like product from M. tuberculosis. LAM-B is clearly the pervasive ""glycoprotein"" antigen of the leprosy bacillus and may be the long sought lipoteichoic acid-like polymer of Mycobacterium with a role in cell wall physiology, macrophage recognition, and perhaps an involvement in cross-protective immunity."

This can be achieved at the point-of-care within just 30 minutes using the Determine TB-LAM, which is a commercially available, lateral-flow urine 'strip test' assay. The assay has been shown to have useful diagnostic accuracy in patients enrolling in antiretroviral treatment services or in HIV-infected patients requiring admission to hospital medical wards in sub-Saharan Africa. Such patients have high mortality risk and have most to gain from rapid diagnosis of TB and immediate initiation of treatment. However, few studies using this assay have yet been reported and many questions remain concerning the correct use of the assay, interpretation of results, the role of the assay as an add-on test within existing diagnostic algorithms and the types of further studies needed. In this paper we address a series of questions with the aim of informing the design, conduct and interpretation of future studies. Specifically, we clarify which clinical populations are most likely to derive benefit from use of this assay and how patients enrolled in such studies might best be characterised. We describe the importance of employing a rigorous microbiological diagnostic reference standard in studies of diagnostic accuracy and discuss issues surrounding the specificity of the assay in different geographical areas and potential cross-reactivity with non-tuberculous mycobacteria and other organisms. We highlight the importance of careful procedures for urine collection and storage and the critical issue of how to read and interpret the test strips. Finally, we consider how the assay could be used in combination with other assays and outline the types of studies that are required to build the evidence base concerning its use."
CD011420,0,12925680,0,Tuberculosis toxin blocking phagosome maturation inhibits a novel Ca2+/calmodulin-PI3K hVPS34 cascade.,"The capacity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to infect latently over one billion people and cause two million fatalities annually rests with its ability to block phagosomal maturation into the phagolysosome in infected macrophages. Here we describe how M. tuberculosis toxin lipoarabinomannan (LAM) causes phagosome maturation arrest, interfering with a new pathway connecting intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. LAM from virulent M. tuberculosis, but not from avirulent mycobacteria, blocked cytosolic Ca2+ increase. Ca2+ and calmodulin were required for a newly uncovered Ca2+/calmodulin phosphatidylinositol (PI)3 kinase hVPS34 cascade, essential for production of PI 3 phosphate (PI3P) on liposomes in vitro and on phagosomes in vivo. The interference of the trafficking toxin LAM with the calmodulin-dependent production of PI3P described here ensures long-term M. tuberculosis residence in vacuoles sequestered away from the bactericidal and antigen-processing organelles in infected macrophages."

The sensitivity in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis negative for acid-fast bacilli in sputum was 67%. Less favorable results were obtained for patients with AIDS and tuberculosis, with a sensitivity of 57%. The specificity in control patients with lung diseases different from tuberculosis and in healthy subjects was 100%.

The results of this study suggest that the detection of lipoarabinomannan is an accurate test for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,7684503,0,Regulation of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene by mycobacterial components and lipopolysaccharide is mediated by two nuclear factor-IL6 motifs.,"The cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are released by mononuclear phagocytes in vitro after stimulation with mycobacteria and are considered to mediate pathophysiologic events, including granuloma formation and systemic symptoms. We demonstrated that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall component lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a very potent inducer of IL-1 beta gene expression in human monocytes and investigated the mechanism of this effect. We localized the LAM-, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, and TNF-alpha-inducible promoter activity to a -131/+15 (positions -131 to +15) DNA fragment of the IL-1 beta gene by deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Within this DNA fragment, there were two novel 9-bp motifs (-90/-82 and -40/-32) with high homology to the nuclear factor-IL6 (NF-IL6) binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the two NF-IL-6 motifs could be independently activated by LAM, LPS, or TNF-alpha and that they acted in an orientation-independent manner. DNA mobility shift assay revealed specific binding of nuclear protein(s) from LAM-, LPS-, or TNF-alpha-stimulated THP-1 cells to the NF-IL6 motifs. We conclude that the two NF-IL6 sites mediate induction of IL-1 beta in response to the stimuli LAM, LPS, and TNF-alpha."

A presumed critical step in the biosynthesis of ManLAM, and other mannose-containing glycoconjugates, is the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, by a phosphomannomutase (PMM), to produce GDP-mannose, the primary mannose-donor in mycobacteria. We have identified four M. tb H37Rv genes with similarity to known PMMs. Using in vivo complementation of PMM and phosphoglucomutase (PGM) deficient strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an in vitro enzyme assay, we have identified both PMM and PGM activity from one of these genes, Rv3257c (MtmanB). MtmanB overexpression in M. smegmatis produced increased levels of LAM, lipomannan, and phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) compared with control strains and led to a 13.3 +/- 3.9-fold greater association of mycobacteria with human macrophages, in a mannan-inhibitable fashion. This increased association was mediated by the overproduction of higher order PIMs that possess mannose cap structures. We conclude that MtmanB encodes a functional PMM involved in the biosynthesis of mannosylated lipoglycans that participate in the association of mycobacteria with macrophage phagocytic receptors."

On the contrary, only 4% of healthy volunteers (1 out of 25 persons) were positive on this test. In conclusion, this diagnostic kit might be a useful test for early and supportive diagnosis of mycobacterial infections based on its sensitivity and specificity."

The anti-LAM results were further evaluated using urine LAM detection and a clinical diagnostic score (DS) system as references. Using sputum AFB as a reference, positive anti-LAM was found in 66.9% of 139 AFB-positive PTB, 34.4% of 61 AFB-negative PTB and 23.5% of 800 non-TB patients and in 8% of 50 healthy individuals. The positive and negative predictive values were 48.7% and 87.4%, respectively. Using the DS as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity were 50.5% and 78.3%, respectively, whereas 45.8% of urine LAM positives and 77.9% of urine LAM negatives were correctly identified by the anti-LAM ELISA. In TB endemic areas a negative anti-LAM could be of practical value, particularly when other indicators of PTB are negative. Using any of these methods as a reference, a positive anti-LAM would mislead in about one-quarter of cases. Had all the 3 methods been combined and at least 2 positive tests sufficed, 90.6% of AFB-positive PTB, 52.5% of AFB-negative PTB and 94.9% of non-TB patients would have been correctly diagnosed. Apart from the possible impact of HIV, the low accuracy of the current assay could be due to intravascular formation of LAM-anti-LAM complexes, latent TB or environmental mycobacterial infections."
CD011420,0,8787690,0,Induction of monocyte expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha by the 30-kD alpha antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and synergism with fibronectin.,"Native 30-kD antigen, also known as alpha antigen, is a fibronectin-binding protein that is secreted by live Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This antigen may play an important biological role in the host-parasite interaction since it elicits delayed type hypersensitivity response and protective immunity in vivo and T lymphocyte blastogenesis and IFN-gamma production in vitro. In the present study, we show that, TNF-alpha protein is produced in monocyte culture supernatants in response to 30-kD antigen and the level is as high as that to purified protein derivative of M. tuberculosis. This stimulatory effect was not due to contamination with either bacterial lipopolysaccharide or mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan. The preincubation of monocytes with plasma fibronectin significantly enhanced the release of TNF-alpha into the culture supernatants in response to 30-kD antigen. This effect was blocked by polygonal antibody to plasma fibronectin. In contrast, the monocytic cell line U937 failed to release TNF-alpha protein in the culture supernatants in response to 30-kD antigen with or without preincubation with plasma fibronectin. To determine whether this observation was due to differential binding of the 30-kD to fibronectin on these cells, a cell based ELISA was used. Pretreatment of monocytes with fibronectin enhanced their binding of the 30-kD antigen. U937 cells bound the 30-kD antigen weakly with or without fibronectin pretreatment. These results indicate that 30-kD antigen which is a known secretary antigen of M. tuberculosis is a stimulus for human monocytes to express TNF-alpha and that stimulatory effect may be mediated through plasma fibronectin."

In order to evaluate this response, alveolar macrophages harvested from nonvaccinated and Mycobacterium bovis BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs were infected in vitro with live M. tuberculosis H37Ra or H37Rv (multiplicity of infection, 1:1) or cultured with lipopolysaccharide (10 micro g/ml) for 3, 12, and 24 h. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR. Culture supernatants were assayed for guinea pig IL-8 protein by using a human IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Alveolar macrophages harvested from BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs produced significantly more mRNA and protein for IL-8 than alveolar macrophages harvested from nonvaccinated guinea pigs at 12 and 24 h poststimulation or postinfection. Infection with attenuated M. tuberculosis (H37Ra) stimulated alveolar macrophages isolated from BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs to produce significantly more IL-8 mRNA than did alveolar macrophages infected with a virulent strain (H37Rv) at 12 and 24 h postinfection. Significant MCP-1 mRNA production was also detected in stimulated or infected alveolar macrophages; however, prior vaccination did not significantly affect levels of MCP-1 mRNA. Alveolar macrophages isolated from BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs produced significantly more IL-8 mRNA and protein when stimulated for 24 h with heat-killed H37Ra, heat-killed H37Rv, and H37Rv cell wall, but not mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), than did cells stimulated with media alone. These observations indicate that prior vaccination may alter very early events in the M. tuberculosis-infected lung."
CD011420,0,19577573,0,Structural insights into antibody recognition of mycobacterial polysaccharides.,"Mycobacteria are major human pathogens responsible for such serious and widespread diseases as tuberculosis and leprosy. Among the evolutionary adaptations essential for pathogenicity in mycobacteria is a complex carbohydrate-rich cell-wall structure that contains as a major immunomodulatory molecule the polysaccharide lipoarabinomannan (LAM). We report here crystal structures of three fragments from the non-reducing termini of LAM in complex with a murine antibody Fab fragment (CS-35Fab). These structures reveal for the first time the three-dimensional structures of key components of LAM and the molecular basis of LAM recognition at between 1.8- and 2.0-A resolution. The antigen-binding site of CS-35Fab forms three binding pockets that show a high degree of complementarity to the reducing end, the branch point and one of the non-reducing ends of the Y-shaped hexasaccharide moiety found at most of the non-reducing termini of LAM. Structures of CS-35Fab bound to two additional tetrasaccharides confirm the general mode of binding seen in the hexasaccharide and indicate how different parts of LAM are recognized. Altogether, these structures provide a rational basis for understanding the overall architecture of LAM and identify the key elements of an epitope that may be exploited for the development of novel and more effective anti-mycobacterial vaccines. Moreover, this study represents the first high-resolution X-ray crystallographic investigation of oligofuranoside-protein recognition."

Overall, study quality was a concern. For pulmonary TB (47 studies, 5,036 participants), sensitivity estimates ranged from 2% to 100% and specificity from 33% to 100%. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) was the antigen most frequently targeted (23 studies, 49%). The pooled sensitivity of urine LAM was higher in HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected individuals (47%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26 to 68% versus 14%; 95% CI, 4 to 38%); pooled specificity estimates were similar: 96%; 95% CI, 81 to 100% and 97%; 95% CI, 86 to 100%, respectively. For extrapulmonary TB (21 studies, 1,616 participants), sensitivity estimates ranged from 0% to 100% and specificity estimates from 62% to 100%. Five studies targeting LAM, ESAT-6, Ag85 complex, and the 65-kDa antigen in cerebrospinal fluid, when pooled, yielded the highest sensitivity (87%; 95% CI, 61 to 98%), but low specificity (84%; 95% CI, 60 to 95%). Because of the limited number of studies targeting any specific antigen other than LAM, we could not draw firm conclusions about the overall clinical usefulness of these tests. Further studies are warranted to determine the value of LAM detection for TB meningitis in high-HIV-prevalence settings. Considering that antigen detection tests could be translated into rapid point-of-care tests, research to improve their performance is urgently needed."
CD011420,0,24274710,1,Reasons for false-positive lipoarabinomannan ELISA results in a Tanzanian population.,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a cell wall component of mycobacteria, can be detected in the urine of tuberculosis (TB) patients. Advantages of this diagnostic include the ease of sample collection and test methods. However, as with most new TB diagnostics, LAM tests have been evaluated in well-controlled laboratory settings and subsequently need assessment under real working conditions. Our experience showed that the diagnosis of TB using the detection of LAM in urine under field conditions is prone to false-positive results due to contamination. Dust and soil, but also stool, seemed to lead to increased OD values and thus false-positive results of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for LAM; however, contamination with blood, as well as bacterial or fungal organisms, had no influence. The collection of urine for the detection of LAM should therefore follow strict collection criteria in order to avoid contamination."
CD011420,0,2126265,0,Evaluation of lipoarabinomannan for the serological diagnosis of tuberculosis.,"The availability of highly purified lipoarabinomannan from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in its native acylated, highly antigenic state allowed its application to the serodiagnosis of tuberculosis in patients from the Republic of Mexico. Antilipoarabinomannan immunoglobulin G antibodies in sera from 66 patients with pulmonary, miliary, and pleural tuberculosis and tuberculosis lymphadenities were measured by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against sera from a control population of healthy individuals, people with histoplasmosis, and people with lung diseases not caused by mycobacteria. The results pointed to an unexpectedly high degree of specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 72%, comparable to figures from previous studies with other purified antigens; most of the false-positive results were for patients with histoplasmosis. Thus, lipoarabinomannan of M. tuberculosis is a potentially useful antigen for the serodiagnosis of tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,23175600,0,Real-time Recognition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Lipoarabinomannan using the Quartz Crystal Microbalance.,"A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunosensor has been successfully employed to screen for both whole Mycobacteria tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli and a Mtb surface antigen, lipoarabinomannan (LAM). One of the most abundant components of the Mtb cell surface, LAM, may be detected without the presence of the entire bacterium. Using available antibodies with proven utility in enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs), a sensor was designed to measure Mtb bacilli and LAM. Equilibrium association constants (K(a)) were determined for the interaction of Mtb with immobilized α-LAM and anti-H37Rv antibodies, where avidity was seen to strengthen this interaction and provide for greater binding than might have otherwise been achieved. The binding of LAM to immobilized α-LAM had a high associate rate constant (k(a)) allowing for rapid detection. Evaluating these binding constants helped the compare the sensitivity of these immunosensors to conventional ELISAs. The use of these assays with the better antibodies may allow for immunosensor use in determining LAM as a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic for Mtb."

ELISA detecting IgG, IgA and IgM against antigens: 38 kDa and 16 kDa, 38kDa and lipoarabinomannan, and A-60 were used. Mean IgG level was higher in TB compared to healthy controls (p<0,001). Mean IgG level against 38kDa and 38 + 16 kDa mycobacterial antigens was higher in TB than in MOTT group. Mean level of the IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against LAM was higher in MOTT compared to TB patients. In all subgroups person-to-person heterogeneity of antigen recognition was observed. Humoral immune response to recombinant mycobacterial antigens significantly differs in TB and MOTT patients."
CD011420,0,19129468,0,Humoral immune responses of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination and experimental challenge with M. bovis.,"Monitoring of the kinetics of production of serum antibodies to multiple mycobacterial antigens can be useful as a diagnostic tool for the detection of Mycobacterium bovis infection as well as for the characterization of disease progression and the efficacy of intervention strategies in several species. The humoral immune responses to multiple M. bovis antigens by white-tailed deer vaccinated with BCG orally via a lipid-formulated bait (n=5), orally in liquid form (n=5), and subcutaneously (n=6) were evaluated over time after vaccination and after experimental challenge with virulent M. bovis and were compared to the responses by unvaccinated deer (n=6). Antibody responses were evaluated by using a rapid test (RT), a multiantigen print immunoassay (MAPIA), a lipoarabinomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (LAM-ELISA), and immunoblotting to whole-cell sonicate and recombinant antigen MPB83. MAPIA and RT detected minimal to no antibody responses over those at the baseline to multiple M. bovis antigens in vaccinated white-tailed deer after challenge. This was in contrast to the presence of more readily detectable antibody responses in nonvaccinated deer with more advanced disease. The LAM-ELISA results indicated an overall decrease in the level of production of detectable antibodies against lipoarabinomannan-enriched mycobacterial antigen in vaccinated animals compared to that in nonvaccinated animals after challenge. Immunoblot data were inconsistent but did suggest the occurrence of unique antibody responses by certain vaccinated groups to Ag85 and HSP70. These findings support further research toward the improvement and potential use of antibody-based assays, such as MAPIA, RT, and LAM-ELISA, as tools for the antemortem assessment of disease progression in white-tailed deer in both experimental and field vaccine trials."

We determined the characteristics and early ART program outcomes of such patients.
CD011420,0,7683696,0,Mechanisms of stimulation of interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by Mycobacterium tuberculosis components.,"The granulomatous immune response in tuberculosis is characterized by delayed hypersensitivity and is mediated by various cytokines released by the stimulated mononuclear phagocytes, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and IL-1 beta. We have demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall component lipoarabinomannan (LAM), mycobacterial heat shock protein-65 kD, and M. tuberculosis culture filtrate, devoid of LPS as assessed by the Amebocyte Lysate assay, stimulate the production of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta proteins and mRNA from mononuclear phagocytes (THP-1 cells). The effect of LAM on the release of these cytokines was specific, as only LAM stimulation was inhibited by anti-LAM monoclonal antibody. Interestingly, we found that LAM and Gram-negative bacterial cell wall-associated endotoxin LPS may share a similar mechanism in their stimulatory action as demonstrated by inhibition of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta release by monoclonal antibodies to CD14. Anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody MY4 inhibited both TNF alpha and IL-1 beta release with LAM and LPS but no effect was observed with other mycobacterial proteins. An isotype antibody control did not inhibit release of cytokines under the same experimental conditions. M. tuberculosis and its components upregulated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNAs in THP-1 cells. Nuclear run-on assay for IL-1 beta demonstrated that LAM increased the transcription rate. The induction of IL-1 beta was regulated at the transcriptional level, in which these stimuli acted through cis-acting element(s) on the 5' flanking region of the IL-1 beta genomic DNA. M. tuberculosis cell wall component LAM acts similarly to LPS in activating mononuclear phagocyte cytokine TNF alpha and IL-1 beta release through CD14 and synthesis at the transcriptional level; both cytokines are key participants in the host immune response to tuberculosis."

CD011420,0,9008794,0,Competitive and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Mycobacterium bovis infections based on MPB70 and lipoarabinomannan antigens.,"A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA) using M. bovis BCG Tokyo culture filtrate as antigen and anti-MPB70 4C3/17 monoclonal antibody was developed for use in multiple animal species. An analysis of the C-ELISA data for cattle and bison serum panels revealed specificities of 68% to 85% and sensitivities of 85% to 89%. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) of this data revealed areas of 81% to 92% for C-ELISA and demonstrated that C-ELISA as well as the indirect ELISA protocols, MPB70-ELISA and LAM-ELISA, discriminate M. bovis infected animals from non-infected animals for these particular panels. The kappa statistic values for agreement beyond chance between C-ELISA and MPB70-ELISA were determined after ELISA cutoffs were adjusted to minimize false positives. There were poor to excellent agreements between C-ELISA and MPB70-ELISA in all species tested (Bovidae, Cervidae, and Camelidae) that were consistently higher than the kappa statistic between C-ELISA and LAM-ELISA. The humoral response to one antigen and little or no response to the other in many animals argued for a parallel interpretation of C-ELISA and LAM-ELISA to increase sensitivity."
CD011420,0,16092920,0,Deciphering the molecular bases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis binding to the lectin DC-SIGN reveals an underestimated complexity.,"Interactions between dendritic cells and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the aetiological agent of tuberculosis in humans, are thought to be central to anti-mycobacterial immunity. We have previously shown that M. tuberculosis binds to human monocyte-derived dendritic cells mostly through the C-type lectin DC-SIGN (dendritic-cell-specific intercellular molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin)/CD209, and we have suggested that DC-SIGN may discriminate between mycobacterial species through recognition of the mannose-capping residues on the lipoglycan lipoarabinomannan of the bacterial envelope. Here, using a variety of fast- and slow-growing Mycobacterium species, we provide further evidence that mycobacteria recognition by DC-SIGN may be restricted to species of the M. tuberculosis complex. Fine analyses of the lipoarabinomannan molecules purified from these species show that the structure and amount of these molecules alone cannot account for such a preferential recognition. We propose that M. tuberculosis recognition by DC-SIGN relies on both a potential difference of accessibility of lipoarabinomannan in its envelope and, more probably, on the binding of additional ligands, possibly including lipomannan, mannose-capped arabinomannan, as well as the mannosylated 19 kDa and 45 kDa [Apa (alanine/proline-rich antigen)] glycoproteins. Altogether, our results reveal that the molecular basis of M. tuberculosis binding to DC-SIGN is more complicated than previously thought and provides further insight into the mechanisms of M. tuberculosis recognition by the immune system."
CD011420,0,23105508,0,"Diagnostic role of the antibody response to the 38kDa, 16kDa proteins and lipoarabinomannan of mycobacterium tuberculosis.","The antibody response to the 38kDa, 16kDa and Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigens ofMycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated using three different ELISAs based on these antigens. The study group included tuberculosis patients (n=52), patients with HIV and TB co-infection (n=10), other chest symptomatics (n=5), HIV infected individuals (n=10), leprosy cases (n=7) and healthy controls (n=75). The results indicate that the 38kDa and LAM based ELISA for IgM/IgG has a low specificity (ranging from 69-85%) and sensitivity (ranging from 55-78%). When three ELISAs are carried out on a single patient the probability of detection of tuberculosis was significantly increased to 95.2% indicating that a single ELISA test is of low sensitivity and that a combination of ELISA's may be needed to be of any value as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis. Additionally, a western blot assay of the serum antibody response to protein fraction ofM. tuberculosis was analysed in 15 tuberculosis patients and five healthy controls. A multiple antibody response to various M.tuberculosis proteins was observed which varied from patient to patient as compared to controls who showed a single 38-39 kDa protein band positivity. These finding suggest that a western blot assay which determines the antibody response to a set of antigenic components ofM. tuberculosis could be a better serological test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in our population."
CD011420,0,22169090,0,Comparative evaluation of profiles of antibodies to mycobacterial capsular polysaccharides in tuberculosis patients and controls stratified by HIV status.,"Despite the complexity of tuberculosis (TB) serology, antibodies (Abs) remain attractive biomarkers for TB. Recent evidence of a mycobacterial capsule that consists mainly of the polysaccharides arabinomannan (AM) and glucan provides new options for serologic targets. For this study, Ab responses to AM and glucan for 47 U.S. TB patients (33 HIV negative [HIV(-)], 14 HIV positive [HIV(+)]), 42 healthy controls, and 38 asymptomatic HIV(+) controls were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The results were compared with Ab responses to the mycobacterial glycolipid cell wall antigen lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and to the proteins malate synthase (MS) and MPT51. We found that the main immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype response to polysaccharides was IgG, predominantly of subclass IgG2. IgG responses to AM were significantly higher for HIV(-) and HIV(+) TB cases than for controls (P, <0.0001 and <0.01, respectively); significantly higher for HIV(-) than for HIV(+) TB cases (P, <0.01); and significantly higher in sputum smear-positive than smear-negative patients in both HIV(-) and HIV(+) cases (P, 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). In both TB groups, titers of Ab to glucan were significantly lower than titers of Ab to AM (P, <0.0001). IgG responses to AM and MS or to AM and MPT51 did not correlate with each other in HIV(-) TB patients, while they correlated significantly in HIV(+) TB patients (P, 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). We conclude that Ab responses to AM could contribute to the serodiagnosis of TB, especially for HIV(-) TB patients. This study also provides new and important insights into the differences in the profiles of Abs to mycobacterial antigens between HIV(-) and HIV(+) TB patients."
CD011420,0,15611594,0,Diagnostic value of different serological tests for tuberculosis in Poland.,"The aim of the study was to test the diagnostic accuracy of several serological assays for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in the Polish population. ELISA based assays detecting: 38 kDa+LAM - MycoM, MycoA and MycoG, 38 kDa - Pathozyme TB complex, 38 kDa+16 kDa - Pathozyme TB complex plus were used. The humoral immune response was analyzed in a group of 319 TB patients (289 adults and 30 children) and in a control group consisting of 66 sarcoidosis cases, 16 cases of mycobacterial infections other than tuberculosis, 35 lung cancer patients, and 70 healthy volunteers. Among the TB patients, there were 267 cases of pulmonary TB and 52 cases of extrapulmonary TB. Sensitivity varied between 32% (IgM) and 63% (IgA) and increased in culture positive tuberculosis and in chronic cases. Specificity was the highest for the tests based on recombinant antibodies (98%). Sensitivity of the IgG test in extrapulmonary TB was comparable with that in pulmonary TB. Overall, sensitivity of the examined tests was lower in children than in adults, but it varied depending on the age and phase of the disease. We conclude that the ELISA-based tests may be a useful tool for improving the diagnosis of TB, especially in adults and in those countries where the prevalence of culture positive and chronic cases is high."
CD011420,0,2128836,0,Sub acute and chronic meningitis in children--an immunological study of cerebrospinal fluid.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 274 cases of subacute to chronic meningitis in age groups from 3 months to 12 years were analysed for the presence of antibody response to mycobacterial and cysticercal antigens by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Simultaneously other correlative parameters such as CSF cell cytology by cytospin studies, mycobacterial antigens of Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) type (a polysaccharide antigen) by reverse passive haemagglutination assay (RPHA) CSF C-reactive protein (CRP) by latex agglutination and microbial cultures for mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungi were carried out. Antimycobacterial antibody was present in 35.4% of the cases. In 57.66% of the cases there was no demonstrable immune response to either mycobacterial or cysticercal antigens. However, it was interesting to note that 5.47% of the cases revealed the presence of anticysticercal antibody in the CSF. The mycobacterial antigen (LAM polysaccharide antigen) was found in 72.6% of the cases. There was no evidence of carcinomatous or cryptococcal meningitis. This study stresses the role of multimodal diagnostic tests on CSF for investigating cases of chronic and subacute meningitis irrespective of leading clues such as tuberculosis."
CD011420,0,8132212,0,"A longitudinal study of per cent agalactosyl IgG in tuberculosis patients receiving chemotherapy, with or without immunotherapy.","An increased percentage of circulating IgG molecules that lack galactose from the oligosaccharides on the CH2 domain correlates with disease severity in tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. We have recently observed that a single injection of 10(9) autoclaved Mycobacterium vaccae given to tuberculosis patients 7 days after the initiation of chemotherapy causes accelerated clinical improvement, and clearance of bacilli from the sputum. We now show that this immunotherapy also causes rapid loss of agalactosyl IgG, detectable within 14-21 days, whereas chemotherapy alone causes agalactosyl IgG to rise further for up to 2 months. There is simultaneous inhibition of the antibody response to lipoarabinomannan, and transient enhancement of the tuberculin skin-test response. These findings are compatible with a shift from antibody production towards increased cell-mediated immunity. The ideal treatment for tuberculosis would supplement a truncated course of chemotherapy with an immunotherapeutic preparation able to down-regulate the Koch phenomenon and replace it with an efficiently bactericidal mechanism. We tentatively postulate that a fall in per cent agalactosyl IgG [%Gal(0)] in tuberculosis patients may be a marker of such a change."

CD011420,0,21996698,0,Tuberculosis in antiretroviral treatment services in resource-limited settings: addressing the challenges of screening and diagnosis.,"The high burden of tuberculosis (TB) among patients accessing antiretroviral treatment (ART) services in resource-limited settings is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is associated with nosocomial transmission risk. These risks are greatly compounded by multidrug-resistant disease. Screening and diagnosis of TB in this clinical setting is difficult. However, progress has been made in defining a high-sensitivity, standardized symptom screening tool that assesses a combination of symptoms, rather than relying on report of cough alone. Moreover, newly emerging diagnostic tools show great promise in providing more rapid diagnosis of TB, which is predominantly sputum smear-negative. These include culture-based systems, simplified versions of nucleic acid amplification tests (such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay), and detection of lipoarabinomannan antigen in urine. In addition, new molecular diagnostics now permit rapid detection of drug resistance. Further development and implementation of these tools is vital to permit rapid and effective screening for TB in ART services, which is an essential component of patient care."

CD011420,0,24429376,0,Application of lipoarabinomannan antigen in tuberculosis diagnostics: current evidence.,"Tests based on the detection of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen in urine have emerged as potential point-of-care tests for tuberculosis (TB). We aimed to assimilate the current evidence regarding the diagnostic performance of LAM assays and to ascertain their clinical indication in settings with high and low prevalence of HIV-TB co-infection. Owing to suboptimal sensitivity, the urinary LAM assays are unsuitable as general screening tests for TB. However, unlike traditional diagnostic methods, they demonstrate improved sensitivity in HIV-TB co-infection which further increases with low CD4 counts. Accordingly, these assays are indicated as rule-in tests for TB in patients with advanced HIV-induced immunosuppression, and facilitate the early initiation of antituberculous treatment in them. They also offer incremental sensitivity and specificity when used as adjunct tests to smear microscopy and chest radiography in HIV-TB co-infection. They obviate the biohazards associated with sputum samples and provide an alternative diagnostic tool in sputum-scarce patients. Notwithstanding these advantages, the specificity of these assays is variable, which is mostly attributable to misclassification bias and cross-reactivity with non-tuberculous mycobacteria or other commensal flora. Furthermore, the inability to detect low titres of antigen in HIV-uninfected patients makes these assays unsuitable for use in settings with a low HIV prevalence. Future research targeted towards inclusion of specific monoclonal antibodies and more sensitive immunoassay platforms might help to improve the diagnostic performance of these assays and extend their applicability to the general population of patients with TB."

The Determine TB LAM Ag (TB LAM) test is a lateral flow immunochromatographic test for detection of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in urine. Our objective was to determine sensitivity and specificity of the TB LAM test for tuberculosis diagnosis."
CD011420,0,23562367,0,Immunogenicity of mycobacterial vesicles in humans: identification of a new tuberculosis antibody biomarker.,"Biomarkers for active tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. Mycobacteria produce membrane vesicles (MVs) that contain concentrated immune-modulatory factors that are released into the host. We evaluated the human immune responses to BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MVs to characterize the antibody responses and identify potentially novel TB biomarkers. Serological responses to MVs were evaluated by ELISAs and immunoblots with sera from 16 sputum smear-positive, 12 smear-negative HIV uninfected pulmonary TB patients and 16 BCG vaccinated Tuberculin skin-test positive controls with and without latent tuberculosis infection. MVs from both BCG and M. tuberculosis induced similar responses and were strongly immunogenic in TB patients but not in controls. Several MV-associated antigens appear to induce robust antibody responses, in particular the arabinomanan portion of the cell wall glycolipid lipoarabinomannan. Three proteins at ≈ 36, 25, and 23 kDa were simultaneously recognized by sera from 16/16 smear-positive, 9/12 smear-negative TB patients and 0/16 controls. These results provide promise and encouragement that antibody responses to proteins enriched in MVs of pathogenic mycobacteria may constitute a novel TB biomarker signature that could have diagnostic information."
CD011420,0,15102070,0,Evidence for a rhesus monkey model of asymptomatic tuberculosis.,"Rhesus monkeys (RM) were inoculated intrabronchially with graded doses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains Erdman and H37Rv in an effort to produce a model of asymptomatic tuberculosis infection. Erdman strain produced active disease within 7-11 weeks regardless of dose. Low doses of H37Rv resulted in asymptomatic infections; high doses produced active disease within 11 weeks. Over a 4-month period of post-inoculation study, MTB culture-filtrate protein (CFP)-stimulated bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BALC) and blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from monkeys with active disease (30 cfu Erdman-inoculated) or asymptomatic infection (200 cfu H37Rv-inoculated) produced similar significant quantities of mRNA encoding for IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha, but insignificant quantities of IL-4 mRNA. Differences were observed in antigen-induced in vitro blastogenic responses and serum anti-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antibody responses in animals with active compared with asymptomatic MTB infections. The results indicate that RM are a good model for the study of asymptomatic tuberculosis infections using low doses of H37Rv."

Sensitive and resistant strains did not significantly differ in viability and cytotoxicity. The highest death of infected macrophages was observed was seen with infection of M. tuberculosis of the Beijing B0 genotype, the least one seen with that of LAM with the similar rate of multiple drug resistance. There was a correlation of the changes in the count of lymphocytes in patients with the genetic affiliation of a causative agent. The severest course of the tuberculous process was observed in baseline lymphopenia (before treatment) in combination with multidrug resistance of mycobacteria, high and moderate cytotoxicity and high viability.

CD011420,0,21996695,1,"Adjunctive tests for diagnosis of tuberculosis: serology, ELISPOT for site-specific lymphocytes, urinary lipoarabinomannan, string test, and fine needle aspiration.","The diagnostic gold standard for active tuberculosis (TB) is the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by culture or molecular methods. However, despite its limited sensitivity, sputum smear microscopy is still the mainstay of TB diagnosis in resource-limited settings. Consequently, diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB remains challenging in such settings. A number of novel or alternative techniques could provide adjunctive diagnostic use in the context of difficult-to-diagnose TB. These may be especially useful in certain patient groups such as persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and children, who are disproportionably affected by smear-negative and extrapulmonary disease and who are also most adversely affected by delays in TB diagnosis and treatment. We review a selection of these methods that are independent of nucleic acid amplification techniques and could largely be implemented in resource-limited settings in current or adapted versions. Specifically, we discuss the diagnostic use and potential of serologic tests based on detection of antibodies to MTB antigens; interferon gamma release assays using site-specific lymphocytes; detection of lipoarabinomannan, a glycolipid of MTB, in urine; the string test, a novel technique to retrieve lower respiratory tract samples; and fine needle aspiration biopsy of lymph nodes."

Sera from 269 adults (age > 15) and 33 children (age < 5) were assayed for antibodies in a blind manner and the results compared to the clinical status of tuberculosis. The assay had a specificity and a sensitivity of 92.4% and 63.0% respectively, when applied to the adult population. In HIV-2 infected individuals (27/269), the specificity and sensitivity of the assay were similar, 94.7% and 62.5% respectively. The assay did not provide high sensitivity for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in children. Sera from patients with leprosy cross-reacted with the antigen of the assay. It is concluded that this easily performed assay may be useful for the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis in adult populations in rural areas of developing countries where routine screening is not readily available."
CD011420,0,2127645,0,Production of monoclonal antibodies to lipoarabinomannan-B and use in the detection of mycobacterial antigens in sputum.,"Tuberculosis has traditionally been confirmed by AFB staining or culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis from clinical specimens. However, because of the low sensitivity of the sputum smear examination and of the delayed report in culturing, the conventional methods for detection of M. tuberculosis have not been always satisfactory. In an attempt to develop an alternate tool, this study was initiated to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to lipoarabinomannan B (LAM-B) antigen and to use the antibodies in detecting mycobacteria. In this study, five monoclonal antibodies specific to LAM-B were produced; LAM701 (IgG3), LAM138 (IgM), LAM204 (IgM), LAM302 (IgM), and LAM604 (IgM). A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detecting LAM-B and other mycobacterial antigens using the monoclonal antibodies. With the MAb LAM701, the minimal detectable concentration was 1.0 ng/ml for LAM-B, and 1.0 microgram/ml for M. tuberculosis whole cells, respectively. When 14 clinical specimens proven to contain AFB by smear staining or culture were examined, ten (71.4%) were positive by the sandwich ELISA; in contrast, sputum smear examination gave positive results in only six (42.9%) specimens. Meanwhile, none of 25 specimens with no evidence of AFB were positive by the sandwich ELISA using the MAb LAM701. Although further evaluations are required, this study suggests that the monoclonal antibodies to LAM-B may be useful in detecting mycobacteria from clinical specimens."
CD011420,0,12368438,0,Characterization of the epitope of anti-lipoarabinomannan antibodies as the terminal hexaarabinofuranosyl motif of mycobacterial arabinans.,"mAb CS-35 is representative of a large group of antibodies with similar binding specificities that were generated against the Mycobacterium leprae lipopolysaccharide, lipoarabinomannan (LAM), and which cross-reacted extensively with LAMs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria. That this antibody also cross-reacts with the arabinogalactan (AG) of the mycobacterial cell wall, suggesting that it recognizes a common arabinofuranosyl (Araf)-containing sequence in AG and LAM, is demonstrated. The antibody reacted more avidly with 'AraLAM' (LAM with naked Araf termini) compared to 'ManLAM' (in which many Araf termini are capped with mannose residues) and mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex (in which the terminal Araf units are substituted with mycolic acids). Neither did the antibody bind to AG from emb knock-out mutants deficient in the branched hexa-Araf termini of AG. These results indicate that the terminal Araf residues of mycobacterial arabinan are essential for binding. Competitive ELISA using synthetic oligosaccharides showed that the branched hexa-Araf methyl glycoside [beta-D-Araf-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1-)(2)-(3 and 5)-alpha-D-Araf-(1-->5)-alpha-D-Araf-OCH(3)] was the best competitor among those tested. The related linear methyl glycoside, beta-D-Araf-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1-->5)-alpha-D-Araf-(1-->5)-alpha-D-Araf-OCH(3), representing one linear segment of the branched hexa-Araf, was less effective and the other linear tetrasaccharide, beta-D-Araf-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Araf-(1-->5)-alpha-D-Araf-OCH(3), was ineffective. The combined results suggest that the minimal epitope recognized by antibody CS-35 encompasses the beta-D-Araf-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1-->5)-alpha-D-Araf-(1-->5)-alpha-D-Araf within the branched hexa-Araf motif of mycobacterial arabinans, whether present in LAM or AG."

We selected the putative glycosyltransferase-Rv2174 from M. tuberculosis and deleted its orthologue NCgl2093 from C. glutamicum. This resulted in the formation of a novel truncated lipomannan (Cg-t-LM) and a complete ablation of LM/LAM biosynthesis. Purification and characterization of Cg-t-LM revealed an overall decrease in molecular mass, a reduction of alpha(1-->6) and alpha(1-->2) glycosidic linkages illustrating a reduced degree of branching compared with wild-type LM. The deletion mutant's biochemical phenotype was fully complemented by either NCgl2093 or Rv2174. Furthermore, the use of a synthetic neoglycolipid acceptor in an in vitro cell-free assay utilizing the sugar donor beta-D-mannopyranosyl-1-monophosphoryl-decaprenol together with the neoglycolipid acceptor alpha-D-Manp-(1-->6)-alpha-D-Manp-O-C8 as a substrate, confirmed NCgl2093 and Rv2174 as an alpha(1-->6) mannopyranosyltransferase (MptA), involved in the latter stages of the biosynthesis of the alpha(1-->6) mannan core of LM.

Cytokines have been identified by immunohistochemistry in granulomas in animal models of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infection and are released by mononuclear phagocytes upon stimulation by mycobacterial proteins. In this regard, the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) may play a role in the clinical manifestations and pathological events of tuberculosis infection. We have demonstrated that lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from the mycobacterial cell wall, which was virtually devoid of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), stimulated mononuclear phagocytes to release IL-6 in a dose-response manner. LAM and LPS were potent inducers of IL-6 gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes. Both LAM- and LPS-inducible IL-6 promoter activity was localized to a DNA fragment, positions -158 to -49, by deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Two nuclear factor NF-IL6 (positions -153 to -145 and -83 to -75) and one nuclear factor NF-kappa B (positions -72 to -63) motifs are present within this fragment. Site-directed mutagenesis of one or more of these motifs within the IL-6 promoter demonstrated that each has positive regulatory activity and that they could act in a function- and orientation-independent manner. Deletion of all three elements abolished inducibility of IL-6 promoter activity by both LAM and LPS. We conclude that the NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B sites mediate IL-6 induction in response to both LPS and LAM, acting as bacterial or mycobacterial response elements."

Methods presently in use for diagnosis of mycobacterial infections include bacterial culture, nucleic acid amplification, tuberculin skin test, interferon-γ assay, and serology. Serological tests have several advantages over other methods, including short turn-around time, relatively simple procedures, and low cost. However, current serodiagnostic methods for TB, bTB and JD exhibit low sensitivity and/or specificity. Recent studies that have aimed to develop improved serodiagnostic tests have mostly focused on identifying useful species-specific protein antigens. A review of recent attempts to improve diagnostic test performance indicates that the use of multiple antigens can improve the accuracy of serodiagnosis of these mycobacterial diseases. Mycobacteria also produce a variety of species-specific nonprotein molecules; however, only a few such molecules (e.g., cord factor and lipoarabinomannan) have so far been evaluated for their effectiveness as diagnostic antigens. For TB and bTB, there has been recent progress in developing laboratory-free diagnostic methods. New technologies such as microfluidics and ""Lab-on-Chip"" are examples of promising new technologies that can underpin development of laboratory-free diagnostic devices for these mycobacterial infections."

Seventy-one percent of patients with paucibacillary disease and 85.5% of patients with multibacillary disease were positive for at least one of the three antibodies. The 15% of antibody-negative patients with multibacillary disease were mostly long-term-treated patients, with inactive disease by biopsy. There was excellent agreement between M. tuberculosis LAM and M. leprae LAM in detection of antibodies. Bacillary index and levels of both IgG and IgM antibodies to LAM were positively correlated when all patients were analyzed. When patients with a history of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) were analyzed separately, there was no correlation between IgM or IgG antibody to LAM and bacillary index, a result suggesting a possible role for LAM in the pathogenesis of ENL."

CD011420,0,14715547,0,Comparison of antibody responses to a potential combination of specific glycolipids and proteins for test sensitivity improvement in tuberculosis serodiagnosis.,"The humoral response to different proteinaceous antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is heterogeneous among patients with active disease, and this has originated in the proposal to use a combination of several specific antigens to find an efficient serodiagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB). However, to date, comparisons of antibody responses to several antigens in the same population have been carried out without consideration of antigenic cell wall glycolipids. In the present study the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA antibodies to M. tuberculosis glycolipids (sulfolipid I, diacyltrehaloses, triacyltrehaloses, and cord factor) was compared with the response to four commercially available tests based on the 38-kDa protein mixed with the 16-kDa protein or lipoarabinomannan. Fifty-two serum samples from TB patients and 83 serum samples from control individuals (48 healthy individuals and 35 non-TB pneumonia patients) were studied. Three relevant results were obtained. (i) Smear-negative TB patients presented low humoral responses, but the sera which did react principally showed IgA antibodies to some glycolipidic antigens. (ii) TB patients exhibit heterogeneous humoral responses against glycolipidic antigens. (iii) Finally, test sensitivity is improved (from 23 to 62%) when IgG and IgA antibodies are detected together in tests based on different antigens (proteins and glycolipids). We conclude that it is possible to include glycolipidic antigens in a cocktail of specific antigens from M. tuberculosis to develop a serodiagnostic test."
CD011420,0,9417127,0,Lipoarabinomannan of Mycobacterium tuberculosis promotes protein tyrosine dephosphorylation and inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase in human mononuclear phagocytes. Role of the Src homology 2 containing tyrosine phosphatase 1.,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a putative virulence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that inhibits monocyte functions, and this may involve antagonism of cell signaling pathways. The effects of LAM on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cells of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 were examined. LAM promoted tyrosine dephosphorylation of multiple cell proteins and attenuated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. To examine whether these effects of LAM could be related to activation of a phosphatase, fractions from LAM-treated cells were analyzed for dephosphorylation of para-nitrophenol phosphate. The data show that LAM induced increased phosphatase activity associated with the membrane fraction. The Src homology 2 containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) is important for signal termination and was examined as a potential target of LAM. Exposure of cells to LAM brought about (i) an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1, and (ii) translocation of the phosphatase to the membrane. Phosphatase assay of SHP-1 immunoprecipitated from LAM-treated cells, using phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase as substrate, indicated that LAM promoted increased activity of SHP-1 in vivo. LAM also activated SHP-1 directly in vitro. Exposure of cells to LAM also attenuated the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-12, and major histocompatibility class II molecules. These results suggest that one mechanism by which LAM deactivates monocytes involves activation of SHP-1."

Herein, we have studied C. glutamicum NCgl1505, the orthologue of putative glycosyltransferases Rv1459c from M. tuberculosis and MSMEG3120 from Mycobacterium smegmatis. Deletion of NCgl1505 resulted in the absence of lipomannan (Cg-LM-A), lipoarabinomannan (Cg-LAM) and a multi-mannosylated polymer (Cg-LM-B) based on a 1,2-di-O-C(16)/C(18:1)-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-(1-->3)-glycerol (GlcAGroAc(2)) anchor, while syntheses of triacylated-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol dimannoside (Ac(1)PIM(2)) and Man(1)GlcAGroAc(2) were still abundant in whole cells. Cell-free incubation of C. glutamicum membranes with GDP-[(14)C]Man established that C. glutamicum synthesized a novel alpha(1-->6)-linked linear form of Cg-LM-A and Cg-LM-B from Ac(1)PIM(2) and Man(1)GlcAGroAc(2) respectively. Furthermore, deletion of NCgl1505 also led to the absence of in vitro synthesized linear Cg-LM-A and Cg-LM-B, demonstrating that NCgl1505 was involved in core alpha(1-->6) mannan biosynthesis of Cg-LM-A and Cg-LM-B, extending Ac(1)PI[(14)C]M(2) and [(14)C]Man(1)GlcAGroAc(2) primers respectively. Use of the acceptor alpha-D-Manp-(1-->6)-alpha-D-Manp-O-C(8) in an in vitro cell-free assay confirmed NCgl1505 as an alpha(1-->6) mannopyranosyltransferase, now termed MptB. While Rv1459c and MSMEG3120 demonstrated similar in vitroalpha(1-->6) mannopyranosyltransferase activity, deletion of the Rv1459c homologue in M. smegmatis did not result in loss of mycobacterial LM/LAM, indicating a functional redundancy for this enzyme in mycobacteria."

CD011420,0,22536883,1,Point-of-care detection of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in urine for diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis: a state of the art review.,"Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in urine is attractive as a potential means of diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) regardless of the anatomical site of disease. The most promising candidate antigen is the cell wall lipopolysaccharide antigen lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which has been used to develop commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Although highly variable diagnostic accuracy has been observed in different clinical populations, it is now clear that this assay has useful sensitivity for diagnosis of HIV-associated TB in patients with advanced immunodeficiency and low CD4 cell counts. Thus, this assay is particularly useful when selectively used among patients enrolling in antiretroviral treatment services or in HIV-infected patients requiring admission to hospital medical wards. These are the very patients who have the highest mortality risk and who stand to gain the most from rapid diagnosis, permitting immediate initiation of TB treatment. A recently developed low-cost, lateral-flow (urine 'dip-stick') format of the assay provides a result within 30 minutes and is potentially a major step forward as it can be used at the point-of-care, making the possibility of immediate diagnosis and treatment a reality. This paper discusses the likely utility of this point-of-care assay and how it might best be used in combination with other diagnostic assays for TB. The many further research studies that are needed on this assay are described. Consideration is particularly given to potential reasons for the variable specificity observed in existing field evaluations of LAM ELISAs. Whether this might be related to the assay itself or to the challenges associated with study design is discussed."
CD011420,0,1583106,0,Use of serum antibody and lysozyme levels for diagnosis of leprosy and tuberculosis.,"Active tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy are difficult to diagnose early because there are few organisms to detect and the specific immune response does not distinguish between active and inactive disease. We developed an immunoassay for lysozyme to see whether serum lysozyme levels could be used to identify individuals with clinical leprosy or TB. The immunoassay for lysozyme proved superior to standard enzyme assays that were less sensitive and reliable. The lysozyme assay was compared with assays for antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and M. leprae phenolic glycolipid-1. The sera tested were from Ethiopian leprosy (paucibacillary and multibacillary) and TB patients and from healthy Ethiopian and U.S. controls. The lysozyme assay was able to detect more of the individuals with TB (sensitivity, 100% for 19 patients) or leprosy (sensitivity, 86% for 36 patients) than either antibody assay. In particular, lysozyme levels were raised in a higher proportion of the paucibacillary leprosy patients (83% of 17), for whom the antibody assays were less sensitive; the LAM IgG and the phenolic glycolipid-1 IgM levels were raised in only 62 and 44% of 16 patients, respectively. The data suggest that lysozyme measurements may be useful in the diagnosis of mycobacterial infections and other chronic infectious granulomatoses."

CD011420,0,10459843,0,Tuberculosis I: a conceptual frame for the immunopathology of the disease.,"An analysis of the cellular and humoral immune responses after bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and during tuberculosis treatment favors the hypothesis of an immune defence developed in four overlapping successive stages. The initial immune response is innate. The following two intermingle innate and specific responses against low molecular weight oligopeptidic and nonpeptidic antigens, as muramyldipeptide and trehalose dimycolate, and large molecular weight nonpeptidic antigens such as lipoarabinomannan. The ultimate specific response is directed against protein antigens as Antigen 60. BCG and primary tuberculosis (TB) infections induce cellular and humoral immune responses essentially against oligopeptidic and small and large molecular weight nonpeptidic antigens. Immune responses against non-peptidic substances contribute to the immunoprotection of the infected person who develops a primary infection. Some infected people allow the expression of the immunosuppressive activity of the pathogen. This results in the synthesis of interleukin-10 (IL-10), which suppresses the formation of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and IL-2, and of IL-6, which suppresses T-cell responses. These patients have a skewed immune response against non-peptidic antigens and present with symptoms. They will not recover unless responses directed against proteinic antigens occur, which restore INF-gamma and IL-2 production. The formation of immumoglobulin-G (IgG)-type antibodies and of a cellular immunity against mycobacterial peptidic antigens is essential for a good protection against a post-primary infection."
CD011420,0,17176104,0,Sequencing of oligoarabinosyl units released from mycobacterial arabinogalactan by endogenous arabinanase: identification of distinctive and novel structural motifs.,"The mycobacterial D-arabinofuran is a common constituent of both cell wall mycolyl-arabinogalactan (AG) and the associated lipoarabinomannan (LAM), and is thus accorded critical structural and immunological roles. Despite a well-recognized importance, progress in understanding its full structural characteristics beyond the nonreducing terminal motifs has hitherto been limited by available analytical tools. An endogenous arabinanase activity recently isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis was previously shown to be capable of releasing large oligoarabinosyl units from AG. Advanced tandem mass spectrometry utilizing both low and high energy collision induced dissociation now afforded a facile way to map and directly sequence the digestion products which were dominated by distinctive Ara18 and Ara19 structural units, together with Ara7 and lesser amount of Ara11 and Ara12. Significantly, evidence was obtained for the first time which validated the linkages and branching pattern of the previously inferred Ara22 structural motif of AG, on which the preferred cleavage sites of the novel arabinanase could be localized. The established linkage-specific MS/MS fragmentation characteristics further led to identification of a galactosamine substituent on the C2 position of a portion of the internal 3,5-branched Ara residue of the AG of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but not that of the nonpathogenic, fast growing M. smegmatis."
CD011420,0,17660426,0,Structural characterization of a partially arabinosylated lipoarabinomannan variant isolated from a Corynebacterium glutamicum ubiA mutant.,"Arabinan polysaccharide side-chains are present in both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium glutamicum in the heteropolysaccharide arabinogalactan (AG), and in M. tuberculosis in the lipoglycan lipoarabinomannan (LAM). This study shows by quantitative sugar and glycosyl linkage analysis that C. glutamicum possesses a much smaller LAM version, Cg-LAM, characterized by single t-Araf residues linked to the alpha(1-->6)-linked mannan backbone. MALDI-TOF MS showed an average molecular mass of 13,800-15 400 Da for Cg-LAM. The biosynthetic origin of Araf residues found in the extracytoplasmic arabinan domain of AG and LAM is well known to be provided by decaprenyl-monophosphoryl-D-arabinose (DPA). However, the characterization of LAM in a C. glutamicum : : ubiA mutant devoid of prenyltransferase activity and devoid of DPA-dependent arabinan deposition into AG revealed partial formation of LAM, albeit with a slightly altered molecular mass. These data suggest that in addition to DPA utilization as an Araf donor, alternative pathways exist in Corynebacterianeae for Araf delivery, possibly via an unknown sugar nucleotide."
CD011420,0,10520182,0,Antigenic definition of plasma membrane proteins of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin: predominant activation of human T cells by low-molecular-mass integral proteins.,"Mycobacterial plasma membrane proteins, in particular the detergent-soluble or 'integral' ones, comprise a class of mostly unexplored antigens capable of inducing potent activation of human T cells. Plasma membrane isolated from culture-grown Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG; Indian vaccine; Danish strain) was subjected to a Triton X-114-based biphasic extraction procedure for isolation of peripheral (water-soluble) and integral proteins (PMP and IMP). A distinction between the two protein pools was evident from results of SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antisera raised in rabbits. An enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay with a panel of WHO-IMMYC monoclonal antibodies against various mycobacterial antigens revealed that three well-known antigens, 19 kDa, 33/36 kDa (proline rich) and 38 kDa (PstS homologue), were part of the IMP pool; and another such antigen, 14/16 kDa alpha-crystallin homologue, partly constituted the PMP pool. Apparently, antigenically distinct species of the immunomodulatory moiety lipoarabinomannan partitioned in aqueous and detergent phases. Human T-cell proliferation assays in donors comprising tuberculoid leprosy and pulmonary tuberculosis patients and healthy BCG vaccinees showed significantly greater potency of IMP over PMP and this immunodominance appeared to be directed towards CD4+ cells. IMP of < 56 kDa were resolved by 'continuous elution SDS-PAGE' into 15 fractions which, after extraction of SDS, were used in T-cell proliferation assays for the identification of immunodominant constituents. Proteins falling within three low-molecular-mass zones (all < 35 kDa) performed better than the rest, particularly a approximately 22 kDa fraction, which strongly stimulated T cells from all five donors. Partial overlap between IMP and secreted proteins, as noticed in this study, could provide clues to immunodominance of the latter. The apparent uniqueness and a high T-cell activating potency make mycobacterial IMP attractive candidates for designing future vaccines or immunotherapeutic agents."

Some of the antibodies preferentially bound to the lipopolysaccharide of M. leprae rather than to that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suggesting the presence of distinguishing structural features. The presence of alkali-labile inositol 1-phosphate in the lipopolysaccharide from M. tuberculosis and its apparent absence from the M. leprae product may account for the difference."
CD011420,0,18207158,0,A novel application of affinity biosensor technology to detect antibodies to mycolic acid in tuberculosis patients.,"Tuberculosis has re-emerged as a global health problem due to co-infection with HIV and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. HIV co-infection introduced a 30% underestimation in TB diagnosis based on sputum analysis, calling for a reliable and fast serodiagnostic assay to assist in the management of TB in HIV-burdened populations. Serodiagnosis with mycobacterial lipid cell wall antigens gave promising results, in particular with LAM and cord factor. Free mycolic acids have also been considered because they are unique in structure to each species of Mycobacterium and can be economically extracted and purified. In a standard immunoassay such as ELISA, however, an unacceptable number of false positive and false negative test results were obtained. Here we report a much improved biosensor method to detect antibodies to mycolic acids in patient serum as surrogate markers of active tuberculosis. Mycolic acid (MA) liposomes were immobilized on a non-derivatized twin-celled biosensor cuvette and blocked with saponin. A high dilution of serum was used to calibrate the binding signal of the two cells, followed by contact with patient serum at a lesser dilution, but pre-incubated with either antigen-carrying, or empty liposomes. The serum, or the protein A purified IgG thereof, from sputum-positive tuberculosis patients could be inhibited from binding to the MA in the biosensor by prior incubation with MA-containing liposomes. The accuracy of the inhibition test was 84% if HIV-positive patients for whom a negative TB sputum analyses could not be relied upon to serve as a reference standard were excluded. If biosensor technology could be made suitable for high throughput screening, then it may provide the solution to the serodiagnosis of tuberculosis against a background of HIV."
CD011420,0,9883609,0,[Diagnosis of mycobacterial disease by biochemical and immunological parameters].,"A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires the recovery of M. tuberculosis organisms from a patient's secretions, body fluids, or tissues.

Several studies demonstrated that adenosine deaminase (ADA) level in pleural effusion above 50 IU/L was strongly associated with tuberculosis. ADA has been found to be elevated in serum and several body fluids that are infected by M. tuberculosis. Recently, the simultaneous skin tests of PPDs (M. tuberculosis), PPD-B (M. intracellulare), PPD-Y (M. kansasii) and PPD-F (M. fortuitum), have been reported to be useful in diagnosing mycobacteriosis in the early stage of the disease. Although serodiagnosis of tuberculosis has long been the subject of investigation, no serodiagnostic approach is currently of widespread and clinical utility. At the present time, several serodiagnostic test using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the measurement of IgG antibody to some protein (38-kDa, 30-kDa, 16-kDa and so on) and nonprotein (lipoarabinomannan and cord factor) antigens.

Cultures of mycobacteria were either sonicated or mechanically homogenised and used to coat the wells of microtitre plates. The mouse Mabs used reacted to lipoarabinomannan, an antigen common to all species of mycobacteria, to a 16 kDa protein specific to members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, to a glycolipid found in the cell wall of M. kansasii and to a glycolipid found in the cell wall of members of the M. avium-intracellulare complex. On the basis of serologic reactivity 443/462 (94%) isolates were identified as M. tuberculosis, 6/462 (1%) were identified as M. avium-intracellulare and 7/462 (2%) were identified as M. kansasii. The remaining 16 isolates gave negative reactions with each of the monoclonals, except that reactive with lipoarabinomannan. On the basis of biological tests on the 13 of the isolates that were available, 6 were identified as M. tuberculosis and 3 as M. bovis. In each of these the optical densities in the ELISA with at least one of the Mabs directed against the 16 kDa protein, was within 0.2 units of the cut off value. 4 isolates were not identifiable using biological tests in our laboratory. Each of the available isolates identified serologically as M. avium-intracellulare or M. kansasii gave biological reactions consistent with this identification.

CD011420,0,3106496,0,Mycobacterium leprae antigen-induced suppression of T cell proliferation in vitro.,"The extent to which M. leprae and its products induced suppression of T lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was evaluated. M. leprae antigens suppressed T cell proliferation in response to mitogens and antigens in both lepromatous and tuberculoid patients, as well as controls never exposed to M. leprae or M. leprae endemic areas. Both soluble and particulate fractions of M. leprae were found to suppress proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The extent of suppression was inversely related to the proliferative response of the donors mononuclear cells to M. leprae. Evidence indicates that M. leprae contains both stimulatory and suppressive molecules for T cells. One such suppressive antigen, Lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-B of M. leprae, also suppressed the proliferative response of tuberculoid patients. Suppression was also observed with the LAM-B of M. tuberculosis. The suppressive effects observed were not due to the toxicity of the antigen. Some of the suppressive activity was mediated by T8+ suppressor cells and was expressed in both lepromatous and tuberculoid patients. We suggest that previous sensitization to M. leprae and other cross-reactive mycobacterial antigens determines the sensitivity of T cells to the suppressive effects of M. leprae antigens."

CD011420,0,21045009,0,Biochemical characterization of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis arabinogalactan (AG) is an essential cell wall component. It provides a molecular framework serving to connect peptidoglycan to the outer mycolic acid layer. The biosynthesis of the arabinan domains of AG and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) occurs via a combination of membrane bound arabinofuranosyltransferases, all of which utilize decaprenol-1-monophosphorabinose as a substrate. The source of arabinose ultimately destined for deposition into cell wall AG or LAM originates exclusively from phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (pRpp), a central metabolite which is also required for other essential metabolic processes, such as de novo purine and pyrimidine biosyntheses. In M. tuberculosis, a single pRpp synthetase enzyme (Mt-PrsA) is solely responsible for the generation of pRpp, by catalyzing the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP to the C1 hydroxyl position of ribose-5-phosphate. Here, we report a detailed biochemical and biophysical study of Mt-PrsA, which exhibits the most rapid enzyme kinetics reported for a pRpp synthetase."

Here we have investigated a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) SMITB14 of IgG1 subclass and its corresponding F(ab')(2) fragment directed against LAM from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. MoAb SMITB14 was shown by immunofluorescence to bind to whole cells of the clinical isolate M. tuberculosis strain Harlingen as well as to M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The binding of MoAb SMITB14 to LAM was inhibited by arabinomannan (AM) and oligosaccharides (5.2 kDa) derived from LAM, showing that the MoAb binds specifically to the AM carbohydrate portion of LAM. In passive protection experiments BALB/c mice were infected intravenously with M. tuberculosis Harlingen. MoAb SMITB14 was added intravenously either prior to, or together with, the bacteria. The antibody proved to be protective against the M. tuberculosis infection in terms of a dose-dependent reduction in bacterial load in spleens and lungs, reduced weight loss and, most importantly, increased long-term survival."
CD011420,0,22709935,0,Enzyme-free signal amplification for electrochemical detection of Mycobacterium lipoarabinomannan antibody on a disposable chip.,"A simple, rapid, and disposable immunosensor at screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was developed by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) labeled Staphylococcal protein A (Au-SPA) as the electrochemical tag for detection of lipoarabinomannan antibody (anti-LAM). The immunosensor as the disposable chip was prepared by immobilizing capture antigen on screen printed carbon working electrode by passive adsorption, and characterized with scanning electron microscopy. After binding with the anti-LAM for further capture of Au-SPA, AuNPs were introduced as an electrochemical tag by the eletrooxidation of AuNPs in 0.1M HCl to produce strong electroactive substance for signal amplification. Compared with the enzyme-based immunosensor, AuNPs as enzyme-free tag for signal amplification exhibited many advantages such as no requirement of deoxygenation, and high stability. Under optimal detection conditions and at a preoxidation potential of +1.3 V for 30s, this method achieved the linear concentration of anti-LAM from 15.6 to 1000 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 5.3 ng mL(-1). The immunosensor showed a good performance with high selectivity, acceptable stability, and simple operation, providing a promising application as an adjunctive tool in early tuberculosis diagnosis."

CD011420,0,22568711,1,Antigen detection as a point-of-care test for TB: the case of lipoarabinomannan.,"The limitations of sputum smear microscopy, routine chest radiology for HIV-associated TB and culture-based diagnosis are well recognized, especially in resource-limited settings. The diagnostic accuracy of a new point-of-care lateral-flow urine strip test for lipoarabinomannan (Determine(®) TB-LAM; Alere, MA, USA), which costs US$3.50 per test strip and provides results within 30 min, was evaluated in a cohort of South African patients for HIV-associated TB before starting anti-retroviral therapy in South Africa. Prevalence of culture-positive TB cases was 17.4%, among which 28.2% had sputum smear positivity. Determine(®) TB-LAM (Alere, MA, USA) had highest sensitivity at low CD4 cell counts: 66.7, 51.7 and 39.0% at <50 cells, <100 cells and <200 cells per µl, respectively; specificity was greater than 98% for all strata. There was an incremental sensitivity when Determine TB-LAM was combined with smear microscopy, which did not differ statistically from the sensitivities obtained by testing a single sputum sample with the Xpert(®) MTB/RIF (Cepheid; CA, USA) assay. Determine TB-LAM is a simple, low-cost alternative to existing diagnostic assays for TB screening in HIV-infected patients with very low CD4(+) cell counts."
CD011420,0,8808639,0,Identification of antibody responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in the CSF of tuberculous meningitis patients by Western blotting.,"One of the adjunctive modes of diagnosing tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is to detect immune responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen. Up to 70% of clinical TBM reveal the presence of antimycobacterial antibody by the enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Defining the specificity of this immune response by Western blotting on separated M. tuberculosis antigen has been attempted in this study. Only antimycobacterial antibody-positive TBM cases were included in the study. An analysis of 30 such TBM cases showed a major immune reactivity to the 30- to 40-kDa region (93%) while a lower degree of immune reactivity was seen to the 14-kDa region (87%) and to the 18- to 25-kDa region (60%). Grossly the antibody reactivity on Western blot correlated with the ELISA results. Assessment of antimycobacterial antibody in the neurologic control CSF samples of pyogenic meningitis [n = 10], cryptococcal meningitis [6], neurocysticercosis [28], neurosyphilis [8], viral meningoencephalitis [8], carcinomatous meningitis [8], iatrogenic meningitis [6], and nonneurological control CSF samples from patients undergoing spinal anesthesia [20] revealed the presence of antibody in the CSF of 2 of the 10 pyogenic meningitis and 5 of the 28 neurocysticercosis cases. A Western blot analysis of these 7 cases revealed immune reactivity to 30- to 40-kDa regions only in 2 cases (1 of pyogenic and 1 of neurocysticercosis). The remaining 5 CSF samples did not reveal any immune reactivity on Western blotting, although ELISA demonstrated antimycobacterial antibodies. The antibody response to M. tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan and 38-kDa antigen by ELISA revealed 70.58 and 41.17% positivity, respectively. Thus this study has demonstrated that, by Western blotting, the major immune response is to the 30- to 40-kDa region, namely, lipoarabinomannan. Further, this finding will be useful for specific immunodiagnosis of the TBM."

CD011420,0,8406806,0,Regulation of murine macrophage effector functions by lipoarabinomannan from mycobacterial strains with different degrees of virulence.,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is the major arabinose- and mannose-containing phosphorylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mycobacterial cell walls. LAM preparations from a virulent strain (Erdman) (LAM(Erdman)) and an attenuated strain (H37Ra) (LAMH37Ra) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as from M. leprae (a virulent mycobacterium), were analyzed for their effects on various macrophage (M phi) effector functions. LAMH37Ra, like gram-negative LPS, exhibited a dose-dependent ability to induce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production in normal M phi, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) priming of the M phi greatly augmented the levels of TNF-alpha. However, the effects of LAMH37Ra were unaffected by polymyxin B, which totally abrogated the effects of LPS. LAM(Erdman) and LAM from M. leprae, on the other hand, induced virtually no TNF-alpha production. Analysis of M phi mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the levels of production. Analysis of M phi mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the levels of TNF-alpha mRNA induced by the various preparations correlated with the levels of TNF-alpha protein detected. Interestingly, both LAMH37Ra and LAM(Erdman) could block subsequent IFN-gamma- and LPS-induced M phi activation, a previously reported measure of the potent ability of LAM to down-regulate M phi effector functions. Two lines of evidence suggested, however, that M phi cyclooxygenase products did not play a role in this down-regulation. LAMH37Ra and LPS could induce the production of NO2- in both normal and IFN-gamma-primed M phi, whereas LAM(Erdman) could stimulate NO2- production only in primed M phi. Both LAMH37Ra and LAM(Erdman) could substitute for LPS as a triggering signal for IFN-gamma-primed M phi in a toxoplasma killing assay. The triggering ability of LAM(Erdman), however, was abrogated by an anti-TNF-alpha antibody, suggesting that sufficient TNF-alpha production was stimulated by LAM(Erdman) to drive a M phi function relevant in host resistance. Thus, mycobacterial LAM is a potent regulator of M phi functions, a fact that may have important consequences in mycobacterial disease."
CD011420,0,11456399,0,Prevalence of antibodies to PPD and lipoarabinomannan of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among patients with an indication of fine needle aspiration biopsy.,"Recent increase in the incidence of lung cancer often makes it difficult to differentiate between lung cancer and tuberculosis (TB), due to their radiologic similarities. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has been widely employed for the diagnosis of lung cancer and TB, but the diagnostic accuracy of TB is not high enough. As a rapid screening test for tuberculosis, we evaluated serological tests using Mycobacterium tuberculosis PPD and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigens. A total of 95 patients with indication of FNAB cytology from initial CT findings were enrolled. 25 patients had TB, 76 thoracic malignancy, and six (7.9%) of the lung cancer patients also had TB, indicating much higher prevalence of TB in thoracic tumor patients. Antibodies to PPD were elevated in 18 (72.0%) of 25 TB patients and in 22 (31.4%) of 70 patients with thoracic malignancy. In contrast, only 3 (4.7%) of 64 healthy controls aged 40 or above were seropositive to PPD antigen. The prevalence of anti-PPD antibodies in thoracic tumor patients was therefore significantly greater than that amongst the healthy controls (p<0.001, chi-square test). However, no significant difference in the prevalence of anti-LAM antibodies was found between study subjects and controls. This study demonstrates that thoracic tumor patients have significantly elevated antibodies to PPD; therefore, high anti-PPD seroreactivity in thoracic tumor patients should be cautiously interpreted. A longitudinal investigation on seropositive thoracic tumor patients is required to determine the role of the serological test for TB in lung cancer patients."
CD011420,0,17072031,0,Humoral immune response against mycobacterial antigens in children with tuberculosis.,"Different clinical outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) are related to the balance between cell-mediated and humoral immunity and may depend on environmental and individual factors including age and sex. The purpose of this study was to analyze the humoral immune response to recombinant and native mycobacterial antigens in relation to clinical presentations of pulmonary TB in children. We examined 224 serum samples including 81 primary and 31 postprimary TB cases, 30 cases of latent TB infection, and 82 nontuberculosis controls. Commercially available ELISA assays detecting IgG, IgA, and IgM against antigens: 38 kDa, 16 kDa, 38 kDa, lipoarabinomannan (LAM), and A-60 were used. The results indicate that IgG production was very low in primary compared with postprimary TB (P<0.0001). IgM levels did not differ between the examined groups. Antibody levels strongly depended on the child's age. In infants aged below 1 there was no difference in the antibody level between the TB and control cases. Most positive cases were observed in children aged above 10. The influence of BCG vaccination on the antibody level was not seen. In all subgroups, person-to-person heterogeneity of antigen recognition was observed. We conclude that humoral immune response is associated with the phase of TB and is stronger in more advanced TB forms. IgG and IgA production against mycobacterial antigens is very low in young children."
CD011420,0,23196205,0,Prime-boost BCG vaccination with DNA vaccines based in β-defensin-2 and mycobacterial antigens ESAT6 or Ag85B improve protection in a tuberculosis experimental model.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that there are about 8 million new cases annually of active Tuberculosis (TB). Despite its irregular effectiveness (0-89%), the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) BCG is the only vaccine available worldwide for prevention of TB; thus, the design is important of novel and more efficient vaccination strategies. Considering that β-defensin-2 is an antimicrobial peptide that induces dendritic cell maturation through the TLR-4 receptor and that both ESAT-6 and Ag85B are immunodominant mycobacterial antigens and efficient activators of the protective immune response, we constructed two DNA vaccines by the fusion of the gene encoding β-defensin-2 and antigens ESAT6 (pDE) and 85B (pDA). After confirming efficient local antigen expression that induced high and stable Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in intramuscular (i.m.) vaccinated Balb/c mice, groups of mice were vaccinated with DNA vaccines in a prime-boost regimen with BCG and with BCG alone, and 2 months later were challenged with the mild virulence reference strain H37Rv and the highly virulent clinical isolate LAM 5186. The level of protection was evaluated by survival, lung bacilli burdens, and extension of tissue damage (pneumonia). Vaccination with both DNA vaccines showed similar protection to that of BCG. After the challenge with the highly virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain, animals that were prime-boosted with BCG and then boosted with both DNA vaccines showed significant higher survival and less tissue damage than mice vaccinated only with BCG. These results suggest that improvement of BCG vaccination, such as the prime-boost DNA vaccine, represents a more efficient vaccination scheme against TB."

CD011420,0,21247063,1,Single-molecule detection on a protein-array assay platform for the exposure of a tuberculosis antigen.,"Based on a single-molecule sensitive fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay, an analytical platform for the detection of lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a lipopolysaccharide marker of tuberculosis, was established that is about 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than comparable current ELISA assays. No amplification step was required. Also, no particular sample preparation had to be done. Since individual binding events are detected, true quantification was possible simply by counting individual signals. Utilizing a total internal reflection configuration, unprocessed biological samples (human urine and plasma) to which LAM was added could be analyzed without the requirement of sample purification or washing steps during analysis. Samples containing about 600 antigen molecules per microliter produced a distinct signal. The methodology developed can be employed for any set of target molecules for which appropriate antibodies exist."

Only LAM-reactive serum immunoglobulin G responses were significantly increased in both BCG-vaccinated patients and patients with active tuberculosis (P<.05), and oral BCG vaccination also induced significant increases in LAM-reactive secretory immunoglobulin A (P<.05). LAM-reactive antibody assays can serve as markers of humoral and mucosal immunity in future trials of BCG and newer attenuated mycobacterial vaccines."
CD011420,0,24384074,0,BCG vaccine mediated reduction in the MHC-II expression of macrophages and dendritic cells is reversed by activation of Toll-like receptors 7 and 9.,"Tuberculosis is a major cause of death in mankind and BCG vaccine protects against childhood but not adult tuberculosis. BCG avoids lysosomal fusion in macrophages decreasing peptides required for activating CD4 T cells and Th1 immunity while suppressing the expression of MHC-II by antigen presenting cells (APCs). An in vitro model of antigen presentation showed that ligands for TLR-9, 7, 4 and 1/2 increased the ability of APCs to present antigen-85B of BCG to CD4 T cells, which correlated with an increase in MHC-II expression. TLR-activation led to a down-regulation of MARCH1 ubiquitin ligase which prevents the degradation of MHC-II and decreased IL-10 also contributed to an increase in MHC-II. TLR-activation induced up-regulation of MHC-II was inhibited by the blockade of IRAK, NF-kB, and MAPKs. TLR-7 and TLR-9 ligands had the most effective adjuvant like effect on MHC-II of APCs which allowed BCG vaccine mediated activation of CD4 T cells."
CD011420,0,2647572,0,Immunohistochemical examination for mycobacteria in intestinal tissues from patients with Crohn's disease.,"We conducted an immunohistochemical search for mycobacteria in the intestinal tissues of patients with Crohn's disease.

Each of the antibody preparations was shown capable of detecting a variety of typical and atypical mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. fortuitum, M. chelonei, M. paratuberculosis, and cell wall-defective as well as cell wall-intact forms of M. avium intracellulare) under conditions identical to those used for staining the patients' tissues. We did not detect mycobacteria in any of the 67 specimens from 30 patients examined. These results, in conjunction with those of our previous serologic studies, do not support the hypothesis that infection with a Mycobacterium causes Crohn's disease."

CD011420,0,15358642,0,Antigen recognition by serum antibodies in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis.,"White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have emerged as reservoirs of bovine tuberculosis in northern America. For tuberculosis surveillance of deer, antibody-based assays are particularly attractive because deer are handled only once and immediate processing of the sample is not required. Sera collected sequentially from 25 Mycobacterium bovis-infected and 7 noninfected deer were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting, and multiantigen print immunoassay (MAPIA) for immunoglobulin specific to M. bovis antigens. Various routes of experimental M. bovis infection, such as intratonsillar inoculation (n = 11), aerosol (n = 6), and exposure to infected deer (in contact, n = 8), were studied. Upon infection, specific bands of reactivity at approximately 24 to 26 kDa, approximately 33 kDa, approximately 42 kDa, and approximately 75 kDa to M. bovis whole-cell sonicate were detected by immunoblot. Lipoarabinomannan-specific immunoglobulin was detected as early as 36 days postchallenge, and responses were detected for 94% of intratonsillarly and ""in-contact""-infected deer. In MAPIA, sera were tested with 12 native and recombinant antigens coated on nitrocellulose. All in-contact-infected (8 of 8) and 10 of 11 intratonsillarly infected deer produced antibody reactive with one or more of the recombinant/native antigens. Responses were boosted by injection of tuberculin for intradermal tuberculin skin testing. Additionally, three of six deer receiving a very low dose of M. bovis via aerosol exposure produced antibody specific to one or more recombinant proteins. M. bovis was isolated from one of three nonresponding aerosol-challenged deer. Of the 12 antigens tested, the most immunodominant protein was MPB83; however, a highly sensitive serodiagnostic test will likely require use of multiple antigens."
CD011420,0,7635156,0,Mannosylated lipoarabinomannan interacts with phagocytes.,"Infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis first involves its adhesion to mononuclear host phagocytes. Various macrophage opsonic and non-opsonic receptors are known to mediate this adhesion, with some specificity of mannosyl receptors for the more virulent strains. Mannosylated lipoarabinomannan, a major component of cell walls from M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG, is endowed with mannooligosaccharide units that could mediate its binding to these latter receptors. To explore its interaction with murine immune cells by flow cytometry, we report a new procedure to fluorescently tag the polysaccharide molecules. We covalently labeled mannosylated lipoarabinomannan from M. bovis BCG with biotin, allowing formation of stable complexes with streptavidin coupled to a fluorochrome. In this work, we demonstrated that this major carbohydrate antigen interacts selectively with murine phagocytes, i.e. granulocytes and macrophages. This binding was affected by temperature and was serum- and divalent-cation-dependent. It also appears to involve a metabolically recycling protein receptor on the phagocyte surface and mannosyl aggretopes on the mannosylated lipoarabinomannan molecule. Thus, the latter may provide a means for mycobacteria to bind to and invade their host phagocytes. This molecule could constitute one of the early factors of mycobacterial virulence."

CD011420,0,15920982,0,[Clinical application of testing methods on acid-fast bacteria].,"Clinical bacteriology pertaining to acid-fast bacteria has made marked advances over the past decade, initiated by the development of a DNA probe kit for identification of acid-fast bacteria. Wide-spread use of nucleic acid amplification for rapid detection of tubercle bacillus contributed more greatly than any other factor to such advances in this field. At present, 90% of all kits used for nucleic acid amplification in the world are consumed in Japan. Unfortunately, not a few clinicians in Japan have a false idea that the smear method and nucleic acid amplification are necessary but culture is not. In any event nucleic acid amplification has exerted significant impacts on the routine works at bacteriology laboratories. Among others, collecting bacteria by pretreatment with NALC-NaOH has simplified the introduction of the collective mode smear method and liquid media. Furthermore, as clinicians have become increasingly more experienced with various methods of molecular biology, it now seems possible to apply these techniques for detection of genes encoding drug resistance and for utilization of molecular epidemiology in routine laboratory works. Meanwhile, attempts to diagnose acid-fast bacteriosis by checking blood for antibody have also been made, primarily in Japan. At present, two kits for detecting antibodies to glycolipids (LAM, TDM, etc.) are covered by national health insurance in Japan. We have an impression that in Japan clinicians do not have adequate knowledge and skill to make full use of these new testing methods clinically. We, as the chairmen of this symposium, hope that this symposium will help clinicians increase their skill related to new testing methods, eventually leading to stimulation of advances in clinical practices related to acid-fast bacteria in Japan. 1. Smear microscopy by concentration method and broth culture system: Kazunari TSUYUGUCHI (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center) Smear microscopy and culture still remain the cornerstone to diagnose tuberculosis. However, the classical methods in Japan using direct microscopy and Ogawa solid media were not sufficient for clinical use. In recent years substantial advance has been made in these fields. Concentration of clinical samples by centrifugation improves the sensitivity of smear microscopy with excellent reproducibility. The Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) system using liquid media yields high sensitivity and rapidity. Using these methods, more and more tuberculosis cases would be correctly diagnosed and treated adequately based on drug susceptibility testing. 2. New technologies for anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing: Satoshi MITARAI (Bacteriology Division, Reference Centre for Mycobacterium, Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) Several new technologies have been developed to obtain anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing (AST) results rapidly, utilising liquid culture and molecular technologies. Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT), as a popular liquid culturing and AST system, was evaluated for its accuracy and usefulness. As for isoniazid, MGIT showed 12.6% of discordant result comparing with standard method. These MGIT resistant and Ogawa susceptible strains had relatively high MICs ranging 0.13 to 2.0 microg/ml. The molecular detection of resistant gene mutation is also a useful method to estimate drug resistance rapidly. The rpoB mutation detection is reliable with high sensitivity and specificity. 3. Nucleic acid amplification and novel diagnostic methods: Shunji TAKAKURA (Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine) Sensitivities of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis meet clinical requirement that patients with high-risk of transmission should be identified within a day. Comparison of the performance of various NAATs is difficult because of the difference in sample processing and in samples tested among methods and reports. Considering the limitations of NAATs (low sensitivity compared with culture, inability to differentiate dead bacilli from the living), further advances would be expected when novel technologies could confer additional information, such as drug susceptibility, quantity, viability, and genotype. 4. Serodiagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease: Seigo KITADA (Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Toneyama National Hospital) Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms are ubiquitous in environment and a contamination in respiratory tracts is sometimes observed, and that complex the diagnosis. We developed a serodiagnostic method for MAC disease using an enzyme immunoassay with the MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core as antigen. A significant increase in GPL core antibodies was detected in sera of patients with MAC pulmonary diseases compared to patients who were colonized with MAC, patients with M. kansasii disease and tuberculosis and healthy subjects. The serodiagnosis is useful for diagnosis of MAC lung disease. 5. Molecular epidemiologic tools for tuberculosis: IS6110 RFLP, Spoligotyping, and VNTR: Tomoshige MATSUMOTO, Hiromi ANO, Tetsuya TAKASHIMA, Izuo TSUYUGUCHI (Osaka Prefectural Medical Center for Respiratory and Allergic Diseases) We have performed molecular typing on about 1,300 culture positive clinical isolates that made up the majority of tuberculosis strains in part of southeast Osaka since 2001 until now. By spoligotyping, about 75% of entire strains belonged to the Beijing strain. Particular spoligotyping descriptions, which were not described in SpolDBIII, were found in the strains with lower than 6 copies of IS6110 RFLP. We described them as Osaka type. We could also show that direct typing from Tb PCR positive sputum of patients with tuberculosis was possible by VNTR and that VNTR with 16 loci was useful in tuberculosis typing in Osaka."
CD011420,0,24429314,0,Lipoarabinomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for early diagnosis of childhood tuberculous meningitis.,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a severe complication of tuberculosis (TB) predominantly affecting young children.

CD011420,0,10603406,0,Clearance and organ distribution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in the presence and absence of LAM-binding immunoglobulin M.,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a component of the mycobacterial surface which has been associated with a variety of deleterious effects on immune system function. Despite the importance of LAM to the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection, there is no information available on its fate in vivo. In this study, we determined the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of exogenously administered LAM in mice. For measurements of serum and tissue LAM concentrations, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which used monoclonal antibodies of different isotypes to capture and detect LAM at concentrations of >/=0.4 microg/ml. Intravenous administration of LAM to mice resulted in transient serum levels with organ deposition in the spleen and in the liver. Immunohistochemical studies localized LAM to the spleen marginal zone macrophages and, to a lesser degree, to liver macrophages. When LAM was administered to mice previously given a LAM-binding immunoglobulin M (IgM), LAM was very rapidly cleared from circulation. In those mice, deposition of LAM in the spleen was significantly reduced while LAM deposition in the liver increased. Administration of LAM-binding IgM resulted in significant levels of IgM to LAM in bile consistent with an increased hepatobiliary excretion of LAM in the presence of specific antibody. Bile, liver extracts, and bile salts were found to rapidly inactivate the immunoreactivity of LAM. The results indicate that serum clearance and organ deposition of LAM in mice are affected by the presence of LAM-binding antibody and suggest a mechanism by which antibody could modify the course of mycobacterial infection."

The material, termed PS1, has an average molecular weight of 22.4 kDa, is freely soluble in water, but has low solubility in acetone or ethanol, and is remarkably heat-stable, as is the parent BCG vaccine in terms of high-dose antitumor activity. PS1 contains at least 50% carbohydrate, consisting mainly of glucose, galactose and mannose, and about 10% lipid that may correspond to phosphatidylinositol. It shares chemical and biological properties with an arabinomannan isolated from M. tuberculosis, but it contains only trace quantities of lipoarabinomannan (LAM). Crossed immunoelectrophoresis indicated that PS1 contains the mycobacterial antigen 89, but only a single, non-migrating precipitin arc appeared on immunoelectrophoresis against a standard anti-BCG serum. PS1 appears to be non-toxic in mice up to a dose of 5 mg/kg, while as little as 70 micrograms/kg is sufficient to inhibit tumor formation significantly."

However, it is not known whether the quantity of LAM present in urine provides additional prognostic information."
CD011420,0,22033469,0,Understanding the interaction of Lipoarabinomannan with membrane mimetic architectures.,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a critical virulence factor in the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. LAM is secreted in urine and serum from infected patients and is being studied as a potential diagnostic indicator for the disease. Herein, we present a novel ultra-sensitive and specific detection strategy for monomeric LAM based on its amphiphilic nature and consequent interaction with supported lipid bilayers. Our strategy involves the capture of LAM on waveguides functionalized with membrane mimetic architectures, followed by detection with a fluorescently labeled polyclonal antibody. This approach offers ultra-sensitive detection of lipoarabinomannan (10 fM, within 15 min) and may be extended to other amphiphilic markers. We also show that chemical deacylation of LAM completely abrogates its association with the supported lipid bilayers. The loss of signal using the waveguide assay for deacylated LAM, as well as atomic force microscopy (AFM) images that show no change in height upon addition of deacylated LAM support this hypothesis. Mass spectrometry of chemically deacylated LAM indicates the presence of LAM-specific carbohydrate chains, which maintain antigenicity in immunoassays. Further, we have developed the first three-dimensional structural model of mannose-capped LAM that provides insights into the orientation of LAM on supported lipid bilayers."
CD011420,0,21678282,0,[Bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient with lymphangioleiomyomatosis accompanying tuberous sclerosis syndrome].,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease of unknown origin, that may be sporadic or develop in the course of tuberous sclerosis (TS). Patients do not present immune deficiency, but structural changes in the lung parenchyma (cysts) may encourage various infections, for example tuberculosis. Radiologic findings are often difficult to interpret, because of changes related to LAM itself. We present a young women with a history of TS and LAM, in whom protracting respiratory tract infection was finally diagnosed as tuberculosis. Initial diagnosis was based primarily on clinical signs and symptoms and treatment was started despite the negative result of the sputum microscopy for acid fast bacilli. In the course of treatment the diagnosis was supported by positive tuberculin skin test, interferon-gamma release assay and genetic test for M. tuberculosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and finally, positive sputum culture in liquid medium."
CD011420,0,2469120,0,Structure of mycobacteria: recent developments in defining cell wall carbohydrates and proteins.,"Work from this laboratory on the immunogens of Mycobacterium species has focused on those based on carbohydrates (with a view to the development of specific tools for the serodiagnosis of mycobacterioses) and on the cell-wall proteins, as a source of protective immunity and as a means of observing specific delayed-type hypersensitivity. Most mycobacteria are endowed with specific, highly antigenic glycolipids that are powerful for the serodiagnosis of individual mycobacterial infections: e.g., the phenolic glycolipids of Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium bovis, the glycopeptidolipids of the Mycobacterium avium complex, and the acylated trehalose-containing lipooligosaccharides of species such as Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium szulgai, and Mycobacterium malmoense. A search for analogous structures in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has revealed an antigenic diglycosyl diacylglycerol and the immunogenic phosphomannoinositides. Others have reported on the presence of a novel phenolic glycolipid in the Canetti strain of M. tuberculosis. The dominant carbohydrate-containing antigen of M. tuberculosis (responsible for the high-titer anti-arabinofuranosyl activity in tuberculous sera) is lipoarabinomannan, which has been purified in the native state from M. tuberculosis and shown to contain both phosphatidylinositol and phosphoinositol side-branches. The cell wall of M. tuberculosis--more precisely, the peptidoglycan skeleton--is a source of a few distinct, highly immunogenic protein antigens. The recognition, isolation, and characterization of these antigens will also be described."
CD011420,0,11552951,0,TNF-alpha-mediated multiplication of human immunodeficiency virus in chronically infected monocytoid cells by mycobacterial infection.,"Mycobacterial infection is a common occurrence in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Incubation of U1, a chronically HIV-1-infected human promonocytic cell line, with Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. avium, M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis resulted in enhancement of p24 antigen release in the supernatant, indicating that these mycobacteria could activate HIV replication from this cell line. The amount of p24 in the culture infected with M. smegmatis was higher than in cultures infected with other mycobacteria. The amounts of p24 release in cultures infected with M. avium and M. bovis BCG were intermediate. M. tuberculosis slightly stimulated HIV replication. The amount of TNF-alpha produced by U1 cells was correlated with the amount of p24 antigen release. The IL-1beta and IL-6 levels in the supernatant from cultures infected with all species were the same. The antibody to TNF-alpha inhibited p24 release induced by mycobacterial infections. The anti-IL-1beta and anti-IL-6 antibodies, however, scarcely influenced stimulation of HIV replication by mycobacterial infection. These data suggested that activation of HIV replication by mycobacteria mainly occurred by secondary release of cytokine TNF-alpha."
CD011420,0,21700601,0,Diagnosing tuberculosis with urine lipoarabinomannan: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a potential marker of active tuberculosis (TB). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding use of urinary LAM assays for diagnosing active TB. We systematically searched for published and unpublished studies that evaluated urinary LAM for active TB diagnosis. Extracted data were pooled using bivariate random effects models and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves. Heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Quality was assessed according to standardised QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) criteria. In seven studies that assessed test accuracy in microbiologically confirmed cases only, estimates of sensitivity ranged from 13% to 93%, while specificity ranged from 87% to 99%. In five studies that assessed accuracy in clinical and confirmed TB cases, sensitivity ranged from 8% to 80%, while specificity ranged from 88% to 99%. In five studies with results stratified by HIV status, sensitivity was 3-53% higher in HIV-positive than HIV-negative subgroups; sensitivity was highest with advanced immunosuppression. The LAM urinary assay has several characteristics that make it attractive for diagnosing active TB, but has suboptimal sensitivity for routine clinical use. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential value of the LAM assay in individuals with advanced HIV or for diagnosis of paediatric TB."
CD011420,0,18080533,0,[Study of DC-SIGN gene polymorphism in patients infected with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis strains of different genotypes in the Irkutsk Region].,"Polymorphism of the promoter of DC-SIGN gene in Caucasians was studied at positions -336A/G and -871/G in 134 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 112 healthy individuals, who lived in the Irkutsk Region, Eastern Siberia. In 90 patients from the patient cohort M. tuberculosis DNA was isolated and investigated using the MIRU-VNTR typing test by 12 loci. Comparison of DC-SIGN gene polymorphism in patients with tuberculosis and healthy controls revealed no significant differences in loci -336A/ G and -871A/G. Analysis of MIRU-VNTR patterns identified 50 unique profiles, among which there were genotypes of the families Beijing, T. LAM, Haarlem, ""Ural"" (Haarlem 4) and X. Among 90 MIRU-VNTR genotypes, 42 profiles belonged to the Beijing family. Moreover, the minimum spanning tree (MST) test revealed a number of Beijing-like strains. The genotypes of the subjects affected with Beijing and Beijing-like strains and those affected with the strains of other families (non-Beijing) were compared. A significance reduction was found in the incidence of the -336G genotype among the subjects affected with Beijing strains versus those infected with non-Beijing strains at a frequency of 0.09 and 0.24, respectively (chi2 = 7.64; p = 0.006; OR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.1-6.1)."
CD011420,0,22971064,0,Promising directions in the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis.,"Estimates of the burden of childhood tuberculosis have been hampered by the lack of a reliable diagnostic test. Clinical scoring systems, radiological findings and tuberculin skin testing (the traditional methods used for diagnosis) are unreliable, particularly in the era of HIV. Microbiologic confirmation using induced sputum is feasible and has become increasingly important to define the burden of disease and to enable appropriate treatment. The availability of a rapid molecular diagnostic test (Xpert® MTB/RIF; Cepheid) is an important advance that can improve case detection in children and enable rapid detection of mycobacterial drug resistance. Xpert testing of two induced sputum specimens detected approximately 75% of children with culture-confirmed disease. Urine lipoarabinomannan has shown promise as a rapid diagnostic in a subgroup of HIV-infected severely immunocompromised adults, but there have been no data in children so far. Further research is needed to develop a rapid point-of-care, reliable and affordable diagnostic test for childhood tuberculosis that can be widely used."
CD011420,0,24168211,1,HIV-associated tuberculosis: relationship between disease severity and the sensitivity of new sputum-based and urine-based diagnostic assays.,Reducing mortality from HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) requires diagnostic tools that are rapid and have high sensitivity among patients with poor prognosis. We determined the relationship between disease severity and the sensitivity of new sputum-based and urine-based diagnostic assays.
