CD007868,0,10926433,0,A comparative clinical trial of a compomer and a resin adhesive for orthodontic bonding.,"The study aimed to compare the survival time and cariostatic potential of a compomer to that of a resin adhesive when used to bond stainless steel orthodontic brackets to labial segment teeth only. The effect of the patients' sex, age at the start of treatment and presenting malocclusion on bracket survival time was assessed also. Forty-five consecutive patients who attended for fixed appliance therapy were randomly selected. Four hundred twenty-six brackets were bonded (213 with compomer and 213 with resin adhesive) with a split mouth design; the right or left side allocation of compomer in either arch was alternated. Color transparencies of the maxillary incisors, mandibular incisors, or both, and transparencies of the canines, were taken before treatment. At the debond stage, the transparencies were projected (20x) and assessed by an experienced examiner, who used a caries index. The survival time distributions for brackets bonded with each bonding agent were not significantly different (P = .74, paired Prentice-Wilcoxon test; P = .75, Akritas test), with bracket failure rates of 17% and 20% recorded for compomer and resin adhesive, respectively. Neither the patients' sex (P = .85) nor malocclusion (P = .26) appear to affect significantly bracket survival, but patient age was identified as a useful prognostic indicator of bracket survival (P < .001). On average, there was more decalcification related to brackets bonded with resin adhesive than with compomer (P = .0075). Survival time distributions of brackets bonded with compomer or resin adhesive appear comparable, but decalcification was reduced significantly by bonding with compomer."

CD007868,0,16379161,0,Subjective impacts of dental caries and fluorosis in rural Ugandan children.,Describe the oral health related quality of life among a group of children in rural Uganda and compare impacts on oral health related quality of life associated with dental caries and fluorosis.
CD007868,0,6957608,0,A further look at the role of radiographs in trials of caries-prophylactic agents.,"To determine the role of bitewing radiographs in clinical trials of caries prophylactic procedures, data from the Chatham flossing study 26 were reanalyzed. The final examination records after 20 months of 147 second grade children were used to assess and compare the separate and combined results from clinical and radiographic examinations. Analysis of paired approximal surfaces from contralateral test and control quadrants revealed that the addition of radiographic findings to clinical data changed the mean increment reduction from 22 to 26 percent. This slight increase was further supported by the results of similar studies which reported either separate or combined radiographic and clinical findings or both. Although the magnitude of the increase of the mean increment reduction remains uncertain, data from these studies indicate that the use of combined radiographic and clinical data might be justified when testing a particular prophylactic procedure which is expected to incur a significant caries reduction to approximal surfaces. Furthermore, findings suggest that clinical trials of certain prophylactic agents that are particularly beneficial to approximal surfaces, but which fail to include radiographic examinations, might actually underestimate the preventive effect of the agent."
CD007868,0,12166909,0,"Three-year performance of a calcium-, fluoride-, and hydroxyl-ions-releasing resin composite.","Secondary caries is the main reason for replacement of restorations in cross-sectional studies. To prevent demineralization, the use of ion-releasing materials has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the durability of a new resin composite that releases calcium-, fluoride- and hydroxyl ions at low pH. Sixty-nine posterior restorations were placed in 36 patients and were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years with slightly modified USPHS criteria. Postoperative sensitivity was observed in 2 teeth directly after placement and in another 8 teeth after 6-12 months. Absence of the use of an adhesive bonding technique explained the symptoms. A total of 26% failures was observed during the follow-up: 13 cusp fractures, 2 partial fractures of the resin composite, 1 secondary caries and 1 endodontic treatment due to prolonged sensitivity. The cusp fractures occurred during the second part of the follow-up and may be explained by expansion of the composite material due to water expansion and/or hydrolytic degradation of the alkaline glass filler. It can be concluded that the new ion-releasing resin composite showed, despite promising pH stabilizing properties, a clinically unacceptable failure rate."
CD007868,0,27037772,0,Predicting changes in aquatic toxicity of chemicals resulting from solvent or dispersant use as vehicle.,"The influence of two vehicles (N,N-dimethylformamide [DMF] as solvent and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil [HCO-40] as a dispersant) on the acute toxicity of eight hydrophobic chemicals with a non-specific mode of action to Daphnia magna was investigated according to the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, No. 202. An increased 48-h EC50 value for D. magna or reduced toxicity resulting from the addition of HCO-40 to the test medium was observed for five of the eight chemicals examined. Each of eight chemicals was dissolved in water at a concentration of either 10 mg/L or 1.0 mg/L, with or without DMF or HCO-40. Silicone film as a model of a biological membrane was then immersed in each solution, and the concentration of each chemical in the water was monitored until equilibrium was reached for each test substance, after which the adsorbed amount of each chemical was determined. The amounts of p-pentylphenol and four other substances with log Pow (1-octanol/water partition coefficient) values greater than 3.4 adsorbed onto the silicone film decreased with increasing concentrations of HCO-40. However, 3-chloro-4-fluoronitrobenzene and two other substances with log Pow values less than 2.6 demonstrated no changes in adsorption with either increasing HCO-40 concentration or the addition of DMF. The reduced adsorption in the presence of a vehicle on the silicone film correlated closely with changes in toxicity. These results indicate that the methodology developed in this study enables the prediction of changes in toxicity resulting from the addition of vehicles to a test system."
CD007868,0,23665469,0,Homocysteine is a novel risk factor for suboptimal response of blood platelets to acetylsalicylic acid in coronary artery disease: a randomized multicenter study.,"The incomplete inhibition of platelet function by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), despite the patients are receiving therapeutic doses of the drug ('aspirin-resistance'), is caused by numbers of risk factors. In this study we verified the idea that plasma homocysteine (Hcy) contributes to 'aspirin-resistance' in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A cross-designed randomized controlled intervention study has been performed (126 CAD pts incl. 26 with T2DM) to determine whether increasing ASA dose from 75mg to 150mg daily may result in the increased antiplatelet effect, in the course of four-week treatment. Platelet response to collagen (coll) or arachidonic acid (AA) was monitored with whole blood aggregometry, plasma thromboxane (Tx), and Hcy levels were determined immunochemically. The ASA-mediated reductions in platelet response to coll (by 12±3%) or AA (by 10±3%) and in plasma Tx (by 20±9%; p<0.02 or less) were significantly greater for higher ASA dose and significantly correlated with plasma Hcy, which was significantly lower in ""good"" ASA responders compared to ""poor"" responders (p<0.001). Higher plasma Hcy appeared a significant risk factor for blood platelet refractoriness to low ASA dose (OR=1.11; ±95%CI: 1.02-1.20, p<0.02, adjusted to age, sex and CAD risk factors). Hcy diminished in vitro antiplatelet effect of low ASA concentration and augmented platelet aggregation (by up to 62% (p<0.005) for coll and up to 15% (p<0.005) for AA), whereas its acetyl derivative acted oppositely. Otherwise, Hcy intensified antiplatelet action of high ASA. Hyperhomocysteinaemia may be a novel risk factor for the suppressed blood platelet response to ASA, and homocysteine may act as a specific sensitizer of blood platelets to some agonists. While homocysteine per se acts as a proaggregatory agent to blood platelets, its acetylated form is able to reverse this effect. Thus, these findings reveal a possibly new challenging potential of the acetylating properties of ASA therapy."

CD007868,0,14681595,0,"Public health and aging: retention of natural teeth among older adults--United States, 2002.","During the past several decades, the percentage of older adults who have retained their natural teeth has increased steadily. This trend is expected to continue, resulting in improved oral function and quality of life. To estimate the prevalences of tooth retention and total tooth loss in 2002 among adults aged >/=65 years, CDC analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that in 26 (52%) states, more than half of older adults reported having most (i.e., losing five or fewer) of their natural teeth. However, rates varied substantially among states and by selected characteristics. With tooth retention, older adults remain at risk for dental caries (i.e., tooth decay) and periodontal disease. To help adults maintain healthy teeth for life, community-based strategies should promote healthy behaviors, optimal use of fluoride, timely examinations and clinical services, and increased research into preventing oral diseases and promoting oral health among adults."
CD007868,0,25113874,0,Photoactivated cytotoxicity of ferrocenyl-terpyridine oxovanadium(IV) complexes of curcuminoids.,"Oxovanadium(IV) complexes, viz. [VO(Fc-tpy)(Curc)](ClO4) (1), [VO(Fc-tpy)(bDHC)](ClO4) (2), [VO(Fc-tpy)(bDMC)](ClO4) (3) and [VO(Ph-tpy)(Curc)](ClO4) (4), of 4'-ferrocenyl-2,2':6',2″-terpyridine (Fc-tpy) and 4'-phenyl-2,2':6',2″-terpyridine (Ph-tpy) and monoanionic curcumin (Curc), bis-dehydroxycurcmin (bDHC) and bis-demethoxycurcumin (bDMC) were prepared, characterized and their photo-induced DNA cleavage activity and photocytotoxicity in visible light studied. The ferrocenyl complexes 1-3 showed an intense metal-to-ligand charge transfer band near 585 nm in DMF and displayed Fc(+)/Fc and V(IV)/V(III) redox couples near 0.65 V and -1.05 V vs. SCE in DMF-0.1 M TBAP. The complexes as avid binders to calf thymus DNA showed significant photocleavage of plasmid DNA in red light of 647 nm forming OH radicals. The complexes showed photocytotoxicity in HeLa and Hep G2 cancer cells in visible light of 400-700 nm with low dark toxicity. ICP-MS and fluorescence microscopic studies exhibited significant cellular uptake of the complexes within 4 h of treatment with complexes. The treatment with complex 1 resulted in the formation of reactive oxygen species inside the HeLa cells which was evidenced from the DCFDA assay."
CD007868,0,28301686,0,Non-operative control of cavitated approximal caries lesions in primary molars: a prospective evaluation of cases.,"The effect of non-operative caries control at cavity level is often questioned. This prospective study of cases aimed to evaluate the suitability of non-operative treatment of active cavitated approximal caries lesions in primary molars by assessing clinical changes of lesions over time. Further, we evaluate children's and parents' attitudes in response to non-operative cavity treatment. Thirty-nine children attending a community dental service, aged 5-11 years, joined the evaluation based on the following criteria: (i) the presence of at least one active cavitated caries lesion in the distal surface of first primary molar or mesial surface of the second primary molar extending up to two-thirds into dentin assessed radiographically, (ii) the absence of spontaneous pain, (iii) the absence of pulpal or periapical pathology. After informed consent, one randomly selected lesion per child had overhanging enamel margins adjusted and was treated non-operatively by the child/parent performing daily site-specific oral hygiene with a fluoridated toothpaste, supplemented by professional topical fluoride treatment and dietary advice. Nine lesions/children dropped out. Fifteen lesions survived without pulpal or periapical pathology for an average of 26 m (range 9-44). Lesion failure was associated with poor compliance or lesions not suited for the method. Children and parents were highly satisfied with the treatment. Our study identifies key factors in the performance of non-operative cavity treatment in a dental practice setting. It is concluded that non-operative cavity treatment can be a helpful method to control caries lesion progression in primary teeth and may familiarise the child with dental treatment."
CD007868,0,15637979,0,Stain reduction of an integrated oral hygiene system.,"This article discusses research to determine the efficacy of a prototype integrated power toothbrush and toothpaste dispensing system, the IntelliClean System from Sonicare and Crest, in the removal of extrinsic stain. The prototype integrated system and a positive control, the Sonicare Elite with conventional toothpaste, were evaluated in 2 randomized, single-blinded, parallel 4-week controlled clinical trials. There was a low dropout rate, with 28 subjects of the 31 randomized in study 1 completing the study (10% loss to follow-up) and 26 subjects of the 28 randomized in study 2 completing the study (7% loss to follow-up). Lobene stain scores were used to assess the extent and intensity of stain for all teeth meeting the criteria for inclusion in the studies. Lobene stain scores were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks in both studies. A survey also was conducted at the conclusion of each study to determine user attitude toward the integrated system. The prototype integrated system was found to significantly reduce overall extrinsic stain over time, performing not significantly differently from the positive control. Overall, the prototype integrated system reduced the composite measure of stain that encompasses both the extent and intensity of stain by 60%. This research demonstrates that the IntelliClean System from Sonicare and Crest is highly effective in reducing extrinsic stain."

CD007868,0,20444027,0,Influence of Pasteurella multocida infection on the pharmacokinetic behavior of marbofloxacin after intravenous and intramuscular administrations in rabbits.,"The pharmacokinetic behavior of marbofloxacin was studied in healthy (n = 12) and Pasteurella multocida infected rabbits (n = 12) after single intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administrations. Six rabbits in each group (control and diseased) were given a single dose of 2 mg/kg body weight (bw) of marbofloxacin intravenously. The other six rabbits in each group were given the same dose of the drug intramuscularly. The concentration of marbofloxacin in plasma was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The plasma concentrations were higher in diseased rabbits than in healthy rabbits following both routes of injections. Following i.v. administration, the values of the elimination half-life (t(1/2beta)), and area under the curve were significantly higher, whereas total body clearance was significantly lower in diseased rabbits. After i.m. administration, the elimination half-life (t(1/2el)), mean residence time, and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) were higher in diseased rabbits (5.33 h, 7.35 h and 2.24 microg/mL) than in healthy rabbits (4.33 h, 6.81 h and 1.81 microg/mL, respectively). Marbofloxacin was bound to the extent of 26 +/- 1.3% and 23 +/- 1.6% to plasma protein of healthy and diseased rabbits, respectively. The C(max)/MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and AUC/MIC ratios were significantly higher in diseased rabbits (28 and 189 h) than in healthy rabbits (23 and 157 h), indicating the favorable pharmacodynamic characteristics of the drug in diseased rabbits."

CD007868,0,18186171,0,Overnight malodor effect with a 0.454% stabilized stannous fluoride sodium hexametaphosphate dentifrice.,"Stannous fluoride (SnF2) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent effective against caries, plaque, and gingivitis. Because oral malodor has a microbial etiology, the potential immediate effects of SnF2 on malodor were evaluated in 2 independent, randomized clinical trials. Both studies used a similar double-blind, crossover design, with subjects randomized to a treatment sequence with a 0.454% stabilized SnF2 sodium hexametaphosphate dentifrice or sodium fluoride dentifrice control. Overnight malodor was assessed at baseline in the morning before brushing and 24 hours later, after morning and evening brushing with the assigned product. In the first study, volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) were measured instrumentally via a portable sulfide monitor (Halimeter) with an electrochemical gas sensor. The second study used second-person malodor assessment on a 9-point hedonic scale. Treatments were compared at each time point using analysis of variance for crossover designs. Seventy-five subjects completed the evaluation (26 in the first and 49 in the second clinical trial). The use of the stabilized SnF2 dentifrice resulted in statistically significant reduction of overnight VSC (P <.03) and the overnight hedonic scores (P <.02) relative to the negative control after 1 day of product use. These 2 randomized, controlled clinical trials provide evidence of significant immediate malodor activity for a 0.454% stabilized SnF2 sodium hexametaphosphate dentifrice."
CD007868,0,28032531,0,"Fluoride concentrations in a range of ready-to-drink beverages consumed in Heilongjiang Province, north-east China.","Consumption of ready-to-drink beverages, as a potential source of fluoride (F), has increased considerably in China over the last decade. To help inform the public and policy makers, this study aimed to measure F concentration of ready-to-drink beverages on sale in Heilongjiang province, north east China. Three batches of 106 drink products manufactured by 26 companies were purchased from the main national supermarkets in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, China. The F concentration of all samples was determined, in triplicate, using a fluoride ion-selective electrode in conjunction with a meter and a direct method of analysis. The products were categorised into 10 groups according to product type. F concentrations of the samples ranged from 0.012-1.625 mg/l with a mean of 0.189 mg/l and a median of 0.076 mg/l. More than half of the products (55%) had an F concentration of ≤0.1 mg/l, while <5% had a F concentration of >0.7 mg/l. The 'tea with milk' group contained the highest mean F concentration (1.350 mg/l), whereas the lowest mean F concentration (0.027 mg/l) was found for the 'fruit juice' group. For some products, such as tea, fruit juice and carbonated beverages, there were substantial variations in F concentration between batches, manufacturers and production sites. In conclusion, ready-to-drink products (apart from tea), sold in Heilongjiang province, China, when consumed in moderation are unlikely to constitute a substantial risk factor for the development of dental or skeletal fluorosis."

CD007868,0,21778723,0,Impact of enamel defects on early caries development in preschool children.,"Quantitative defects of the enamel are considered risk factors for caries development at the cavitated level. Since caries risk assessment and control should be implemented as early as possible in order to prevent operative treatment, it seemed interesting to investigate the relationship between enamel defects and caries development in the stages of progression that precede cavitation. The impact of enamel defects and selected child-mother indicators on early caries development was investigated in a cohort of Brazilian preschool children. The null hypothesis that developmental defects of the enamel and dental caries are independent and that an association between them occurs by chance was tested. The sample (n = 1,718) was made up of 2- to 5-year-olds. Developmental defects of enamel and caries on buccal surfaces were identified in 48 and 26% of the children, respectively. Bivariate analyses at the surface level showed neither an association between demarcated/diffuse opacity and caries experience (p ≥ 0.64, GLM), nor between the presence of hypoplastic surfaces and non-cavitated lesions (p = 0.29, GLM). The multivariate analyses indicated that in the mouths of individual children, hypoplastic surfaces were more likely to present filled surfaces and non-cavitated/cavitated lesions than non-hypoplastic surfaces (within-child p = 0.03, GEE). However, children having teeth with hypoplastic surfaces were not at higher caries risk than those children who did not present hypoplastic surfaces (between-child p = 0.23, GEE). The null hypothesis could not be accepted for quantitative defects such as hypoplasia, since they had a significant impact on the within-child prevalence of filled surfaces and non-cavitated/cavitated lesions."

CD007868,0,23483461,0,[Sensitivity to antibiotics and genetic support to resistance of Shigella flexneri strains isolated in Dakar from 2001 to 2010].,"Diarrheal diseases remain a leading cause of death with 14.7 million deaths in 2001 and 26% of global mortality worldwide according to WHO. Shigella species are prevalent in tropical areas; they are present all the year, with epidemic outbreaks in rainy season. Between 2001 and 2010 one hundred ninety (190) strains of Shigella flexneri isolated from National Senegalese Enterobacteriaceae Center located at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar were studied. Susceptibility was performed by antibiogram following the CASFM recommendations. Detection and characterization of integrons and resistance genes was done by PCR using specific primers and sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility showed high percentage resistance to tetracycline: 95%, cotrimoxazole 60%, ampicillin 55%. Nineteen strains were cephalosporin resistant (10%). Two isolates were resistant to quinolones and one was imipenem resistant. Genes tet, dfr, cat, bla tem1 , bla oxa30 , bla shv , bla CTX-M , blakpc,bla IMP , gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE were detected on isolates. Integrons harbored genes resistance. The class 1 integron predominated followed by class 2 integron. Genes bla oxa30 , aadA1/aadA2 dfrA1, dfrA7 were found on class 1 integron. Class 2 integron showed three different types cassettes. No class 3 integron was detected. Genes dfrA1, dfrA7, sat, and aadA1 were harbouring by integrons. Antibiotic susceptibility showed that Shigella flexneri strains are resistant to the first line drugs used to treat shigellosis in Senegal. Resistance to 3rd generation of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones emerged and is of great concern. These molecules must be used with caution in the treatment of shigellosis."

CD007868,0,8634898,0,"Dental caries and dental fluorosis among 4-, 6-, 12- and 15-year-old children in kindergartens and public schools in Kuwait.","The purpose of the present study was 1) to describe the occurrence of dental caries and fluorosis among children in kindergartens and public schools in Kuwait, and determine their need for dental health care, 2) to describe changes in caries prevalence and experience from 1982 to 1993 and 3) to provide a baseline for the evaluation of the preventive oral health programmes starting in Kuwait in 1994. The study population comprised 3,500 4-, 6-, 12- and 15-year-old children in kindergartens and public schools in Kuwait, selected by stratified cluster sampling. Dental caries was scored by surface in accordance with WHO criteria, and dental fluorosis was registered by Dean's index (modified). The mean deft was 4.6 at age 4 years, and 6.2 at age 6; 8 and 11 percent of the decay had been treated by extractions or fillings in the two respective age groups. Among the 6-, 12- and 15-year-old children DMFT was 0.2, 2.6 and 3.6 respectively; 12 and 14 percent of the decayed teeth of 12- and 15-year-old children had been treated. As to the 4- and 6-year-old children, 19 and 9 percent were caries-free in the deciduous teeth, while 86, 21 and 14 percent of the 6-, 12- and 15-year-old children were caries-free in the permanent teeth. Among the 4-year-old children 47 percent had caries in the front teeth. None of the children had severe dental fluorosis, but 6 percent at 12 and 15 years showed mild to moderate, but manifest, dental fluorosis. The survey revealed that caries experience as well as caries prevalence had increased since 1982, although there was a marked increase in the number of filled tooth surfaces in all age cohorts. However, in 1993 the DMFT of 12-year-old children was still well within WHO's global goal for the year 2000, whereas the prevalence of dental caries among 6-year-old was considerably higher than the WHO goal."

CD007868,0,3857149,0,Relationship between enamel fluoride concentration and dental caries in a selected population.,The relationship between dental caries experience (DMFT) and enamel fluoride concentration (EnF) was determined in 100 freshman dental students aged between 20 and 26 yr. DMFT was determined by clinical examination and supplemented by bitewing radiographs. Biopsies were performed on the maxillary right canine of each student by etching with 1 M perchloric acid for 5 s. A regression analysis of DMFT and EnF and of square root DMFT and 1nEnF indicated that the correlation coefficients were not significant. Students exposed to fluoridated drinking water had significantly lower DMFT and significantly greater EnF than the students reared in areas with non-fluoridated drinking water.

CD007868,0,3479075,0,Increased dental caries activity in pre-school children with low baseline levels of serum IgG antibodies against the bacterial species Streptococcus mutans.,"The caries increment was followed for two years in 33 children, aged 2.6-4.9 years at the start of the investigation. This was analysed in relation to Streptococcus mutans counts in dental plaque and serum IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against Strep. mutans 10449 (serotype c). Furthermore, related factors, sugar, fluoride consumption and oral hygiene, were analysed. Large numbers of Strep. mutans in dental plaque were significantly associated with high caries incidence. Children with dental caries at the first examination and an increasing incidence of caries throughout the study period had significantly lower serum IgG antibodies against Strep. mutans (p = 0.006) than those whose caries activity was decreasing or who were caries-free at the beginning of the follow-up. The protective effect of specific serum IgG antibodies was most pronounced on the approximal surfaces of deciduous molars. Specific IgA or IgM antibodies were not associated with the development of caries."

The amount injected ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 ml (mean 0.3). A single injection cured the reflux in 26 ureters (65%) and the grade of reflux improved in a further 9 ureters. Seven ureters required a second injection and reflux was cured in 6 of these. The overall cure rate was therefore 80% after the second injection. There was one complication due to self-limiting ureteric obstruction following injection. The procedure is quick, easy to perform and effective. We have some reservations about the long-term efficiency and safety of subureteric Polytef injection in children."

CD007868,0,9924506,0,[Analysis of fluoride concentration in mineral waters in the Araraquara region in Brazil].,"It has been shown that people of all ages can benefit from the topical and systemic effects of water fluoridation. However, the increase in consumption of bottled water, either to substitute for or supplement consumption of water from public sources, has implications for safe fluoride supplementation. Taking that into consideration, in 1995 we analyzed the fluoride content in 31 commercial brands of mineral water in the region of Araraquara, state of São Paulo, Brazil. Fluoride concentration as determined by our analysis was compared to the concentration of fluoride specified on each label. Only 25% of the products studied listed the fluoride concentration on their labels. In addition, among 31 mineral water brands, 26 listed the date when the chemical analysis to determine chemical composition had been performed. Of these, 20 had not been put through the annual chemical analysis determined by Brazilian law. Based on these results, if the mineral waters tested had been the only source of drinking water, fluoride supplementation would have been necessary in 69% of the samples analyzed. In the case of children up to 6 years of age who use products containing fluoride, such as topical gels, mouthwashes or toothpastes, supplementation should be recommended only if commercially bottled water is the only source of water used, not only for drinking but for cooking as well."
CD007868,0,10909495,0,"[The effect of selected prophylactic-educational programs on oral hygiene, periodontium and caries in school children during a 4-year observation].","The aim of the work was the continuation of the evaluation of the efficacy of three prophylactic-educational programs in the field of oral cavity hygiene, status of periodontium and dental caries, and their influence on the forming of pro-health awareness and correct hygiene habits among school children. The work under discussion is the second stage of observations of the above-mentioned programs as well as the complete evaluation of 4-years examinations. The clinical and questionnaire studies were carried out in two elementary schools in Szczecin. Two hundred and twenty-three pupils were randomly allocated to three test groups: I (45 children), II (71 children), III (60 children) and control group K (47 children). In both schools mentioned above the examinations started when children were 7-8 years old and all of them were receiving planned stomatological treatment and contact fluoridation. All programs of the second stage of studies were the same as those of the first stage [49], only with the modified frequency of meetings with children. Program I, carried out in group I, was based on individual, motivating instructions of oral cavity hygiene (total 10 meetings during second stage of research). Programs II and III (group II and III accordingly) were expanded by educational activity among children and their parents. Additionally program III was enriched by professional mechanical tooth-cleaning, the use of fissure sealants, intensive dental care and proximal surface cleaning with dental floss (Tab. 1). The above-mentioned programs were carried out in co-operation with school dentists, teachers, fifth year dentistry students and students from Medical College--Oral Hygienist Faculty. After 4-years-long studies the evaluation of the three above-mentioned programs in oral cavity hygiene was achieved by using OHI-S and PI(QH). The status of periodontium was evaluated by GI and the intensity of dental caries by DMFT and DMFS. The increase of caries during the second stage of examinations was additionally evaluated and analysed thoroughly. The questionnaire studies made it possible to estimate the changes in the pro-health awareness among examined children. Reduction of OHI-S after 4 years was about 23% to 26% (Fig. 1). The status of gums shows the state of oral cavity hygiene in a better way. In control group the state remained unchanged, but in groups I, II and III it improved considerably (reduction of GI about 46% to 79%--Fig. 2). The reduction of caries in examined groups obtained after 4 years of studies was about 25% to 77% (Fig. 3) however during the second stage of research if figured out from 17% up to 72% (Fig. 4). Extreme increase of DS observed in the second stage of studies was 2.0 in control group K, a little less--1.51 in group I and 0.38 in group III (Fig. 5). The DS in group III reached the value -0.27 which proved that program III was the most efficient. The results of questionnaire studies showed a distinct improvement of health awareness among examined children. However the value of GI indicated some discrepancy between children's health knowledge and pro-health behaviour. Also it was noticed that the level of parents' education and their socioeconomic status had influence on building up good hygiene habits and on the state of caries among the examined children. The studies proved that the implementation of the above-mentioned prophylactic-educational programs or similar ones in elementary school conditions is possible with the use of hygienist under the dentist's supervision."
CD007868,0,2681732,0,Review of the anticaries effectiveness of professionally applied and self-applied topical fluoride gels.,"Of the five types of topical fluoride gel products available in the United States, two have not been clinically tested in randomized double blind clinical trials. For those tested, the averaged results of clinical trials involving schoolchildren in fluoride-deficient communities indicate a caries reduction of approximately 26 percent from either a professional or self-administered program. A similar relative reduction can be expected from programs conducted in fluoridated communities, but the absolute caries inhibition is less. Twice-a-year professional applications are more effective than once-a-year applications, and self-applications using trays are more effective than applying the gel on a toothbrush. For subjects beyond school age, there are few clinical studies of either self-applied or professionally applied gels; however, current epidemiological evidence does not indicate a need for public health caries preventive programs for healthy employed adults. For medically compromised patients, especially those exhibiting rampant caries associated with radiation-induced xerostomia, a variety of topical gel procedures appear to be effective in limiting caries."
CD007868,0,19686543,0,Human exposure to triclosan via toothpaste does not change CYP3A4 activity or plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones.,"Triclosan is an antibacterial compound commonly used in cosmetics and personal care products for everyday use. As previously shown, triclosan is found in the plasma, urine and milk from large parts of different human populations. Recent studies have revealed that triclosan is able to activate the human pregnane X receptor in vitro and thus possibly affecting metabolism of drugs in humans via the induction of CYP3A4. Besides, triclosan has been shown to affect thyroid hormonal levels in rats in vivo. In the present study, we investigated if an everyday exposure to triclosan via triclosan-containing toothpaste for 14 days in 12 adult humans caused an increase in plasma 4beta-hydroxycholesterol, indicative of CYP3A4 induction, and/or alterations in thyroid hormonal status. The plasma triclosan concentrations increased from 0.009-0.81 ng/g to 26-296 ng/g (ranges) upon exposure. Despite this, there were no significant changes in plasma levels of either plasma 4beta-hydroxycholesterol or thyroid hormones during the exposure. This indicates that the normal use of triclosan-containing toothpaste is not likely to alter metabolism of drugs via CYP3A4 induction or cause adverse events because of thyroid disturbances in humans."
CD007868,0,17514449,0,[Oral health behaviour of children and adolescents in Germany. First results of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS)].,"Despite successful prevention and the possibility to directly control oral health by individual behaviour, children are still affected by caries. Aim of this article is to determine the prevalence and the social factors influencing selected aspects of oral health behaviour based on data of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS). Over a period of three years, 17,641 children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years - a representative sample for Germany - were examined in the nationwide KiGGS study. Based on a written survey and a medical interview, data on oral health behaviour were also collected. 29 % of the surveyed children and adolescents brushed their teeth only once daily or less frequently. This type of teeth brushing behaviour shows a social status gradient (low: 39 %, middle: 28 %, high: 22 %) and is more frequently found in children with a migration background (45 %) than in those without a migration background (26 %). Differences were also found between girls and boys (girls: 25 %; boys: 33 %). In only 8 % of cases, parents stated that their children have a dental check-up less than once a year. However, this information substantially differs from the actual visits to dentists. Here again, differences regarding social status (low: 12 %; high: 6 %) and migration status (migrants: 16 %; non-migrants: 6 %) were found. According to the parents, 43 % of the 0-to-2-year-olds and 7 % of the 3-to-6-year-olds use pharmaceutical preparations for caries prevention. Relevant differences were found between migrants (5 %) and non-migrants (8 %). These results show that there is primarily a need for social status-specific and culture-specific prevention. To identify starting points for effectively offering preventative measures, a systematic study into the factors causing these behavioural differences is needed."

The synthesis of key intermediate 2 is highlighted by a ZnCl(2)-MAEP complex 19 catalyzed diastereoselective Michael reaction of dioxolane 7 with 2-cyclopenten-1-one (5) to establish the contiguous quaternary-tertiary chiral centers and a subsequent geminal difluorination of ketone 17 using Deoxofluor in the presence of catalytic BF(3).OEt(2). The synthesis of the amine moiety 3 is highlighted by the discovery of a novel n-Bu(3)MgLi magnesium-halogen exchange reaction for selective functionalization of 2,6-dibromopyridine. This new and practical metalation protocol obviated cryogenic conditions and upon quenching with DMF gave 6-bromo-2-formylpyridine (26) in excellent yield. Further transformations afforded the amine fragment 3 via reductive amination with 35, Pd-catalyzed aromatic amination, and deprotection. Finally, the highly convergent synthesis of 1 was accomplished by coupling of the two fragments. This synthesis has been used to prepare multi-kilogram quantities of the bulk drug."
CD007868,0,22113711,0,Caries-preventive and remineralizing effect of fluoride gel in orthodontic patients after 2 years.,"Patients with orthodontic appliances exhibit a higher caries risk, but they are often excluded from preventive studies. Thus, the aim of this observational study was to assess the caries-preventive and remineralizing effect of a high-fluoride gel in orthodontic patients. Two hundred twenty-one orthodontic patients (age, 6-19 years; mean, 13.1 ± 2.3; n = 104 with use of a 1.25% fluoride gel weekly at home, 117 participants without) were recruited and followed for 2 years, recording caries (decayed/missing/filled teeth (DMFT)/decayed/missing/filled surface (DMFS), active/inactive lesions), orthodontic treatment, use of fluorides, plaque and gingivitis. Baseline values regarding demographic and clinical parameters were equivalent for the 75 participants using fluoride gel and the 77 individuals of the control group who completed the study. The initial plaque and gingivitis values (approximal plaque index (API), 37% ± 34 and 42% ± 39, resp.; papillary bleeding index (PBI), 19% ± 28 and 22% ± 27, resp.) deteriorated slightly during the 2-year study (API, 54%/56%; PBI, 25%/28%). The increase in carious defects or fillings was minimal in both groups (fluoride, 0.75 DMFT ± 1.2, 1.27 DMFS ± 1.9; control, 0.99 ± 1.3 and 1.62 ± 2.6, resp.) without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.12 for DMFT, 0.44 for DMFS). The main statistically significant effect of the fluoride use was the reversal of active initial lesions diagnosed (fluoride group, -0.96 ± 1.82; control, -0.19 ± 2.0, p = 0.004), while the number of inactive initial lesions increased (2.3 ± 2.1 and 1.7 ± 2.1, resp.; p = 0.02). In conclusion, the weekly application of a fluoride gel in orthodontic patients can reduce their caries activity. Initial caries lesions in orthodontic patients can be inactivated by weekly fluoride gel use at home."

Fifty-three patients (27 female and 26 male), 7 to 10 years old, were included in the study. At baseline, a total of 192 permanent first molars were sealed with either fissure sealant (n=96, each), using invasive technique. The sealed teeth were evaluated at post-operative 3, 6, 12 and 24 months with respect to evaluation parameters. The data were analyzed with the Chi-Square tests where alpha=0.05. There were no statistically significant differences between fissure sealants as regards to retention and prevention of caries for all periods of the evaluation (p>0.05). However, regarding marginal integrity of the sealants, Delton FS+ gave significantly better results than Dyract Seal for the 3-, 6- and 12-month evaluations, respectively (p<0.05). In conclusion, the use of Dyract Seal on permanent molars with invasive technique was found to be clinically comparable to Delton FS+ for the 24-month evaluation period."

CD007868,0,16946612,0,Quantification of dental fluorosis using fluorescence imaging.,"Fluorescence imaging hardware and software have been recently employed to assess demineralization due to early dental caries. Dental fluorosis also presents as diffuse surface hypomineralization of enamel and in principle similar measurement methods might be applicable to both. The caries analysis system requires the user to select an area of sound enamel around the lesion so that the affected surface can be reconstructed and the lesion subtracted. Whereas early caries presents as discrete isolated lesions fluorosis is characterized by diffuse opacities covering most of the tooth. Consequently it is difficult to use commercial QLF software for the assessment of fluorosis, as there is typically no sound area of enamel to use for reconstruction. This study describes a fluorescent imaging device capable of recording digital images of the anterior teeth and also software that is able to objectively measure fluorosis area and severity. A convenience sample of 26 subjects with a range of fluorosis from TF scores 0-3 took part in the study. The upper left central incisor of these subjects was scored for fluorosis using the TF index, photographed using a conventional digital camera and imaged using the fluorescence imaging device. The TF index was then used to visually score the digital photographs and the fluorescence images. The data from the fluorescence method demonstrated a strong correlation with TF scores from fluorescence images (Kendall's tau = 0.862). The fluorescence imaging method shows promise as an objective, potentially blinded system for the longitudinal assessment of enamel fluorosis in vivo."
CD007868,0,8556745,1,Effect of a modified toothpaste technique on approximal caries in preschool children.,"A 3-year, double-blind caries trial was conducted to evaluate the caries-reducing effect of a modified technique to use toothpaste. At the outset, 369 children, 4 years of age, were randomly assigned to four groups. At the end of the study, when the children were 7 years old, 281 (76%) had completed the trial. Two of the groups (test groups, n = 131) were given the following instructions regarding 'toothpaste technique': (1) to spread the paste evenly on the teeth prior to brushing, (2) not to expectorate more than necessary during brushing, (3) to filter the remaining dentifrice foam in the dentition, together with a sip of water, by active cheek movements for 1 min before expectorating, and (4) not to carry out any further water rinsings afterwards, and not to eat or drink for 2 h after brushing. The children in the other two groups (control groups, n = 150) were not given any instruction how to use the dentifrice and how to rinse after the brushing, but were, as the children in the test groups, encouraged to use the test dentifrice and to brush their teeth twice daily. Two commercial fluoride dentifrices (A and B) were compared: one of the test groups and one of the control groups used each product. Approximal carious lesions were scored on bite-wing radiographs at baseline and at the end of the study on the distal surface of the first and on the mesial surface of the second primary molars. No difference in caries increment was found between toothpastes A and B. The children in the two test groups developed a mean of 1.14 new dfs during the 3 years compared to 1.55 in the two control groups (p < 0.05). Thus, the results indicate that the modified toothpaste technique reduced approximal caries in preschool children by an average of 26%."
CD007868,0,7660318,0,Toothpaste technique. Studies on fluoride delivery and caries prevention.,"The aim of the investigations was to evaluate the cariostatic effects of a modified toothpaste technique using fluoride (F) toothpaste. The modification consisted of an active mouthrinse with the toothpaste slurry and a sip of water for one minute after brushing. Toothpaste technique and salivary F concentration after toothbrushing were recorded in a caries active and a caries inactive group. The level of F in whole saliva, the concentration of F in plasma, the effect on demineralised enamel and dentine samples, and the accumulation of F in interdental plaque when using the modified toothpaste technique were studied. In a 3-year clinical trial, 4-year old children were trained in the toothpaste technique. The results showed that in the caries active group, the water rinsing was more thorough and more water was used compared to a caries inactive group. Rinsing with water and eating immediately after toothbrushing decreased the F level in whole saliva. Mouthrinsing with either a NaF solution or a slurry of toothpaste foam and water increased the F concentration in saliva compared to when a single or double water rinse was performed. The degree of F absorption in plasma, the accumulation of F in approximal plaque and the interdental clearance after toothbrushing were strongly related to the mode of water rinsing. The degree of demineralisation of enamel and dentine at approximal sites was also related to the mode of water rinsing. The clinical study showed that the cariostatic effect of the modified toothpaste technique resulted in 26% less approximal caries in the test group. It is concluded that a toothpaste technique where a slurry rinse was carried out after brushing increased the efficacy of F toothpaste."

CD007868,0,8877091,0,Effect of copper co-crystallized with sugar on caries development in desalivated rats.,"The purpose of the present study was to explore the effects of varying levels of copper incorporated in sucrose by co-crystallization on caries development in the desalivated rat model and to examine the retention of copper in the oral cavity and its influence on protein and carbohydrate composition of plaque. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were infected by Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 and desalivated when aged 26 days. Four groups were placed in a König-Höfer programmed feeder and received 17 meals daily at hourly intervals, and essential nutrition (NCP No. 2) by gavage twice daily. The control group (1) received meals of plain sucrose, and groups 2, 3, and 4 received sucrose co-crystallized with 300 ppm Cu2+(2), 150 Cu2+(3), and 75 Cu2+(4). After 3 weeks, the animals were killed, and blood was collected for determination of copper. The lower jaw was removed and sonicated in 0.9% saline solution. Microbial assessment and copper, protein and carbohydrate assays were performed for each animal. Smooth-surface and [sulcal] caries scores were: (1) 92.0[41.4]; (2) 6.1[34.2]; (3) 16.7[32.0]; (4) 24.0[36.0]. Copper in sucrose drastically affected the population of S. sobrinus when compared with the control. Also, Cu2+ sucrose groups had significantly more copper per unit of protein and carbohydrate in jaw suspension than the control group. Concentration of copper in the blood was apparently unaffected by any dietary regimen. It is concluded that Cu2+ in a range of concentrations (75-300 ppm Cu2+) when delivered co-crystallized with sucrose is an effective cariostatic agent. The co-crystallization of a cariostatic agent with sucrose may be an effective method to decrease the cariogenic potential of sucrose."
CD007868,0,16567555,0,Oral health beliefs in adolescence and oral health in young adulthood.,"According to theory, health beliefs are related to health behaviors. We investigated whether individuals who hold favorable oral-health-related beliefs over time have better adult oral health than those who do not. Beliefs about the efficacy of water fluoridation, keeping the mouth clean, avoiding sweet foods, visiting the dentist, using dental floss, and using fluoridated toothpaste were assessed in a birth cohort at ages 15, 18, and 26 years. At each age, the majority of participants endorsed the importance of each practice. However, there was also evidence of instability across time. Individuals who held stable favorable dental beliefs from adolescence through adulthood had fewer teeth missing due to caries, less periodontal disease, better oral hygiene, better self-rated oral health, and more restorations. Dental beliefs can change between adolescence and young adulthood, and these changes are related to oral health. In particular, unfavorable dental health beliefs are related to poorer oral health."
CD007868,0,24926421,0,fAFLP analysis of Brazilian Bacillus thuringiensis isolates.,"A total of 65 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) isolates were subjected to analysis of genetic relationship using fAFLP (fluorescent Fragment Length Polymorphism), in order to determine the genetic diversity within a group of Bt strains. 26 strains from different subspecies were identified as it follows: 9 kindly provided by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), 9 kindly provided by the Institute Pasteur and eight from Embrapa Maize and Sorghum Bt Collection, and 39 strains with no subspecies information also from Embrapa's Bt Collection. DNA sample was double digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and MseI, and the fragments were linked to adapters. Selective amplification reactions were performed using five primer combinations and the amplified fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis on an ABI377 sequencer. Genetic distances were obtained by the complement of the Jaccard coefficient and the groups were performed by the UPGMA method. Five primer combinations generated 495 scorable fragments and 483 were found to be polymorphic. Out of 26 subspecies, strains 344 and T09 (B. thuringiensis subsp. tolworthi) showed the highest similarity (15%), while isolates HD3 B. thuringiensis subsp finitimus and T24 B. thuringiensis subsp neoleonensis were the most genetically distant (92%). B. thuringiensis isolates with no subspecies identification, found in samples from Goiás State showed higher similarity forming a group with an average distance of 6%, and the closest subspecies to this group was B. thuringiensis subsp thuringiensis (HD2) with 52% of similarity. This similarity may be due to the fact that these organism exchange genetic material by conjugation, and it is relatively common to have evolutionary characteristics of their ancestors."

CD007868,0,9927915,0,Effect on caries experience of a long-term preventive program for mothers and children starting during pregnancy.,"The aim of this three-phase prospective study was to determine the effects of a primary-primary prevention program on the oral health of children. Eighty-six pregnant women from various social backgrounds participated in the first phase of this study. In the second phase (at 3 years of age) 54 of the mother-child couples and in the third phase (at 4 years of age) 47 of the mother-child couples remained. Participants were recalled every 6 months and received individual prophylactic care. The following clinical parameters were assessed at each examination period for mother and child: DMF-S or dmf-s, proximal plaque index, and the salivary level of Streptococcus mutans (Dentocult SM). The control group consisted of 65 (at 3 years of age) and 45 (at 4 years of age) children from various kindergartens. All children in the second phase of the study group revealed a naturally healthy dentition with an API of 0-25% and a salivary S. mutans score of 0 (0-10(3) cfu/ml). In the third phase, only four of the 47 children of the study group showed caries, with a mean dmf-s of 1.5. No S. mutans could be detected in 20 (42.6%) children. Ten (21.3%) children of the study group showed a S. mutans score of > or = 2 (> 10(5) cfu/ml). In contrast, only 53 of the 65 children of the control group (second phase) and 26 of the 45 control children (third phase) revealed a naturally healthy dentition. The remaining 19 children of the control group revealed a mean dmf-s of 7.0 at 4 years of age. In the control group, no S. mutans could be detected in 25 (38.5%) children at 3 years of age whereas 21 (32.3%) children showed a S. mutans score of > or = 2. In the third phase, a salivary S. mutans score of > or = 2 was found in 27 (60%) children of the control group. The statistical comparison between the study and the control groups revealed significant differences for all results determined (P < 0.001). Additionally, all mothers revealed a significant improvement in oral health and a reduction of salivary S. mutans colonization. From our data we conclude that a pre- and postnatal prevention program (primary-primary vs primary prevention) may significantly improve the oral health of mother and child."
CD007868,0,2650531,0,"An evaluation of a fluoride-releasing, visible light-activated bonding system for orthodontic bracket placement.","In spite of improved preventive measures, decalcification around bonded orthodontic appliances continues to be a problem for the clinician. Various fluoride-containing mediums have been proposed as aiding in the elimination of this problem; however, almost all are dependent on patient cooperation for their success. An ideal preventive system would be one that would operate independently of patient cooperation. The purpose of the present study was to compare a visible light-activated, fluoride-releasing bonding system with a visible light-activated conventional bonding system relative to bracket retention and prevalence of decalcification. Twenty-two patients were entered into the study, representing 206 experimental brackets and 206 control brackets. The average treatment period was 25 months. No significant differences in bracket retention rates were found between the two systems. Significantly, 26 teeth in the control group demonstrated decalcification (12.6%), whereas none of the teeth in the experimental group did. The results of this study suggest that a visible light-activated, fluoride-releasing bonding system is capable of adequately retaining brackets while aiding in the prevention of decalcification around bonded appliances."

She defied diagnosis until an acute flare followed immediately after dental treatment with a mint flavoured tooth cleaning powder. This led us to prick test her to mint leaves and this was positive. Her cheilitis settled after changing from her mint-flavoured toothpaste. A diagnosis of contact urticaria should be considered in cases of cheilitis of unknown cause."
CD007868,0,392699,0,Effect of caries in mentally handicapped children of addition of fluoride and bicarbonate-phosphate to dietary sugar products.,"Mentally handicapped children, aged 5--15 years and living in institutions, received fluoride supplement in several sugar products of their diet; in candies, marmalades, jams, fruit juices and in sweet desserts corresponding to 10 mg F as NaF per kg of the sugar (sucrose or glucose) of each product. To two of the four daily candies was also added a NaHCO3 + KH2PO4 mixture (mole ratio 9.8/l, resp.) to substitute for 2.5% of the sugar of the candy. The control children received the respective products without the additives. After stepwise exclusions of subjects for various reasons, e.g. for the absence of permanent teeth, low initial caries activity, strong medication, Down's syndrome, etc., the mean DMFS-increment in the remaining 43 control subjects was 4.5 and in the 41 test subjects 2.6 lesions/100 surfaces at risk, i.e. 42% reduction. Caries arrestment had occurred in these test subjects after the first year, while in the respective controls it was continuously increasing. Among numerous oral and body parameters studied, only surface enamel fluoride in primary teeth was increased by the fluoride supplements and urinary phosphate and calcium excretion decreased."
CD007868,0,1056817,0,An approach to objective assessment of caries prophylactic measures in a dental health program.,"In a retrospective survey the mean number of intact proximal surfaces on the first molars of 13-year-old children was found to increase from 2.6 to 4.8 following 7 years of a preventive program with fortnightly fluoride mouthrinsings (0.2% NaF). This improvement was significant and corresponded to a reduction of the totally filled surfaces from 30.0 to 16.6. Caries on the proximal surfaces on the first molars was assessed from bite-wing radiographs. Judged from interexaminer comparisons, the number of filled surfaces was a reliable parameter of the caries prevalence in 13-year-old children. In a group of 54 children aged 13 who participated in the preventive program, the caries experience on the proximal surfaces of the first molars was significantly associated with the total DMFS."

CD007868,0,8519058,0,Caries experience of 15-year-old children in The Netherlands after discontinuation of water fluoridation.,"In 1973 the fluoridation of drinking water in the Dutch town of Tiel was discontinued. In order to monitor the effect of this measure, the caries experience in 15-year-old children was investigated annually from 1979 to 1988, both in Tiel and in Culemborg. In the latter town the drinking water had never been fluoridated. The caries data of 15-year-old children examined between 1968 and 1969 in Tiel (children having used fluoridated water from birth) and Culemborg were used as historical controls. In Tiel the mean number of DMFS increased between 1968/69 and 1979/80 from 10.8 to 12.7 (+18%) and decreased to 9.6 (-26%) in the following years; in 1987/88 the mean DMFS was 11% lower than in 1968/69. In Culemborg the mean DMFS score decreased between 1968/69 and 1987/88 from 27.7 to 7.7 (-72%). In 1968/69 the mean DMFS score in Tiel was 61% lower and in 1987/88 17% higher than in Culemborg. The question as to whether water fluoridation would have had an additional effect if it had been continued (presuming the application of existing preventive measures) cannot be answered, as there are no remaining communities with fluoridated water in The Netherlands."
CD007868,0,2785284,0,A cross-sectional study of DMFT and CPITN scores in a group of Indonesian soldiers.,"A cross-sectional clinical study showed that the prevalence of caries among Indonesian soldiers was low, compared with that found in corresponding Western populations. Also, the progression of caries was very slow, and caries was limited almost exclusively to the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. Among officers, the prevalence of caries was lower than it was among other ranks of the same age. The low general prevalence of caries among Indonesian soldiers may be related to diet. Rice was the major source of carbohydrate for the soldiers, and their sucrose consumption was 10 kg per person per year. Their drinking water contained a low concentration of fluoride (0.1 ppm). In spite of massive accumulations of calculus, the periodontal health of young soldiers (less than 26 yr) was also good. Among those in higher age groups, however, periodontal health had deteriorated, but even in a group aged 40-46 yr, no teeth had been lost as a result of periodontal disease. Among officers, periodontal health was better than it was amongst other ranks of corresponding age. The officers had been accustomed to brushing their teeth regularly, whereas the other ranks had not. It thus appears that toothbrushing may help to preserve periodontal health, even when large amounts of calculus are present on the teeth and there is no opportunity for it to be removed regularly by a dentist."
CD007868,0,19089284,0,Use of Diagnodent for diagnosis of non-cavitated occlusal dentin caries.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a laser fluorescence device for detection of occlusal caries in permanent teeth. One hundred and ninety-nine non-cavitated teeth from 26 patients aged 10 to 13 years were selected. After dental prophylaxis, two previously calibrated dentists examined the teeth. Visual inspection, radiographic examination and laser measurements were performed under standardized conditions. The validation method was cavity preparation with a small cone-shaped diamond bur, when the two examiners agreed about the presence of dentin caries. It was found that the laser detection method produced high values of sensitivity (0.93) and specificity (0.75) and a moderate positive predictive value (0.63). The laser device showed the lowest value of likelihood ratio (3.68). Kappa coefficient showed good repeatability for all methods. Although the laser device had an acceptable performance, this equipment should be used as an adjunct method to visual inspection to avoid false positive results."
CD007868,0,9892778,0,Caries and fluorosis prevalence in communities with different concentrations of fluoride in the water.,"The need to defluoridate and fluoridate the water supplies in areas with drinking water naturally containing above-optimal (>/=2.5 mg/l) and suboptimal (</=0.3 mg/l) fluoride concentration and caries and fluorosis prevalence of 12-year-old schoolchildren were assessed in Italy. In the low-fluoride area, 48.4% children were caries-free (DMFT = 0) and the DMFT and DMFS were 1.5 and 2.6; in the high-fluoride area, 46.8% had a DMFT = 0 and the values of the indices were 1.4 and 1.6, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant association in the caries-free status according to parents' employment status (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.3) and children's sweets consumption, since children who consumed sweets at least once a day had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.8 (95% CI = 1.4-2.3) compared to those with a lower consumption. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that DMFT and DMFS were significantly higher in children with a lower socioeconomic status and in those who consumed sweets at least once a day, with the DMFS significantly associated also with the area of residence. DT and FT scores were higher in the high- and low-fluoride areas, respectively. No evidence of fluorosis was reported in 94.5 and 55.3% of children in the low- and high-fluoride areas, respectively. The Community Fluorosis Index (CFI) for all permanent teeth was significantly higher in the high-fluoride area, 0.8, than the value, 0.1, found in the low-fluoride community. Our results substantiate the difficulties in defining universal guidelines for the fluoridation or defluoridation of drinking water and the need for an epidemiological approach to the decision as to fluoridate and defluoridate the water supply."

CD007868,0,23230807,0,Adolescents' experiences of participating in a school-based fluoride varnish programme in Sweden.,"Population-based health promotion with school-based fluoride varnish programmes is becoming more frequent, as these programmes have been implemented in many parts of Sweden during the last five years. The caries-prevention effect is well studied, but as yet there is no study aimed at adolescents'experiences of these programmes. The aim of this study was therefore to describe how a school-based fluoride varnish programme is experienced by participating adolescents. The study was performed as a qualitative study by conducting four focus-groups interviews. In all, 26 adolescents participated, all aged 15. All the participants had several years'experiences of a fluoride varnish programme at school. The participants were asked to describe their experience of participating in the programme.The analysis of the data from the interviews was carried out according to the principles of phenomenography.The three themes that emerged were""Conceptions in relation to the individual"", ""Conceptions in relation to the school dental nurse""and ""Conceptions in relation to the group and school"". The result showed that the adolescents experienced that it was positive to take part in a fluoride varnish programme at school and they regarded the school as an important health promotion arena. In spite of this, there were perceptions that were worth reflecting on for school dental nurses, such as feelings of exposure, peer pressure and a perceived lack of information. To further improve these programmes, and thereby increase population-based dental health promotion, it is important to highlight the role of dental personnel, as they are largely responsible for creating the atmosphere."
CD007868,0,8069888,0,Relationship between oral hygiene and approximal caries in 15-year-old Norwegians.,"The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between oral hygiene level, as judged from the number of non-bleeding papillae (NBP), and approximal caries development and progression in 14- to 15-year-old Norwegians. NBP, according to Gjermo, were registered in 165 15-year-old Norwegians. Approximal lesions in the outer half (D1) or in the inner half (D2) of the enamel or in dentin (D3) and the total numbers of carious approximal surfaces (D1 + D2 + D3), filled approximal surfaces, and sound approximal surfaces were recorded from bite-wing radiographs from premolars and molars at the age of 14 and 15 years (values expressed as mean +/- SD). The average number of NBP in the whole group was 4.6 +/- 4.5. One group with good oral hygiene (NBP > or = 5, 8.7 +/- 3.3, n = 76) and one group with bad oral hygiene (NBP < 5, 1.2 +/- 1.5, n = 89) were established. Carious approximal surfaces and filled approximal surfaces were significantly higher in the group with few than in the group with many NBP (6.0 +/- 5.9 vs. 1.7 +/- 2.8 and 2.6 +/- 4.3 vs. 0.9 +/- 1.8, respectively). The number of lesions at the age of 15 and progression of lesions from 14 to 15 years were also significantly higher in the group with few NBP. It is concluded than in populations exposed regularly to fluoride, the oral hygiene level may be an important indicator of a high caries risk."

This study surveyed chair-side preventive measures used in the public clinics and compared them with recommendations in evidence-based guidelines in the neighbouring countries.Materials and methods After ethical approval, the regional Chief Dental Officers (CDOs) emailed questionnaires to their local clinics (N = 421) where the most experienced dentist and dental hygienist were asked to respond on behalf of the clinic. Answers were received from 256 clinics (response rate 61%). Altogether, 215 dentists and 166 dental hygienists answered.Results Of the respondents, 26% reported that their clinic had agreed guidelines on preventive treatment to be used by all staff. Oral hygiene and fluoride toothpaste recommendations were considered appropriate. Almost 60% claimed that flossing instructions were given to all children and adolescents and 40% that fluoride varnish was used on all the young. Fissure sealants were used after individual assessment (80%). A third of the respondents claimed that fluoride tablets and fluoride rinse were recommended for all or most children and fluoride rinses for adults, even in addition to regular use of fluoride toothpaste. Dental hygienists used all methods more often than dentists. On adults, preventive measures were more often used on individual assessment. Half (48%) of the respondents were interested in new evidence-based national guidelines on preventive care.Conclusions Chair-side preventive treatment measures were numerous in the well-resourced Norwegian PDS, but partly outdated."

The effects of extraction variables have been studied by response surface methodology. The best conditions were extraction with 100% methanol (2mM NaF) during 30min for table olives, and 91% methanol (2mM NaF) during 40min for olive paste. Chromatographic separation of 26 polyphenols from different families was optimized. This method provides high linearity, in all cases higher than 98.65%, and high sensitivity whose detection limits ranged between 0.08 and 1.11μg/mL. The validated method has been applied for the determination of polyphenols in table olive and olive paste samples.

This study's objectives were to describe misleading marketing strategies used in selling children's fluoridated toothpaste and identify warning label characteristics. Two researchers independently coded the packaging from 26 over-the-counter toothpastes that are specifically marketed for children. Aggressive marketing strategies targeting children were identified: every toothpaste in this sample displayed at least 1 children's animated character, 50% had at least 1 picture of a food item, 92.3% stated they were flavored and 26.9% depicted a full swirl of toothpaste, directly contradicting dentist recommendations for young children. Further, on most toothpaste tubes, warnings regarding fluoride overconsumption for young children were only listed on the back and in very small font. Misleading marketing strategies are regularly used in selling children's toothpaste as if it is a food product, while warnings regarding overconsumption among youth are minimized.

Initially, 1,400 women in the first trimester of pregnancy residing in communities served by fluoride-deficient drinking water were randomly assigned to one of two groups. During the last 6 months of pregnancy the treatment group received 1 mg fluoride daily in the form of a tablet and the control group received a placebo. Both treatment and control subjects were encouraged to use postnatal dietary fluoride supplements. Caries was measured in children at age 3 and 5 while fluorosis was assessed at age 5. Caries activity was very low in both study groups: 92% of children remained caries-free in the treatment group and 91% remained caries-free in the placebo group. Fluorosis was observed in 26 subjects, all classified as very mild. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in the study groups with respect to caries and fluorosis in deciduous teeth. The study had sufficient power to detect an absolute risk reduction of 5.1% while only a 1.5% reduction was observed. These findings do not support the hypothesis that prenatal fluoride has a strong caries-preventive effect."

Enamel was sampled by acid-etching and the F levels were measured with an adapted F ion-selective electrode. More F was built into the deeper enamel in the high-F area than in a similar low-F area. Unerupted enamel did not etch significantly (p > 0.05) deeper than erupted enamel. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in the F concentrations amongst the following: alkali-washed erupted, unwashed erupted, alkali-washed unerupted and unwashed unerupted at the outer most enamel (approx. 6 microns). However the erupted enamel (alkali-washed or not) showed higher F levels than unerupted enamel (alkali-washed or not) between approx. 6 microns and greater than 100 microns. The increase of F for this high-F area was about 100% in the deeper enamel while for a low-F area it was approx. 78% in the most outer enamel with no increase after a depth of about 20 microns. In contrast to a similar low-F area (water F < 0.10 parts/10(6)), no significant 'CaF2-like' F could be detected in erupted or unerupted enamel for the high-F area."

The study design was a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial with two parallel arms. The subjects were 273 consecutive 12- to 15-year-old children referred for maxillary treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances. The patients were randomly assigned to a test or a control group with topical applications of either a fluoride varnish (Fluor Protector) or a placebo varnish every 6th week during the treatment period. The outcome measures at debonding were incidence and progression of WSL on the upper incisors, cuspids and premolars as scored from digital photographs by 2 independent examiners. The attrition rate was 5%. The mean number of varnish applications was 10 (range 4-20) in both groups. The incidence of WSL during the treatment with fixed appliances was 7.4% in the fluoride varnish compared to 25.3% placebo group (p < 0.001). The mean progression score was significantly lower in the fluoride varnish group than in the placebo group, 0.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 2.6 +/- 2.8 (p < 0.001). The absolute risk reduction was 18% and the number needed to treat was calculated to 5.5. The results from the present study strongly suggest that regular topical fluoride varnish applications during treatment with fixed appliances may reduce the development of WSL adjacent to the bracket base. Application of fluoride varnish should be advocated as a routine measure in orthodontic practice."
CD007868,0,2312892,0,Dependence of in vitro demineralization of apatite and remineralization of dental enamel on fluoride concentration.,"The anti-caries activity of fluoride is contributed to in several ways. Two major aspects of fluoride action are (i) the inhibition of demineralization at the crystal surfaces within the tooth, and (ii) the enhancement of subsurface remineralization resulting in arrestment or reversal of caries lesions. Fluoride present in the aqueous phase at the apatite crystal surface may play a determining role in the inhibition of enamel or dentin demineralization. In one part of the present study, the initial dissolution rate of synthetic carbonated-apatite in acetate buffers was measured with fluoride present in the buffer in the 0-2.6 mmol/L (0-50 ppm) range. Inhibition of demineralization was shown to be a logarithmic function of the fluoride concentration in solution. In the second part of the present study, an in vitro pH-cycling model was used for determination of the effect on net de/remineralization of enamel by treatment solutions containing fluoride in the 0-26 mmol/L (0-500 ppm) range. The net mineral loss was shown to be negatively related to the logarithm of the fluoride concentration. These studies have demonstrated an exponential quantitative relationship between fluoride concentration and inhibition of apatite demineralization or enhancement of remineralization. The clinical implications are (i) that simply increasing fluoride concentration may not necessarily give increased cariostatic benefit, and (ii) that improving the means of delivery of relatively low fluoride concentrations for longer times should be more appropriate for enhancing clinical efficacy."

CD007868,0,30697084,0,Early childhood caries and oral health care of Hong Kong preschool children.,"Surveys have shown that the prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC) among 5-year-old children decreased from 63% in 1993 to 55% in 2017. Caries experience was unevenly distributed; 81% of the caries lesions were found in 26% of the children. Risk factors, including oral hygiene practice behaviors, sugar consumption, parental oral health-related knowledge, and sociodemographic backgrounds, were significantly related to ECC. Oral health promotion aimed at managing the burden of ECC has been implemented. Water fluoridation was launched in 1961, and the fluoride concentration has been adjusted to 0.5 ppm since 1988. It is considered an important dental public health measure in Hong Kong. The Department of Health set up the Oral Health Education Unit in 1989 to deliver oral health education to further improve the oral health of preschool children. Other nongovernmental organizations also launched short-term oral health promotion programs for preschool children. However, no significant change in the prevalence of ECC has been observed in the recent two decades. There is a necessity to revisit dental public health policies and develop effective evidence-based strategies to encourage changes in oral health-related behaviors to forestall the impending epidemic of ECC in Hong Kong."

CD007868,0,23748452,0,Biochemical composition of carious dentin and different layers of sound dentin.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and fluoride (F) in carious dentin and in different layers of sound dentin. The samples examined were 52 permanent teeth (26 sound and 26 carious), which were subjected to two experiments to assess the mineral content of: 1) two layers (internal and external) of sound dentin and 2) sound and carious dentin. Ca and Pi were analyzed using a colorimetric method with arsenazo III (C22H18As2N4O14S2) and molybdate reagents, and F was analyzed using a specific electrode. A non-parametric test, the Mann-Whitney test, was used to verify differences between groups. Sound dentin showed a higher concentration of fluoride in the internal layer than in the external layer (P = 0.03), but no inter-layer differences in Ca or Pi concentration were evident. Lower concentrations of Ca, Pi and F were observed in carious dentin than in sound dentin (P < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that the internal layer of sound dentin has a higher fluoride content than the external layer, and that carious dentin has lower concentrations of Ca, Pi and F than sound dentin."

CD007868,0,12218276,0,Remineralisation of enamel lesions with daily applications of a high-concentration fluoride gel and a fluoridated toothpaste: an in situ study.,"The inhibition of enamel demineralisation and the enhancement of remineralisation are positively but not linearly related to the concentration of fluoride, especially when high fluoride concentrations are used. The aim of this in situ experiment was to determine the maximum amount of enamel remineralisation that can be achieved with daily applications of very high concentrations of fluoride. For this purpose we compared the efficacy of a daily application of fluoridated topical gel (12500 ppm F, partly as NaF, Olafluor and Dectafluor, pH 4.5) in combination with a fluoridated toothpaste (1450 ppm F as NaF), with fluoridated toothpaste alone. Participants (n = 26, with partial dentures) were fitted with a demineralised enamel specimen (mean mineral loss of 1674 vol%.micro m) and were instructed to use one of the two fluoride treatments. After 4 weeks of treatment, the specimens were retrieved, a section was cut and analysed with microradiography. The remainder of each of the specimens was used for analysis of the 'loosely bound' and 'bound' fluoride. Fluoride was measured with gas-liquid chromatography. After 4 weeks in the mouth, the original lesion was reduced in size by 54% in the toothpaste + gel group (n = 14) and by 44% in the toothpaste-only group (n = 12), but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. The mineral content profiles showed remineralisation of the lesions throughout the depth of the lesion. The enhancement of remineralisation by the high amounts of fluoride was most pronounced in the surface layer. For both the 'loosely bound' and 'bound' fluoride, a statistically significant increase in fluoride concentration could be found in the toothpaste + gel group. In the 4-week in situ period the use of high amounts of fluoride resulted in a maximum remineralisation rate. This is illustrated by an increase in remineralisation and higher fluoride concentrations in the toothpaste + gel group compared to the toothpaste-only group."
CD007868,0,1468099,0,Secondary caries in situ around fluoride-releasing light-curing composites: a quantitative model investigation on four materials with a fluoride content between 0 and 26 vol%.,"In the literature, secondary caries around composite restorations is reported often. Fluoridated composites are therefore interesting materials because they might reduce or inhibit secondary caries. In this article an in situ model investigation is presented in which the effect of F-releasing composites on enamel demineralisation around an artificial gap of 200 microns width was quantified after 1 month. The fluoride content of the composites varied between 0 and 26 vol%. The beneficial effect of the fluoride released was larger in the gap than at the outer enamel surface. In the gap, all fluoridated composites reduced the enamel demineralisation statistically significantly with respect to the non-fluoridated control. Microradiography showed a reduction of lesion depth values of 27-45%, and a reduction of mineral loss values of 25-56%. At the outer enamel surface next to the artificial gap, a beneficial fluoridation effect was measurable only near the most fluoridated composite. The results indicate that fluoridated composites may play a role in the future prevention of secondary caries."

Three-year development of oral hygiene.,"The oral hygiene conditions were evaluated within a 3-year field study aimed at assessing the cariostatic value of partial substitution of sucrose by xylitol (X group) in comparison with systemic fluoride (F group) and restorative treatment only (C group). Parallel to caries and further associated studies the visible plaque index, based on the total number of permanent and deciduous teeth, was determined longitudinally at annual examinations in 688 institutionalized children, initially 6 to 11 years old. The observations were analyzed with regard to sex, age, experimental grouping, and total development. The oral hygiene conditions were generally poor. At the base-line examination only 26% of the children had acceptable oral hygiene; at the end this level was reached by 42%. A definite improvement was measured only in the X group, in which the final values differed significantly (p less than 0.001) from the base-line values and also from the end situation in the F and C groups. It is concluded that the development was influenced by several factors, such as different snacking habits and access to sweets, the study per se, and xylitol-induced effects."

The following items were studied: opinions of general and oral health, attitudes to and experiences of dental care, dental care habits, experiences of latest visit to a dentist, tobacco habits and use of various dental hygiene articles. A cross-sectional mail questionnaire was sent in 1992 to all 50-year-olds in two Swedish counties, Orebro and Ostergotland, totally 8888 persons; the response rate was 71%. Of the population 89%, indicated good health. Satisfaction with dental care was high, 94%. 26% stated attendance to a dentist twice or more per year, and 64% at least once a year. As to expenses, 78% paid less than 1000 SEK the last year. Concerning the latest visit, 38% reported painless treatment, 37% no inconvenience, and 55% good care. The duration of the latest visit included on an average 27 min in travel time, 7 min in waiting time and 27 min in treatment time. Information about oral hygiene was given to 29% and about cost for treatment to 47% of the interviewed. There were 28% daily smokers. Snuff was daily used by 10% of the males.

Criteria were those proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO, 1997), adapted by the School of Public Health, University of S o Paulo. The sample was selected at random, without replacement, and was calculated by age, accepting a design error of 2 and a sampling loss of 20% (n = 96 per age). There were six trained examiners, with accepted agreement percentage above 89% for all variables. In the Sorocaba region, the dmft index in 5 year-old children was 3.1, and 37.6% were caries-free (DMFT = 0). At age 12, 32.3% were caries-free (DMFT = 0), and the DMFT index in the region was 2.6, thus characterizing the area as having a low prevalence of caries. In areas with fluoridated water, the proportion of caries-free children at 12 years was higher than in those without fluoridated water (p = 0.019), and the DMFT was lower (p = 0.001).

CD007868,0,29352469,0,Amoxicillin-current use in swine medicine.,"Amoxicillin has become a major antimicrobial substance in pig medicine for the treatment and control of severe, systemic infections such as Streptococcus suis. The minimum inhibitory concentration 90% (MIC 90) is 0.06 μg amoxicillin/ml, and the proposed epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF) is 0.5 μg/ml, giving only 0.7% of isolates above the ECOFF or of reduced susceptibility. Clinical breakpoints have not been set for amoxicillin against porcine pathogens yet, hence the use of ECOFFs. It has also been successfully used for bacterial respiratory infections caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida. The ECOFF for amoxicillin against A. pleuropneumoniae is also 0.5 μg/ml demonstrating only a reduced susceptibility in 11.3% of isolates. Similarly, P. multocida had an ECOFF of 1.0 μg/ml and a reduced susceptibility in only 2.6% of isolates. This reduced susceptibility disappears when combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, demonstrating that it is primarily associated with beta-lactamase production. In contrast, amoxicillin is active against Escherichia coli and Salmonella species but using ECOFFs of 8.0 and 4.0 μg/ml, respectively, reduced susceptibility can be seen in 70.9% and 67.7% of isolates. These high levels of reduced susceptibility are primarily due to beta-lactamase production also, and most of this resistance can be overcome by the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. Currently, amoxicillin alone is considered an extremely valuable antimicrobial in both human and animal medicine and remains in the critically important category of antibiotics alongside the fluoroquinolones and macrolides by the World Health Organization as well as the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, but these cephalosporins show marked resistance to basic beta-lactamase production and are only destroyed by the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid are currently classed together in Category 2 in the European Union. By reviewing the pharmacodynamic data and comparing this with pharmacokinetic data from healthy and infected animals and clinical trial data, it can be seen that the product has a good efficacy against S. suis and A. pleuropneumoniae, in spite of usage over many years. However, it may be much less efficacious on its own against E. coli, due to reduced susceptibility and resistance associated with beta-lactamase production, which is largely overcome by the use of clavulanic acid. It is felt that this differentiation may be useful in future classification of amoxicillin alone, in comparison with its combined use with clavulanic acid and thereby preserve the use of the more critically important antibiotics in veterinary medicine and reducing the risk of their resistance being transmitted to human."

CD007868,0,25765050,0,Assessing risk factors for dental caries: a statistical modeling approach.,"The problem of identifying potential determinants and predictors of dental caries is of key importance in caries research and it has received considerable attention in the scientific literature. From the methodological side, a broad range of statistical models is currently available to analyze dental caries indices (DMFT, dmfs, etc.). These models have been applied in several studies to investigate the impact of different risk factors on the cumulative severity of dental caries experience. However, in most of the cases (i) these studies focus on a very specific subset of risk factors; and (ii) in the statistical modeling only few candidate models are considered and model selection is at best only marginally addressed. As a result, our understanding of the robustness of the statistical inferences with respect to the choice of the model is very limited; the richness of the set of statistical models available for analysis in only marginally exploited; and inferences could be biased due the omission of potentially important confounding variables in the model's specification. In this paper we argue that these limitations can be overcome considering a general class of candidate models and carefully exploring the model space using standard model selection criteria and measures of global fit and predictive performance of the candidate models. Strengths and limitations of the proposed approach are illustrated with a real data set. In our illustration the model space contains more than 2.6 million models, which require inferences to be adjusted for 'optimism'."

The purified extract is dried, reconstituted, and quantified by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Twenty laboratories from 13 European Union member states, Uruguay, Turkey, and the United States of America participated in this study. The study was evaluated according to internationally accepted guidelines. The method performance characteristics can be summarized as follows: over a working range of 7.7 to 141 microg/kg OTA, the mean recoveries were 87% for licorice root and 84-88% for licorice extracts; and the RSDs for reproducibility ranged from 10 to 17% and from 11 to 22% in licorice extracts and licorice root, respectively.

The photophysical and photochemical properties of octa (2a) and tetra (2b) derivatives were investigated in DMF and DMSO. The effect of octa or tetra substitution on fluorescence quantum yield, singlet oxygen generation and photodegradation were examined, and the differences were evaluated regarding their potential efficiency in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Their pH-responses were investigated to determine the influence of protonation of azomethine nitrogen atoms on singlet oxygen generation efficiencies. Dramatic optical changes were observed by protonation of azomethine bridges of 2a and 2b. They exhibited signal decrease from pH 4.0 to 1.0 for 2a (pKa = 2.6) and pH 3.0 to 1.0 for 2b (pKa = 1.8). Besides, the compounds exhibited no aggregation tendency, moderate fluorescence quantum yield, solubility in common organic solvents, high singlet oxygen quantum yield and high photostability in DMF and in DMSO, these favorable properties making them good candidates as photosensitizer for PDT."

Seventy-eight extracted human premolar teeth were used. Class II cavities were prepared on both approximal surfaces of each tooth in such a manner that the gingival wall was situated apical to the amelo-cemental junction. The enamel of the cavity walls was bevelled, etched and treated with the enamel bonding agent recommended by the manufacturer. The 3 brands of composite resin used were: Fulfil, Estilux Posterior and P 50. The teeth were divided at random into 3 groups of 26 premolars each. The mesial and distal cavities of each tooth in the group were filled with the same brand. The resin was inserted in two increments in both the mesial and distal cavities and polymerised. The margins of one restoration in each tooth was coated with fluorescent adhesive and cured. All the restored teeth were embedded in clear epoxy resin and then sectioned. The mounted sections were examined at 100X magnification with fluorescent light.

CD007868,0,23041912,0,Changes in dental caries and oral hygiene among 7-8 year-old schoolchildren in different regions of Lithuania 1983-2009.,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the changes of the dental caries prevalence and severity of 7 to 8 year old schoolchildren in six Lithuanian regions over the past 26 years (1983-2009) and to propose recommendations based on the results of the study. The study is based on the analysis of data, containing 576 cases of children examined in 1983 and comparison with data containing 531 cases added in 2009. The studies were conducted in the same six regions of Lithuania among the children from 7 to 8 years of age. For the study of children the WHO oral assessment methodology was used (WHO Basic methods 1997). Severity of dental caries was described by df-t and DMF-T index. The average of individual df-t and DMF-T indices was calculated for all subjects and sorted by gender. Oral hygiene status was evaluated by applying the simplified Green-Vermilion index-OHI-S (1964) The prevalence of primary dental caries among the children 7 to 8 years of age was 92.4% in 1983 and 88.7% (p=0.43) in 2009. The prevalence of permanent dental caries decreased from 49.6% in 1983 to 29.7% (p<0.001) in 2009. Mean df-t score decreased from 4.9±3.4 in 1983 to 4.1±2.7 in 2009 and DMF-T index decreased from 1.1±1.7 in 1983 to 0.5±1.0 in 2009 (p<0.001). The OHI-S index was not significantly different during 1983-2009. In the period of last 26 years a tendency towards the decrease in the prevalence and severity of dental caries was observed. That could be related to the frequent using of the toothpastes with fluoride, as well as implementation of the caries prevention program with sealants among the children of that age. The poor oral hygiene and comparatively high caries prevalence in schoolchildren show that it is still necessary to improve preventive measures in Lithuania."

A control group (n = 70) rinsed in a similar mode using fluoride-free tap water. The two groups received the same basic prophylactic program during the trial. Detection of approximal caries lesions and fillings was based on bitewing radiographs at baseline and after 3 yr. The test group developed an average of 2.75 + 4.76 (mean +/- SD) approximal DFS compared with 3.21 + 4.74 DFS in the control group (n.s.).

This study identifies benzylic bromination of phenyl all-cis-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorocyclohexane 2 as a key reaction for accessing building blocks containing the all-cis-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorocyclohexane ring system. These cyclohexanes are of interest as the fluorines are only on one face of the cyclohexane, and this imparts an unusual polar aspect, very different to an otherwise hydrophobic cyclohexane. Ritter type reactions of benzyl bromide 4 with DMF and acetonitrile generated the corresponding benzyl alcohol 6 and benzylacetamide 7 respectively. Benzylacetamide 7 was hydrolysed to benzyl amine 8 and syn-amino-alcohol 9, and separately the phenyl ring was oxidatively cleaved to furnish carboxylic acid acetamide 10, which after hydrolysis gave the tetrafluorocyclohexyl amino acid 11.

This study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy (minor/major failures) and survival rates (successful cases without any failures) of 3 carious lesion treatment approaches, the Hall Technique (HT), non-restorative caries treatment (NRCT), and conventional restorations (CR), for the management of occlusoproximal caries lesions (ICDAS 3-5) in primary molars. Results at 2.5 years are presented. A total of 169 children (3- to 8-year-olds) were enrolled in this secondary care-based, 3-arm parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Participants were allocated to: HT (n = 52; sealing caries with stainless-steel crowns without caries removal), NRCT (n = 52; opening up the cavity and applying fluoride varnish), CR (n = 65; control arm, complete caries removal and compomer restoration). Statistical analyses were: non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U test and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. One hundred and forty-two participants (84%; HT = 40/52; NRCT = 44/52; CR = 58/65) had follow-up data of 1-33 months (mean = 26). Overall, 25 (HT = 2, NRCT = 9, CR = 14) of 142 participants (17.6%) presented with at least 1 minor failure (reversible pulpitis, caries progression, or secondary caries; p = 0.013, CI = 0.012-0.018; Mann-Whitney U test). Ten (HT = 1, NRCT = 4, CR = 5) of 142 participants (7.04%) experienced at least 1 major failure (irreversible pulpitis, abscess, unrestorable tooth; p = 0.043, CI = 0.034-0.045). Independent comparisons between 2 samples found that NRCT-CR had no statistically significant difference in failures (p > 0.05), but for CR-HT (p = 0.037, CI = 0.030-0.040) and for NRCT-HT (p = 0.011, CI = 0.010-0.016; Kruskal-Wallis test) significant differences were observed. Cumulative survival rates were HT = 92.5%, NRCT = 70.5%, and CR = 67.2% (p = 0.012). NRCT and CR outcomes were comparable. HT performed better than NRCT and CR for all outcomes.

CD007868,0,26748556,0,Detecting outlying studies in meta-regression models using a forward search algorithm.,"When considering data from many trials, it is likely that some of them present a markedly different intervention effect or exert an undue influence on the summary results. We develop a forward search algorithm for identifying outlying and influential studies in meta-analysis models. The forward search algorithm starts by fitting the hypothesized model to a small subset of likely outlier-free studies and proceeds by adding studies into the set one-by-one that are determined to be closest to the fitted model of the existing set. As each study is added to the set, plots of estimated parameters and measures of fit are monitored to identify outliers by sharp changes in the forward plots. We apply the proposed outlier detection method to two real data sets; a meta-analysis of 26 studies that examines the effect of writing-to-learn interventions on academic achievement adjusting for three possible effect modifiers, and a meta-analysis of 70 studies that compares a fluoride toothpaste treatment to placebo for preventing dental caries in children. A simple simulated example is used to illustrate the steps of the proposed methodology, and a small-scale simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

CD007868,0,8781145,0,Detection of anaerobic odontogenic infections by fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole.,"Odontogenic infections are a potential risk for patients who receive cervicofacial radiotherapy and should be treated before irradiation. Anaerobic microbial infections are the most common causes. This study assessed the value of the hypoxic imaging agent fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) in detecting anaerobic odontogenic infections. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed at 2 h after injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of FMISO in 26 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and six controls with healthy teeth. Tomograms were interpreted visually to identify hypoxic foci in the jaw. All patients received thorough dental examinations as a pre-radiotherapy work-up. Fifty-one sites of periodontitis, 15 periodontal abscesses, 14 sites of dental caries with root canal infection, 23 sites of dental caries without root canal infection, and seven necrotic pulps were found by dental examination. Anaerobic pathogens were isolated from 12 patients. Increased uptake of FMISO was found at 45 out of 51 sites of periodontitis, all 15 sites of periodontal abscess, all 14 sites of dental caries with root canal infection, all seven sites of necrotic pulp and 15 sites of dental caries without obvious evidence of active root canal infection. No abnormal uptake was seen in the healthy teeth of patients or in the six controls. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of FMISO PET scan in detecting odontogenic infections were 93%, 97%, 84%, 99% and 96%, respectively. 18F-fluoride ion bone scan done in three patients showed that 18F-fluoride ion plays no role in the demonstration of anaerobic odontogenic infection. FMISO PET scan is a sensitive method for the detection of anaerobic odontogenic infections, and may play a complementary role in the evaluation of the dental condition of patients with head and neck tumours prior to radiation therapy."

Several methods have been advocated to prevent their development, such as fluoride rinses or varnishes. In this randomized clinical trial, a fluoride rinse (a combination of sodium fluoride and amine fluoride) was compared with a placebo rinse, to be used every evening after toothbrushing. A total of 81 participants (mean age: 13.3 yr) completed the study (mean treatment period: 24.5 months). Demineralizations, measured using quantitative light-induced fluorescence and the decayed, missing, and filled surfaces (DMFS) index, were assessed before treatment (baseline) and around 6 wk after debonding (post treatment). Bleeding scores were measured at baseline, and during and post treatment. The incidence rate ratio for demineralizations was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.1-6.3) in the placebo group vs. the fluoride group. In the fluoride group, 31% of participants developed at least one demineralization, compared with 47% in the placebo group. Relative to baseline, gingival bleeding increased significantly in the placebo group 1 yr after the start of treatment and onwards. For the fluoride group, bleeding scores during treatment were not different from those at baseline. In conclusion, using a fluoride rinse helps to maintain better oral health during fixed appliance treatment, resulting in fewer demineralizations."

Forty-six orthodontic patients participated in this prospective clinical trial. A cross-mouth method was used in each patient, in which two diagonal quadrants (i.e. upper right and lower left or vice versa) were randomly assigned to the pumice group and the contralateral diagonal quadrants to the Prophy Paste group. A total of 836 teeth were bonded using Transbond XT (3M Unitek) and monitored for an average of 23 months for bond failure. Chi-square analysis was used to compare the number of bracket failures between the groups. Overall, 26 bond failures occurred by the end of the trial. Fifteen bracket failures were observed in the Prophy Paste group (3.6%) and 11 in the pumice group (2.6%). The failure rates were fairly evenly distributed between the upper and lower jaws. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups (P = 0.43).

Results from a questionnaire.,"The aim of the present investigation was to map the presence of prophylactic measures in organized Swedish dental health care systems, focusing on personnel working with children and adolescents. The study was conducted by sending a questionnaire to all public dental clinics in Sweden (830 clinics in all). The results showed that collectively-performed prophylactic measures were given at 66% of the child health centers/ child day care centers and at 63% of the pre-schools. 57% of all clinics replied that they performed some kind of fluoride administration collectively (mainly fluoride varnish application or fluoride mouthrinses). 34% of all clinics used fluoride varnishes at the ages from 6 to 12 years, and collectively-performed fluoride mouthrinsing in schools at these ages was carried out by 16% of the clinics. 26% of all the clinics answered that they aimed at increasing the time spent on prophylactic measures compared to only 2% that were planning to decrease this time. The remaining 72% aimed at maintaining the time spent at the present. Prophylactic measures were performed individually by 49% of the clinics, whereas 50% of the clinics preferred a combination of individually and collectively performed measures. It can be concluded that the preventive measures against dental caries in Swedish public dental care is mainly focused on individually performed prophylaxis."
CD007868,0,24425440,0,Bicarbonate effect on electron flow in a cyanobacteriumSynechocystis PCC 6803.,"In this communication, evidence is presented from the kinetics of QA (-) decay (where QA is the first plastoquinone electron acceptor of photosystem II) and oxygen evolution for the requirement of bicarbonate in the electron transport in a cyanobacteriumSynechocystis (Pasteur Culture Collection 6803). A large slowing down of QA (-) oxidation, measured from the variable chlorophylla fluorescence after saturating actinic flashes, was observed in the thylakoids ofSynechocystis 6803 depleted of bicarbonate in the presence of 25 mM formate. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with DCMU-treated thylakoids. This shows that bicarbonate depletion inhibits electron transport on the acceptor side of photosystem II between QA and the plastoquinone (PQ) pool in cyanobacteria. Addition of 2.5 mM HCO3 (-) fully reversed the inhibition of electron flow caused by bicarbonate depletion. Two exponential phases of QA (-) decay, a fast one and a slow one, were observed with halftimes of approx. 400 μs (fast) and 26 ms (slow) at pH 6.5. At pH 7.5, these phases were approx. 330 μs (fast) and 21 ms (slow), respectively. The amplitude, but not the halftime, of the fast component decreased by about 70% (pH 6.5) or 50% (pH 7.5); this was accompanied by a concomittant increase in the slow phase. Twenty mM bicarbonate stimulated, by a factor of 4, the Hill reaction in bicarbonate-depletedSynechocystis cells. This effect is independent of CO2 fixation as it was observed even in the presence of an inhibitor DBMIB."

Enzyme activity was abundant, particularly in the epidermis and mucous membrane (4.2 to 11.3 moles/hr/kg dry wt.). The keratin layer of sole epidermis also contained a considerable amount of enzyme activity (2.6 moles/hr/kg dry wt.). A relatively low activity was found in the apocrine and sebaceous glands (1.8 to 3.6 moles/hr/kg dry wt.). The enzyme was influenced by various activators and inhibitors. The activators were 1-cysteine (200% increase), mercaptoethanol (+300%), EDTA (+300%), and the inhibitors, pCMB, Cu++ and Co++ (nearly 100% inhibition). Either arsenate or orthophosphate was an absolute requirement for the enzyme reaction.

SDC patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2014 were identified by the Nationwide Network and Registry of Histo- and Cytopathology in the Netherlands (PALGA). Subsequently, medical records were evaluated and pathological diagnoses reviewed. Data were analyzed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and prognostic factors. AR was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), HER2 by IHC and fluorescent in-situ hybridization. A total of 177 patients were included. The median age was 65 years, 75% were male. At diagnosis, 68% presented with lymph node metastases and 6% with distant metastases. Median OS, DFS and DMFS were 51, 23 and 26 months, respectively. In patients presenting without distant metastases, the absolute number of positive lymph nodes was associated with poor OS and DMFS in a multivariable analysis. AR and HER2 were positive in 161/168 (96%) and 44/153 (29%) tumors, respectively, and were not prognostic factors. SDC has a dismal prognosis with primary lymph node involvement in the majority of patients. The absolute number of lymph node metastases was found to be the only prognostic factor for DMFS and OS. AR expression and-to a lesser extent-HER2 expression hold promise for systemic treatment in the metastatic and eventually adjuvant setting."

Children from two communities were surveyed using a modified Decayed, Missing and Filled Tooth Surface Index (D1D2MFS). Questionnaires on the use of various fluoride preventive practices and residence histories during childhood were collected. Completed questionnaires were returned and exams were performed on 1131 children. Crude caries prevalence scores for the different fluoride exposure groups were tested for differences in dental age and the level of educational attainment of parents and/or guardians. No significant group differences were found. The 110 children with lifelong exposure only to fluoridated water had 35%, or 0.88 (S.D. = 2.91), fewer decayed or filled tooth surfaces per child (P < 0.07) than children with no reported exposure to systemic fluorides. For the 122 children who had taken fluoride supplements for 4 yr or more, 0.67 fewer decayed and filled tooth surfaces (26% reduction) were observed per child when compared to children with no exposure to fluoridated water or supplements. For children who used fluoride supplements for less than 4 yr, no significant benefits were observed. Approximately 75% of the caries prevalence for control and fluoride-exposed groups was on pit and fissured surfaces.

By the fourth examination, 400 (17.3%) children had 2209 surfaces sealed. After one year, 14%, and at 3 years, 26% of baseline sealants were missing. Overall, at the last examination, 25% of baseline unsealed surfaces were carious compared to 15% of those originally sealed (P less than 0.001), although for molars, the equivalent figures were 49% and 24% (P less than 0.001). Finally, analysis showed that at baseline, as few as 15% of sealants had been placed by general dental practitioners, and this low proportion was maintained throughout the study period.

Complex 2 is a solvated form of the known and structurally characterized [Pt(tpy)(CCPh)]PF(6) species. All compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analyses, and solution electronic spectra. Structural characterization shows that compounds 3 and 4 are similar in the solid state and form cation-anion stacking patterns while compounds 5 and 6 form chains of cations supported by metallophilic interactions with anion partners on either side of the chains. Solution studies (UV-vis and fluorescence) strongly suggest that there are no Pt···Au interactions in solution state.

Subjects (N = 30) in this randomized, three-phase, 28-day, crossover study served as their own control. Each participant wore a customized orthodontic appliance attached to a mandibular molar and contained one tooth block with caries-like lesion. For each phase, participants engaged in twice-daily brushing for 2 min with one of the following dentifrices: 500 ppm F, 500 ppm F plus functionalized β-tricalcium phosphate (fTCP), and a clinically proven 1,100 ppm F. After each phase, appliances were removed, and specimens were analyzed using surface microhardness (SMH), transverse microradiography (TMR), and cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH). Statistically significant (p < 0.05) remineralization of white-spot lesions relative to baseline occurred for each dentifrice as determined with SMH and TMR. No significant differences (p > 0.05) in SMH were found among the three groups, but trending revealed the 500 ppm F plus fTCP produced 26% and 27% greater SMH recovery relative to 500 and 1,100 ppm F, respectively. Similarly, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in TMR were found among the groups. However, the 500 ppm F plus fTCP dentifrice produced 10% and 38% greater mineral recovery relative to 500 and 1,100 ppm F, respectively, while reducing the lesion depth 30% and 52%, respectively. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in CSMH existed among the three dentifice groups at different enamel depths, but statistical differences (p < 0.05) in relative lesion size were only found between 500 ppm F plus fTCP and 500 ppm F. The combination of fTCP and fluoride in a single-compartment, water-based dentifrice can cooperate with fluoride to produce significant remineralization. These results suggest that the combination of 500 ppm F with fTCP may provide comparable anticaries benefits relative to a 1,100 ppm F dentifrice."
CD007868,0,29380407,0,WHO Global Consultation on Public Health Intervention against Early Childhood Caries.,"Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is prevalent around the world, but in particular the disease is growing rapidly in low- and middle-income countries in parallel with changing diet and lifestyles. In many countries, ECC is often left untreated, a condition which leads to pain and adversely affects general health, growth and development, and quality of life of children, their families and their communities. Importantly, ECC is also a global public health burden, medically, socially and economically. In many countries, a substantial number of children require general anaesthesia for the treatment of caries in their primary teeth (usually extractions), and this has considerable cost and social implications. A WHO Global Consultation with oral health experts on ""Public Health Intervention against Early Childhood Caries"" was held on 26-28 January 2016 in Bangkok (Thailand) to identify public health solutions and to highlight their applicability to low- and middle-income countries. After a 3-day consultation, participants agreed on specific recommendations for further action. National health authorities should develop strategies and implement interventions aimed at preventing and controlling ECC. These should align with existing international initiatives such as the Sixtieth World Health Assembly Resolution WHA 60.17 Oral health: action plan for promotion and integrated disease prevention, WHO Guideline on Sugars and WHO breastfeeding recommendation. ECC prevention and control interventions should be integrated into existing primary healthcare systems. WHO public health principles must be considered when tackling the effect of social determinants in ECC. Initiatives aimed at modifying behaviour should focus on families and communities. The involvement of communities in health promotion, and population-directed and individual fluoride administration for the prevention and control of ECC is essential. Surveillance and research, including cost-effectiveness studies, should be conducted to evaluate interventions aimed at preventing ECC in different population groups."

In the present study, in an aim to further examine the disruption of GnRH neurones by foetal vinclozolin exposure, pregnant rabbits were dosed orally with vinclozolin, flutamide or carrot paste vehicle for the last 2 weeks of gestation. Offspring were euthanised at birth (males and females), PNW 6 (females), PNW 26 (adult males) or PNW 30 (adult females) of age. At birth and in adults, brains were sectioned and processed for immunoreactive GnRH. The numbers of immunoreactive GnRH neuronal perikarya were significantly decreased in vinclozolin-treated rabbits at birth and in adult littermates. By contrast, there was an increase in GnRH immunoreactivity in the terminals in the region of the median eminence. Analysis of PNW 6 female brains by radioimmunoassay revealed a two-fold increase in GnRH peptide content in the mediobasal hypothalamus in vinclozolin-treated rabbits. This finding was complemented by immunofluorescence analyses, which revealed a 2.8-fold increase in GnRH immunoreactivity in the median eminence of vinclozolin compared to vehicle-treated females at PNW 30. However, there was no difference between treatment groups in the measures of reproduction that were evaluated: ejaculation latency, conception rates or litter size. These results indicate that sub-acute, prenatal vinclozolin treatment is sufficient to create perdurable alterations in the GnRH neuronal network that forms an important input into the reproductive axis. Finally, the effect of vinclozolin on the GnRH neuronal network was not comparable to that of flutamide, suggesting that vinclozolin was not acting through anti-androgenic mechanisms."

A cross-sectional survey of 2662 adolescents was conducted in eight capital cities in China; the response rate was 92%. The study population was chosen by multistage cluster sampling and covered three age groups: 11, 13, and 15 years. Data on dental and general health were collected by self-administered questionnaires. Self-assessment of dental health of Chinese adolescents was generally good, only 12% of the students answered that their teeth were ""poor"" or ""very poor"", and 9% claimed having ""poor"" or ""very poor"" gums. Eleven percent of participants said that other students made fun of their teeth; 24% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the appearance of their teeth, and 41% claimed that they had experienced toothache or symptoms during the previous 12 months. Positive attitudes towards dental care were found in all age groups; 67% of adolescents brushed their teeth at least twice a day and 48% of the students used fluoridated toothpaste. Only 26% of the students visited a dentist during the previous 12 months. In all, 6% of the adolescents had tried cigarette smoking at least once, while 41% reported having tasted alcohol drinks. Multivariate regression analyses showed that perceived dental health status and needs were associated with gender, age, unhealthy lifestyles, poor school performance, and socio-economic status. The establishment of school-based health promotion programs in China is urgently needed, and promotion of oral health lifestyles should be integrated with other general health actions."
CD007868,0,3232107,0,Dental health and dental health behaviour in 8-year-old Finnish immigrant children in the north of Sweden.,"The aim was to investigate whether the observed difference in dental health between Finnish immigrant children and Swedish children at ages 4-6 persisted at the age of eight. The study also included knowledge of dental health and dental health behaviour. Dmft, dmfs, DMFT, DMFS and GBI were recorded in 70 Finnish and 97 Swedish children included in an earlier study. The children were interviewed about toothbrushing frequency, use of fluoride and dietary habits. Questions about knowledge of dental health were included. Dmfs and DFS averaged 13.1 and 3.8 for the Finnish children and 8.9 and 2.6 for the Swedish. Only 19% of the Finnish and 28% of the Swedish children had cariesfree permanent teeth. The mean GBI was 7.9% in the Finnish and 5.9% in the Swedish group. More Finnish children had bad or poor dietary habits, with more frequent between-meal eating of sucrose containing products than the Swedish children. There were no statistically significant differences in the use of fluorides or in individual prophylaxis within the last 36 months."
CD007868,0,6950639,0,Caries prevalence and therapy in the deciduous dentition from 3 to 8 years. A longitudinal study.,"The onset and prevalence of caries in primary teeth and the rate of failure in conservative caries therapy were followed up for six years in a group of children who were three years old at the start of the study in 1974. All children were offered a basic preventive program which included counselling their parents on dietary habits, oral hygiene and the use of fluoride tablets. During the annual clinical examinations bite-wing radiographs were taken in cases with established molar contacts. Operative care was delivered when necessary, combined with topical fluoride applications. At the age of three years the onset of caries was registered in 26 percent of the children. The corresponding percentages at the ages of 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 years were 26, 18, 3 and 2, respectively. Consequently, 17 percent were still caries-free at the end of the six-year period. Proximal caries was most often observed on the distal surfaces of the first primary molars, followed by the mesial surfaces of the second primary molars. The overall frequency of class II amalgam restorations requiring replacement was 16 per cent. The highest percentage of failures was noted in lower first primary molars."

CD007868,0,11071939,0,Cloning of a human homolog of the yeast nucleotide excision repair gene MMS19 and interaction with transcription repair factor TFIIH via the XPB and XPD helicases.,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes UV-induced photoproducts and numerous other DNA lesions in a highly conserved 'cut-and-paste' reaction that involves approximately 25 core components. In addition, several other proteins have been identified which are dispensable for NER in vitro but have an undefined role in vivo and may act at the interface of NER and other cellular processes. An intriguing example is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mms19 protein that has an unknown dual function in NER and RNA polymerase II transcription. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a human homolog, designated hMMS19, that encodes a 1030 amino acid protein with 26% identity and 51% similarity to S.cerevisiae Mms19p and with a strikingly similar size. The expression profile and nuclear location are consistent with a repair function. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that hMMS19 directly interacts with the XPB and XPD subunits of NER-transcription factor TFIIH. These findings extend the conservation of the NER apparatus and the link between NER and basal transcription and suggest that hMMS19 exerts its function in repair and transcription by interacting with the XPB and XPD helicases."

In 95 children aged 7-8 years, having all four first permanent molars fully erupted and caries free, a chemically initiated tinted fissure sealant was placed with the following 4 different methods in every child. 1) Tooth 16: Cotton rolls isolation and cleaning of occlusal surface using a bristle brush and non-fluoridated paste. 2) Tooth 26: Rubber dam isolation and mechanical preparation of pits and fissures using a round bur No. 0 in a slow hand-piece. 3) Tooth 36: Rubber dam isolation and cleaning of occlusal surface using a bristle brush and non-fluoridated paste. 4) Tooth 46: Isolation with cotton rolls and mechanical preparation of pits and fissures using a round bur No. 0 in a slow hand-piece. Eighty children were available for re-examination 4 years later (320 teeth). The 4 methods of application showed the following success rates of full retention: 1) 81% 2) 88% 3) 91% 4) 93%. Although statistical analysis of the results revealed only marginal statistically significant difference among the four different methods of application (p = 0.091), there was statistical significant difference (p = 0.031) between methods 1 and 4. No differences were detected among the remaining methods. The present trial revealed best sealant retention using a combination of cotton rolls isolation and mechanical preparation of the occlusal surface.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007868,0,2129916,0,Fluoride in dental plaque after a single toothbrushing with monofluorophosphate dentifrice.,"Many studies have shown that topical fluoride applications can produce a fluoride reservoir in dental plaque. Since the most common topical fluoride application is via toothbrushing with fluoridated dentifrices, the aim of this study was to measure fluoride uptake by dental plaque after a single toothbrushing with monofluorophosphate (MFP) toothpaste and to follow the plaque until its fluoride concentration returned to the prebrushing levels. In a fluoridated area, plaque samples were collected from 26 children who brushed with MFP toothpaste, 22 children who brushed with a fluoride-free control toothpaste, before brushing and at intervals of 10 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours after brushing. A combination fluoride electrode was used to determine the fluoride content of the samples. In conclusion, our study has shown that brushing with fluoridated water has a positive effect on the fluoride level of the plaque and the addition of MFP did not make a significant change, although it had a short term effect. A negative correlation was established between plaque wet weight and its fluoride content whenever the plaque equilibrated."
CD007868,0,1468100,0,Noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.,"Erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by Aureobasidium sp. from glucose. It is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. The aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. Erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. It was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans PS-14 (c) and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). Finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- SEM) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). Also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with S. mutans PS-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). The main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view."

CD007868,0,15384727,0,"Fluorides in groundwater, soil and infused black tea and the occurrence of dental fluorosis among school children of the Gaza strip.","The purpose of this study was to determine the fluoride levels in water, soil and tea, and to identify the major fluoride minerals in soil that supply water with fluoride ions. Another aim was to study the prevalence of dental fluorosis in permanent dentition of the school children of the Gaza Strip. Monitoring of fluoride levels in 73 groundwater wells and 20 topsoil samples for the last three years revealed a general trend of increasing from north to south of the Gaza Strip. A linear regression analysis found a correlation coefficient of r=0.93 between the fluoride concentrations in groundwater and soil for the same geographic areas. However, the X-ray diffraction technique (XRD) results showed that none of the four major fluoride minerals were detected in the tested soil samples; the PHREEQC model showed that fluorite (CaF2) was the main donating mineral of fluoride ions to groundwater. A high positive correlation was found between fluoride concentrations in groundwater and occurrence of dental fluorosis. Among 353 school children of the five geographic areas of the Gaza Strip the prevalence of dental fluorosis was 60%, and 40% had no signs of fluorosis in their permanent dentitions. The highest occurrence, 94%, was in Khan Yunis, followed by 82% in Rafah, 68% in the middle area, 29% in Gaza and the lowest occurrence of 9% was in the northern area. These percentages were directly proportional to the average content of fluoride in groundwater of each area: 2.6, 0.9, 1.7, 1.2, and 0.7 ppm, respectively. The exception was Rafah where people drank from new groundwater wells that have been dug in the last 10 years. The occurrence of the disease was due to intake of high amounts of fluorides in drinking water, tea and fish. Communication with population indicated a heavy intake of tea starting from a very young age; not uncommonly tea is put in nursing bottles. No significant correlation was found between prevalence figures and gender or age groups. This high prevalence indicates a need to examine other sources of F including diet."
CD007868,0,7960166,1,Results from a three-year caries clinical trial comparing NaF and SMFP fluoride formulations.,"A three-year, double blind, randomised clinical trial was conducted in Polk County, Florida from 1983-1987. The objective was to compare the effect of four dose levels of sodium monofluorophosphate (SMFP) and a single dose level of sodium fluoride (NaF) on DMFS, DMFT, and DFS Interproximal indices. A total of 8,027 children were examined clinically and radiographically at baseline, and 5,474 children completed the three-year study, which included daily supervised brushing at school. No differences existed at baseline between the five study cells on age or gender distribution, or on any of the dental indices. Results indicated that the 2000 ppm F NaF group had significantly smaller DMFS increment than the 2000 ppm F SMFP group p < 0.005. The 2000 ppm F NaF group demonstrated an 18 per cent (26 per cent for children > 10 years at baseline) reduction in DMFS over the 1500 ppm F SMFP group, the 2500 ppm F group a 15 per cent (19 per cent) reduction, and the 2000 ppm F SMFP a 5 per cent (9 per cent) reduction. Results are strongest in children at greatest risk--older children with previous caries. This study concludes that the anticaries efficacy of SMFP dentifrices rises with increasing fluoride, and that the anticaries efficacy of a 2000 ppm NaF dentifrice is superior to that of a 2000 ppm F SMFP dentifrice, p < 0.005)."
CD007868,0,10601780,0,"Caries prevalence after cessation of water fluoridation in La Salud, Cuba.","In the past, caries has usually increased after cessation of water fluoridation. More recently an opposite trend could be observed: DMFT remaining stable or even decreasing further. The aim of the present study conducted in La Salud (Province of Habana) in March 1997 was to analyse the current caries trend under the special climatic and nutritional conditions of the subtropical sugar island Cuba, following the cessation, in 1990, of water fluoridation (0.8 ppm F). Diagnostic evaluations were carried out using the same methods as in 1973 and 1982. Boys and girls aged 6-13 years (N = 414), lifelong residents in La Salud, were examined. Between 1973 and 1982 the mean DMFT had decreased by 71.4%, the mean DMFS by 73. 3% and the percentage of caries-free children had increased from 26. 3 to 61.6%. In 1997, following the cessation of drinking water fluoridation, in contrast to an expected rise in caries prevalence, DMFT and DMFS values remained at a low level for the 6- to 9-year-olds and appeared to decrease for the 10/11-year-olds (from 1. 1 to 0.8) and DMFS (from 1.5 to 1.2). In the 12/13-year-olds, there was a significant decrease (DMFT from 2.1 to 1.1; DMFS from 3.1 to 1. 5), while the percentage of caries-free children of this age group had increased from 4.8 (1973) and 33.3 (1982) up to 55.2%. A possible explanation for this unexpected finding and for the good oral health status of the children in La Salud is the effect of the school mouthrinsing programme, which has involved fortnightly mouthrinses with 0.2% NaF solutions (i.e. 15 times/year) since 1990."
CD007868,0,7669208,0,Fluoride and sugar intake among adults and youth in Mauritius: preliminary results.,"The potential use of different vehicles for delivering fluoride to prevent dental caries has been discussed recently in Mauritius. Water fluoridation was found not to be feasible, and extending the fluoride tablet program would not be easy. Thus, sugar fluoridation as one possibility was considered. For these purposes, the average fluoride and sugar intake was estimated in Mauritius. The results are based on two studies--a Survey on Diet, Health and Lifestyle of Youth in Mauritius (1990) and the Mauritius Diet and Health Survey. Information was collected by trained interviewers using food-frequency and 24-hour-recall questionnaires. The daily total sugar intake, manufactured and natural, was found to be 62 g per day in young people and 50 g per day in adults. In the younger groups, daily frequencies of raw sugar, sweets, and biscuit (cookie) consumption were 1.5, 0.2, and 0.2 times a day, respectively. For adults, the mean daily frequency of consuming sugar-containing foods was 2.6 (SD = 1.3). The daily sucrose intake was rather high, representing about 10% of the daily energy intake. The fluoride levels of foods were calculated by use of Finnish and other available fluoride tables. The mean fluoride intakes per day were 0.64, 0.72, and 0.62 mg per day for 8-17-year-, 18-24-year-, and 30-64-year-old groups, respectively. The median fluoride intake for the oldest group was 0.62 mg/day. The estimated fluoride intake from food did not correspond with the proposed level for the prevention of caries (Murray, 1986) except for the 18-24-year-olds, where it might have been just above the lower recommended limit. However, further data based on analysis of the fluoride contents of Mauritian food samples, especially of whole daily diet, are needed."
CD007868,0,2111576,0,Prevention of enamel demineralization adjacent to glass ionomer filling materials.,"In order to study the release of fluoride and prevention of enamel demineralization by different filling materials, standardized cavities were prepared in 80 extracted human molars. The cavities were filled as follows: 1. Fuji II F; 2. Ketac-Fil; 3. Ketac-Silver; 4. Silar. Twenty molars were used as controls (no filling). Enamel slabs with the fillings were subjected to 9 days of demineralization (30 min daily) and remineralization (artificial saliva, replaced daily). Fluoride release in the saliva was determined on days 1, 3, 5, and 9. Enamel fluoride content adjacent to the cavities was determined initially and after the de-remineralization using the acid etch technique. On day 1, the largest amount of fluoride in the saliva was released by Fuji, but on day 9 the largest amount was released by Ketac-Fil. Ketac-Silver released significantly less fluoride than Fuji and Ketac-Fil. The average initial fluoride content of enamel was 2200 ppm. After the test period, fluoride contents adjusted for biopsy depth were 1822, 1690, 1693, 1337, and 888 ppm in groups 1-5, respectively. The amounts of phosphorus dissolved by the second acid etch were 28.9 (SE 2.6), 30.2 (2.0), 34.4 (2.8), 44.1 (2.7), and 42.2 (2.4) micrograms, respectively. Softening of surface enamel during the test period was clearly reduced in teeth filled with Fuji and Ketac-Fil. The results show that glass ionomer materials release considerable amounts of fluoride and prevent demineralization of the adjacent enamel in vitro. Fuji and Ketac-Fil seem to be more effective than Ketac-Silver."

The F uptakes in ppm (mean +/- SEM) for the control prophy pastes (C), Zircate treatment paste (Z), an APF paste (Nuppro,A), and a new experimental paste (N) were 1145 +/- 65,1245 +/- 72,1857 +/- 296, and 1841 +/- 321, respectively. The enamel biopsy depths in micrometers (mean +/- S.D.) for the control, Zircate APF pastes, and Newpaste were 6.64 +/- 1.75, 7.4 +/- 2.32, 6.55 +/- 2.23 and 7.69 +/- 1.80.

A small change in the colinker leads to significant differences in the overall structure of the MOFs. Topological analysis reveals that the framework 1 exhibits 6,4-connected forbidden sub-configuration (FSC) topology, while the framework 2 exhibits twofold interpenetrated and (3,4,4)-connected new network topology with Schläfli point symbol {4.6(2)}{4.6(4).8}{4(2).6(2).8(2)}. The crystallographic investigation reveals the framework 2 having single helix structure, which is further coiled through noncovalent interaction, afforded a double-helix structure similar to DNA. These double helices are further connected through the colinker L2 to form an overall 3D structure. Besides framework 2 exhibits remarkable fluorescence intensity compared to 1. Framework 2 displayed a strong emission at 457 nm when a sample of 2 was dispersed in ethanol and excited at 334 nm. This emission is selectively and completely quenched in the presence of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) allowing its detection in the presence of other nitroaromatic compounds. The quenching constant for TNP was found to be 3.89 × 10(4) M(-1), which is 26 times higher than that of TNT demonstrating greater and selective quenching ability. The emission is restored to its original value when the sample after collected by filtration is dispersed in fresh ethanol for 1 d. Interestingly, when solid 2 is exposed to different nitroaromatic compounds, its emission is quenched selectively in the presence of nitrobenzene. In this case, the emission is restored upon heating the sample to 150 °C for 2 h."

Consequently, these products should have a relatively neutral pH to minimize potential damage. This study measured the pH of 26 commercially available tooth-whitening products. The pH of the different whitening products ranged from 3.67 (highly acidic) to 11.13 (highly basic). The dentist-supervised home-bleaching products had a mean pH of 6.48 (range 5.66 to 7.35). The over-the-counter whitening products had a mean pH of 8.22 (range 5.09 to 11.13), and the whitening toothpastes had a mean pH of 6.83 (range 4.22 to 8.35). The 3 in-office bleaching products had a pH between 3.67 and 6.53. One-way ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between the 4 product categories. The most basic pH of all the products tested was 11.13 for the whitening gel of Natural White-Rapid White. The most acidic pH of all products tested was 3.67 for Opalescence Xtra 35% hydrogen peroxide in-office bleach. The Least-Squares-Means test showed that the over-the-counter category had a pH significantly different from the other categories (p < 0.05)."

Ninety-six Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 and desalivated when aged 26 days. Eight groups were placed in a König-Höfer programmed feeder and received 17 meals daily at hourly intervals, and essential nutrition (NCP No. 2) by gavage twice daily for 21 days. The groups received (1) plain sucrose, (2) F (8 parts/10(6)) co-crystallized with sucrose, (3) Fe (88 parts/10(6)) sucrose, (4) Cu (75 parts/10(6)) sucrose, (5) Cu + F sucrose, (6) Cu + L Fe sucrose, (7) F + Fe sucrose, and (8) Cu + Fe + F sucrose. At death the jaws were removed and sonicated in 0.9% saline solution for microbial assessment. In addition, organic acid assays were performed for each animal. Keyes smooth-surface and sulcal caries scores were lowest in the Cu + Fe + F sucrose group, but not statistically significantly different from those of the other Cu groups. The numbers of Strep. sobrinus found in the groups that received Cu, Cu + Fe, Cu + F, F + Fe and Cu + Fe + F sugar were lower than in the control group. Lactic acid was found in lower concentrations in Fe, Cu, Cu + F, Cu + Fe and F + Fe groups than in the other groups. It appears that combinations of Cu; Fe and F co-crystallized with sugar may have an additive effect in reducing the cariogenic potential of sugar by affecting lactic acid formation and reducing bacterial colonization."

Bovine specimens were brushed with a diamond-loaded dentifrice (DD2; 2 g particles/kg), a diamond-loaded dentifrice (1.5 g/kg) containing 20% hydrated silica as extra abrasive (DD1.5+S), or a diamond-loaded dentifrice (3 g/kg) containing 20% hydrated silica abrasive (DD3+S). Values were compared to those obtained with Colgate Total (CT) and Elmex Sensitive plus (ES). Brushing was performed using a cross brushing machine (F = 2.5 N; 120 brushing strokes/min). Abrasive wear [μm] of specimens (n = 12) was measured profilometrically and adjusted to 10,000 brushing strokes (10 kBS). Data were compared between groups using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc pairwise tests with Tukey correction, alpha = 0.05. Diamond dentifrices and ES showed no difference on dentine specimens: DD2 7.7 ± 2.6 μm/10 kBS; DD1.5+S 10.1 ± 2.3 μm/ 10 kBS; DD3+S 10.1 ± 2.6 μm/10 kBS; ES 7.4 ± 1.1 μm/10 kBS, while CT–brushed specimens exhibited significantly higher dentinal abrasion compared to all other groups: CT 31.0 ± 7.7 μm/ 10 kBS. Diamond loading significantly influenced enamel wear (mean ± SD μm/10 kBS): DD2 1.8 ± 0.5 μm/10 kBS. Conversely, addition of the silica abrasive reduced these values: DD1.5+S 1.1 ± 0.3 μm/10 kBS; DD3+S 1.6 ± 0.3 μm/10 kBS. CT and ES revealed similarly low values: CT 0.3 ± 0.1 μm/10 kBS; ES 0.2 ± 0.1 μm/10 kBS.

CD007868,0,8319254,0,Long-term fluoride release of visible light-activated composites in vitro: a correlation with in situ demineralisation data.,"Fluoridated composites are able to reduce or inhibit secondary caries around fillings. The aims of this study were firstly to investigate the amount of F released in vitro from composites with a F content between 0 and 26 vol% as a function of time over a 1-year period. A second aim was to correlate the in vitro data on F release with enamel demineralisation data in situ after a 1-month period. The results show that all fluoridated composites release sizable amounts of F in solution, the total amounts of F released from three composites were proportional to log t over at least 1 year. In one case proportionality of the total amount of F released with t was observed. Possible mechanisms of F release are considered. The results presented also show a linear relation between the log of in vitro F release data and the effects on enamel demineralisation in situ next to the composite. Extrapolation of the data reveals that a F release of about 200-300 micrograms/cm2 over a 1-month period from a fluoridated composite would completely inhibit secondary caries under plaque conditions."

CD007868,0,16765601,0,Triple helix stabilization by covalently linked DNA-bisbenzimidazole conjugate synthesized by maleimide-thiol coupling chemistry.,"Tethering of BBZPNH2, an analogue of the Hoechst 33258, with a 14 nucleotide long DNA sequence with the help of succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), a heterobifunctional crosslinking reagent, using DMF/ water as solvent yields a conjugate which effectively stabilizes the triple helix. The above conjugate was hybridized with 26 bp long double stranded (ds) DNA having 14 bp long polypurine-polypyrimidine stretch to form a pyrimidine motif triple helix. The above conjugate increases the thermal stability of both the transitions, that is, triple helix to double helix by 12 degrees C and double helix to single strand transition by 16 degrees C for the triple helix formed with conjugated TFO over the triple helix made from non-conjugated TFO. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra recorded at different temperatures confirm the presence of minor groove binding bisbenzimidazole in the AT-rich minor groove of dsDNA even after the major groove bound TFO separates out."
CD007868,0,11218494,0,An in vitro study of fluoride release from a resin-modified glass ionomer cement after exposure to toothpaste slurries of different pH.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the fluoride release from an aged resin-modified glass ionomer (Vitremer) after exposure to five toothpaste slurries with different pH values. Cylindrical specimens of the material were leached in de-ionized water for 3 months and then exposed for 30 min daily for 10 days to three dentifrice slurries (20 specimens/group) containing 0.05% fluoride with pH values of 2.6, 5.7 and 8.3 and two non-fluoridated slurries with pH values of 2.5 and 5.7. A neutral NaF solution (0.05% F) was used as a control. During the 30 min exposure time, the fluoride concentration was gradually decreased in order to imitate the clinical situation. Thereafter, specimens were immersed individually in de-ionized water and the fluoride release determined. After the first day of exposure, all groups except one without fluoride (pH 5.7) showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased fluoride release. After exposure to the fluoridated toothpaste slurry with pH 5.7, significantly (P < 0.05) more fluoride was released compared to the toothpaste slurry with pH 8.3. Low pH (2.5 or 2.6) of the slurry resulted in a significantly (P < 0.05) higher fluoride release, regardless of whether it was fluoridated or not. The total amount of fluoride released after exposure to the more acidic fluoride toothpaste slurry was greater than that released from the more acidic non-fluoride toothpaste and the less acidic fluoride toothpaste. Our data indicate that the fluoride release from the resin-modified glass ionomer studied may be increased after treatment with an acidified NaF-toothpaste."

CD007868,0,2638180,0,Salivary and plaque triclosan levels after brushing with a 0.3% triclosan/copolymer/NaF dentifrice.,"The concentration and elimination rate of triclosan in saliva was assessed as part of a six week clinical study which evaluated the antiplaque efficacy of a 0.3% triclosan/PVM/MA copolymer/NaF dentifrice. On day one of the study the concentration of triclosan in whole saliva was determined at various times after dentifrice use for both the triclosan/PVM/MA copolymer/NaF and placebo dentifrice groups. The results indicated that the salivary triclosan levels ranged from 19.7 micrograms/ml at 5 minutes to 1 microgram/ml at 2 hours after use of the 0.3% triclosan dentifrice. The triclosan elimination curve for saliva exhibited a mono-exponential decline with a half-life of 26 minutes. The plaque content of triclosan, one hour after dentifrice use, which was determined at the end of the study, was found to be relatively high (25 micrograms/g) compared to that seen in saliva at the same time (6.2 micrograms/ml). It was concluded that the 0.3% triclosan/PVM/MA copolymer/NaF test dentifrice provided effective delivery and bioavailability of the antiplaque agent, triclosan. This was based on the relatively high salivary and plaque triclosan levels observed and the concomitant reduction in plaque formation seen at the end of the study."

CD007868,0,9461907,0,Marginal seal composition in amalgam restored teeth of varying marginal leakage.,"An in vitro study was performed to ascertain the marginal seal elemental composition of amalgam restored extracted teeth of known marginal leakage. Occlusal cavities were cut in 400 caries free extracted teeth and left unlined or lined with one of 5 bases. A varnish was applied to half the cavities followed by restoration with a low copper or high copper amalgam to produce 20 restoration combinations. The teeth were stored in 1 per cent NaCl and thymol for 3 and 12 months at 20 degrees C whereafter a standard fluorescent dye marginal leakage test was performed on 320 specimens (eight teeth per treatment). Restoration combinations were grouped into 4 seal classes depending on percentage marginal seal achieved for each combination: 0-25 per cent; 26-50 per cent; 51-75 per cent and 76-100 per cent. The 80 remaining teeth (2 teeth per treatment) were fractured to expose the restoration and cavity surface, covered with marginal seal material and this was analysed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Elemental seal composition was compared to percentage marginal seal achieved using ANOVA and Tukey's test with significance set at p < 0.05. Numbers of elemental analysis specimens falling into each marginal seal class was 0-25 per cent = 48; 26-50 per cent = 18; 51-75 per cent = 10; 76-100 per cent = 4. Of the 16 elements detected, nine were significantly linked to sealing/leakage: Ca, Cl, Cu, Mg, Hg, P, Ag, Sn and Zn. The findings have a bearing on the improved longevity of amalgam restorations."

A total of 989 water samples were analyzed. Fluoride concentrations were classified according to three different criteria used in Brazil. The city conducted a political and legal intervention in 2003. The Prais-Winsten procedure was used to evaluate the fluoride concentrations over time. In the ten years, the water fluoridation system showed 46%, 32%, and 43% of adequate samples, depending on the criterion. Prior to the municipal intervention, the proportion of adequate samples was 40%, 26%, and 36%, increasing to 63%, 49%, and 61% after the intervention, according to the three criteria. Fluoride concentration improved after the municipal intervention. On-going surveillance is recommended, including water fluoridation, dental caries, and dental fluorosis."
CD007868,0,17384036,0,Effects of calcium phosphate nanoparticles on Ca-PO4 composite.,"Nano-particles of dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA) were synthesized for the first time. The objectives of this study were to incorporate DCPA nano-particles into resin for Ca-PO(4) release to combat dental caries, and to investigate the filler level effects. Nano-DCPA and nano-silica-fused silicon nitride whiskers at a 1:1 ratio were used at filler mass fractions of 0-75%. The flexural strengths in MPa (mean +/- SD; n = 6) of DCPA-whisker composites ranged from (106 +/- 39) at 0% fillers to (114 +/- 23) at 75% fillers, similar to (112 +/- 22) of a non-releasing composite (TPH) (p > 0.1). The composite with 75% fillers in a NaCl solution (133 mmol/L, pH = 7.4, 37 degrees C) yielded a Ca concentration of (0.65 +/- 0.02) mmol/L and PO(4) of (2.29 +/- 0.07) mmol/L. Relationships were established between ion-release and DCPA volume fraction V(DCPA): Ca = 4.46 V(DCPA)(1.6,) and = 66.9 V(DCPA)(2.6). Nano-DCPA-whisker PO(4) composites had high strength and released high levels of Ca-PO(4) requisite for remineralization. These new nano-composites could provide the needed combination of stress-bearing and caries-inhibiting capabilities."
CD007868,0,24956225,0,Large work function difference driven electron transfer from electrides to single-walled carbon nanotubes.,"A difference in work function plays a key role in charge transfer between two materials. Inorganic electrides provide a unique opportunity for electron transfer since interstitial anionic electrons result in a very low work function of 2.4-2.6 eV. Here we investigated charge transfer between two different types of electrides, [Ca(2)N](+)·e(-) and [Ca(24)Al(28)O(64)](4+)·4e(-), and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a work function of 4.73-5.05 eV. [Ca(2)N](+) · e(-) with open 2-dimensional electron layers was more effective in donating electrons to SWNTs than closed cage structured [Ca(24)Al(28)O(64)](4+) · 4e(-) due to the higher electron concentration (1.3 × 10(22) cm(-3)) and mobility (∼ 200 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at RT). A non-covalent conjugation enhanced near-infrared fluorescence of SWNTs as high as 52%. The field emission current density of electride-SWNT-silver paste dramatically increased by a factor of 46,000 (14.8 mA cm(-2)) at 2 V μm(-1) (3.5 wt% [Ca(2)N](+) · e(-)) with a turn-on voltage of 0.85 V μm(-1)."

Another agent, sanguinarine, which is currently used in both a mouthrinse and toothpaste, leads in some cases only to a transient burning sensation and could be used on a long-term basis. The purpose of this 14-week controlled clinical trial was to assess the effectiveness of a toothpaste and oral rinse containing sanguinaria extract after scaling, root planing and a chlorhexidine regimen."
CD007868,0,17713337,0,A cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoride varnish as a public health measure to reduce caries in children.,"This cluster randomised controlled study assessed the effectiveness of twice-yearly applications of fluoride varnish as a public health measure to reduce dental caries in children living in relatively deprived communities. The test (n = 334) and control (n = 330) children in 2 school years (unit of randomisation) attended 24 state primary schools and were 6-8 years of age at the start. Good baseline balance was found. Duraphat varnish was applied at school on 5 occasions over 26 months, by dental therapists. A combined visual and fibre-optic transillumination examination included all surfaces of primary and first permanent molars at baseline and after 26 months for small and large enamel and dentine lesions. At the final examination the only statistically significant difference was in the caries increment for small enamel lesions in the primary dentition, with the test children having fewer lesions. This study failed to demonstrate that the twice-yearly application of fluoride varnish provided at school reduced dental caries in children living in this community. The low level of response and a lower than expected caries increment had a major impact on the effectiveness of the intervention, since the children who participated were least likely to have benefited from the programme, whereas those who might have benefited did not consent."
CD007868,0,15992619,0,Detection of the apr gene in proteolytic psychrotrophic bacteria isolated from refrigerated raw milk.,"Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas have been associated with the spoilage of raw milk and dairy products due to the production of thermostable proteolytic enzymes. The apr gene encodes for alkaline metalloprotease in Pseudomonas and other related bacteria. Its presence in psychrotrophic proteolytic bacteria isolated from raw milk collected from cooling tanks was verified. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used with degenerate primers. Total DNA from 112 isolates was pooled in different groups and then used as template for the amplification reactions. Controls consisted of DNA extracted from 26 cultures. An expected DNA fragment of 194 bp was detected in groups that contained bacteria identified as Pseudomonas. The PCR product was observed only when DNA from control cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens and Aeromonas hydrophila were used. A detection limit assay indicated that the apr gene could be directly amplified from pasteurized milk inoculated with 10(8) CFU/ml of P. fluorescens. With this method it was possible to detect proteolytic bacteria at 10(5) CFU/ml in reconstituted skim milk powder if cells were recovered for DNA extraction before amplification."
CD007868,0,7899099,0,Argon laser irradiation and acidulated phosphate fluoride treatment in caries-like lesion formation in enamel: an in vitro study.,"The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine the combined effects of argon laser irradiation (ArI) and acidulated phosphate fluoride treatment (APF) on caries-like lesion formation in human enamel. Each specimen was divided into tooth quarters with each quarter assigned to one of four groups: 1) control; 2) ArI Only; 3) ArI before APF treatment; 4) APF treatment before ArI. After a fluoride-free prophylaxis, acid-resistant varnish was applied to the tooth quarters, leaving sound enamel windows exposed on buccal and lingual surfaces. Argon laser irradiation was at 2 watts for 10s (100J/cm2). APF treatment was with a 1.23% APF gel for 4 min. Lesions were created in sound enamel windows with an acidified gel. After lesion formation, sections were obtained and imbibed with water for polarized light study. Body of the lesion depths were determined and compared among the four groups. Lesion depths were: 195 +/- 23 microns for control; 129 +/- 17 microns for ArI only; 96 +/- 14 microns for ArI before APF; and 88 +/- 11 microns for APF before ArI. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between the control group and all treatment groups, and between the ArI only group and both combined APF and ArI groups. Significant difference (P > 0.05) was not found between the ArI before APF and the APF before ArI groups. Laser irradiation alone reduced lesion depth by 34% compared with control lesions. When ArI was combined with APF treatment, lesion depth decreased by more than 50% compared with control lesions, and by 26 to 32% when compared with lased-only lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD007868,0,15506689,0,Comparing caries risk factors and risk profiles between children and elderly.,"The aim of this study was to compare the caries risk profiles of children and elderly, the actual annual caries increment and the impact of some selected caries related factors. The risk profiles were created by a computerised risk assessment program, the Cariogram, which evaluates data and presents the weighted and summarized result as one figure, illustrating the 'percent chance of avoiding caries' in the future. The data used originated from two separate longitudinal studies illustrating the Cariogram's capacity to assess caries risk. One study comprised about 400 children; the other included about 150 elderly. At baseline, information on past caries experience, diet, oral hygiene and use of fluoride was obtained. Saliva analyses included mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, buffering capacity and secretion rate. The caries risk was assessed and after two and five years, respectively, caries was re-evaluated and the incidence was compared with the predictions. Fifty percent of the children, but only two percent of the elderly appeared in the lowest caries risk group. Of the elderly, 26% belonged to the highest caries risk group versus 3 % of the children. The mean DFS increment per year for the total group of children was 0.4 +/- 0.8 (SD) and 1.2 +/- 1.9 for the elderly. Individual factors contributing significantly to the higher risk profiles for the adults were higher plaque scores, higher counts of mutans streptococci and lower buffering capacity. Over all, the risk for caries, as assessed by the Cariogram, was twice as high for the elderly."

Testing for the presence of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in feces (Monofluo Kit Cryptosporidium, Diagnostics Pasteur, France) indicated that 26% animals were infected (81% of Group I, 15% of Group II and 0% of Group III). Serological testing (ELISA for detection of specific anti-C. parvum IgG) indicated that 59% animals were seropositive (12% of Group I, 74% of Group II and 78% of Group III). Immunoblotting results indicate that cattle sera recognize C. parvum antigens of widely varying molecular weights and that the number of antigens recognized increases with age. Immunoblots revealed that some of the sera belonging to the Group I reacted with protein fractions between 15 and 20 kDa but none recognized the 21-23 kDa antigen. Only few sera in the Group II recognized the protein fraction between 15 and 20 kDa. The recognition of 21-23 kDa fraction was observed by four sera from uninfected and seropositive animals. Sera from all the seronegative Group II animals recognized few antigens and always with molecular weight greater than 50 kDa. Serum samples from both seropositive and seronegative animals belonging to the Group III recognized antigens with molecular weight ranging 15-20 kDa. Surprisingly, the protein fractions between 21 and 28 kDa reacted with approximately 30% of the sera from seropositive animals and only one of the nine sera from seronegative animals. The recognition of 42-46 kDa antigens increased with the age and only reacted with the sera from uninfected animals."

CD007868,0,23721034,0,Evaluation of preventive programs in high caries active preschool children.,"Although caries prevalence in preschool children has dramatically decreased during the last decades it is still a large problem for a minor group of these children. Great efforts have been invested in finding effective preventive programs for the high caries active preschool children. However, few studies have evaluated and discussed which approach will give the best effect. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of a ""standard"" preventive program with a series of programs with more extensive measures during a two-year period. At start one hundred and sixty high caries active preschool children (mean age 4 years) were included in the study. The children were randomly distributed to four groups. All groups were exposed to the basic program composed of dietary counselling, oral hygiene instructions and fluoride varnish application. Three groups were exposed to one additional preventive measure e.g. 1% chlorhexidine gel in trays, 0.2% NaF gel in trays or daily tooth brushing with 1% chlorhexidine gel. The programs were repeated seven times during the two-year study period and were executed by trained dental hygienists. Caries examination and saliva sampling for Streptococcus mutans measurements were performed at start of the study and after two years. The mean defs at start was between 10.8 and 12.6 for the four groups (NS). After two years the caries increment was 1.9 ds in the basic preventive group and between 1.9 and 2.6 (NS) in the other groups. Numerically there were more children in the chlorhexidine groups that showed reduction of Streptococcus mutans counts compared to the other groups, but the differences were small. The mean caries increment of about 1.9 ds per year in all groups indicate that all programs were effective taken into account that the children had about 11 defs at start. There were no differences in caries increment between the basic preventive group and the other groups. The conclusion was that addition of preventive measures on top of an effective basic program is a waste of resources. The effect on oral health of individual reinstruction and motivation, by a dental hygienist, seven times during the two-year study period should not be underestimated."

In a double-blind randomised controlled trial (n = 773) the effect of sodium fluoride gel on D3MFS and d3mfs was compared with a placebo gel. The mean caries reduction of professionally applied fluoride gel after 4 years in subjects with baseline caries experience D3MFS = 0 as well as d3mfs = 0 was 0.08 D3MFS (SE = 0.06) and 0.36 d3mfs (SE = 0.22). The prevented fraction for D3MFS and d3mfs was 26% (SE = 16%) and 20% (SE = 11%), respectively. It was concluded that in the investigated low-caries 4.5- to 6.5-year-olds, fluoride gel treatment showed a statistically significant (tested one-sided) caries-inhibiting effect on D3MFS, which was considered not clinically relevant, and no significant effect on d3mfs."

On the basis of these answers two groups were distinguished: a group of students who had been subjected to planned dental care (positive surveys) and a group of students who had not been subjected to planned care (negative surveys) (Tab. 1). At the second stage the clinical examination of the surveyed students was carried out and the obtained data were registered on 1986 WHO record cards. The examination was performed among students who were subjected to dental care in primary and high school together with those students who were not subjected to this care. All examinations were done at a dental surgery with the use of a mirror, probe and a calibrated WHO-621 probe. Results of the surveys showed that systematically performed examinations of the oral cavity and systematic dental treatment were carried out for over 60% of surveyed students in primary schools and about 40% of surveyed students in high schools. In primary schools the organization of health education was more effective, its activity was confirmed by about 80% of respondents, while in high schools by only 40%. In response to question concerning topical fluoride preventive measures 40% of positive answers were obtained from the surveyed students concerning primary schools and 10% concerning high schools. Survey questions in the part referring to nurseries were often answered ""I don't remember"" therefore it is impossible to interpret the results. Fluoride tablets were taken by about 40% of surveyed students. Over 65% of respondents with diagnosed malocclusion were treated orthodontically. Among students with dental calculus over a half had it removed earlier. Much better results of clinical examinations were obtained in the group subjected to planned dental care at developmental age. In this group the average DMFT number was 11.31, the average number of teeth with untreated caries (D) was 0.82, average number of removed teeth because of caries (M) was 0.55, whereas in the negative group (not subjected to dental care) the average DMFT number was 14.61, average D number was 1.41, average M number was 2.54. The average number of filled teeth (F) showed no significant difference in both groups and was about 10 (Tab. 2). Malocclusion was diagnosed in about 30% of surveyed students in the group subjected to treatment and in over 45% of surveyed students not subjected to dental care in school (Tab. 2). In the group of positive surveys the proportion of respondents with healthy periodontium was over 11% whereas in the group of negative surveys it was about three times lower (Tab. 4). The results of the study show that planned program of dental care is most effectively carried out in primary schools. The results have confirmed that systematic dental care at development age has a positive effect on the stomatognathic system at mature age."

CD007868,0,2059982,0,Formation of CaF2 on sound enamel and in caries-like enamel lesions after different forms of fluoride applications in vitro.,"The formation of calcium fluoride (CaF2) was measured on sound enamel (SE) and in caries-like enamel lesions (CL) after treatment in vitro with 2% neutral NaF or Duraphat. The caries-like lesions were created by exposure to acidified gel at pH 4.5 within a 0.07-cm2 window punched in water-repellant tape. The same window area was used in series (n = 10) of SE or CL during the application of NaF for 1 or 5 min or for 18 h or Duraphat for 6 or 18 h. CaF2 was extracted with 1 M KOH for 24 h, and fluoride was determined by gas chromatography. The short-term applications of NaF produced only negligible amounts of CaF2 on SE. The amounts of CaF2 in CL after 5 min application of NaF corresponded to (mean +/- SEM) 27 +/- 2.0 micrograms F/cm2. More than half of this amount was observed after only 1 min exposure to the NaF solution. The quantities of CaF2 in CL were similar after 6 and 18 h application of Duraphat, amounting to 26 +/- 2.2 and 31 +/- 2.2 micrograms F/cm2, respectively, suggesting that the reaction was essentially terminated after 6 h. These amounts were only about one fourth of the quantity obtained after 18 h exposure to the NaF solution. Thus, the conventional 5-min treatment with NaF produced the same amount of CaF2 in CL as 6 or 18 h exposure to Duraphat."

From these 236 children, 143 answered a questionnaire which showed that 36 of them were fluoridated salt users and 107 were not. The dft index was significantly lower in the FS consumers which showed 35.5% dft reduction compared to the non-FS-consuming children. When using the Generalized Linear Model, this reduction was significant (P = 0.03). Although lower in the FS group, the DMFT and DMFS indices showed no statistical significant difference. It appeared that 72.2% of the users took simultaneously fluoride tablets but no dental fluorosis was observed. The use of fluoride tablets had a significant effect on the DMFS (P = 10(-2)). The children who consumed FS used more frequently fluoridated mouthrinses (P = 10(-3)) and had more frequent professional application of fluoridated gel and varnishes than non-consumers (P = 0.02). The DMFS index increased with the number of meals (P = 10(-6)), which was the most significant variable entered into the Generalized Linear Model. The children who brushed their teeth once a day had a DMFS value 2.6 times higher than those who brushed regularly three times a day (P = 10(-3)). The DMFS value was 4.4 times higher among the children who brushed their teeth irregularly when compared with those who brushed three times a day (P = 10(-2))."

CD007868,0,1878920,0,Effect of different fluoride levels in dentifrice on the development of approximal caries.,"The development of approximal carious lesions was monitored on annual bite-wing radiographs obtained from 315 children, participating in a controlled dentifrice trial; 157 of these children had used a dentifrice containing 250 ppm F and 158 a dentifrice containing 1,000 ppm F (both as NaF) during a 3-year period as the sole fluoride supplement. The total number of surfaces recorded was 6,099 at the baseline and 7,358 at the final examination. In the 250-ppm F group 393 approximal lesions (297 in the outer half, 96 in the inner half of the enamel) and in the 1,000-ppm F group 399 lesions (319 and 80, respectively) were diagnosed at the baseline examination. After 3 years the fraction of sound surfaces had decreased from 79% at baseline in both groups to 54% in the low-F group and to 58% in the high-F group. Concurrently, the relative number of enamel lesions had increased from 13% in both groups to 26% in the low-F group and 24% in the high-F group. 66% of the surfaces in the low-F group and 60% in the high-F group remained sound, and the relative proportion of static enamel lesions was 26 and 28%, respectively. The differences did not reach statistical significance. The results imply that higher fluoride levels in the dentifrice are more effective in retarding the initiation of caries, while they do not differ with respect to the progression of radiographically detectable approximal carious lesions."

In a double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study, 33 adult subjects (mean age 35.3 years) used either Plax or a placebo mouthwash for 30 s prior to toothbrushing during a 2-week period. After a washout period of 4 weeks, the subjects used the other mouthwash in the same way.

The bleeding index (BI) was recorded at the beginning and end of the study. Results were analysed using a paired one-tailed t-test. Neither plax nor placebo mouthwashes reduced plaque scores significantly (p > 0.05) below baseline. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean BI at the beginning of the trial (0.42) and at the end (0.44). These results suggest that the routine use of Plax is not a useful adjunct to toothbrushing."

Caries-free prevalence in the 6-year-old was 52.9% in their primary dentition; the dmft and dmfs were 2.1 and 5.1, and both DMFT and DMFS were 0.1. Almost 91% of the dmft was attributable to active decay. The proportion of children with a dmft+DMFT > or = 1 and the dmft and dmfs were significantly higher in those with low socio-economic status. In the 12-year-old, 52.7% had a history of caries and the DMFT and DMFS were 1.5 and 2.6; the filled component was the dominant proportion. The more likely they visited a dentist for routine checkup, the higher socio-economic status (it was not associated with DMFT), the less frequently they had sweets, and the low level of Streptococcus mutans, the more likely they were caries-free and the less likely they were to have a high DMFT, DMFS, and DT. In the 15-year-old, 68.8% had a history of caries and the DMFT and DMFS were 2.8 and 4.8, with a higher prevalence of the F component. The children who visited a dentist for routine checkup had a significantly lower caries experience, DMFT, DMFS, and DT than the irregular attenders, and those with low socio-economic background were more likely to have a high DMFS."
CD007868,0,2211263,0,"Influence of scheduling, dose, and volume of administration of a perfluorochemical emulsion on tumor response to radiation therapy.","Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Eighty consecutive patients, scheduled for fixed appliance treatment in both jaws were compared with a non-orthodontic matched-control group. The oral hygiene regimen consisted of brushing two to three times daily, flossing, fluoride rinse, and plaque disclosing tablets. Patients were requested to avoid carbonated soft drinks/acidic juices and candies. The WSL index of Gorelick et al. (Gorelick L, Geiger A M, Gwinnett A J 1982 Incidence of white spot formation after bonding and banding. American Journal of Orthodontics 81: 93-98) was used. Caries were scored according to Amarante et al. (Amarante E, Raadal M, Espelid I 1998 Impact of diagnostic criteria on the prevalence of dental caries in Norwegian children aged 5, 12 and 18 years. Community Dental Oral Epidemiology 26: 87-94). We collected data from all finished cases. It comprised 40 subjects in the orthodontic group (mean age: 13.6 years, range: 12-16 years) and 40 matched controls. The average treatment time was 18 months (range: 9-25 months). The mean increase in WSL index in the orthodontic group was 1.9 and 0.4 in the control group (P = 0.001). The mean increase in dentine caries was 0.5 lesions and 0.7 lesions in the in the orthodontic group and control group, respectively (P = 0.62). Twenty-three per cent of treated patients showed good compliance, 68 per cent moderate compliance, and 9 per cent poor compliance. The mean increase in WSL was 1.0, 1.4, and 3.3 in the good, moderate, and poor compliance group, respectively (P = 0.155). Orthodontically treated patients have significantly higher risk for developing WSL than untreated patients, while there is no difference with respect to development of new dentinal caries lesions.

CD007868,0,22391794,0,Amounts of Sr and Ca eluted from deciduous enamel to artificial saliva related to dental caries.,"This study was performed to elucidate the relationship between dental caries and the levels of Sr and Ca eluted from enamel, and to examine whether these elements are useful as factors to assess caries risk. The available 103 (Sr) and 108 (Ca) samples were obtained among 111 collected deciduous teeth. The healthy regions of enamel were decalcified in artificial saliva at pH 6.2 and 5.5. The eluted levels of these elements from enamel were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Sr and Ca levels were not affected by the sex nor tooth type. Sr levels of the caries-experienced tooth (CE) group were 2.6-fold (pH 6.2) and 2.2-fold (pH 5.5) higher than those of the sound tooth (ST) group, respectively. Furthermore, the Sr levels were significantly higher in the teeth with treated than in those with untreated caries. Only at pH 6.2 was a significant difference found in Ca levels between the ST and CE groups. In the ST group, at pH 5.5, both the Sr and Ca levels significantly increased when the children had six or more carious teeth. The Sr and Ca elution levels were significantly inhibited in the teeth receiving fluoride application every 3 or 4 months compared to those that were not. These findings indicate that Sr can be an indicator of the acid resistance of teeth, and a useful factor to assess future caries risk."

To determine whether fluoride in tablet or liquid form would be more efficacious with children with cleft lip and/or palate, a two-year clinical investigation was conducted to test the anti-caries effects. One-hundred and fifteen cleft children (59 boys and 56 girls) between 22 and 26 months old were randomly selected into control, tablet and liquid fluoride groups. The amount of administered fluoride was 0.25 mg F daily in non-fluoridated Taiwan. Dental examinations were conducted using mirrors and #23 explorers. Caries were assessed using the DMF index in the baseline, first year and second year. The results showed that children in the tablet and liquid groups had a significantly lower DMFT increment than in the control group (p < 0.05). In the DMFS index, children in the liquid group showed a significantly lower caries increment than in the control group (p < 0.01), and children in the tablet group presented a borderline, but non-significant statistical difference when compared with the control group (p = 0.065). No significant statistical difference was found in either DMFT or DMFS between tablet and liquid fluoride administrations (p = 0.521 and p = 0.383, respectively). It is concluded that dietary fluoride supplements in liquid form show efficacy in reducing early childhood caries in the cleft children. Liquid fluoride showed slightly better numerical anti-caries effect than tablet fluoride, which is possibly due to its ease of administration with small children."

In a 3-y cluster-randomized trial, we developed an OHP INT with Navajo input that was delivered by trained Navajo lay health workers to children attending 52 Navajo Head Start classrooms (26 INT, 26 usual care [UC]). The INT was designed as a highly personalized set of oral health-focused interactions (5 for children and 4 for parents), along with 4 fluoride varnish applications delivered in Head Start during academic years of 2011 to 2012 and 2012 to 2013. The authors evaluated INT impact on decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces (dmfs) increment compared with UC. Other outcomes included caries prevalence and caregiver oral health-related knowledge and behaviors. Modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted. The authors enrolled 1,016 caregiver-child dyads. Baseline mean dmfs/caries prevalence equaled 19.9/86.5% for the INT group and 22.8/90.1% for the UC group, respectively. INT adherence was 53% (i.e., ≥3 child OHP events, ≥1 caregiver OHP events, and ≥3 fluoride varnish). After 3 y, dmfs increased in both groups (+12.9 INT vs. +10.8 UC; P = 0.216), as did caries prevalence (86.5% to 96.6% INT vs. 90.1% to 98.2% UC; P = 0.808) in a modified intention-to-treat analysis of 897 caregiver-child dyads receiving 1 y of INT. Caregiver oral health knowledge scores improved in both groups (75.1% to 81.2% INT vs. 73.6% to 79.5% UC; P = 0.369). Caregiver oral health behavior scores improved more rapidly in the INT group versus the UC group (P = 0.006). The dmfs increment was smaller among adherent INT children (+8.9) than among UC children (+10.8; P = 0.028) in a per-protocol analysis. In conclusion, the severity of dental disease in Navajo Head Start children is extreme and difficult to improve. The authors argue that successful approaches to prevention may require even more highly personalized approaches shaped by cultural perspectives and attentive to the social determinants of oral health (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01116739)."
CD007868,0,15352023,0,Application of stepwise discriminant analysis to classify commercial orange juices using chiral micellar electrokinetic chromatography-laser induced fluorescence data of amino acids.,"The use of chiral amino acids content and stepwise discriminant analysis to classify three types of commercial orange juices (i.e., nectars, orange juices reconstituted from concentrates, and pasteurized orange juices not from concentrates) is presented. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography with laser-induced fluorescence (MEKC-LIF) and beta-cyclodextrins are used to determine L- and D-amino acids previously derivatized with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). This chiral MEKC-LIF procedure is easy to implement and provides information about the main amino acids content in orange juices (i.e., L-proline; L-aspartic acid, D-Asp, L-serine, L-asparagine, L-glutamic acid, D-Glu, L-alanine, L-.arginine, D-Arg, and the non-chiral gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA), i.e., gamma-aminobutyric acid). From these results, it is clearly demonstrated that some D-amino acids occur naturally in orange juices. Application of stepwise discriminant analysis to 26 standard samples showed that the amino acids L-Arg, L-Asp and GABA were the most important variables to differentiate the three groups of samples. With these three selected amino acids a 100% correct classification of the samples was obtained either by standard or by leave-one-out cross-validation procedures. These classification functions based on the content in L-Arg, L-Asp and GABA were also applied to nine test samples and provided an adequate classification and/or interesting information on these samples. It is concluded that chiral MEKC-LIF analysis of amino acids and stepwise discriminant analysis can be used as a consistent procedure to classify commercial orange juices providing useful information about their quality and processing. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the combined use of chiral capillary electrophoresis and discriminant techniques to classify foods."

CD007868,0,7850638,0,A study of the dietary fluoride supplementation prescribing pattern of south Glamorgan dentists.,"Following the inclusion of dietary fluoride supplements in the Dental Practitioners Formulary on 1st January 1993, the aims of this study were to observe the fluoride supplementation prescribing pattern of South Glamorgan general dental practitioners and relate it to the latest caries prevalence data. The analysis was carried out on the prescribers and recipients of the prescriptions using post codes to locate all members of both groups into one of 26 dental planning areas (DPA) within the district. As the age of a minority of recipients could not be substantiated, an assumption that they were all 14 years or under was used to calculate a prescription to population ratio for each DPA. These ratios were correlated against the latest available caries prevalence data for each DPA to ascertain any relationship between the level of fluoride supplement prescription and the caries prevalence within South Glamorgan. Data were collected via the Prescription Pricing Division of Welsh Health Common Services Authority for the six month period, 1st January to 30th June 1993. Of 623 prescriptions dispensed within South Glamorgan, 581 were issued by dentists working in the District for patients living in the District. Of the 163 dentists registered within South Glamorgan FHSA, (boundary coterminous with the DHA) 49 made one or more prescription. Of these, 10 dentists wrote 20 prescriptions or more, totalling 401, during the study period, i.e. 6 per cent of the dentists made 69 per cent of the prescriptions. The correlation of the number of prescriptions issued per DPA (according to the dentists' location) with whole time equivalents in that DPA was 0.58 (P < 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Studies were grouped and analysed on the basis of sealant material type (resin-based sealant and glass ionomer-based sealant, glass ionomer and resin-modified glass ionomer) and different follow-up periods. Odds ratio were calculated for caries or no caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth. Mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes and data. Evidence quality was assessed using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods.ResultsEight RCTs involving a total of 1747 children aged five to ten years of age were included. Three trials compared resin-based fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish. Results from two studies (358 children) after two years were combined. Sealants prevented more caries, pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.69 (95%CI; 0.50 to 0.94). One trial with follow-up at four and nine years found that the caries-preventive benefit for sealants was maintained, with 26% of sealed teeth and 55.8% of varnished teeth having developed caries at nine years. Evidence for glass-ionomer sealants was of low quality. One split-mouth trial analysing 92 children at two-year follow-up found a significant difference in favour of resin-based fissure sealant together with fluoride varnish compared with fluoride varnish only (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55). The evidence was assessed as low quality. Three studies assessed but did not report any adverse effects.ConclusionsCurrently, scarce and clinically diverse data are available on the comparison of sealants and fluoride varnish applications; therefore it is not possible to draw clear conclusions about possible differences in effectiveness for preventing or controlling dental caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molars. The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those of the last update (in 2010). We found some low quality evidence suggesting the superiority of resin-based fissure sealants over fluoride varnish applications for preventing occlusal caries in permanent molars, and other low-quality evidence for benefits of resin-based sealant and fluoride varnish over fluoride varnish alone. Regarding glass ionomer sealant versus fluoride varnish comparisons, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low and could draw no conclusions."

Children of the different communities had varying dietary habits and consumed water with varying fluoride (F) concentration. Subjects (n=256) aged 9-14 years were examined in high-F areas (3.6 mg F/l, Arusha and Arusha Meru, n=101) and low-F areas (<0.4 mg F/l, Moshi and Kibosho, n=155). Dental caries was assessed under field conditions using the decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) index and the WHO criteria. The prevalence of caries was 14%. The mean DMFT score was 0.22 (n=256), the range between areas 0.07-0.66. Carious lesions were mainly observed in mandibular first molars. Logistic regression analyses indicated that subjects in the high-F and urban Arusha municipality were at a significantly higher risk of dental caries than children in the low-F areas (odds ratio [OR] 2.6). Controlling for ethnicity, children in urban areas were at higher risk for caries (OR 5.4) than children living in low-F rural Kibosho."
CD007868,0,9403120,0,Dissolution of powdered human enamel suspended in acid solutions at a high solid/solution ratio under a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 20 degrees C.,"The aim was to examine the nature of enamel dissolution in aqueous suspensions with a high solid/solution ratio and in a CO2-rich atmosphere. Before experimentation, a water-saturated mixture of 95% N2-5% CO2 was passed through the acid solutions for 24 hr. Samples of 2 g of powdered enamel were suspended in 7 ml of either 5 or 10 mmol/l HClO4, with or without 2 parts/10(6) fluoride and kept gently agitated for 24 hr in the above atmosphere. The same enamel samples were repeatedly exposed to fresh acid for 26 runs. All experiments were duplicated. The aqueous phase was analysed after 20 min and 24 hr for calcium, phosphate, fluoride, chloride, sodium and magnesium. It was found that after 20 min the fluoride was invariably taken up in the enamel and the solution was supersaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite with pH ranging 6.7-5.6. During the following 24 hr pH increased further, the supersaturation remained unchanged and the concentrations of calcium and phosphate in solution decreased. In contrast, sodium, magnesium and chloride were released from enamel during the entire period. In the later runs, the supersaturation with respect to hydroxyapatite was only modest and the decrease of calcium and phosphate concentrations limited, as were the release of sodium, magnesium and chloride. It is concluded that despite a CO2-rich atmosphere, calcium, phosphate and carbonate were released from enamel and quickly established a supersaturation with respect to hydroxyapatite with a secondary reprecipitation of mineral. It indicates that within the dental caries lesion in vivo, lesion fluid cannot exist undersaturated with respect to enamel apatite."
CD007868,0,8402803,0,Effects of a lactoperoxidase system-containing toothpaste on levels of hypothiocyanite and bacteria in saliva.,"Lactoperoxidase (LPO)/H2O2/SCN(-)-system-generated hypothiocyanite ions (OSCN-) and hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) are inhibitory against a number of oral bacteria, including mutans streptococci. A commercially available toothpaste (Biotene) comprises the complete LPO system. Generation of HOSCN/OSCN- by Biotene was studied in vitro both in sterilized and nonsterilized saliva of 10 healthy subjects. The HOSCN/OSCN- yield ranged from 100 to 300 microM with Biotene, while the salivary levels of HOSCN/OSCN- before the addition of Biotene were 30.1 +/- 25.1 microM. Two in vivo trials were carried out. In the first study, resting saliva was collected from 12 individuals before, immediately after, and 2, 5, 10 and 20 min after brushing with Biotene to evaluate the in vivo generation and decomposition of HOSCN/OSCN-. In the second study, 26 healthy individuals attended a 1-month crossover trial with Biotene and a control toothpaste, Vademecum (no LPO system), both containing F- and xylitol. The salivary counts of total streptococci, mutans streptococci (MS), lactobacilli and the total flora (TF), as well as the peroxidase, thiocyanate ion and HOSCN/OSCN- levels were determined before and after 2 and 4 weeks daily use of the toothpastes. Twice-a-day use of Biotene for 1 month resulted in an elevation of 'resting levels' of HOSCN/OSCN-. No such effect was found with the control toothpaste. No significant changes were found in the salivary levels of total streptococci, MS, lactobacilli or TF after 1-month use of either toothpaste. The results show the capability of the LPO-system-containing toothpaste to elevate the salivary levels of HOSCN/OSCN-, although no bactericidal effect was observed."

CD007868,0,7697563,0,The prevalence of dental caries in Slovenia in 1987 and 1993.,"Two national oral pathfinder surveys were conducted in the Republic of Slovenia in 1987 (1623 subjects) and 1993 (1567 subjects). The assessment forms used in the surveys were those of the World Health Organization. Persons aged 6, 12, 15, 18, 35-44 and 65 years or older were examined in all nine geographical areas of Slovenia. The results showed that caries prevalence declined in all the age groups except the oldest one. Mean DMFT changed from 5.2 to 3.9 (dmft) at age 6 years, from 5.1 to 2.6 at 12 years, from 10.2 to 5.6 at 15 years, from 12.9 to 8.8 at 18 years, from 20.5 to 19.0 at 35-44 years, and from 27.0 to 28.0 in persons aged 65 years or older. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05) for all the age groups except the last two. The proportion with caries-free primary teeth increased from 13 per cent to 30 per cent for 6-year-old children and for permanent teeth, from 6 per cent to 31 per cent for 12-year-old children. The substantial decline in caries is attributed to the widespread use of fluoridated dentifrices, the distribution of fluoride tablets to children and expectant mothers, topical application of an amine fluoride gel in schoolchildren, and an extensive fissure-sealing programme."

CD007868,0,9482041,0,Caries and dental fluorosis in a 0.25 and a 2.5 ppm fluoride area in the Sudan.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the caries prevalence of children living in areas with either 0.25 or 2.5 ppm fluoride in the drinking water, and to relate caries experience to the severity of dental fluorosis. The children, aged 6-16 years (mean 11.3 years), were lifelong residents of their rural villages. The severity of dental fluorosis in the maxillary central incisors, assessed by Deans index, was 1.4 +/- 0.9 (n = 59) and 2.3 +/- 0.9 (n = 65) in the 0.25 and 2.5 ppm areas, respectively. There was no significant difference in DMFT between children from the two areas (2.6 +/- 2.3 n = 59 versus 2.1 +/- 2.3, n = 65). In the low-fluoride area 75% of the children had decayed permanent teeth compared to 66% in the high-fluoride area. In the primary teeth, however, both the caries prevalence and the dmft were significantly lower in the 2.5 ppm area than in the low-fluoride area. Stepwise, multiple, linear regression analyses, including all children, showed a significant effect of age on DMFT (30% of the variance explained), but no explanatory effect of fluoride in drinking water, severity of dental fluorosis, or gender. Regression analyses based on children in the 2.5 ppm area alone, showed significantly higher DMFT by increased severity of dental fluorosis. In children with a mixed dentition (n = 66), there was no association between caries in the primary and permanent teeth."

They used a placebo dentifrice for 28 days, fluoridated dentifrice (1,570 ppm F) for the following 28 days, and placebo dentifrice for an additional 28 days, then returned to their usual dentifrices. Group B children also received 4-week applications of a varnish (2.26% F) while using the fluoridated dentifrice. Urinary collections were performed 24 h before the use of fluoridated dentifrice and 24 h (group A) or 48 h (group B) after. Fingernails were clipped every 2 weeks, for 26 weeks. Total F intake from diet and dentifrice was estimated. Fingernail F concentrations did not vary significantly throughout the study. Twenty-four-hour urinary F outputs (mean +/- SD, microg) were: 414 +/- 200 and 468 +/- 253 for placebo and F dentifrices, respectively (group A) and 402 +/-206, 691 +/- 345, 492 +/- 243 for placebo dentifrice, F dentifrice plus F varnish and F dentifrice, respectively (group B). The use of F dentifrice did not cause a significant increase in the urinary F output. However, when F varnish was used, a transitory increase in the urinary F output was detected (p = 0.001), returning to baseline levels in the last 24 h. Thus, F varnish is a safe method for topical F application even in children that use F dentifrice regularly. According to our protocol, urine was a suitable biomarker of exposure to F from dentifrice plus varnish, but not from dentifrice alone, while nails were not."

A fluoride-free dentifrice was used. Controls did not receive instruction in plaque removal procedures nor did they engage in plaque removal activities at school. For three school years the students in the treatment group practiced daily plaque removal, supervised by trained personnel. All participants were examined initially for plaque (PHP), gingival inflammation (DHC) and dental caries (DMFS). Girls in the treatment group showed a significant reduction (28%) in mean plaque scores and, for girls and boys, the mean changes in gingivitis scores were significantly reduced (40% and 17%, respectively). Adjusted mean incremental DMF surface scores were 13% lower in the treatment group than in the control group.

CD007868,0,15914987,0,Caries prevention by professional fluoride gel application on enamel and dentinal lesions in low-caries children.,"In a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, the caries-reducing effect of semi-annually applied fluoride gel in a low-caries child population initially aged 4.5-6.5 years (n = 773) has been investigated. Secondary analyses of the data were performed to study the caries reduction including non-cavitated lesions. The treatment effect of fluoride gel was calculated as preventive fraction (PF). When enamel lesions were included in DFS count (D(2) grade), the PF was 22% as compared to 26% counting dentinal lesions. The PFs showed that the mean effect of professionally applied fluoride gel was highest (71%) for D(3)S in the permanent dentition and lowest for d(3)s in the primary dentition (5%). The PFs for approximal and buccal and lingual surfaces of the permanent dentition significantly decreased from 80 to 25% and from 60 to 37% when enamel lesions (D(2)S) were included. With the exception of the buccal and lingual surfaces, in the primary dentition the PFs varied slightly when enamel lesions were included. Inclusion of non-cavitated lesions in the treatment effect statistics did not change the former conclusion that the treatment effect of fluoride gel application on dental caries reduction in a low-caries child population was considered not clinically relevant."

Fifty-two bovine enamel blocks were submitted to three different demineralisation cycles for caries-like lesion induction using Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces naeslundii. At baseline and after each cycle, the enamel blocks were analysed under Knoop surface micro-hardness (SMH) and an LFpen. One enamel block after each cycle was randomly chosen for Raman spectroscopy analysis. Cross-sectional micro-hardness (CSMH) was performed at different depths (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μm) in 26 enamel blocks after the second cycle and 26 enamel blocks after the third cycle. Average values of SMH (± standard deviation (SD)) were 319.3 (± 21.5), 80.5 (± 31.9), 39.8 (± 12.7), and 29.77 (± 10.34) at baseline and after the first, second and third cycles, respectively. Statistical significant difference was found among all periods (p < 0.01). The LFpen values were 4.3 (± 1.5), 7.5 (± 9.4), 7.1 (± 7.1) and 5.10 (± 3.58) at baseline and after the first, second, and third cycles, respectively, among all periods (p < 0.05). The CSMH values after the second and third cycles at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μm were 182.8 (± 69.8), 226.1 (± 79.6), 247.20 (± 69.36), 262.35 (± 66.36) and 268.45 (± 65.49), and for the third cycle were 193.7 (± 73.4), 239.5 (± 81.5), 262.64 (± 82.46), 287.10 (± 78.44) and 284.79 (± 72.63) (n = 24 and 23), respectively. No correlation was observed between the LFpen and SMH values (p > 0.05). One sample of each cycle was characterised through Raman spectroscopy analysis. It can be concluded that LF was effective in detecting the first demineralisation on enamel; however, the method did not show any effect in monitoring lesion progression after three cycles of in vitro demineralisation."

Fluoride toothpaste is used by 95% of the population and there is a long tradition of fluoride supplement use. The purpose of this study was to record the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in 8-year-old children and relate this to systemic fluoride exposure (supplements and toothpaste). All children (n = 551, born 1988) in a municipality in Norway were invited to participate. Dental fluorosis on the buccal surface of the upper permanent incisors was recorded according to the Thylstrup-Fejerskov index (TF). Parents provided data on use of supplements and toothpaste. Complete data were obtained from 383 children. Sixty-seven percent of the children had used fluoride supplements regularly during childhood. At 8 months or earlier, the teeth of 26% of the children, and at age 14 months or earlier the teeth of 82%, were being brushed. Among children who used fluoride supplements regularly, periodically, seldom and not at all, 45%, 21%, 10% and 0%, respectively, had dental fluorosis. The dental fluorosis was mild (TF = 1) in 87% of the cases. Bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that, in addition to use of fluoride supplements, starting toothbrushing at an early age was associated with higher prevalence of dental fluorosis. The child's birth weight and liking for or swallowing of toothpaste did not influence the prevalence of fluorosis. Risk factors for fluorosis were use of toothpaste before the age of 14 months and regular use of fluoride supplements during childhood."

CD007868,0,17024942,0,Efficiency of 4 caries excavation methods compared.,"This in vitro study compared the efficiency (time taken to excavate and successfully remove bacterially infected dentin) of Fluorescence Aided Caries Excavation (FACE), caries detector dye (CD), chemomechanical excavation (CS) and conventional excavation (CE). Teeth with dentin caries were assigned to 4 groups (n= 25). Caries excavation was carried out by one operator. In the FACE group, the operating field was illuminated with violet light. The operator observed the teeth through a high-pass filter and removed orange-red fluorescing areas with a slow speed bur. In the CS group, Carisolv was applied to the cavity using CS hand instruments and allowed to act for 30 seconds before caries was removed. In the CD group, caries was removed using the Caries Detector and, in the CE group, conventional excavation was carried out using visual-tactile criteria. The excavation time was recorded. Undecalcified thin slices (8 microm) were prepared, stained with giemsa and examined using light microscopy. The excavation time (median) was significantly shorter for FACE (3 minutes, 3 seconds) compared to CS (5 minutes, 8 seconds, p=0.015), CD (5 minutes, 26 seconds, p=0.003) and CE (4 minutes, 2 seconds, p=0.025). Histology showed remaining bacteria in significantly fewer (5/25) FACE samples compared to CS (15/25 p=0.004) CD (12/25 p=0.037) but not significantly fewer than CE (11/25 p=0.069)."
CD007868,0,12752542,0,Cost-effectiveness of different caries preventive measures in a high-risk population of Swedish adolescents.,"A total of 3373 12-year-olds agreed to participate in an intervention study evaluating different caries preventive measures. The study, titled 'Evaluation of caries preventive measures', was performed between 1995 and 1999 at 26 dental health clinics throughout Sweden. At the start of the study, the subjects were classified as individuals at high or low risk of developing caries. The high-risk group consisted of 1165 subjects. The children in the high-risk group were randomly assigned to one of four preventive programs. The programs represent a step-wise increase in fluoride content, contact with dental personnel and cost. The aim of the present cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) study performed from a societal perspective is to compare costs and consequences of caries preventive programs in a caries high-risk population. By 'costs' is meant both treatment costs and costs contributed by the patient and the patient's family. Costs contributed by patients and their families consist of out-of-pocket expenses, transportation costs, and time. Conclusions are that it is important to consider the perspective from which a study is carried out. Costs contributed by the patient and the patient's family have a high impact on total costs for children and younger adolescents but decrease with time as the adolescents get older. The present study shows an incremental cost-effectiveness of 2043 SEK (8.54 SEK = 1 US dollar, December 1999) per averted decayed enamel and dentine missing and filled surface (DeMFS), of which treatment costs represent 1337 SEK using the unit cost for a nurse. This means a yearly cost of approximately 334 SEK."

CD007868,0,1068439,0,[The falls not far from the tree. Occurrence of dental caries among 3 year-old children in relation to their parents' background].,"113 children 3 years of age, living in a rural community in Norway, were examined. 59% of the children were born in 1970 and examined in 1973, the remaining were born in 1971 and examined in 1974. The caries experience was described by caries scores based on 1 point for each decayed tooth and 2 points for each root. 51% of the children were caries-free, 26% had 1-4 caries scores, and 24% had 5 or more caries scores. The dental health of the children born in 1971 was better than that of children born in 1970, a finding which hardly could be ascribed to encreasing use of fluorides only. There was a significant association between the childrens' caries experience and their age at the examination, and particularly with their social background. The treatment pattern and the oral health habits of their parents, which in turn were dependent on social background, had conceivably an early and distinct influence on the dental health of their children."
CD007868,0,19345715,0,"Fluoride levels in various black tea, herbal and fruit infusions consumed in Turkey.","The fluoride contents were determined by ion-selective electrode in 26 black tea samples originally produced in Turkey, Sri Lanka, India and Kenya, and in 14 herbal and seven fruit infusions originated from Turkey. Fluoride content in black tea infusions ranged from 0.57 to 3.72 mg/L after 5 min of brewing. Higher fluoride levels were found in black teas originated from Turkey when compared with teas originated from Sri Lanka. Moreover higher fluoride levels were determined in black tea bags compared with granular and stick-shaped black teas. However, herbal and fruit infusions were characterized by low values of fluoride (0.02-0.04 mg/L) after 5 min of brewing and increasing brewing time to 10 min caused only slight increases in some infusions. As a result, consuming tea infusions prepared from some black tea available in Turkish market, especially black tea bags, in large quantities may lead to exposion to a high amount of fluoride which may cause dental fluorosis. Although fruit and herbal infusions are safer to consume their fluoride contents are too low for caries prevention. In countries such as Turkey where tea is traditionally consumed, the fluoride concentration and daily safety precautions should be indicated on tea products."

CD007868,0,19204390,0,"Fluoride retention in proximal plaque and saliva using two NaF dentifrices containing 5,000 and 1,450 ppm F with and without water rinsing.","A total of 26 healthy volunteers participated in this randomized 4-leg crossover study designed to measure fluoride (F) retention in interdental plaque and saliva. Two NaF dentifrices (5,000 and 1,450 ppm F) were used, with and without postbrushing water rinsing. The 4 tooth brushing methods were carried out twice a day during 2 weeks. Interdental plaque was collected from all proximal sites after each method, using dental floss. Immediately after the plaque sampling, the subjects were asked to brush their teeth with the same toothpaste and use the postbrushing water rinsing procedure as previously. Proximal saliva was collected from 4 interdental sites, using small paper points, before and up to 60 min after the brushing. The present study showed that the 5,000 ppm F toothpaste without postbrushing water rinsing resulted in the highest F concentration in both plaque and saliva and the 1,450 ppm F toothpaste with water rinsing in the lowest. The difference in the area under the curve of saliva F concentration versus time between the 2 methods was 4.2 times (p<0.001). The corresponding difference in F concentration per unit weight of plaque (n=16) was 2.75 times (p<0.05). Water rinsing immediately after tooth brushing with 5,000 ppm reduced the F concentration in saliva by 2.4 times (p<0.001). The difference in F values in saliva between 5,000/rinsing and 1,450/no rinsing was minor and not significant. The increase of F in both proximal saliva and plaque, using a dentifrice with 5,000 ppm F without postbrushing water rinsing, may be of clinical importance."
CD007868,0,20383545,0,Treatment of post-orthodontic white spot lesions with casein phosphopeptide-stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate.,"This study aims to investigate the effect of topical applications of 10% casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) on white spot lesions (WSL) detected after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances. Sixty healthy adolescents with ≥1 clinically visible WSL at debonding were recruited and randomly allocated to a randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups. The intervention group was instructed to topically apply a CPP-ACP -containing agent (Tooth Mousse, GC Europe) once daily and the subjects of the control group brushed their teeth with standard fluoride toothpaste. The intervention period was 4 weeks and the endpoints were quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) on buccal surfaces of the upper incisors, cuspids and first premolars and visual scoring from digital photos. The attrition rate was 15%, mostly due to technical errors, and 327 lesions were included in the final evaluation. A statistically significant (p < 0.05) regression of the WSL was disclosed in both study groups compared to baseline, but there was no difference between the groups. The mean area of the lesions decreased by 58% in the CPP-ACP group and 26% in the fluoride group (p = 0.06). The QLF findings were largely reflected by the clinical scores. No side effects were reported. Topical treatment of white spot lesions after debonding of orthodontic appliances with a casein phosphopeptide-stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate agent resulted in significantly reduced fluorescence and a reduced area of the lesions after 4 weeks as assessed by QLF. The improvement was however not superior to the ""natural"" regression following daily use of fluoride toothpaste."
