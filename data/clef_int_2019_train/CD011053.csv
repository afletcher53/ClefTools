CD011053,0,11928616,0,[Successful treatment of primary myelofibrosis with thrombocytosis during pregnancy with alfa-interferon].,"Primary myelofibrosis is predominantly a disease of old age, poor prognosis and no curable treatment. Thrombocytosis was observed in only 12% of patients. To our knowledge, there is only one reported case of a young woman with primary myelofibrosis who had a term pregnancy [1]. We report on a 29-year-old woman with thrombocytosis and medical history of two miscarriages in the last 2 years, the iirst at 30 weeks of gestation and the second at 27 weeks. Multiple placental infarctions were observed. She was without symptoms but with moderate splenomegaly 4.5 cm below left costal margin). The platelet count was 651 x 10(9)/L, WBC 7.2 x 10(9)/L with normal differential formula, and haemoglobin level 12 g/dl. Bone marrow biopsy showed fibrotic phase of primary myelofibrosis, with hyperplasia of megacaryocytes, decreased numbers of erythroid and granulocytic cells, and increased amounts of reticulin fibres. Cyctogenetic examination of the bone marrow showed normal female caryotype. Increased numbers of progenitors CFU-Mk, CFU-GM and BFU-E were observed in peripheral blood, and decreased numbers in bone marrow cultures. As the patient wished to become pregnant, the treatment with interferon-a (Roferon A) was started at a dose of 3 MU s.c., three times per week. The platelet count rapidly decreased at a level of 260-370 x 10(9)/L. The pregnancy was diagnosed 5 months later. At the 24 week of pregnancy, platelet count raised to 690 x 10(9)/l and the dose of interferon-a was augmented, 3 MU every day, until delivery. Foetal growth and placental circulation were monitored by serial ultrasonography. At the end of 34 weeks of pregnancy, it was noted that placental flow became insufficient, and after foetal lung maturity was stimulated with dexamethasone, Cesarean section was performed. Male baby was born, weighting 2000 g, with respiratory distress syndrome. This complication was successfully treated, and the child is now one year old, with normal growth and development. The mother is still on therapy with interferon-a, 3 MU, three times a week, and the last blood count was as follows: haemoglobin 10.7 g/dl, WBC 6.1 x 10(9)/L and platelet comt 437 x 10(9)/L. In conclusion, according to the clinical results of interferon-d in thrombocytosis and experimental studies which showed the absence of placental transfer of interferon-d, this therapy could be recommended to women with primary myelofibrosis who wish to have a baby."
CD011053,0,19217473,0,Diagnostic issues of VTE in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolism is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and accurate diagnostic workup upon suspicion of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in a pregnant woman is of utmost importance. The diagnostic repertoire for venous thromboembolism is, however, less well studied in pregnant women. The clinical assessment is influenced by common symptoms of pregnancy such as leg swelling or shortness of breath. The role of D-Dimer is limited, since - even during uncomplicated pregnancy - D-Dimer levels increase with gestational age. Preliminary data indicate that a normal D-Dimer in a healthy pregnant woman with a low clinical probability may exclude deep vein thrombosis. Compression ultrasonography and ventilation perfusion scanning or helical computed tomography are the imaging techniques of choice in a pregnant woman with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, respectively. The role of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy is uncertain and contraindications particularly to contrast media have to be considered."

CD011053,0,21742240,0,[Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism].,"Nowadays the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is based on a ""diagnostic strategy"" rather than a single test. The first step, after identifying patients with suspicion of PE, is to establish the pre-test clinical probability. Several scores are available to make a standardised and reproducible assessment of the clinical probability and these, therefore, represent valuable diagnostic tools. Indeed, it is the clinical probability that guides further investigation. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, PE can be safely ruled out by a negative D-dimer in approximately one-third of patients without additional imaging. In the case of a positive D-dimer or high clinical probability, CT pulmonary angiography is now the recommended imaging technique. However, lower limb venous compression ultrasound and ventilation/perfusion scans remain useful in patients with contraindications to CT; mainly those with renal insufficiency. In the presence of readily available and strongly validated diagnostic strategies, the challenge for the future will probably be better identification of patients in whom PE should be suspected."
CD011053,0,18845379,0,The visually-evoked cerebral blood flow response in women with a recent history of preeclampsia and/or eclampsia.,"Several studies provide evidence for altered cerebral hemodynamics during (pre)eclampsia. Whether (pre)eclampsia has a persistent negative impact on cerebral hemodynamics, possibly contributing to an elevated risk of premature stroke, is unknown. The aims of this study were (i) to refine and apply a control system-based method previously introduced by Rosengarten to quantify the visually-evoked blood flow response of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA); and (ii) to test the hypothesis with this method that cerebral hemodynamics in women with a recent history of (pre)eclampsia is abnormal relative to that in parous controls. Hereto, we recorded cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the PCA by transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography during cyclic visual stimulation in 15 former preeclamptics, 13 former eclamptics and 13 controls. The typical CBFV response was fitted with the step response of a second-order-linear model enabling quantification by parameters K (gain), zeta (damping), omega (natural frequency), T(v) (rate time) and T(d) (time delay). The method refinement introduced here consisted of response filtering before quantification and of considering the individual instead of group-averaged response patterns. Application of this refinement reduced the fitting errors (1.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.2 +/- 1.8, p < 0.01). Intergroup differences in model parameters were not found. Although statistically not significant, a trend was observed that critical damping (zeta>1) occurred more frequently in the combined group of former patients than in the controls (7 of 28 vs.1 of 13, p = 0.16). Critical damping (zeta>1) reflects an abnormal response, which is either compensated for by a rise in rate time (""intermediate""; zeta>1; T(v) > 20) or remains uncompensated (""sluggish""; zeta>1; T(v) < 20). Critical damping increased significantly (p = 0.039) with (pre-)eclampsia-to-test-interval in the PE+E patients with abnormal responses (zeta>1), suggesting that (pre)eclampsia might induce diminishing cerebral hemodynamic function over time. Based on a system-analytical classification approach, the data of this study provide evidence for individual CBFV responses to be abnormal in former (pre)eclamptics compared with controls. Further study is needed to reveal how the abnormal CBFV response classification reflects cerebrovascular dysfunction."

CD011053,0,23406997,0,Comparison of wavelet transform and time-domain analysis of second trimester uterine artery Doppler waveforms in screening for pre-eclampsia.,"The aim of this study was to compare time-domain waveform analysis of second-trimester uterine artery Doppler using the resistance index (RI) with waveform analysis using a mathematical tool known as wavelet transform for the prediction of pre-eclampsia (PE). This was a retrospective, nested case-cohort study of 336 women, 37 of whom subsequently developed PE. Uterine artery Doppler waveforms were analysed using both RI and waveform analysis. The utility of these indices in screening for PE was then evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. There were significant differences in uterine artery RI between the PE women and those with normal pregnancy outcome. After wavelet analysis, significant difference in the mean amplitude in wavelet frequency band 4 was noted between the 2 groups. The sensitivity for both Doppler RI and frequency band 4 for the detection of PE at a 10% false-positive rate was 45%. This small study demonstrates the application of wavelet transform analysis of uterine artery Doppler waveforms in screening for PE. Further prospective studies are needed in order to clearly define if this analytical approach to waveform analysis may have the potential to improve the detection of PE by uterine artery Doppler screening."
CD011053,0,16816883,0,Prenatal calcification of the inferior vena cava and renal veins in a normal neonate.,"Prenatal calcification of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and renal veins is a rare condition with unclear etiology and prognosis. It occurs with renal vein thrombosis in utero and is associated with congenital anomalies and abnormal prenatal hemodynamic status. We report a rare case of prenatal IVC and renal vein calcification in a normal neonate without any history of compromised prenatal or perinatal condition, or significant deterioration of kidney function."
CD011053,0,11084970,0,Prenatal diagnosis of a subdural hematoma associated with reverse flow in the middle cerebral artery: case report and literature review.,"To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a subdural hematoma, related to fetal autoimmune thrombocytopenia, diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound. The underlying etiology was hidden maternal autoimmune thrombocytopenia. This disease, which is as serious as alloimmune thrombocytopenia, causes severe fetal thrombocytopenia, which carries with it a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage and recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. Only 14 cases of fetal subdural hematomas have been reported in the literature. The etiologies of these cases were principally traumatic, or due to disorders of hemostasis. Their prognoses were generally poor, with 50% resulting in fetal death in utero and the remaining 50% demonstrating post-natal sequelae. The presence of reverse flow in the middle cerebral artery is rare and its association with a subdural hematoma unusual. Abnormalities found on cerebral Doppler studies indicate an adaptive response to a fetal condition for which the prognosis is then very poor. Monitoring fetuses at risk for hemorrhage by ultrasound imaging and Doppler studies enables us to detect indicators of a worsening prognosis before the ultrasound appearance of morphological hemorrhage. The development of intracranial hemorrhage raises difficult management issues during the index pregnancy and in subsequent pregnancies."

The mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis is complex and the predisposition to thrombus formation in pregnancy is probably the interaction of several different factors. Because of the risks of anticoagulant therapy, it is important to establish the diagnosis of thromboembolism before commencing treatment using venography and pulmonary angiography when necessary. When anticoagulants are used in pregnancy, coumarin derivatives can be used until 36 weeks and then substituted by heparin; alternatively heparin alone can be given throughout pregnancy. Subcutaneous heparin has no fetal effects and can be used successfully on an outpatient basis. Prevention is always better than cure, and it is essential that well-established preventive measures should be carried out diligently so that the incidence of this rare, but dreaded, complication can be reduced to an absolute minimum."

CD011053,0,13679666,0,"Thrombosis during pregnancy: risk factors, diagnosis and treatment.","Venous thromboembolism occurs infrequently but is a leading cause of illness and death during pregnancy and the puerperium and remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In the general population the incidence of pregnancy associated VTE has been estimated to vary from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 2000 deliveries. The risk of VTE is five times higher in a pregnant woman than in a nonpregnant woman of similar age. Postpartum VTE is more common than antepartum VTE. Women with congenital abnormalities or persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies have an increased risk of VTE during pregnancy and the puerperium. In individuals with well defined hereditary thrombosis risk factors, such as the factor V:R506Q mutation, the factor II:G20210A variation, antithrombin-deficiency or protein C-deficiency, a relative risk of pregnancy associated VTE between 3.4 and 15.2 has been found. Women with previous VTE have an approximately 3.5 fold increased risk of recurrent VTE during pregnancy compared to non-pregnant periods. Our ability to diagnose deep-vein thrombosis clinically is generally poor and is further hampered during pregnancy since dyspnea, tachypnea, swelling and discomfort in the legs are common. Objective diagnosis is essential for treatment decisions. Exposure to radiation of less than 50,000 microGy (5 rad) has not been associated with a significant risk of fetal injury. Therefore, besides sonography, routine diagnostic procedures should be performed, if clinically necessary. Heparin does not cross the placenta and is therefore the anticoagulant treatment of choice during pregnancy. In case of acute new onset of thrombosis during pregnancy, treatment is performed like in non-pregnant patients with acute deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. There is ongoing debate, whether or not pregnant women with previous venous thrombosis should routinely receive prophylactic anticoagulation. In patients who have hereditary antithrombin deficiency, antiphospholipid antibodies, a combined abnormality or a history of a severe thrombotic event (pulmonary embolism, extended deep vein thrombosis) should be advised to use prophylactic heparin during pregnancy, starting during the first trimester. Post partum prophylaxis should be given in all women with an increased risk for VTE."

We hypothesized that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), the precursor of endothelial cells, might be impaired in patients with PE and hold a great promise for the treatment of PE. In the present study, we analyzed the EPCs number and expression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in PE patients. We confirmed that both EPCs number and ILK expression were diminished in PE patients. Next, we transfected EPCs with ILK gene using ultrasonic microbubble technique (UMT) for the first time, as UMT is a novel type of gene transfer technology showing promising applications in stem cells apart from EPCs. To further investigate the transfection efficiency of UMT, RT-PCR analysis and western blot were used to examine the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level of ILK. After transfection of the ILK gene, EPCs function was tested to illustrate the role of ILK in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and secretion. The results of the in vitro study suggested that UMT, a novel gene delivery system, could be considered a potent physical method for EPCs transfection. Moreover, the growth and angiogenetic properties of EPCs are enhanced by introducing ILK. This study may afford a new trend for EPCs transfection and gene therapy in PE."

We document a previously unreported case of a 37-year-old female in whom APS was first manifested by infarction and cecal perforation following cesarean section. At laparotomy the underlying cause of colonic perforation was not clear and after resection of the affected bowel an ileo-colostomy was performed. The diagnosis of APS was established during post-operative hospital stay and the patient was commenced on warfarin. Eventually, she made a full recovery and had her stoma reversed after 4 mo. Pregnancy poses an increased risk of complications in women with APS and requires a more aggressive approach to the obstetric care.

In contrast with type A NPD, a severe neurodegenerative disease of infancy, type B NPD patients have little or no neurodegeneration, and frequently survive into adulthood. Although over 100 mutations have been found within the SMPD1 gene causing NPD, there was only one report about SMPD1 mutation status of a Korean NPD patient. We report a case of a 32-yr-old female, who presented with thrombocytopenia without any neurologic involvement. Hepatosplenomegaly was detected by both physical examination and imaging studies, and a thoracic radiograph examination showed a pattern of interstitial lung disease. Biochemical tests revealed increased liver enzymes, cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol, and decreased HDL-cholesterol. Sea-blue or foamy vacuolated histiocytes occurred in bone marrow and liver. Sequencing analysis of SMPD1 using genomic DNA from peripheral leukocytes identified a compound heterozygote of two mutations at exon 2: p.E246K and p.A357V. The former is a known mutation in an Italian patient, and the latter has not been reported yet. She has received oral rosuvastatin to treat hyperlipidemia at a dose of 10 mg per day for 4 months. This is the second report in which the mutation of SMPD1 gene was detected in a Korean NPD patient. The active genetic analysis of SMPD1 gene in patients with typical findings of type B NPD would enable us to facilitate diagnosis as well as to accumulate data on molecular characteristics of Korean NPD patients."

CD011053,0,21036031,0,Imaging evaluation of the pregnant patient with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism is the leading cause of maternal death in the developed world. The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is particularly challenging in pregnant patients as physiologic changes of pregnancy can mimic symptoms of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis. Clinical decision and imaging algorithms for venous thromboembolic disease have been proposed in the literature for the general population, but have not undergone wide-scale validation in pregnant patients. Laboratory evaluation of D-dimer levels has likewise been established as a viable screening method in the general population but remains controversial in pregnant patients. Regardless of whether D-dimer levels are used in this population, the clinician must often rely on imaging tests to confirm or exclude a clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism. Additional factors beyond test performance must be weighed during pregnancy: radiation exposure to the fetus and maternal breast tissue, the safety of intravenous contrast administration and the diagnostic accuracy of the various testing options so that diagnosis and proper management are not delayed. The epidemiology of pregnancy-related venous thromboembolic disease and the different diagnostic methods are reviewed, with emphasis on the pregnant patient.

CD011053,0,16719796,0,Neurovascular mechanisms of hypertension in pregnancy.,"Normal pregnancy is associated with significant changes in the neuronal and vascular control mechanisms of blood pressure (BP). Preeclampsia (PE) is a major complication of pregnancy characterized by proteinuria, and increased vascular resistance and BP. If untreated, PE leads to eclampsia with serious seizures and severe hypertension. However, the neurovascular mechanisms of hypertension in pregnancy and PE are unclear. Studies in animal models of hypertension in pregnancy suggest that inadequate cytotrophoblast invasion of uterine spiral arteries causes reduction in uteroplacental perfusion pressure leading to placental ischemia/hypoxia. Placental ischemia may promote the release of biologically active factors such as cytokines and reactive oxygen species. These circulating factors may increase the vascular permeability, cross the blood-brain barrier, and affect the sympathetic tone and the neuronal control mechanisms of BP. Placental factors could also cause endothelial cell dysfunction and inhibit nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), prostacyclin (PGI(2))-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and hyperpolarizing factor vascular relaxation pathways. Additionally, placental factors may induce endothelium-derived contracting factors such as endothelin, thromboxane and angiotensin II, which stimulate Ca(2+)-dependent vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction or increase protein kinase C activity and enhance myofilament sensitivity to intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). The increased sympathetic tone combined with systemic decrease in endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and enhanced VSM contraction may contribute to the increased vascular resistance and BP associated with PE. The hypertensive state in severe PE may weaken the blood-brain barrier and precipitate convulsions and cerebral hemorrhage. Careful monitoring of maternal neuronal, endothelial, and VSM function during pregnancy should circumvent the life-threatening neurovascular complications of PE-eclampsia."

Most cases reported in the literature have occurred in patients with indwelling central venous catheters, in association with head and neck sepsis, or in hypercoagulable states. However, a small number of cases have been associated with in vitro fertilization and more often with the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). We report the case of a 30-year-old woman heterozygous for both the prothrombin 3' UTR mutation and for the factor V Leiden mutation who presented with a proximal deep vein thrombosis following in vitro fertilization. She subsequently developed an internal jugular vein thrombosis extending into the subclavian and axillary vein despite therapeutic anticoagulation with a low molecular weight heparin. Thromboembolic events can occur in the absence of other clinical features of OHSS, especially in patients with underlying prothrombotic abnormalities. Neck pain and swelling in a pregnant woman, especially one that has undergone in vitro fertilization, should be taken seriously and investigated with duplex scanning and/or MRI. Women with a personal or family history of thrombosis undergoing in vitro fertilization should be made fully aware of the potential thrombotic risks and should be considered for a thrombophilia screen."

CD011053,0,16908622,0,"Probable intrafamilial transmission of coxsackievirus b3 with vertical transmission, severe early-onset neonatal hepatitis, and prolonged viral RNA shedding.","Here we report a familial cluster of 3 cases of coxsackievirus B3 infection: a recent history of illness in a woman's 3-year-old son with a coxsackievirus B3-positive stool culture indicated that he probably infected his mother at home during her last week of pregnancy. Consequently, she delivered an infected neonate who developed severe hepatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and bilateral intracranial hemorrhage. The neonate remained well for the first 2 days of life. On the third day, he developed fever (39 degrees C) and poor peripheral circulation. On the fourth day, he developed petechiae and bruises over his chest wall and extremities, and prolonged bleeding was observed over venipuncture sites. Investigations revealed severe thrombocytopenia (platelets: 41 x 10(9)/L) and a markedly deranged coagulation profile (prothrombin time: 19 seconds [reference: < 10 seconds]; activated partial thromboplastin time: > 120 seconds [reference: 24.2-37.0 seconds], serum D-dimers: 6722 ng/mL [reference: < 500 ng/mL]), suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Clinical examination revealed yellow sclera, hepatomegaly (5 cm), and splenomegaly (2 cm), consistent with hepatitis. Serial chest radiographs showed bilateral pleural effusions, and an ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrated ascites. An echocardiogram showed normal cardiac structure and good contractility of both ventricles. However, a cranial ultrasound revealed bilateral grade 2 intraventricular hemorrhages. Serum C-reactive protein increased to 33.9 mg/L. Liver-function tests were also markedly deranged at this time, with maximum values for serum alanine transferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and ammonia concentration of 1354 IU/L, 258 micromol/L, 189 IU/L, and 147 micromol/L, respectively. Serum glucose levels were normal. Over the next 3 days, his fever subsided, and his liver function and clotting profile normalized by day 13 after onset of illness. A stool sample from the older brother, collected 14 days after his onset of illness at home, was positive for coxsackievirus B3 by both virus culture and enterovirus reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. He had neutralizing coxsackievirus B3 antibody titers of 1:2560 and 1:1280 on days 14 and 28 after his onset of illness, respectively. No virus was cultured from the mother's stool sample, collected 5 days after her onset of illness, but the enterovirus polymerase chain reaction was positive and maternal sera neutralized the coxsackievirus B3 isolated from the neonate. The maternal sera also showed a more than fourfold rise in antibody titer from 1:80 to 1:640 on days 5 and 16 after her onset of illness, respectively. Neonatal antibody titers also showed a more than fourfold rise from < 1:80 to 1:2560 on days 1 and 21 after his onset of illness, respectively. This demonstrates that both the mother and the neonate had had recent coxsackievirus B3 infections. Serially collected neonatal throat swab and stool samples were culture negative for enterovirus by 4 and 8 days after his onset of illness, respectively. However, enterovirus RNA remained detectable by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in these samples for considerably longer, only becoming undetectable by 16, 23, and 41 days after his onset of illness. We show that even mild household infections may have potentially serious consequences for pregnant women and their infants."
CD011053,0,8345156,0,[Endoscopic surgery during pregnancy. A case report of cholecystectomy].,"Pregnancy used to be considered a contraindication for endoscopic surgery of the digestive tract. We report a case of cholecystectomy carried out laparoscopically for complicated gall stones in a woman who was 14 weeks pregnant. There was no post-operative maternal or fetal morbidity. The mother carried on the pregnancy to term normally and gave birth to a normal infant. The same results have been reported in the literature for three other cases of cholecystectomy and six of appendicectomy. The sole technical precautions that had to be undertaken were in introducing and placing the trocars, taking into account the size of the uterus. There has been no scientific proof that CO2 is toxic for the fetus. Clinical practice shows that endoscopic surgery is possible without any obstetrical risk including thrombo-emboli, nor specific sepsis occurring in any of the three trimesters of pregnancy. The advantages of the endoscopic approach are that there is less post-operative pain and therefore less need to take analgesics. There are no complications because of an abdominal wound and the patient can both feed and walk about immediately after the operation with a reduction of the time spent in hospital. There is probably less risk of aborting when compared with classical laparotomy. The endoscopic route can be chosen when surgery is needed in the digestive tract during pregnancy."
CD011053,0,21856225,0,Left-ventricular non-compaction with congenital left ventricular diverticulum.,"Left-ventricular non-compaction may be isolated or associated with other cardiac or noncardiac anomalies. Left-ventricular non-compaction associated with left ventricular diverticulum is very rare. We describe a 30 year-old pregnant woman with a long standing diagnosis of biventricular non-compaction in whom a hidden left ventricular apical diverticulum was detected on transthoracic echocardiography. Both these conditions increase the risk of thromboembolism. Additionally, she was also diagnosed to have endocervical adenocarcinoma. This case suggests that a comprehensive echocardiographic examination is mandatory in cases of suspected isolated left-ventricular non-compaction to detect any other associated cardiac or noncardiac anomalies."
CD011053,0,22197626,0,Review: Biochemical markers to predict preeclampsia.,"Worldwide the prevalence of preeclampsia (PE) ranges from 3 to 8% of pregnancies. 8.5 million cases are reported yearly, but this is probably an underestimate due to the lack of proper diagnosis. PE is the most common cause of fetal and maternal death and yet no specific treatment is available. Reliable biochemical markers for prediction and diagnosis of PE would have a great impact on maternal health and several have been suggested. This review describes PE biochemical markers in general and first trimester PE biochemical markers specifically. The main categories described are angiogenic/anti-angiogenic factors, placental proteins, free fetal hemoglobin (HbF), kidney markers, ultrasound and maternal risk factors. The specific biochemical markers discussed are: PAPP-A, s-Flt-1/PlGF, s-Endoglin, PP13, cystatin-C, HbF, and Œ±‚ÇÅ-microglobulin (A1M). PAPP-A and HbF both show potential as predictive biochemical markers in the first trimester with 70% sensitivity at 95% specificity. However, PAPP-A is not PE-specific and needs to be combined with Doppler ultrasound to obtain the same sensitivity as HbF/A1M. Soluble Flt -1 and PlGF are promising biochemical markers that together show high sensitivity from the mid-second trimester. PlGF is somewhat useful from the end of the first trimester. Screening pregnant women with biochemical markers for PE can reduce unnecessary suffering and health care costs by early detection of mothers at increased risk for PE, thus avoiding unnecessary hospitalization of pregnant women with suspect or mild PE and enabling monitoring of the progression of the disease thereby optimizing time for delivery and hopefully reducing the number of premature births."

CD011053,0,18025513,0,Imaging the pregnant patient for nonobstetric conditions: algorithms and radiation dose considerations.,"Use of diagnostic imaging studies for evaluation of pregnant patients with medical conditions not related to pregnancy poses a persistent and recurring dilemma. Although a theoretical risk of carcinogenesis exists, there are no known risks for development of congenital malformations or mental retardation in a fetus exposed to ionizing radiation at the levels typically used for diagnostic imaging. An understanding of the effects of ionizing radiation on the fetus at different gestational stages and the estimated exposure dose received by the fetus from various imaging modalities facilitates appropriate choices for diagnostic imaging of pregnant patients with nonobstetric conditions. Other aspects of imaging besides radiation (ie, contrast agents) also carry potential for fetal injury and must be taken into consideration. Imaging algorithms based on a review of the current literature have been developed for specific nonobstetric conditions: pulmonary embolism, acute appendicitis, urolithiasis, biliary disease, and trauma. Imaging modalities that do not use ionizing radiation (ie, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging) are preferred for pregnant patients. If ionizing radiation is used, one must adhere to the principle of using a dose that is as low as reasonably achievable after a discussion of risks versus benefits with the patient."
CD011053,0,11411754,0,Pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension.,"Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is estimated to affect 7% to 10% of all pregnancies in the United States. Despite being the leading cause of maternal death and a major contributor of maternal and perinatal morbidity, the mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of PIH have not yet been fully elucidated. Studies during the past decade, however, have provided a better understanding of the potential mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of PIH. The initiating event in PIH appears to be reduced uteroplacental perfusion as a result of abnormal cytotrophoblast invasion of spiral arterioles. Placental ischemia is thought to lead to widespread activation/dysfunction of the maternal vascular endothelium that results in enhanced formation of endothelin and thromboxane, increased vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II, and decreased formation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The quantitative importance of the various endothelial and humoral factors in mediating the reduction in renal hemodynamic and excretory function and elevation in arterial pressure during PIH is still unclear. Investigators are also attempting to elucidate the placental factors that are responsible for mediating activation/dysfunction of the maternal vascular endothelium. Microarray analysis of genes within the ischemic placenta should provide new insights into the link between placental ischemia and hypertension. More effective strategies for the prevention of preeclampsia should be forthcoming once the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that are involved in PIH are completely understood."

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of uterine autotransplantation in a porcine model using microvascular anastomoses. Eight large white/landrace sows of proven fertility were used. A supracervical hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) was performed. After 1 hour of cold storage in a transplant solution, the specimen was reintroduced and followed by stepwise vascular reanastomosis. Objective perfusion index measurements suggested adequate uterine perfusion after transplantation. Postoperatively, sow 1 survived to 3 months with no signs of oestrus, and sows 2, 6, and 8 were killed on days 6, 33, and 54, respectively, for pelvic infection. Histopathology of the uterine grafts revealed gradual vessel thromboses.

A variety of neurological symptoms may occur in association with the disease, including movement disorders. We report on a 79 year old woman with an unremarkable past medical history who progressively developed psychomotor agitation and insomnia through a period of four months, followed by an acute onset complex hyperkinetic syndrome with chorea, focal left foot dystonia, oral dyskinesias and severe speech impairment. Brain MRI showed multiple subcortical lesions without basal ganglia involvement, and a large cortical lesion in the left posterior temporal lobe that appeared to be ischemic. These findings along with a strongly elevated titer of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I antibodies and positive Lupus Anticoagulant (LAC) suggested a diagnosis of Antiphospholipid Syndrome, confirmed 14 weeks later as a Primary syndrome. The autoimmune mechanisms possibly responsible for the patient's clinical picture are discussed. This case underlines the importance of taking into account APS as a cause of unusual movement disorders even in elderly patients without evidence of previous thrombotic events."

CD011053,0,9759911,0,"Antepartum fetal intracranial hemorrhage, predisposing factors and prenatal sonography: a review.","Our objective was to review current literature pertaining to antepartum fetal intracranial hemorrhage. To this goal we selected all manuscripts published in the English language regarding this topic obtained from a MEDLINE search for 1966 through January 1998. Additional sources were identified through cross-referencing. Antenatal fetal intracranial hemorrhage may occur spontaneously, or occur in association with various maternal or fetal conditions. Predisposing maternal conditions at risk for this occurrence include alloimmune and idiopathic thrombocytopenia, von Willebrand's disease, specific medications (warfarin) or illicit drug (cocaine) abuse, seizures, severe abdominal trauma inflicting subsequent fetal injury, amniocentesis, cholestasis of pregnancy and febrile disease. Predisposing fetal conditions include congenital factor-X and factor-V deficiencies, hemorrhage into various congenital tumors, twin-twin transfusion, demise of a co-twin, or fetomaternal hemorrhage. Currently, antepartum fetal intracranial hemorrhage may be diagnosed by imaging techniques including ultrasonography and less frequently, magnetic resonance imaging. Early real-time sonographic signs of intracranial hemorrhage consist of irregular echogenic patterns representing the associated hematoma that may clearly distort normal intracranial structures. Recent reports have suggested Doppler flow velocimetry and color Doppler imaging as additional tools in detecting fetal intracranial hemorrhage. Various types of antenatal fetal intracranial hemorrhages that have been visualized sonographically include intraventricular, periventricular, subependymal, parenchymal, subdural, and intracerebellar events. Active hemorrhages may be associated with fetal distress manifested by fetal heart rate changes. Infrequently, antenatal ultrasonographic depiction of intracranial hemorrhage may precede devastating sequelae such as hydrocephalus, hydranencephaly, porencephaly, or microcephaly. Due to the significant associated neonatal neurological impairment and potential medicolegal implications of antepartum fetal intracranial hemorrhage, it follows that obstetricians and sonographers should be familiar with predisposing factors and typical diagnostic imaging findings of these events."

CD011053,0,23318541,0,[Adult patients with congenital heart disease].,"Unlike a few decades ago, today most patients with congenital heart disease reach adulthood after intervention or reparative surgery. As complete correction is generally not possible, a patient population with great complexity and a particular challenge to medical management is rising and a regular follow-up is mandatory. The aim of care is the timely recognition of residual or associated problems. Frequency and intensity of follow-up examinations depend on type and complexity of the lesion. The standard repertoire at follow-up consists of a specific history, clinical examination, ECG, Holter-monitoring, exercise tests, and echocardiography. Depending on the indication, cardio-MRI, CT scan, and sophisticated cardiac catheterization may become necessary. Long-term complications like rhythm disturbances, pulmonary hypertension, or heart failure are frequent, despite optimal care. Acute complications like arrhythmias, infective endocarditis, cerebral events, cerebral abscesses, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding have to be recognized early and treated appropriately. Additional focus has to be placed on counseling and management of noncardiac disease and surgery, pregnancy and delivery, exercise at work and in private life, driving, and insurance issues.

Less invasive methods are feasible with ultrasound fetal assessment for alpha-thalassaemia, analysis of circulating fetal nucleic acid in maternal plasma, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. Women with thalassaemia major and intermedia are at risk of various maternal complications, such as cardiac failure, alloimmunisation, viral infection, thrombosis, endocrine and bone disturbances. Therefore, it is prudent to adhere to a standard management plan in this group of pregnant women.

CD011053,0,9089782,0,Serotonin-induced vasoconstriction is mediated by thromboxane release and action in the human fetal-placental circulation.,"The possibility that prostanoids mediate the contractile response of serotonin on placental vessels was investigated. Rings of chorionic plate arteries and veins with and without endothelium were suspended in an organ bath for recording isometric mechanically activity. Serotonin caused dose-dependent contractions that were significantly attenuated by indomethacin (cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, 10 microM) and SQ29,548 (thromboxane receptor antagonist, 1 microM). Pretreatment of placental venous and arterial rings with indomethacin decreased sensitivity (EC50) to serotonin of 2.3- and 1.9-fold, respectively. Pretreatment with SQ29,548 decreased sensitivity to serotonin of twofold in veins and 2.1-fold in arteries. In the endothelium-denuded placental arteries and veins, pretreatment with indomethacin and SQ29,548 reduced the serotonin-induced contraction in a similar way to that obtained in the endothelium-intact vessels. In isolated perfused cotyledon through the fetal circulation, serotonin caused a significant increase in perfusion pressure and stimulated thromboxane release 1.9-fold compared with basal values. Therefore, serotonin-induced vasoconstriction in the human fetoplacental circulation appears to be mediated in part by thromboxane release or action. This effect is not dependent on mediators released from the endothelium. The present study provides evidence for the participation of thromboxane A2 in the contractile response to serotonin in the human placental circulation. The ability of serotonin to release thromboxane A2 which is also a potent vasoconstrictor agent, may be important in increase fetoplacental resistance, one of the features of pre-eclampsia."

There was a significant difference in the incidence of both early (4.1% vs 8.8%) and late miscarriages (1.1% vs 2.3%) in group A than in group B, respectively. There were no differences between both groups as regards the occurrence of pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, caesarean delivery, intra-partum bleeding or ecchymosis at operative wounds. There were no differences in most of the neonatal values between both groups. However, the mean birth weight was significantly higher in group A. LMWH seems to be a safe drug and effective in significantly reducing the incidence of recurrent miscarriages of unknown aetiology when given in the first trimester and continued throughout pregnancy."

Angiomyolipoma in a 31-year-old woman was incidentally found by ultrasonography. CT scan revealed a fat-containing tumor in the right kidney with 4 cm in diameter. The patient was followed at outpatient clinic without any treatment. Fifteen months later, the post-delivery follow-up CT scan showed that tumor size had grown up to 11 cm in diameter. Although laparoscopic right nephrectomy was tried, open transperitoneal right nephrectomy was performed because the tumor thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava was found during the laparoscopic procedure. Pathological diagnosis was angiomyolipoma of the kidney. There are several reports that indicate angiomyolipoma grows rapidly during pregnancy. Our case demonstrates that careful follow-up is required for angiomyolipoma in women with possible conception and delivery."

CD011053,0,17108202,0,PLAC1 mRNA in maternal blood correlates with Doppler waveform in uterine arteries in normal pregnancies at the second and third trimester.,"Doppler analysis of the uterine arteries is currently used for pre-eclampsia (PE) screening. PLAC1 is a trophoblast-specific gene, and it is known that in normal pregnancies, trophoblastic cells are released into the maternal circulation, where specific trophoblastic mRNA can be detected. In PE, as in women who eventually develop PE, an abnormal passage of fetal and placental cells is also present. In this study, we aimed to verify whether, in normal pregnancies, Doppler waveform of the uterine arteries correlates with PLAC1 mRNA concentrations. Thirteen cases of normal pregnancies at 37 weeks' gestation (23-41) were enrolled in the study. PLAC1 mRNA was extracted from 2 mL of blood by ABI PRISM 6100 nucleic acid Prep Station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed by a PE 5700 Sequence detection system. Bulk RNA from normal placental tissue was used as the reference curve, and the amount of PLAC1 mRNA in the study samples was then expressed as the ""relative amount"" of weight of placental tissue (ng/mL). The uterine arterial mean resistance index (RI) and presence/absence of a dicrote waveform were calculated by using a 5 MHz transabdominal probe (Tecnos, ESAOTE) at the uterine cervico-corporal junction. Doppler measurement was performed on the same day as blood collection. The median of the means of uterine arterial RI was 0.52 (0.39-0.68). RI of uterine arteries and PLAC1 mRNA were significantly correlated in a log-linear regression (R(2) = 0.483, P = 0.024). Our data support that in normal pregnancy, the passage of trophoblast material into the maternal circulation is correlated with the quantitative measurement of uterine hemodynamics."
CD011053,0,11927739,0,Peroneal nerve palsy: a complication of umbilical artery catheterization in the full-term newborn of a mother with diabetes.,"Umbilical artery catheters are an essential aid in the treatment of newborn infants who have cardiopulmonary disease. However, it is well-known that umbilical artery catheterization is associated with complications. The most frequent visible problem in an umbilical line is blanching or cyanosis of part or all of a distal extremity or the buttock area resulting from either vasospasm or a thrombotic or embolic incidence. Ischemic necrosis of the gluteal region is a rare complication of umbilical artery catheterization. We report the case of a full-term infant of an insulin-dependent diabetic mother with poor blood glucose control who developed a left peroneal nerve palsy after ischemic necrosis of the gluteal region after umbilical artery catheterization. The infant was born weighing 5050 g. The mother of the infant had preexisting diabetes mellitus that was treated with insulin from the age of 14 years. The metabolic control of the mother had been unstable both before and during the pregnancy. The neonate developed respiratory distress syndrome soon after birth and was immediately transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. Mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube was quickly considered necessary after rapid pulmonary deterioration. Her blood glucose levels were 13 mg/dL. A 3.5-gauge umbilical catheter was inserted into the left umbilical artery for blood sampling without difficulty when the infant required 100% oxygen to maintain satisfactory arterial oxygen pressure. Femoral pulses and circulation in the lower limbs were normal immediately before and after catheterization. A radiograph, which was taken immediately, showed the tip of the catheter to be at a level between the fourth and fifth sacral vertebrae. The catheter was removed immediately. Circulation and femoral pulses were normal and no blanching of the skin was observed. Another catheter was repositioned and the tip was confirmed radiologically to be in the thoracic aorta between the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae. The catheter was continuously flushed with heparinized solution. Three days after umbilical arterial catheterization, bruising was observed over the left gluteal region. The catheter was immediately removed despite its correct position. Over the next few days, the bruised skin and underlying tissues became necrotic. The area affected was 3 x 4 cm in diameter, with central necrosis surrounded by a rim of dark, red skin, which, in turn, was sharply demarcated from normal skin by a narrow, pale zone. Surgical excision of the gluteal necrosis was performed, but a deep ulcer 3 cm in diameter was left. The gluteal ulcer required 1 month to heal completely with extensive scar tissue formation. Throughout this period, the infant showed active movements in all of her limbs. At 4 weeks of age deterioration of all movement below the left knee with a dropping foot was observed. Severe peroneal nerve palsy was confirmed through nerve conduction studies, and there was electromyographic evidence of degeneration of the muscles supplied by the peroneal branch of the sciatic nerve. A Doppler study, which was also conducted, revealed no vascular damage. Treatment with physiotherapy and night-splinting of the left ankle was instituted. Repeated examination and nerve conduction tests at 3 months showed slow improvement with the left peroneal nerve remaining nonexcitable. At the time of this writing, the infant is 6 months old, and muscular strength below the left knee is still weak and atrophic changes in the form of muscle-wasting are already present. The rest of her motor development is normal. In our case, gangrene of the buttocks and sciatic nerve palsy followed displacement of the tip of the catheter into the inferior gluteal artery, a main branch of the internal iliac artery supplying the gluteus maximus, the overlying skin, and the sciatic nerve. The gangrenous changes were probably caused by vascular occlusion resulting from catheter-induced vasospasm of the inferior gluteal artery. Sciatic nerve palsy associated with umbilical artery catheterization has been postulated to be caused by vascular occlusion of the inferior gluteal artery. Infants of diabetic mothers may exhibit changes in coagulation factors and be at increased risk of thrombotic complications in utero and postnatally. In addition, maternal diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased incidence of congenital abnormalities, the incidence of which is 3 to 5 times higher than that among nondiabetic mothers. Although no particular or specific abnormalities have been associated with maternal disabilities, abnormalities of the cardiovascular system, including the development of umbilical vessels, frequently occur. This complication of umbilical artery catheterization has not been widely reported. We describe the first case that refers to gluteal gangrene and peroneal nerve palsy after umbilical artery catheterization of a newborn infant of a diabetic mother with poor blood glucose control. It should be noted that there were no contributing factors except that of the displacement of the catheter into the inferior gluteal artery. We speculate that the displacement of the tip of the catheter, with no difficulty in the present case, was associated with the maldevelopment of normal branching patterns of arteries after exposure of the fetus to hyperglycemia. In conclusion, umbilical artery catheterization is possibly associated with vascular occlusion, particularly in infants of diabetic mothers. Frequent inspection after the procedure has been performed is of the utmost importance especially in these neonates who often suffer from cardiopulmonary disease and require catheterization of their umbilical artery."

CD011053,0,2530267,0,The effects of prostacyclin and thromboxane analogue (U46619) on the fetal circulation and umbilical flow velocity waveforms.,"In placental insufficiency and pre-eclampsia the relative production rates of prostacyclin and thromboxane by the placenta and umbilical vessels are altered and the Doppler umbilical flow velocity waveform shows a high resistance pattern. To investigate the control of umbilical placental blood flow by those eicosanoids either prostacyclin (10 micrograms/min), or the thromboxane analogue U46619 (10 ng/min) was infused into the distal aorta of 12 chronically catheterized fetal lambs at day 125. Thromboxane produced a rise in mean arterial pressure and a rise in the systolic diastolic ratio of the umbilical artery flow waveform (2.6 to 3.1; P less than 0.05). Umbilical blood flow did not change and there was no evidence of altered flow to other organs. Prostacyclin caused a fall in fetal mean arterial pressure and a decrease in the umbilical artery systolic diastolic ratio (2.9 to 2.4; P less than 0.05). Prostacyclin produced a three-fold increase in lung perfusion (and the onset of fetal breathing movements) and this was associated with a 90% reduction in muscle blood flow (hindlimb muscle flow reduced from 12.5 to 1.1 ml.min-1 100g-1; P less than 0.01). We conclude that the local release of thromboxane in the fetal placental vascular bed could account for the rise in systolic diastolic ratio seen in umbilical placental insufficiency."

CD011053,0,2255222,0,Selected neurologic complications of pregnancy.,"Many neurologic disorders, such as eclampsia, pseudotumor cerebri, stroke, obstetric nerve palsies, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumors, and choriocarcinoma, can develop in the pregnant patient. Maternal mortality from eclampsia, which ranges from 0 to 14%, can be due to intracerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, abruptio placentae, or failure of the liver or kidneys. Associated fetal mortality ranges from 10 to 28% and is directly related to decreased placental perfusion. Pseudotumor cerebri can be associated with serious visual complications; thus, the therapeutic goal is to prevent loss of vision. The risk of stroke in the pregnant patient is 13 times the risk in the nonpregnant patient of the same age. The major causes of stroke in pregnant patients are arterial occlusion and cerebral venous thrombosis. Lumbar disk prolapse is common in pregnant patients, and lumbosacral plexus injuries can occur during labor or delivery. In addition, peripheral nerve compression or entrapment syndromes are thought to be caused by the retention of fluid during pregnancy. The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage during pregnancy is 1 in every 10,000 patients, a rate 5 times higher than in nonpregnant women. Because of a proliferation of prolactin-secreting cells, the pituitary gland can enlarge dramatically during pregnancy, a change that can disclose a previously unknown tumor or cause a known pituitary tumor to become symptomatic. The incidence of choriocarcinoma is 1 in 50,000 full-term pregnancies but 1 in 30 molar pregnancies. This malignant tumor has a high rate of cerebral metastatic lesions. In addition to these disorders that develop during pregnancy, the pregnant state can affect numerous preexisting neurologic conditions, including epilepsy, headaches, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, spinal cord injury, and brain tumors. We discuss advice for patients with such conditions who wish to become pregnant, recommendations for medical and surgical management, and surgical considerations for neurologic complications during pregnancy."

The appearance of thromboemboli is the indication to the long time heparin treatment and according to other authors even to the surgery. In some cases implantation of the special filter to the inferior vena cava is necessary to prevent the pulmonary embolism. The worst form of thrombosis-phlegmasia cerulea dolens is the absolute indication to surgery. Pregnancy at patients with previous reconstructions in the aorto-iliac segment needs frequent examination of fetus and blood flow in the graft to avoid many dangerous complications. At pregnant women with peripheral vessels diseases examination using color ultrasonic doppler is method of choice. In some cases pregnancy should be treated as a high risk pregnancy and should remain under obstetrician and vascular surgeon care.

CD011053,0,12393666,0,How we manage venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.,"During pregnancy, physiologic and anatomic changes can complicate the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as the management of patients with a high risk of or established VTE. As in nonpregnant subjects, clinical diagnosis of VTE by itself is unreliable and accurate objective testing is essential. Few diagnostic studies of VTE have been performed in pregnant women and, therefore, approaches are largely extrapolated from those used in nonpregnant subjects with modifications to limit the radiation exposure and overcome the limitations of diagnostic testing in pregnancy. Therapy of established VTE during pregnancy consists of therapeutic doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), generally given throughout pregnancy subcutaneously and for 4 to 6 weeks after childbirth. A key unresolved issue includes the optimum dosing of LMWH therapy. Maternal warfarin can be safely used after childbirth because it is safe to use in the breast-fed infant of a mother receiving warfarin. Finally, pregnant women with prior VTE (with or without a hypercoagulable state) have an increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis. A recent study has demonstrated that for women with a single episode of prior VTE, many can be managed without anticoagulants. However, for many, anticoagulant therapy with prophylactic UFH or LMWH is a reasonable option."

This article discusses the common abnormalities of the placenta and highlights some correlative pathological processes, which will serve to enhance the reader's understanding of sonographic findings. A practical approach is presented with respect to assessment of the hypoechoic lesion, placental infarction, thick placenta, placenta previa, abruption, placenta accreta, and placental tumors."
CD011053,0,20885297,0,Targeted ultrasound is the procedure of choice for detecting rudimentary branchial cysts causing jugular and subclavian vein thrombosis.,"The aim of this study was to facilitate the imaging diagnosis of branchial cysts leading to combined jugular and subclavian vein thrombosis during ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Three women developed combined jugular and subclavian vein thrombosis following OHSS related to assisted reproductive technologies. The imaging modalities used for diagnosis were a bimode Doppler ultrasound, MRI of the neck in two women, computed tomography (CT) angiography and venography in one. Targeted ultrasound identified the rudimentary cysts in all patients, whereas CT angiography performed with contrast material failed to detect the cyst, which resembled a vessel with thrombus in the lumen. MRI performed at the same level did detect the cyst; however, MRI of the neck requires special attention using a dedicated cystic protocol at the base of the neck. Venography was performed in one patient; it demonstrated the thrombosed vein possibly with some extrinsic compression, but it could not define a cyst. Targeted ultrasound is the simplest and best imaging modality for discerning rudimentary cysts in pregnant women with OHSS who present with jugular and subclavian vein thrombosis following assisted reproductive technology. A search for the cyst at the time of OHSS is important, as early detection could decrease the risk of developing thrombosis."
CD011053,0,2749594,0,Risks to the fetus of radiologic procedures used in the diagnosis of maternal venous thromboembolic disease.,"The diagnosis of suspected venous thromboembolic disease during pregnancy is problematic because of the fear of fetal irradiation with routine diagnostic procedures. In order to develop rational guidelines, we have calculated levels of radiation exposure to the fetus for the common diagnostic procedures and conducted a literature review to examine the fetal risks associated with these levels of radiation. A small increase in the relative risk of childhood cancer is suggested by a literature review of outcomes following low dose (less than 5 rads), in utero radiation exposure. With careful use of the available procedures, a diagnosis of venous thrombosis is possible with fetal radiation exposure of less than 0.50 rads and a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is possible with fetal radiation exposure of less than 0.05 rads. The risk of such exposure is small, both in relative and absolute terms."
CD011053,0,20823267,0,Thrombocytopenia in mice lacking the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain of the Ets transcription factor Fli1.,"Targeted disruption of the Fli1 gene results in embryonic lethality. To dissect the roles of functional domains in Fli1, we recently generated mutant Fli1 mice that express a truncated Fli1 protein (Fli1(ŒîCTA)) that lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory (CTA) domain. Heterozygous Fli1(ŒîCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ŒîCTA)/Fli1(ŒîCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ŒîCTA)/Fli1(ŒîCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ŒîCTA)/Fli1(ŒîCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed. Collectively, these data showed for the first time a hemostatic defect associated with the loss of a specific functional domain of the transcription factor Fli1 and suggest previously unknown in vivo roles in megakaryocytic cell differentiation."
CD011053,0,3348242,0,Echocardiographic recognition of pulmonary arterial disease and determination of its cause.,"Echocardiography provided the initial diagnosis of significant pulmonary hypertension, unrelated to left heart pathologic conditions, in 10 patients: four with acute pulmonary embolism; five with chronic pulmonary hypertension, primary in three patients and secondary to tumor emboli in the other two patients; and one with Eisenmenger's syndrome due to previously unsuspected atrial septal defects. Referral diagnoses were pericardial disease in five patients (including three with suspected tamponade), and right ventricular infarction versus pericarditis, atrial septal defect, dyspnea, inferoposterior infarction (by electrocardiography), and Ebstein's malformation in one patient each. The echocardiographic diagnoses were confirmed by lung scan (ventilation/perfusion mismatches were interpreted as high probability for pulmonary emboli in all four patients considered to have acute pulmonary emboli by echocardiographic study), pulmonary angiography (one patient), cardiac catheterization (four patients), and autopsy (three patients). No patient had evident aortic or mitral valvular, myocardial, or other left heart pathologic condition. In acute pulmonary embolism, mean right ventricular diameter was increased at 4.2 cm (range 3.2 to 6 cm) and right ventricular wall thickness was normal (mean 4.5 mm, range 3 to 5 mm). Moderate or marked right ventricular hypokinesis was noted in two patients each. Doppler examination, performed in three patients, revealed tricuspid regurgitation in all, with an increased flow velocity suggestive of mild to moderate systolic pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular minus right atrial pressures of 28 to 36 mm Hg). Patients with chronic pulmonary hypertension also had right ventricular dilatation (mean 4.4 cm diameter, range 3 to 5.4 cm) and hypokinesis (marked in four and moderate in one patient), but wall thickness was increased in all (mean of 9 mm, range 6 to 14 mm) and the flow velocities in the tricuspid regurgitant jets, detected by Doppler in all patients, suggested higher right ventricular minus right atrial pressures of 44 to 104 mm Hg (mean 64 mm Hg). The single patient with Eisenmenger's syndrome had right ventricular dilatation (3.2 cm), hypertrophy (10 mm), and hypokinesis (mild). Only the patient with Eisenmenger's syndrome had Doppler or contrast echocardiographic evidence for an intracardiac or extracardiac shunt. In the absence of left heart pathologic conditions, right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis strongly suggest pulmonary arterial or primary right ventricular disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD011053,0,23063171,0,Cranial neuroimaging in pregnancy and the post-partum period.,"Several diverse neurological conditions may be seen during pregnancy and the post partum period. These usually require neuroimaging for definitive diagnosis and range from a predisposition to neurovascular abnormalities, such as acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, through to more specific pregnancy-related conditions, such as eclampsia/posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy and post-partum angiopathy. Additionally, the pregnant patient is predisposed to pituitary disease. It is necessary that the radiologist has an awareness of these conditions to allow swift specific diagnoses or suggest the most appropriate diagnosis when imaging findings are non-specific. We describe epidemiological and radiological features to allow the radiologist to guide the clinician in management, and review guidelines for safe cranial imaging of the pregnant patient."
CD011053,0,1479518,0,Short-term effect of magnesium sulfate infusion on renal function in preeclamptic women.,"Magnesium (Mg) plays an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis. A deficiency may be of importance for the etiology of disorders that have vasospasm in common. Mg administration can reduce the peripheral vascular resistance and thus enhance organ perfusion. We observed that Mg sulfate infusion could have a beneficial effect upon the serum urate concentration in preeclamptic women, presumably by affecting the renal function. A study comprising 10 preeclamptic women with a high serum urate level (413-788 umol/l) was carried out. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by determination of iohexol clearance. 30 mmol Addex-Magnesium was then given i.v. during 12 h and a second GFR determination performed the next day. We had expected the GFR to increase, but to our surprise, it decreased (in mean, from 74.2 ml/[min x 1.73 m2] to 71.3; p < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed-ranks test). There were no significant changes of blood pressure, proteinuria, blood thrombocytes, transaminases, serum creatinine or serum urate. We conclude that in preeclamptic women with renal dysfunction, Mg infusion therapy had no favourable effect upon either blood pressure nor GFR in the short-term perspective."

Women with UP (n = 13) were submitted to standardised duplex scanning of HV at 11 stages of pregnancy between 10 and 38 weeks. For each stage, mean +/- SD was calculated for HV A-, X-, V- and Y-peaks. Women with PE (n = 30) were evaluated once, and mean +/- SD was calculated for pregnancies <32 weeks, 32-34(+6) weeks and > or =35 weeks. PE and UP values at corresponding gestational age were compared statistically using t-test. HV A-velocity measurements changed markedly from negative values in early uncomplicated pregnancy, converting around 22-24 weeks to positive values until term. Changes throughout gestation were less prominent for HV X-, V- and Y-velocities. HV A-velocity measurements were significantly lower in PE than in UP, the difference being more pronounced at 30 weeks (-3.59 +/- 3.41 vs. 6.12 +/- 3.43, p = 0.0001) than at 37 weeks (2.35 +/- 4.54 vs. 5.32 +/- 1.92, p = 0.04). From our results, we conclude that HV Doppler velocimetry shows a gradual shift from central venous reversed flow during atrial contraction in uncomplicated early pregnancy to constantly forward moving flow until term. HV A-velocities are significantly lower in PE than in UP, the differences being more pronounced in late second trimester than near term."

CD011053,0,20827172,0,Association of a patent foramen ovale with myocardial infarction and pulmonary emboli in a peripartum woman.,"Peripartum myocardial infarction is uncommon but devastating in young women. Although it is generally associated with arterial dissection, pregnancy-induced hypercoagulable state can also be a major contributor. Association of patent foramen ovale (PFO) adds to this potential risk. A 29-year-old postpartum female presented with worsening chest pressure, shortness of breath and syncope. She was hypotensive and tachycardic. A ventilation perfusion imaging displayed high probability for pulmonary emboli. With elevated cardiac enzymes and echocardiogram showing wall motion abnormalities, patient underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty for a midvessel thrombus in the left anterior descending artery. Further workup showed a thrombus straddling into the left atrium via a PFO and a deep venous thrombus in the right iliac vein. Hormonal changes in pregnancy are noted to place young women in a hypercoagulable state. Screening for PFO in this group of patients with timely intervention might prevent a major systemic event caused by paradoxical embolus."

Electrocardiograms showed left ventricular hypertrophy or left bundle branch block. On echocardiography, left ventricular minor axis dimensions were increased (diastolic, 67 +/- 7 mm; systolic, 59 +/- 7 mm) and mean fractional shortening was reduced (13% +/- 5%). All patients had hypokinesis or akinesis of the left ventricular segments and two had right ventricular dilatation. Gallium scanning performed in three patients was negative. Viral serologic testing was negative in all cases. All patients died within 5 years, three within 5 months. Survival duration was closely correlated with left ventricular fractional shortening.

CVT made up approximately half of the young strokes and 40% of strokes occurring in females. Majority of them were below 25 years of age, multipara women from rural areas who were delivered at home by untrained dais. While 79.6% cases occurred during first two weeks after delivery, the incidence of antepartum CVT was also higher at 7.8%. Majority of the patients had meningoencephalitic (70.32%) presentation. Others in the spectrum had either acute fulminant type (18.7%), neuropsychiatric (6.25%) or pseudotumour cerebri like presentation (4.68%). Patients with neuropsychiatric and pseudotumour cerebri like presentation had a better prognosis while those with acute fulminant type had a poorer outcome. The patients with bilateral hemorrhagic infarcts and diffuse cerebral edema on CT scan had a poorer prognosis. A lower mortality rate (18.75%) could be achieved with early diagnosis and quick institution of planned therapy."

CD011053,0,22648485,0,Imaging tests in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Imaging modalities play an essential role in diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE). Clinical outcome studies demonstrated that PE can be safely ruled out in patients with unlikely clinical probability in combination with a normal D-dimer test result; in all other patients additional imaging is needed. The aim is to accurately confirm or rule out the diagnosis of PE, after which, if indicated, anticoagulant treatment can be initiated. Various diagnostic tests are available, and this article reviews the different imaging techniques in patients with suspected PE. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the imaging test of choice because of its high sensitivity and specificity. Compression ultrasonography and ventilation perfusion scintigraphy are reserved for patients with concomitant suspicion of deep vein thrombosis or contraindication for CTPA. Furthermore the diagnostic process in patients with clinically suspected recurrent PE, PE during pregnancy, and PE in the elderly and in patients with malignancy are discussed."

CD011053,0,17626317,0,[Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism].,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is challenging because the symptoms are unspecific and an objective confirmation of the disease is required. Clinical symptoms and physical examination can be used to estimate the clinical probability of the disease used to interpret the results of the diagnostic tests. In patients with low or moderate clinical probability most quantitative D-dimer tests allow to exclude PE safely. A positive proximal venous ultrasound enables to confirm PE but the sensitivity is too low to exclude the diagnosis. In patients with a positive D-dimer test, multidetector spiral CT allows to confirm or exclude PE with confidence in most of the cases. Lung scanning is still useful in patients with renal impairment or allergy to contrast medium."
CD011053,0,8356266,0,Imaging of pregnancy-related complications.,"Thirty-six cases of pregnancy-related complications were studied with plain radiography, ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging alone or in combination. Among the complications diagnosed with these various techniques were venous thromboembolic disorders, deep vein thrombosis, ovarian vein thrombosis, endometritis and pyometra, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet counts), hepatic hematoma and rupture, fatty liver, uterine rupture, various hematomas and a foreign body, tubo-ovarian abscess, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral ischemia, and cerebral edema. Prompt detection and appropriate management of many of these complications could result in decreased maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Although US should be considered first because it can be performed bedside, does not require use of ionizing radiation, and is cost-effective, CT is superior in demonstrating the extent of the abnormality and MR imaging is best for detection of neurologic complications of pregnancy. The radiologist should select the best available method and tailor the examination according to the presumptive clinical diagnosis and the individual problem to be solved."
CD011053,0,18669732,0,Guidelines for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging use during pregnancy and lactation.,"There has been a substantial increase in the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pregnancy and lactation. Among some physicians and patients, however, there are misperceptions regarding risks, safety, and appropriate use of these modalities in pregnancy. We have developed a set of evidence-based guidelines for the use of CT, MRI, and contrast media during pregnancy for selected indications including suspected acute appendicitis, pulmonary embolism, renal colic, trauma, and cephalopelvic disproportion. Ultrasonography is the initial modality of choice for suspected appendicitis, but if the ultrasound examination is negative, MRI or CT can be obtained. Computed tomography should be the initial diagnostic imaging modality for suspected pulmonary embolism. Ultrasonography should be the initial study of choice for suspected renal colic. Ultrasonography can be the initial imaging evaluation for trauma, but CT should be performed if serious injury is suspected. Pelvimetry now is used rarely for suspected cephalopelvic disproportion, but when required, low-dose CT pelvimetry can be performed with minimal risk. Although iodinated contrast seems safe to use in pregnancy, intravenous gadolinium is contraindicated and should be used only when absolutely essential. It seems to be safe to continue breast-feeding immediately after receiving iodinated contrast or gadolinium. Although teratogenesis is not a major concern after exposure to prenatal diagnostic radiation, carcinogenesis is a potential risk. When used appropriately, CT and MRI can be valuable tools in imaging pregnant and lactating women; risks and benefits always should be considered and discussed with patients."
CD011053,0,11693208,0,47 years of phaeochromocytomas.,"Thirty three patients with phaeochromocytomas had surgery in St. Vincent's Hospital between 1950 and 1997. 32 patients had hypertension, 32 had palpitations and 30 had excessive sweating. All patients had at least one of these cardinal symptoms. Diagnostic tests changed over this period. In the early cases the phentolamine test was used, later diagnosis was confirmed by measurement of urinary VMA and catecholamines. IVP, CT, ultrasound or MIBG scanning were used to locate the tumours. Before 1967, 3 of 17 patients died peri-operatively, 2 of these from strokes and one from pulmonary embolism. Since then, all patients have survived surgery. Four of the women had phaeochromocytomas diagnosed during pregnancy. Two of the 33 patients had tumours that were malignant, the remainder being benign. One patient has died from metastatic disease. This series illustrates the changing trends in the surgical management of phaeochromocytomas."

CD011053,0,18692942,0,[Pregnancy and systemic lupus erythematosus].,"Pregnancy is widely authorized in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Fertility is similar in SLE and in the general population although the age of menarche seems higher. Some cases of sterility might be attributed to SLE because of autoimmune ovaritis or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). These antibodies might lead to endothelial activation and thrombosis by influencing homeostasis, complement activation, inhibition of protein C and annexin V. They might have a deleterious effect on embryonic implantation by adhesion to the trophoblast, inhibition of invasion and placentation and decreased hCG production. The most important part of sterility seems secondary to the use of cyclophosphamide and might be prevented by acetate leuprolide administration. Maternal morbidity seems correlated to SLE activity (controlled by pregnancy planning), hypertension, preeclampsia, Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome, therapy and aPL. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should be maintained throughout pregnancy. Aspirin is prescribed alone in patients with asymptomatic aPL and in addition to heparin if there is a history of thrombosis or fetal loss with aspirin. Fetal and neonatal morbidity correlate with prematurity, adverse effects or maternal steroid therapy and maternal anti-SSA antibodies with 1 to 2% risk of congenital atrioventricular block. Abnormal obstetrical echography-doppler examination is the best predictor of pregnancy outcome. Abnormal umbilical artery flow on the second trimester echodoppler examination and history of thrombophlebitis predict fetal or neonatal death. Abnormal uterine notch on the second trimester echodoppler examination predicts adverse pregnancy outcome. Except for the preventive therapy of congenital atrioventricular block, modalities of SLE pregnancy monitoring and therapy are now well established."

CD011053,0,3730696,0,Acetylcholine output and foetal vascular resistance of human perfused placental cotyleda.,"The foetal villous vessels of single cotyleda of human placentae have been perfused with a constant flow of Krebs solution, recording inflow pressure and passing the venous perfusate in cascade over guinea-pig ileum and rat stomach strip preparations in vitro. Each cotyledon released for at least 4 h a substance that was probably acetylcholine. The perfusate caused contractions of both preparations which were inhibited by atropine or hyoscine and potentiated by physostigmine. Contractile activity was destroyed after incubation at 37 degrees C of perfusate with acetylcholinesterase but not with acetylcholinesterase plus physostigmine. When the perfusion temperature was lowered to 34 degrees C or below, acetylcholine output was reduced, the extent depending on the fall in temperature. No change in resistance of the villous vessels occurred during the changes in temperature or in the presence at 37 degrees C of atropine, hyoscine, hexamethonium, (+)-tubocurarine, hemicholinium-3 or bretylium. Submaximal vasoconstrictor responses of the villous vessels to the thromboxane A2-mimetic U46619 were not affected by reduction of the perfusion temperature to 30 degrees C, which lowered acetylcholine-like output by approximately 70%. Responses to U46619, at 37 degrees C, were unchanged during the presence of atropine or hyoscine. Acetylcholine is released into the foetal circulation of the human placenta but no evidence could be obtained that it affects villous vascular smooth muscle tone or vasoconstrictor responses."

CD011053,0,18979429,0,[Pre-eclampsia screening in first and second trimester].,"Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-associated disease of the second part of the pregnancy, occurring mainly after 20th weeks gestation. The prevalence of hypertension in pregnancy is between 5 to 11% and affects mainly women under 20 years of age. An inadequate invasion of trophoblasts with consequential placental ischemia as a result of insufficiently dilated uterine spiral arteries is thought to be an initial cause in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The clinical symptoms of pre-eclampsia, such as loss of intravascular volume and edema, are caused by generalized endothelial dysfunction. These symptoms are potentiated by hypertension and reduced colloid osmotic pressure in the plama. The organs being affected by pre-eclampsia are those of the vascular-, hepatic-, renal-, cerebral- and coagulatory systems. The prognosis is much more severe when pre-eclampsia develops very early in the pregnancy. The symptoms include elevated blood pressure (over 140 mmHg systolic, 90 mmHg diastolic) combined with proteinuria. Frequent symptoms are hyperreflexia and edema. The etiology of pre-eclampsia has not been clearly defined. Risk factors/triggers for the development of pre-eclampsia can include chronic hypertension, advanced maternal age at first pregnancy (over 35 y), nephropathy, thrombophilia (heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome, heterozygous prothrombin mutation and homozygous MTHFR), multiple gestation and prior pregnancy with preeclampsia. The incidence of preeclampsia is higher in nulliparous than multiparous women. In many countries pre-eclampsia is still most frequent cause of maternal perinatal mortality. HELLP-Syndrome (haemolysis-elevated liver enzyme- low platelets) is a severe progressive course of this disease. Eclampsia, characterized by generalized tonic-clonic convulsion, is the most dangerous complication of pre-eclampsia, and may develop before or after delivery. This form of pre-eclampsia is associated with higher maternal and fetal mortality. Constant maternal hypertension potentially alter vascular integrity of the placenta with further consequences in fetal blood supply leading to growth restriction or zero growth and subsequently resulting in low birth weight or fetal death. The sooner the disease is detected and confirmed, the better the maternal and fetal prognoses are. This is the reason why it is major importance, together with the employment of preventive measures, to identify patients with risk factors with pre-eclampsia though an adequate screening method, thereby detecting the disease earlier and ensuring better pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child."

CD011053,0,17515260,0,From carotid plaque biology to serologic markers of vulnerability to predict the risk of cerebrovascular events.,"Stroke is the second cause of mortality in industrialized countries. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture with atheromatous debris distal embolization is the pathogenetic mechanism responsible for cerebrovascular events due to atherosclerotic carotid disease. Plaque composition rather than lesion burden seems to be the determinant factor producing rupture and subsequent thrombosis. Histologic features of vulnerability are : a large lipid core, a thin fibrous cap, and an inflammatory infiltrate rich of monocytes and macrophages. In the clinical practice, it is difficult to predict the risk of experiencing a major cerebrovascular events especially in asymptomatic patients. New invasive techniques such as intravascular ultrasound with termography, optical coherence tomography, fotons spectroscopy and elastography have been developed to detect atherosclerotic lesion tissue composition. However, such techniques are difficult to apply on a large scale basis in primary prevention. On the contrary, new serologic biomarkers such as Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein-A, Lp-PLA2, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-12, metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-(a), and plaque oxidative products have been recently proposed for screening general and high risk population. The present paper will briefly review the current histologic characteristics of vulnerable plaque and the new imaging tools proposed for its detection, focusing on the most recent serologic biomarkers evaluated in the clinical practice to increase our accuracy in predicting not only the plaque but moreover the patient at risk for an acute cerebrovascular event."
CD011053,0,11929641,0,Contraceptives and cerebral thrombosis: a five-year national case-control study.,"The object of this study was to assess the influence of oral contraceptives (OCs) on the risk of cerebral thromboembolic attacks (CTA) including thrombotic stroke and transitory cerebral ischemic attacks. A 5-year case-control study including all Danish hospitals was conducted. All women 15-44 years old suffering a first ever CTA during the period January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1998, were included. Controls were selected annually, 600 per year in 1994-1995, 1200 per year 1996-1998. Response rates for cases and controls were 88% and 90%, respectively. After exclusion of nonvalid diagnoses, pregnant women, and women with previous thrombotic diseases, 626 cases and 4054 controls were available for analysis. A multivariate matched analysis was performed. Controls were matched to cases within 1-year age bands. Adjustments were made for the following potential confounders: year, length of OC use, smoking, hypertension, migraine, family CTA, and years of schooling. There were 212 and 1208 current users of OCs among cases and controls, respectively. The risk of CTA among current users of OCs decreased significantly with decreasing estrogen dose (nonusers reference): OCs with 50 microg, 30-40 microg, 20 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and progestin-only pills implied adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% CI) of 4.5 (2.6-7.7), 1.6 (1.3-2.0), 1.7 (1.0-3.1), and 1.0 (0.3-3.0), respectively. Current users of OCs with second- (levonorgestrel or norgestimate) and third- (desogestrel or gestodene) generation progestins combined with 20-30 microg EE had ORs of CTA of 2.2 (1.6-3.0) and 1.4 (1.0-1.9), respectively. After correction for differences in estrogen dose, the third- to second-generation risk ratio was 0.6 (0.4-0.9; p = 0.01). In conclusion, high dose OCs and OCs with second-generation progestins were associated with the risk of CTA. The risk increased 2.5 times with estrogen dose increasing from 20 to 50 microg EE, and users of low-dose OCs with second-generation progestins had a 61% higher risk-association of CTA than users of OCs with third-generation progestins."

CT scan and MRI revealed multiple cerebral infarcts. Laboratory evaluation revealed lupus anticoagulant and high levels of anticardiolipin antibody.

CD011053,0,6823379,0,Phleborheography in pregnancy.,"To determine whether pregnancy and the gravid uterus have an effect on phleborheographic findings, 48 asymptomatic pregnant patients underwent phleborheography in the second or third trimester or the immediate postpartum period. Their phleborheograms were compared to normal phleborheograms of nonpregnant patients with normal venograms. No difference was detected between the phleborheograms of the two groups. Furthermore, there was no change in the phleborheograms of patients who were tested in the second and third trimesters and also in the immediate postpartum period. The fact that the gravid uterus and pregnancy did not alter the venous wave amplitude and baseline tracing indicated the absence of chronic or acute venous obstruction. The use of a lateral rather than supine position was judged important in obtaining accurate findings. The study suggests that phleborheography can be used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women with the same confidence as in nonpregnant patients."

Also noted were dilated, tortuous abdominal and pelvic vessels. A scan at 33.5 weeks confirmed the two-vessel cord and noted a widely dilated abdominal aorta and a left foot 2 cm shorter than the right. Delivery at 36 weeks was followed by a neonatal course complicated by thromboses, renovascular hypertension, and a newly patent ductus with pulmonary hypertension. Successful ligation was followed by acute pulmonary hypertension, cardiac dysfunction and death.

CD011053,0,8522406,0,Cardiac valve involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome: lack of correlation with antiphospholipid antibodies.,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of cardiac valve disease in systemic lupus erythematosus or in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and to assess the role of the antiphospholipid antibodies as risk factor for endocardial lesions. We studied 39 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (mean age 34 +/- 12 years, 38 female and one male), 20 women with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (mean age 32 +/- 4 years) and 20 normal subjects (mean age 35 +/- 8 years, 15 female and five male). All patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome had increased levels of serum anticardiolipin antibodies and recurrent fetal abortions; some of them also had arterial and/or venous thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia. M-mode, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography were performed in all patients. IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Valvular lesions were observed in 15 patients (38%) with systemic lupus erythematosus. These abnormalities included: mitral valve thickening or vegetation, mitral valve prolapse and aortic valve vegetation; mitral, aortic and tricuspid regurgitation; mitral stenosis. None of the patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and of the normal subjects was found to have valvular abnormalities. In systemic lupus erythematosus, high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 73% of the patients with valvular lesions and in 67% of the patients without valvular lesions (P > 0.05). We conclude that valvular involvement is frequent in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus but it is apparently unrelated to antiphospholipid autoimmunization."

These have been reported in the setting of arterial infarction and/or haemorrhage. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cause of brain infarction. It occurs in the setting of oral contraceptive administration or pregnancy. Inherited thrombophilias are documented risk factors. The most frequent being heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. We report a single case of bilateral thalamic infarction due to cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis. Clinically the case manifested with memory impairment and dysexecutive symptoms. Predisposing factor for venous thrombosis was a homozygous factor V Leiden mutation. The patient was treated with anticoagulation and made a good recovery.

The correct diagnosis of superior vena caval (SVC) obstruction led to an immediate cesarean section, CT of the chest and abdomen, open lung biopsy of a mediastinal mass, and radiation therapy for the lymphoma with pericardial invasion, all within 24 hours of presentation. The next day, an in vitro labeled Tc-99m red blood cell (RBC) angiogram was performed, which documented collateral flow from the SVC obstruction to the abdomen and filling of the right ventricle via the liver, presumably through reopened channels of the umbilical vein."

CD011053,0,12538548,0,Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"No single noninvasive test for pulmonary embolism is both sensitive and specific. Some tests are good for ""ruling in"" pulmonary embolism (e.g., helical CT) and some tests are good for ""ruling out"" pulmonary embolism (e.g., D-dimer); others are able to do both but are often nondiagnostic (e.g., ventilation-perfusion lung scanning). For optimal efficiency, choice of the initial diagnostic test should be guided by clinical assessment of the probability of pulmonary embolism and by patient characteristics that may influence test accuracy. This selective approach to testing enables pulmonary embolism to be diagnosed or excluded in a minimum number of steps. However, even with the appropriate use of combinations of noninvasive tests, it is often not possible to definitively diagnose or exclude pulmonary embolism at initial presentation. Most of these patients can be managed safely without treatment or pulmonary angiography by repeating ultrasound testing of the proximal veins after one and 2 weeks to detect evolving deep vein thrombosis. Helical CT and MRI are rapidly improving as diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism and are expected to become central to its evaluation."

On brain examination, 23 cases showed hypoxic-ischemic lesions. The white matter was the main site of damage that consisted in classical leucomalacia or other features such as: astrocytic glial reaction, microcalcifications and microthromboses either as isolated finding or in association. Anoxic neuronal damage was much less frequent. Anemia, hypoprotidemia and cardiac failure with hypotension, which often occur in hydrops fetalis, may account for brain perfusion failure and hypoxic-ischemic changes."

The mortality rate among pregnant women is very high at 75% with a fetus mortality rate of 95%. This report describes the clinical course of a 25-year-old woman with hemorrhagic shock four hours after elective Cesarean Section. Symptoms like hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnoe were initially suggestive of pulmonary embolism. Ultrasound demonstrated a nonechogenic mass in the abdomen suggestive of a fluid collection. Ruptured splenic artery aneurysm was recognized during the second emergency laparotomy for hemoperitoneum. Splenectomy was performed. The outcome for the patient was good. We underline that the only way to avoid a fatal event is to know and to think about this rare but very important complication in any woman with unexplained abdominal pain or with clear signs of haemorrhage during pregnancy or shortly after delivery."

CD011053,0,22489252,0,Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus: current status and future direction.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is commonly associated with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) including systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The prevalence of PAH in SLE is estimated to be 0.5% to 17.5%. The pathophysiology of PAH involves multiple mechanisms from vasculitis and in-situ thrombosis to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, potentially leading to right heart failure. Immune and inflammatory mechanisms may play a significant role in the pathogenesis or progression of PAH in patients with CTDs, establishing a role for anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies. The leading predictors of PAH in SLE are Raynaud phenomenon, anti-U1RNP antibody, and anticardiolipin antibody positivity. The first-line of diagnostic testing for patients with suspected SLE-associated PAH (SLE-aPAH) involves obtaining a Doppler echocardiogram. Once the diagnosis is confirmed by right heart catheterization, SLE-aPAH patients are generally treated with oxygen, anticoagulants, and vasodilators. Although the prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness of these patients have improved with the addition of intensive immunosuppressive therapies, these treatments are still largely unproven. Recent data put the one-year survival rate for SLE-aPAH patients at 94%. Pregnant women are most at risk of dying due to undiagnosed SLE-aPAH, and screening should be considered essential in this population."

Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common tumors of the liver diagnosed during fetal and neonatal life. The diagnosis can be suspected antenatally by ultrasound and MR scan. The differential diagnosis is often challenging. While small hepatic hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic, large tumors can lead to complications such as high-output congestive heart failure, consumptive thrombocytopenic coagulopathy and hemorrhage after tumor rupture.

Vascular ultrasound (US) offers distinct advantages in confirming the clinical suspicion of disease or suggesting the need for further tests. The authors encountered three consecutive cases of antepartum proximal vein thrombosis during a 6-month period (0.6 case per 1,000 deliveries). Lack of venous flow accentuation and lack of diameter change at the common femoral vein during the Valsalva maneuver are indications for iliac venography and suggest the diagnosis of iliac vein thrombosis. In distal iliac and proximal femoral vein thrombosis, noncompressibility of the vein and the presence of echogenic material within are indicative of acute thrombus."

We describe the case of a 29-year-old woman with primary infertility with no history of thrombosis, hypertension or renal disorders. In her first pregnancy, achieved by frozen embryo transfer, she developed severe early-onset (23rd gestational week) PE with heavy proteinuria, and at the same time was found to have enlarged ovaries with hyperreactio luteinalis. After admission we found that she was a heterozygotic carrier of the factor V Leiden mutation. After administering low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy, her blood pressure normalized, proteinuria diminished and her d-dimer values returned to that of a normal pregnant level. The fetus grew normally. Her ovaries normalized during the pregnancy, as determined by ultrasound examinations. At term she delivered spontaneously a normal weight, healthy girl. Previously, only prophylactic LMWH, in subsequent pregnancy, have been administered in patients with thrombophilia and a history of severe PE. We describe a case of spontaneous hyperreactio luteinalis, where the clinical characteristics of PE improved after beginning LMWH therapy in severe, very early onset PE. Inherited thrombophilia, spontaneous hyperreactio luteinalis and PE may be associated phenomena."
CD011053,0,2521985,0,Evidence for functional thromboxane A2-prostaglandin H2 receptors in human placenta.,"The aim of this investigation was to study the role of thromboxane (TX) A2 in the modulation of human fetoplacental vascular resistance. By use of the isolated perfused fetoplacental cotyledon, TX generation (measured by direct radioimmunoassay of TXB2) was demonstrated on the fetal side of the placental circulation. The stable TX mimetic U-46619 caused a dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure that was inhibited by the TX receptor antagonist SQ 29548. To further characterize the putative TXA2-prostaglandin H2 receptors, binding studies were performed in placental membranes using [3H]SQ 29548. Kinetic analysis revealed rapid and reversible specific binding of [3H]SQ 29548. Saturation binding and Scatchard analysis indicated radioligand binding to a single class of receptors (dissociation constant, 9.11 +/- 0.60 nM; receptor density, 103 +/- 8 fmol/mg protein, n = 4). Prostaglandins D2, E1, E2, F2a, and I2 did not inhibit the specific binding of [3H]SQ 29548 at concentrations less than or equal to 10 microM. This study demonstrates that the human placenta produces and releases TXA2, which can act locally via specific receptor sites to constrict the fetoplacental vasculature."

CD011053,0,17983956,0,Cause and prevention of central nervous system injury in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery.,"Neurologic morbidity has been identified as increasingly problematic in neonates with congenital heart disease as surgical mortality rates have improved. The presence of ""congenital brain disease"" in patients with congenital heart disease represents a challenge in improving long-term neurologic outcomes. Mechanisms of central nervous system injury in infants undergoing cardiac surgery include hypoxia-ischemia, emboli, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory microvasculopathy. Preoperatively, the primary focus is on preventing hypoxic-ischemic injury and thromboembolic insults. Modifiable intraoperative factors associated with central nervous system injury include, but are not limited to, pH management, hematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass, regional cerebral perfusion, and the use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Postoperatively, secondary neurologic injury may be related to post-cardiopulmonary bypass alterations in cerebral autoregulation and additional hypoxic-ischemic insult, seizures, or other issues associated with prolonged intensive care unit stay. In addition to prenatal and modifiable perioperative factors, genetic and environmental factors are known to be important. Unfortunately, modifiable perioperative factors may explain less of the variability in long-term outcomes than do patient-specific factors."

CD011053,0,6809935,0,Effects of the oestrous cycle on the metabolism of arachidonic acid in rat isolated lung.,"1. The metabolism of exogenous arachidonic acid perfused through the pulmonary circulation was investigated in lungs taken from rats at different stages of the oestrous cycle. 2. Following perfusion with [14C]arachidonic acid there was more radioactivity associated with cyclo-oxygenase products in general at pro-oestrus than at any other stage of the cycle. 3. Production of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha and hence of prostacyclin (PGI2) was also highest at pro-oestrus. 4. Production of thromboxane B2 was highest at pro-oestrus although it was never greater than PGI2 production at any stage. 5. Radioactivity retained in lung tissue was mostly present in phospholipid and free fatty acid fractions with the distribution at pro-oestrus being different from the other stages. 6. Following perfusion with [14C]oleic acid (which is not a substrate for cyclooxygenase), variations in the distribution of label in radioactivity in lung were also observed. However, these were not related to the stages of the oestrous cycle in the same way as those associated with arachidonic acid. 7. We conclude that both pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism in lung--oxidation via cyclo-oxygenase and incorporation into phospholipid - are affected by the progress of the oestrous cycle. 8. Altered arachidonate metabolism appeared to be associated chiefly with pro-oestrus and may be linked to those hormones involved in this stage of the oestrous cycle."
CD011053,0,19319769,0,[Diagnostic imaging during pregnancy].,"If diagnostic imaging during pregnancy is performed, potential risks not only for the mother but also for the fetus have to be considered. Ultrasonography should be performed primarily because it is harmless for the fetus. Other imaging modalities like x-ray, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for cases in which results of ultrasonography are inconclusive and patient care depends on further imaging. If pulmonary disease is suspected (e. g. pneumonia) chest x-ray should be performed. CT should be considered if chest x-ray is nondiagnostic or inadequate (e. g. suspicion of pulmonary embolism). In patients with abdominal symptoms the indication either for CT or MRI depends on the presumed disease. Every abdominal CT during pregnancy should include an estimation of radiation dose. Dose estimation is not necessary after CT of the chest. In case of pelvic disease in particular concerning the ovaries and the uterus as well as fetal imaging MRI is the method of choice. Contrast media should only given intravenously when a compelling clinical indication exists and the potential benefit to the patient outhweights the potential risk to the fetus."

CD011053,0,19648522,0,Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism.,"Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism (NTPE) is defined as embolisation to the pulmonary circulation of different cell types (adipocytes, haematopoietic, amniotic, trophoblastic or tumour), bacteria, fungi, foreign material or gas. The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical signs, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of the different NTPE subtypes. The complex and diverse pathogenesis of different subtypes of emboli is subject to continuing speculation and is certainly far more complex than ""simple"" mechanical obstruction after embolisation of vascular thrombi. Nonthrombotic emboli may also lead to a severe inflammatory reaction both in the systemic and pulmonary circulation, as well as in the lung. NTPE presents a formidable diagnostic challenge, as the condition often presents with very unusual and peculiar clinical signs that are frequently overlooked. They range from very dramatic acute presentations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome to signs observed late in the disease course. Pathological observations play a key role in the exact diagnosis, and sometimes carefully aspirated blood from the pulmonary artery or specific staining of cells recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may be helpful. Frequently, lung biopsies revealing severe granulomatous reaction or unfortunate post-mortem pathological investigations of pulmonary tissue are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Here, we also aim to familiarise the reader with the atypical radiological features of NTPE. Thin-section computed tomography of the lungs showing peculiar radiographic findings, such as a feeding vessel, the so-called tree-in-bud pattern or the appearance of micronodules distributed at the termination of bronchovascular bundles, may be observed in certain forms of NTPE. Increased awareness of NTPE as an underestimated cause of acute and chronic embolism, which may result in acute and chronic pulmonary hypertension, is needed. Despite the fact that detailed descriptions of several forms of NTPE have existed for nearly 100 years, well-designed trials have never been performed to evaluate therapy in the different subsets of these patients."

CD011053,0,15522067,0,Late puerperal thrombohemorrhagic complications in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome.,"In this study, we present a case of late-puerperal onset of thrombohemorrhagic complications in a 33-yr-old woman with known antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and heterozygosity for factor V Leiden gene mutation. Antithrombotic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin was given since the 12th gestational week. Pregnancy and cesarean delivery were uncomplicated. Five weeks postpartum, the patient developed a severe hemorrhagic diathesis with marked thrombocytopenia accompanied by vaginal, nasal and cutaneous bleeding. A variety of autoimmune phenomena were also detected, partly at clinical presentation and partly later on, despite ongoing steroid treatment. Platelet counts recovered to normal values within a few weeks secondary to high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin administration. An ultrasound of both legs, performed because of persistent complaint of moderate calf pain, revealed bilateral deep venous thromboses (DVT). The clinical and biochemical findings were not consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or the 'hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet syndrome' (HELLP). The diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were not fulfilled either. The complex of thrombohemorrhagic complications and autoimmune phenomena seen in this case is unusual and not previously described in the late puerperal stage of APS-related pregnancies."

Sonographic evaluation included the size of the lesion, its echogenicity on subsequent examinations and location in relation to the placental margin and umbilical cord insertions. Classical pathologic examination was performed after delivery to confirm the ultrasonographic findings. The echogenic pattern of these lesions was distinct from that of the rest of the placenta and the lesions were classified in two categories. The parenchymal lesions including 19 intervillous thrombosis, 14 caverns, 3 cases of hydatidiform changes, 2 infarcts, 1 septal cyst and one case of fibrin deposition and, the chorionic lesions including 5 subchorionic thrombosis, 3 cases of extrachorial placentas and 2 amniotic cysts.

CD011053,0,19331837,0,The current and continuing important role of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy in evaluating patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"After the publication of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) study in 1990, there was considerable controversy concerning the ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) study in regard to its low sensitivity and high number of nondiagnostic examinations when used in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Many lessons have been learned from the PIOPED database that have greatly improved our interpretive skills in the 2 decades since the study was performed. One of the key problems negatively impacting interpretation was the predominantly inpatient population that was studied. Inpatients generally are sicker patients with abnormal chest x-rays. This factor significantly degrades V/Q interpretation. A normal chest x-ray greatly facilitates accurate interpretation of the lung scan. The emergence of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the early to mid-1990s provided a superb new means of imaging patients with suspected PE. As this technology became more sophisticated with multidetector units, it became the procedure of choice in the great majority of medical centers. CT scanners located in or proximal to many emergency departments as well as its 24/7 availability supported this preference. Within the past 2 to 3 years, the publication of the PIOPED II study as well as some other prospective and retrospective studies have confirmed similar diagnostic accuracy for CTA and V/Q studies. Additionally, there have been several recent publications cautioning physicians about the large radiation dose associated with CTA, particularly to the female breast. Considering the great benefits of both techniques as well as their limitations, it is prudent for both clinicians and imaging physicians to develop an appropriate approach to studying patients with suspected PE. Considerations such as objective clinical assessment, D-dimer assay and the chest x-ray appearance all play significant roles in this decision-making process."

The other twin, a male infant, was delivered by Cesarean section because of fetal distress, with resuscitation performed in the delivery room. The infant developed generalized tonic seizure shortly after stabilization, and was put on anticonvulsants. The initial brain echography was normal; follow-up echograms and CT scans performed at 8 and 12 days old, respectively, revealed diffuse low density over both side of cerebral hemisphere. At one month old, the infants's brain echogram showed diffuse cystic encephalomalacia. At four months, he was noted to be spastic and significantly delayed in neurodevelopment. Disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by fetal-to-fetal transfer of thromboplastic material from the dead fetus was considered as the most possible cause of the neurological complication in this patient.

CD011053,0,14636154,0,Second trimester Doppler ultrasound screening of the uterine arteries differentiates between subsequent normal and poor outcomes of hypertensive pregnancy: two different pathophysiological entities?,"The 'classical' concept that pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and pre-eclampsia (PE) primarily originate from defective placentation in early pregnancy has been challenged recently. There is growing evidence that other factors, including maternal predisposing conditions, also play a significant role in the pathophysiology of PIH and PE. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that PIH and PE with an early onset and poor pregnancy outcome is associated with defective placentation, e.g. inadequate spiral artery dilatation and subsequent reduced uteroplacental perfusion, whereas PIH and PE with normal pregnancy outcome is not. Using Doppler ultrasound, we measured the uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) in a population of 531 nulliparous women in the 22nd week of gestation. Uterine artery PI was used as an index of resistance to blood flow in the uteroplacental circulation. Outcome measures were PIH/PE with or without poor pregnancy outcome, preterm birth and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). The results revealed a striking difference between PI values for PIH/PE with and without poor pregnancy outcome. Uterine artery PI in the 22nd week was increased significantly in pregnancies which developed early-onset (before 35 weeks) PIH/PE with a poor pregnancy outcome. In contrast, uterine artery PI values were normal in women who developed PIH/PE, but had a good pregnancy outcome. There was a significant correlation between 22nd week uterine artery PI and subsequent preterm birth or IUGR. Our results indicate that only PIH/PE with poor pregnancy outcome is associated with defective placentation, whereas PIH/PE with good outcome is not. These findings support the concept of heterogeneous causes of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy."

CD011053,0,2801765,0,In utero thrombosis and neonatal gangrene in an infant of a diabetic mother.,"We report an infant of a diabetic mother (IDM) with in utero brachial artery thrombosis and neonatal gangrene to illustrate that there may be an increased risk for arterial as well as venous thrombosis in IDMs. The diagnosis of brachial artery thrombosis was made by using Doppler sonography flow studies and was confirmed with autopsy. The postnatal period was complicated by aortic and mesenteric artery thrombosis, with subsequent necrotizing enterocolitis, renal infarction, and death. Gangrene of a limb presenting at birth is rare, with 32 individuals reported in the literature, including this patient. Twenty-two percent (7/32) of the infants with peripartum limb gangrene were IDMs. This implies a marked increase in arterial thrombosis in IDMs over the general population. Changes in coagulation factors have been reported in newborn IDMs with poor control of maternal diabetes. Increased clotting and decreased fibrinolysis found in diabetics may lead to arterial thrombosis in IDMs in utero and postnatally. Use of anticoagulants in at-risk infants should be considered to prevent further thrombosis postnatally. Additionally, IDMs may be at increased risk for thrombotic complications from umbilical artery catheter. In utero thrombosis of the brachial artery may be one mechanism which leads to limb reduction defects in IDMs."

CD011053,0,1631280,0,Doppler ultrasonography of the pelvis.,"TVS has brought the pelvic organs closer to us than ever before. Color Doppler probes have exposed small vessels that could not be seen with real-time technique alone, and pulsed Doppler is becoming an important adjunct in many physiologic and pathologic states. Vascular changes of the ovary and uterus during the menstrual cycle are now being followed during infertility protocols, are being investigated to determine the viability of an early pregnancy, and may increase our confidence in the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy in a few selected cases. Waveform analysis may be useful in discriminating benign from malignant uterine masses, and additional work in the diagnosis of pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian torsion is anticipated. Color Doppler sonography has an important role to play in the diagnosis of early ovarian cancer. A large multicenter trial is ongoing in this country to determine if there is a characteristic PI that will determine whether an adnexal mass is benign.

CD011053,0,9488786,0,Diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.,"Accurate diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is required because treatment can be life-saving, while inappropriate anticoagulation exposes the mother and fetus to haemorrhage and other hazards. Clinicians must be aware of which patients are at risk because DVT is frequently asymptomatic. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable for DVT and PE so objective tests are required. Venography is the gold standard test for DVT but is invasive and has been superseded by less invasive tests such as duplex ultrasound which is now the first-line investigation in pregnancy. However, where doubt remains, venography, CT and MRI have a role. Ventilation-perfusion scanning is the pivotal test for PE in pregnancy, and need not expose the fetus to excess radiation. If the result is unclear deep venous ultrasound can guide management of suspected PE, thus avoiding pulmonary angiography, the invasive gold standard test."

They are also major ingredients in cold and flu mixtures. Unlike well-known organ toxicological profile, their prenatal toxicity was not fully established. For a long time, acetaminophen was considered as a relatively safe antipyretic and analgesic drug during pregnancy. However, a new data indicate that it may increase the risk of cryptorchidism and asthma during childhood as well as preeclampsia, preterm birth, maternal phlebothrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Contrary to acetaminophen, non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - NSAID; i.e., diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen) may induce intrauterine growth retardation, ductus arteriosus constriction with secondary persistent pulmonary hypertension, reduced fetal renal perfusion that led to oligohydramion, prolonged pregnancy as well as increase prevalence of intracranial bleeding in newborns.

Serum resistin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) at 11 to 13 weeks were measured in 480 singleton pregnancies, including 240 with normal outcome, 60 that subsequently developed preeclampsia (PE), 60 that developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 60 that delivered large for gestational age (LGA) neonates, and 60 that delivered small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. Each value in both the normal and pathological outcome groups was expressed as a multiple of the expected normal median (MoM), and the median MoM values in the outcome groups were compared. In the PE group, compared with the controls, there were an increase in median resistin (1.22 MoM, P = .003) and uterine artery PI (1.25 MoM, P < .0001) and a decrease in serum PAPP-A (0.72, P < .0001). There was no significant association between serum resistin with either uterine artery PI (P = .415) or serum PAPP-A (P = .290). In the SGA, LGA, and GDM groups, serum resistin MoM was not significantly different from that of the controls (P = .415, P = .702, and P = .549, respectively). In pregnancies that develop PE, maternal serum resistin concentration at 11 to 13 weeks is increased in a manner not related to altered placental perfusion or function. In pregnancies complicated by the development of GDM or delivery of SGA or LGA neonates, serum resistin is not significantly altered."

In pregnancy is even more complicated, because physiologic changes of pregnancy can mimic signs and symptoms of PTE. Our patient presented dyspnoea, breathing effort and cyanosis of the mouth at admission. In the check-up there was a distinct murmur just under the heart and tachycardia 115 bpm. The Doppler examination of the venous vessels of the lower extremities was normal. Echocardiography revealed features of right ventricular failure. Due to increased level of D-dimers and echocardiographic features of right-ventricular overload, the suspicion of pneumonic embolism was made. Therefore, in order to verify the initial diagnosis the decision of pulmonary CT angiography was made with the radiological protection of the fetus. This study revealed pulmonary embolism in the form of numerous defects in the contrast fillings of the pulmonary arteries. CT pulmonary angiography is the first imaging test of choice in general population who is suspected to have PTE. However there is no consensus what should be preferred during pregnancy. In this paper the diagnostic concepts and an evidence-based guidelines were discussed in case of PTE in pregnancy as well as its side effects including teratogenicity and oncogenicity. In each case, the risks and benefits must be compared before a decision is taken. In case of thrombosis symptoms in the lower extremities, ultrasound should be taken as the next step, otherwise chest X-ray must be performed. In patients with normal chest X-ray the next step should be scintigraphy but if chest X-ray is abnormal, angio CT is preferred."

Head computed tomography showed intracranial calcifications and enlarged ventricles. Skin biopsy was consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis, with no evidence of neoplastic infiltrate. Family history was notable for parental consanguinity and twin sisters with the diagnosis of Aicardi-Gouti√®res syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive progressive encephalopathy. Although the infant's clinical presentation at birth suggested an infectious etiology, extensive testing for infection, including TORCH titers, was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed persistent lymphocytosis and an elevated interferon alpha level, consistent with the diagnosis of Aicardi-Gouti√®res syndrome. Although there have been no reported cases of a blueberry muffin rash in Aicardi-Gouti√®res syndrome, it is biologically plausible for this cutaneous manifestation to occur in the setting of a genetic condition that mimics the clinical phenotype of a congenital viral infection.

CD011053,0,18619081,0,Venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolism is the leading cause of maternal death in the United States. Pregnancy is a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis, and risk is further increased with a personal or family history of thrombosis or thrombophilia. Screening for thrombophilia is not recommended for the general population; however, testing for inherited or acquired thrombophilic conditions is recommended when personal or family history suggests increased risk. Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation are the most common inherited thrombophilias, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is the most important acquired defect. Clinical symptoms of deep venous thrombosis may be subtle and difficult to distinguish from gestational edema. Venous compression (Doppler) ultrasonography is the diagnostic test of choice. Pulmonary embolism typically presents postpartum with dyspnea and tachypnea. Multidetector-row (spiral) computed tomography is the test of choice for pulmonary embolism. Warfarin is contraindicated during pregnancy, but is safe to use postpartum and is compatible with breastfeeding.

CD011053,0,19135831,0,Symptomatic ileofemoral DVT after onset of oral contraceptive use in women with previously undiagnosed May-Thurner Syndrome.,"May-Thurner syndrome is characterized by left common iliac obstruction secondary to compression of the left iliac vein by the right common iliac artery against the fifth-lumbar vertebra. This anatomic variant results in an increased incidence of left-sided deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Furthermore, while a preponderance of left-sided DVT has been demonstrated in women during pregnancy and oral contraceptive use, patients are not typically screened for this condition after developing a left-sided DVT. As anticoagulation alone is ineffective for DVT treatment in the setting of May-Thurner anatomy, more aggressive treatment is warranted. Failure to diagnosis this condition predisposes these women to the unnecessary risks of recurrent DVT and post-thrombotic syndrome."
CD011053,0,6792225,0,Ultrasonic prediction of complications following normal vaginal delivery.,One hundred uncomplicated pregnancies of primigravida and secundigravida gestation were scanned within 24 h of delivery. The ultrasonic appearances of the uterus were categorized into three groups: 1) empty uterus; 2) cavity separation indicating blood or clot; and 3) dense cavity echoes representing retained tissue. The presence of blood and clot in the puerperium is a common occurrence that resolves spontaneously. Retained tissues of conception were present in 10 cases and were passed spontaneously in four women within the first 3 days postpartum. The presence of retained tissue after the fourth day is support for surgical evacuation of the uterus. Gray-scale ultrasonic examination was accurate in diagnosing all of these cases.
CD011053,0,11297074,0,Renal venous thrombosis with calcification and preservation of renal function.,"Two neonates were found on US to have branching linear calcification in the renal parenchyma, right sided in one and bilateral in the other. CT confirmed the presence of branching calcification in the kidneys and demonstrated calcified thrombus in the inferior vena cava in both babies. Antenatal detection of adrenal haemorrhage in one baby and presence of calcification at the age of 3 days in the other indicate that thrombosis probably occurred before birth. The kidneys remained normal in size, and uptake of 99mTc-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) was normal on follow-up examination. The presence of branching calcification and normal renal size probably indicates good prognosis for renal function in neonates in whom renal venous thrombosis is found and may indicate prenatal thrombosis."

CD011053,0,6437228,0,The management of severe rhesus isoimmunization by fetoscopic intravascular transfusions.,"Twenty-five severely rhesus-isoimmunized fetuses, including 15 with hydrops fetalis, underwent a total of 77 intrauterine transfusions between 19 and 32 weeks' gestation. Fifty-eight of the procedures were fetoscopically directed intravascular transfusions, nine were ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal transfusions, and 10 were a combination of intravascular transfusion, fetal paracentesis, and intraperitoneal transfusion. The average number of antenatal procedures per patient was three (range, one to five). The survival rate for the 19 fetuses that received their initial intrauterine transfusion at or before 25 weeks' gestation was 84%; 11 of the 13 hydropic fetuses and five of the six fetuses without antenatal evidence of hydrops survived. In six cases hydrops fetalis was reversed in utero. The outcome in patients referred after 25 weeks' gestation was poor; neither of the two hydropic fetuses and only two of the four nonhydropic ones survived, which suggests the importance of early referral to a team experienced in the management of this problem. However, most of these fetal losses occurred early in the series. Seven of the 20 neonates were hydropic, and nine had severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, less than 50,000 X 10(6)/L). The mean cord blood hematocrit and bilirubin of the neonates were 25.1% and 82 mumol/L, respectively. The babies required a total of 69 exchange transfusions (range, 0 to 9) and 68 simple transfusions (range, 0 to 25). One newborn infant who had had ultrasound evidence of hydrops fetalis at 22 weeks' gestation did not require any exchange transfusions. Nine patients required intermittent positive pressure ventilation (eight had respiratory distress syndrome and one had apnea) for a range of 1 to 86 days. The neonatal survival rate was 90% (18/20)."

Nevertheless, in more than 70% of patients who die of pulmonary embolism (PE), the diagnosis is not considered before death. Thus, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for VTE, especially in high-risk patients. Some risk factors for VTE are a recent surgical procedure and general anesthesia, immobilization, congestive heart failure, previous PE, pregnancy, and oral contraceptive use. Before therapy can be initiated, a definitive diagnosis of VTE must be established. An algorithm for assessing patients with possible VTE is presented; decisions about proceeding with various studies are based primarily on the clinician's degree of suspicion for the presence of PE and the findings on a ventilation-perfusion scan. Elevation of the patient's legs before, during, and after a surgical procedure is a simple measure that may substantially decrease the occurrence of PE."

Only a few cases of recurrence have been published. We report a new case. A 27-year-old primiparous patient presented a first episode of AFLP in 1991 at 37 week's gestation. Diagnosis was suspected because of vomiting, thrombocytopenia, and liver function tests abnormalities. It was confirmed by liver ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography. Clinical and biological improvement was observed after caesarean delivery. Six years later, the woman began a second pregnancy. Liver function tests and complete blood count were regularly checked. At 30 weeks' gestation, recurrent AFLP occurred and caesarean section was performed. Again, diagnosis was confirmed by both ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography. In 2006, the mother and the two girls, 15 and 8-year-old respectively, were in good health. The study of the HADHA gene, coding alpha subunit long chain 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCHAD) in the patient failed to find mutations, particularly the common mutation c.1528G>C (Glu474-Gln, p.E474Q).

A 24-year-old woman (gestational stage: 28 weeks and 6 days) was admitted because of a tumor mass in the abdominal cavity. A well-circumscribed and fibrously encapsulated tumor mass was revealed in the Douglas cavity. Histologically, tumor cells were arranged in a solid sheet with deciduoid appearance and showed partial glandular and papillary structures. The tumor cells contained PAS positive and diastase-digested granules in the cytoplasm as well as alcian-blue positive and hyaluronidase-digested substances in the stroma. The cellularity of the tumor cells was moderate and mitoses were rare. There was partial tumor necrosis and tumor cells had infiltrated through the fibrous capsule. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were reactive for pancytokeratin, cytokeratin5/6, vimentin, HBME-1, calretinin and thrombomodulin. Ultrastructurally, numerous, long microvilli, tonofilaments and desmosome junctions could be seen. Consequently, this case was diagnosed as deciduoid mesothelioma and 2 years and 4 months after operation, the patient's clinical course has been good. This case is considered to be the first reported in Japan."

CD011053,0,23429288,0,CUL1 promotes trophoblast cell invasion at the maternal-fetal interface.,"Human trophoblast progenitor cells differentiate via two distinct pathways, to become the highly invasive extravillous cytotrophoblast (CTB) cells (EVT) or fuse to form syncytiotrophoblast. Inadequate trophoblast differentiation results in poor placenta perfusion, or even complications such as pre-eclampsia (PE). Cullin1 (CUL1), a scaffold protein in cullin-based ubiquitin ligases, plays an important role in early embryonic development. However, the role of CUL1 in trophoblast differentiation during placenta development has not been examined. Here we show that CUL1 was expressed in CTB cells and EVT in the first trimester human placentas by immunohistochemistry. CUL1 siRNA significantly inhibited outgrowth of extravillous explants in vitro, as well as invasion and migration of HTR8/SVneo cells of EVT origin. This inhibition was accompanied by decreased gelatinolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and increased expression of tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP-1 and -2). Consistently, exogenous CUL1 promoted invasion and migration of HTR8/SVneo cells. Notably, CUL1 was gradually decreased during trophoblast syncytialization and CUL1 siRNA significantly enhanced forskolin-induced fusion of choriocarcinoma BeWo cells. CUL1 protein levels in human pre-eclamptic placental villi were significantly lower as compared to their matched control placentas. Taken together, our results suggest that CUL1 promotes human trophoblast cell invasion and dysregulation of CUL1 expression may be associated with PE."

Comparative clinical trials of fondaparinux versus heparins in prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism are ongoing. Little is known about fondaparinux during pregnancy, as women of child-bearing potential were excluded from clinical trials. No particular safety issue, for either mother or fetus, has been reported for heparins. The objective of this study was to compare in vitro the steady state placental transfer of fondaparinux and enoxaparin at the plasma concentrations reached during acute treatment of venous thromboembolism (1.75 microg/mL and 1 anti-Xa IU/mL respectively), using antipyrine (20 mg/L) as reference. No biological activity was detectable in the fetal venous effluent during perfusion of enoxaparin-antipyrine, fondaparinux-antipyrine or control media. Furthermore, fetal venous samples did not differ significantly from fetal arterial samples. This apparent absence of placental transfer supports further evaluation of fondaparinux in pregnant women."
CD011053,0,16707770,0,Reactivity of human placental chorionic plate vessels from pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).,"A successful pregnancy is dependent on liberal placental perfusion via the maternal and fetal circulations. Doppler waveform analyses of umbilical arteries suggest increased resistance to flow in the fetoplacental circulation of pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Neither the site nor the mediators responsible for this altered vascular reactivity are known, to date. In placentas in normal pregnancy, reduced oxygenation promotes contraction of the in vitro-perfused placental cotyledon and modulates agonist-induced contraction of chorionic plate arteries and veins. Placental oxygenation has also been suggested to be reduced in IUGR. We tested the hypothesis that oxygen tension could directly modify placental chorionic plate vessel vasoreactivity in IUGR. Small arteries and veins from the chorionic plate were dissected from biopsies from placentas of pregnancies complicated by IUGR and were studied using parallel wire myography. Vasoconstriction at 20%, 7%, and 2% oxygen was assessed utilizing the thromboxane mimetic U46619. Experiments were also performed in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (4AP), a blocker of voltage-gated potassium channels. Increased oxygenation reduced venous vasoconstriction but did not modify arterial vasoconstriction. 4AP increased basal tone in arteries and veins. We suggest that venoconstriction in response to hypoxia may provide a mechanism for increased fetoplacental vascular resistance associated with IUGR."

The post-partum period is the period carrying the highest risk of venous thromboembolism, especially after caesarean delivery. The diagnosis is essential, applying strategies validated in the non-pregnant population, as none of the diagnostic tests is contra-indicated during pregnancy. These strategies use a combination of empirical evaluation of clinical probability, D-Dimer measurement. In case of positive D-Dimer testing (or high clinical probability), ultrasonography of the legs should be performed first; if there is no proximal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary CT scan or lung scan should be performed. Low molecular weight heparin is the treatment of choice until 6 weeks after the delivery, for a minimal total duration of 6 months.

CD011053,0,17012465,0,Placental abruption.,"Placental abruption complicates about 1% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of vaginal bleeding in the latter half of pregnancy. It is also an important cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. The maternal effect of abruption depends primarily on its severity, whereas its effect on the fetus is determined both by its severity and the gestational age at which it occurs. Risk factors for abruption include prior abruption, smoking, trauma, cocaine use, multifetal gestation, hypertension, preeclampsia, thrombophilias, advanced maternal age, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, intrauterine infections, and hydramnios. Abruption involving more than 50% of the placenta is frequently associated with fetal death. The diagnosis of abruption is a clinical one, and ultrasonography and the Kleihauer-Betke test are of limited value. The management of abruption should be individualized on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity of the abruption and the gestational age at which it occurs. In cases where fetal demise has occurred, vaginal delivery is preferable. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy should be managed aggressively. When abruption occurs at or near term and maternal and fetal status are reassuring, conservative management with the goal of vaginal delivery may be reasonable. However, in the presence of fetal or maternal compromise, prompt delivery by cesarean is often indicated. Similarly, abruption at extremely preterm gestations may be managed conservatively in selected stable cases, with close monitoring and rapid delivery should deterioration occur. Most cases of placental abruption cannot be predicted or prevented. However, in some cases, maternal and infant outcomes can be optimized through attention to the risks and benefits of conservative management, ongoing evaluation of fetal and maternal well-being, and through expeditious delivery where appropriate."

The examinations were undertaken with a Dohn plethysmograph for segmental application of the calf. The emptying curves in question had an initial phase at the ordinary rapid rate, changing distinctly within 1.5 sec into a definitely slower phase of venous emptying. Biphasic emptying curves were found to be characteristic of patients with isolated, high venous obstruction, mostly acute thromboses, but more or less intact veins in peripheral parts of the leg. The same type of pathological emptying curves could be provoked by external compression of the femoral vein or Valsalva's manoeuvre, providing experimental evidence of the underlying mechanism. The venous emptying course might be similarly influenced also by varicose veins, pregnancy, and right heart failure. The diagnostic experience of biphasic emptying curves in clinical practice indicates, that this particular way of interpreting venous occlusion plethysmography is a valuable complement to phlebography in the detection of proximal venous obstructions in the lower limb, whether due to iliac thrombosis or elusive intrapelvic tumours."

CD011053,0,1957040,0,Endothelin: release by and potent constrictor effect on the fetal vessels of human perfused placental lobules.,"Human placental lobules were bilaterally perfused with a modified Krebs solution at constant flow rates of 5 mL min-1, and fetal inflow perfusion pressure was recorded. The effect of infusions of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 (ET-1 and ET-3) on the perfusion pressure was assessed and compared with that for the thromboxane A2-mimetic U46619 and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). All substances caused significant increases in pressure, ET-1 being the most potent, followed in order by U46619, ET-3 and PGF2 alpha. In addition, ET-like immunoreactivity was identified in the fetal effluent of placental lobules during 4 h of basal perfusion. The mean ET-1 equivalent immunoreactivity at 1 h of perfusion was 0.6 +/- 0.2 fmol min-1 g-1 of wet lobule weight for 10 placentae. These data suggest that human fetal placental endothelial cells are capable of synthesizing ETs and that ETs are potent constrictors of the fetal placental vessels. Thus, endothelins may play a role in the control of fetal vascular tone in the human placenta in normal and/or pathological conditions."

After the patient has received plasma exchange, platelet count normalized. An ophthalmic examination showed a dysfunction in choroid perfusion as a cause for the blurred vision. After discharge regular lab tests were planned, but no further treatment was necessary at that point of time. The premature twins survived after ventricular haemorrhage, severe sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other complications of neonates."
CD011053,0,16356811,0,Diagnosis of suspected venous thromboembolic disease in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of maternal mortality during pregnancy. Early and accurate radiological diagnosis is essential as anticoagulation is not without risk and clinical diagnosis is unreliable. Although the disorder is potentially treatable, unnecessary treatment should be avoided. Most of the diagnostic imaging techniques involve ionizing radiation which exposes both the mother and fetus to finite radiation risks. There is a relative lack of evidence in the literature to guide clinicians and radiologists on the most appropriate method of assessing this group of patients. This article will review the role of imaging of suspected venous thromboembolic disease in pregnant patients, highlight contentious issues such as radiation risk, intravenous contrast use in pregnancy and discuss the published guidelines, as well as suggesting an appropriate imaging algorithm based on the available evidence."

The present study aimed to determine the clinical efficacy of combined blood purification treatment (CBPT) in patients with AFLP complicated by AKI. The CBPT involves plasma exchange (PE) combined with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The subjects were 17 patients with AFLP complicated by AKI. The CBPT was implemented based on the timely termination of pregnancy and general treatment. Changes in clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, liver ultrasounds, as well as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Glasgow scores were evaluated. The efficacy and adverse reactions of the CBPT were also assessed. The CBPT was smoothly performed without any obvious adverse reaction. After treatment, the clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and liver ultrasonography significantly improved. Therefore, the SOFA scores correspondingly decreased 1 week after treatment [9 (range 5-11) vs. 3 (range 0-10), P = 0.002], and the median was close to normal by the second week. The clearance rate of the total bilirubin in PE was significantly higher than that in CVVH (37.2 vs. 7.9%, P = 0.000). The incidence of acute pulmonary edema in CVVH was less than that in PE (0 vs. 41.2%, P = 0.007). Finally, the maternal mortality was 5.88% (95% CI: 0-29%). Overall, we think that CBPT aids in the recovery of liver and kidney function. Different blood purification methods may be combined to integrate and maximize their advantages to improve the prognoses of patients with serious AFLP."
CD011053,0,17507435,0,"Placental HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, membrane and soluble VEGF receptor-1 proteins are not increased in normotensive pregnancies complicated by late-onset intrauterine growth restriction.","Inadequate trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling leading to poor placental perfusion are believed to underlie the pregnancy pathologies preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The main objective of this study was to investigate hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) and downstream genes (VEGF receptor-1) Flt-1 and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) proteins in IUGR placentas. Placentas from normal pregnant (NP; n = 18), PE (n = 18), and IUGR (n = 10) patients were investigated. Normotensive patients with IUGR delivered babies at >or= 37 wk of gestation with birth weights of <10% and asymmetrical growth. HIF-1 alpha, -2 alpha, Flt-1, and sFlt-1 protein, and mRNA were assessed by Western and Northern blot analyses, respectively. The results are expressed as ratios of the densitometric values for each pair of pathologic and normal placentas, a ratio of 1.0 indicating no difference. Comparable to our earlier studies, the PE/NP ratios for HIF-1 alpha, -2 alpha, and Flt proteins were significantly increased by 50-100% (all P < 0.01 vs. 1.0). Unexpectedly, the IUGR/NP ratios for HIF-1 alpha and -2 alpha proteins were 1.03 +/- 0.07 and 0.96 +/- 0.16, respectively, and for Flt and sFlt were 1.14 +/- 0.15 and 0.95 +/- 0.12, respectively (all P = not significant vs. 1.0). Northern blot analysis revealed comparable levels of HIF-alpha mRNA in abnormal and normal placentas. In contrast to PE, HIF-alpha proteins and regulated genes are not increased in placentas from normotensive pregnant women delivering small, asymmetrically grown babies >or= 37 wk of gestation. The absence of an increase in HIF-alpha protein is not due to insufficient HIF-alpha mRNA for protein synthesis. Thus, the placentas from women with PE and late IUGR are fundamentally different at the molecular level."

This case discusses the management of a woman with placenta percreta complicated by intraoperative pulmonary embolism. A 39-year-old gravida 3 with two previous cesarean deliveries presented at 34 weeks of gestation with an antepartum hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed placenta percreta. The multidisciplinary group including obstetricians, gynecological oncologists, interventional radiologists and anesthesiologists developed a delivery plan. Cesarean delivery was performed with internal iliac artery occlusion and embolization catheters in place. After the uterine incision our patient experienced acute hypotension and hypoxia associated with a drop in the end-tidal carbon dioxide and sinus tachycardia. She was resuscitated and the uterus closed with the placenta in situ. Postoperatively, uterine bleeding was arrested by immediate uterine artery embolization. With initiation of embolization, hypotension and hypoxia recurred. Oxygenation and hemodynamics slowly improved, the case continued and the patient was extubated uneventfully at the end of the procedure. Computed tomography revealed multiple pulmonary emboli. The patient was anticoagulated with low-molecular-weight heparin and returned six weeks later for hysterectomy. Placenta percreta with invasion into the bladder can be catastrophic if not recognized before delivery. The chronology of events suggests that this may have been amniotic fluid emboli. An intact placenta with abnormal architecture, such as placenta percreta, may increase the risk of amniotic fluid embolus. The clinical findings and co-existing filling defects on computed tomography may represent a spectrum of amniotic fluid embolism syndrome."

CD011053,0,1629498,0,An approach to immunologic reactions associated with plasma exchange.,"Immunologically mediated anaphylactic-type events are not uncommon with PE. The pathogenesis of these reactions is not well understood and demands further investigation. If a technique or equipment-related phenomenon can be identified, it should be addressed (e.g., replace the membrane for a more biocompatible membrane and use better rinsing procedures to eliminate ethylene oxide). Testing for specific relevant immunogen, either by in vivo or in vitro methods, if these methods are available, should be considered. If infusion of essential blood products is the most likely cause, then a premedication regimen may be helpful in preventing such reactions. As the risks and benefits of treatment are weighed, it is important to remember that every hive need not be eliminated. Instead, the goal is to prevent compromise to oxygenation and perfusion in both mother and fetus while comfort is maintained and drug-induced adverse effects are avoided."
CD011053,0,15533635,0,The role of lipoprotein (a) in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia.,"Endothelial cell dysfunction is a key feature of the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The cause of the endothelial cell injury is probably multifactorial, but poor placenta perfusion plays a major role. In pre-eclampsia, characteristic pathological lesions in the placenta are fibrin deposits, acute atherosis and thrombosis. The similarity between the lesions of pre-eclampsia and atherosclerosis has led to speculations of a common pathophysiological pathway. An abnormal lipid profile is known to be strongly associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and has a direct effect on endothelial function. Abnormal lipid metabolism seems important in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia too. An elevated plasma lipoprotein (a) concentration is a known risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In this paper, we discuss three hypotheses about the mechanisms by which lipoprotein (a) may be associated with pre-eclampsia: 1. Lp(a), as an acute-phase reactant, transporting cholesterol to sites of endothelial damage for reparation, temporarily increases during pregnancy and increases more during a pregnancy complicated by mild to moderate pre-eclampsia as compared to an uncomplicated pregnancy, in response to a greater extend of endothelial injury in pre-eclampsia. After delivery, pre-eclampsia subsides and Lp(a) concentrations return to baseline levels. 2. In cases of severe pre-eclampsia, there is even more extensive endothelial damage and consequently a higher consumption of Lp(a) in reparation of this vascular damage. These women will have lower concentrations of Lp(a). 3. High baseline concentrations of Lp(a), which are genetically determined, may induce or contribute to the development of pre-eclampsia by promoting endothelial dysfunction. In this line of reasoning one would expect to find higher concentrations of Lp(a) in women at risk for developing pre-eclampsia in a future pregnancy or with a history of pre-eclampsia. As discussed above, these women are also at increased risk for future cardiovascular disease as compared to women with a history of normal pregnancy. The pathophysiologic changes associated with cardiovascular disease may also be responsible for the increased incidence of pre-eclampsia in these women."

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis was suspected based on multiple cystic lesions on chest computed tomography. Additionally, moderate thrombocytopenia occurred during the last trimester. Hyperplasia of megakaryocytes in a bone marrow specimen and a high serum titer of platelet-associated IgG led to a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. High-dose intravenous gammaglobulin promptly restored her platelet count, and the patient successfully gave birth to a healthy baby by cesarean section. After delivery, lymphangioleiomyomatosis was diagnosed by lung biopsy that was obtained during a video-assisted thoracoscopic abscission for recurrent pneumothorax.

CD011053,0,7646253,0,[Prevention of deep venous thrombosis].,"The positive and negative clinical symptoms and signs of deep venous thrombosis are both insensitive and non-specific. Venography is the reference investigation: Duplex ultrasonography is the usual diagnostic procedure for distal deep venous thrombosis but it is less reliable in proximal lesions. The sensitivity of plethysmography in proximal deep venous thrombosis is high but the diagnosis of isolated calf vein thrombosis and non-obstructive proximal thrombosis escape diagnosis in this technique. Most cases of deep venous thrombosis occur after major surgery, during pregnancy, in the post-partum period, after prolonged immobilisation and in obese patients or those with varicose veins. Congenital and acquired causes should also be investigated when spontaneous deep venous thrombosis occurs or when the condition complicates minor surgical trauma in a young patient. The incidence of deep venous thrombosis varies with the type of surgical procedure: 25% in general surgery, 50% after hip or knee arthroplasty, 43% after fracture of femur, 24% after neurosurgery. Graduated pressure stockings should be used for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis.

Here, we report a case of extensive intervillous hematoma diagnosed at 25 weeks of gestation with severe intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios. Marked elevation of fetal DNA levels was observed in maternal blood. Fetal DNA levels decreased after 27 weeks of gestation, concurrent with recovery of fetal growth. We conservatively managed this case until 30 weeks of gestation, when a male infant was delivered. He weighed 508 g and displayed Apgar scores of 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. Histological examination of the placenta revealed intervillous thrombosis without infarction or inflammatory changes. In this case, decreasing fetal DNA levels in maternal plasma correlated with recovery of fetal growth and provided useful information for fetal management as well as insight into the pathogenesis of placental injuries."

CD011053,0,2680850,0,[Diagnosis and surgical management of varicosities].,"The diagnosis of varicose veins is based on historical details pertaining to risk factors such as familial preponderance, advanced age, overweight, multiple births, professional activities carried out mainly in the standing or sitting position, use of oral contraceptives, diuretics or drugs which lower venous tone. Swelling of the legs on prolonged recumbancy, during pregnancy, fractures or cast treatment may be associated with thrombosis (Table 1). In addition to inspection and palpation in the standing and lying positions, the status of the pulses and the joints are of importance. The diagnostic measures must clarify the stage of the chronic venous insufficiency and provide adequate information on the various forms of venous functional disturbances (Table 2). Classification of varicose veins is carried out according to etiology--primary or secondary--or according to anatomical and functional derangement: with varicosities of the great saphenous vein and the lesser saphenous vein, in addition to valve incompetence at the proximal confluence of the saphenous-femoral junction, there may be segmental or global valve incompetence frequently in combination with a perforating vein incompetence. Varicosities of the great saphenous vein are classified with respect to whether the venous valves involved are those only in the region of the proximal confluence or from the inguinal region to above or below the knee or to the ankle, respectively, in four degrees of severity (Figure 1). For varicosities of the lesser saphenous vein, three degrees of severity are differentiated, the confluence incompetence, incompetence of the venous valves from the knee to the middle of the lower leg or from the knee to the ankle.4+ as the postthrombotic syndrome. Chronic venous insufficiency is characterized by venous hypertension and subdivided into three degrees of severity: grade I in the presence of corona phlebectatica paraplantaris and stasis edema; grade II in the presence of hyperpigmentation, melanodermitis, atrophy blanche, stasis induration and hypodermitis; grade III in the presence of hyperpigmentation, melanodermitis, atrophy blanche, stasis induration and hypodermitis; grade III in the presence of healed or florid ulceration.

CD011053,0,22341691,0,[Pregnancy and antiphospholipid syndrome].,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is associated with a risk of obstetrical complications, affecting both the mother and the fetus. Obstetrical APS is defined by a history of three consecutive spontaneous miscarriages before 10 weeks of gestation (WG), an intra-uterine fetal death after 10 WG, or a premature birth before 34 WG because of severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia or placental adverse outcomes (intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios). Pregnancy in women with a diagnosis of obstetric APS is at increased risk for placental abruption, HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count) syndrome and thrombosis that may be part of a catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). A previous thrombosis and the presence of a lupus anticoagulant are risk factors for pregnancy failure. A multidisciplinary approach, associating the internist, the anesthesiologist and the obstetrician, is recommended for these high-risk pregnancies. Preconception counseling is proposed to identify pregnancy contraindications, and to define and adapt the treatment prior and during the upcoming pregnancy. Heparin and low-dose aspirin are the main treatments. The choice between therapeutic or prophylactic doses of heparin will depend on the patient's medical history. The anticoagulant therapeutic window for delivery should be as narrow as possible and adapted to maternal thrombotic risk. There is a persistent maternal risk in the postpartum period (thrombosis, HELLP syndrome, CAPS) justifying an antithrombotic coverage during this period. We suggest a monthly clinical and biological monitoring which can be more frequent towards the end of pregnancy. The persistence of notches at the Doppler-ultrasound evaluation seems to be the best predictor for a higher risk of placental vascular complications. Treatment optimization and multidisciplinary antenatal care improve the prognosis of pregnancies in women with obstetric APS, leading to a favorable outcome most of the time."

CD011053,0,15450392,0,Prognostic value of placental ultrasound in pregnancies complicated by absent end-diastolic flow velocity in the umbilical arteries.,"Our objective was to evaluate the utility of gray-scale placental ultrasound for the detection of pathological lesions in the placentas of preterm pregnancies with abnormal fetoplacental blood flow (defined by absent or reversed end-diastolic flow velocities [ARED] in the umbilical arteries) before 32 weeks of gestation. Sixty consecutive structurally and chromosomally normal singleton pregnancies were evaluated. Pre-defined criteria were used to describe placental appearances using gray-scale real-time ultrasound. Proximal uterine artery Doppler waveforms were recorded using pulsed and color Doppler ultrasound. Each patient had a thrombophilia profile. Following delivery, a single perinatal pathologist reviewed each placenta at a gross and microscopic level blinded to the placental ultrasound findings. Placental shape or texture was abnormal on gray-scale ultrasound in 43/59 (73%) and echogenic cystic lesions (ECL) were found in 16 (27%). Uterine artery Doppler was abnormal in 47/60 (78%) cases. Thirty-eight pregnancies were subsequently delivered by planned Caesarean section in the fetal and/or maternal interest (birthweights 540-2300 g, mean gestational age 30.6 weeks) and 21 pregnancies resulted in the vaginal delivery of a stillborn fetus where fetal weight and/or gestational age did not justify Caesarean section (birthweights 85-600 g, mean gestational age 24.9 weeks). ECL had a low positive predictive value for both villous infarcts (63%) and for focal/massive perivillous fibrin deposition (40%). Nevertheless, the combination of abnormal uterine artery Doppler and abnormal gray-scale findings (abnormal placental morphology or ECL) was strongly predictive of stillbirth (17/21; sensitivity 81%, PPV 52%, p = 0.006 Fisher's exact test). Pregnancies with ARED in the umbilical arteries have a high perinatal mortality associated with pathology of the placental villi. Ultrasound examination of the placenta and its maternal blood supply may contribute to the perinatal management of these pregnancies."
CD011053,0,10625203,0,Efficacy of antithrombin replacement therapy in severe early-onset preeclampsia.,"It has been suggested that the hypercoagulable state in severe preeclampsia is strongly related to the onset of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) through the deterioration of placental circulation. In this study, one of two kinds of anticoagulants, heparin or antithrombin (AT), was given to severe early-onset preeclamptic women (onset before 32 weeks of gestation) with IUGR, and the efficacies in maternal and fetal findings were compared. The mechanism of AT to improve placental circulation was discussed based on our previous study using the culture system of chorionic trophoblastic cells. The mean systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in the AT group (AT concentrate 1,500 IU/d for 7 days, n = 15). Fetal growth was calculated by ultrasonographic measurement, and the weight gain was higher in the AT group than it was in the heparin group. In vitro experiments showed that AT increased the thrombomodulin (TM) antigen on the cell surface and also increased prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) production by cultured trophoblastic cells. This suggests that AT replacement therapy is useful for improving maternal hypertension and fetal findings in severe preeclampsia with IUGR through the increase of TM and PGI2 production in both maternal and placental circulation."

CD011053,0,8739459,0,Antiphospholipid antibody prevalence in patients with IVF failure.,"Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) have been associated with reproductive wastage. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of APAs in women who have had at least 12 embryos transferred during several in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles without ensuing pregnancy. Sera from 42 women with IVF failure and 42 women who successfully conceived after IVF were tested for the presence of APAs by ELISA. Successful post-IVF pregnancy was determined by obtaining two consecutive rising beta-hCG levels followed by an ultrasound to confirm a viable conceptus. The sera were tested for three isotypes of antibody: IgA, IgG, and IgM against seven phospholipids: cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic Acid (PA), phosphatidyl-glycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidyl-serine (PS). From the IVF failure group, 11/42 (26.2%) were positive for APAs. From the control group, 2/42 (4.8%) were found positive only for IgA against PE. The difference between IVF failure and successful IVF groups was significant (P = 0.01). These results suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies should be considered an important marker for increased risk of IVF failure. Patients who are involved with an IVF program should be tested for the presence of APAs prior to initiation of an IVF cycle."

CD011053,0,18795302,0,CTPA for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism during pregnancy.,"CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been suggested by the Fleischner society as the first test following a negative leg ultrasound in pregnant patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. This editorial discusses the use of CTPA as a diagnostic tool in pregnant women and comments on the need for specifically adapting CT protocols during pregnancy in the light of new research describing a substantial number of non-diagnostic examinations in pregnant women if routine scanning protocols are used for CTA of the pulmonary arteries. Potential reasons for these high numbers of insufficient examinations are physiological changes occurring during pregnancy that lead to a hyperdynamic circulation, which reduces average enhancement of the pulmonary vasculature. In addition, there are possible breathing-related effects that include an increased risk for Valsalva manoeuvre with devastating effects for pulmonary vascular enhancement. Techniques to overcome these problems are discussed: bolus triggering with short start delays, high flow rates or high contrast medium concentration, preferential use of fast CT systems and the use of low kVp CT techniques. CT data acquisition during deep inspiration should be avoided and shallow respiration may be considered as an alternative to suspended breathing in this patient group. All these factors can contribute to optimization of the quality of pulmonary CTA in pregnant patients. It is time now to adapt our protocols and provide optimum care for this sensitive patient group."

This article attempts to provide a brief overview and critique of the frequently reported factors. In addition, we call attention to the fact that, to be most helpful, modern studies of miscarriage need to provide details about the sonographically determined gestational age and fetal anatomic development prior to or at the time of pregnancy loss. Such information will be critical in helping to sort out which miscarriage-associated factors are more relevant at which stage of fetal development."
CD011053,0,24421214,0,"Impact of the nitric oxide-donor pentaerythrityl-tetranitrate on perinatal outcome in risk pregnancies: a prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial.","Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia (PE) are associated with impaired placentation. Patients who are at risk of developing both these disorders can be identified by abnormal uterine artery Doppler at mid-trimester pregnancy. Nitric oxide (NO)-donors like pentaerithrityl-tetranitrate (PETN) reduce the impedance in the uteroplacental vessels and possess protecting effects on the endothelium. We tested the effectiveness of the NO-donor PETN for secondary prevention of IUGR, PE, and preterm birth in pregnancies at risk. Some 111 women who presented with abnormal placental perfusion at 19-24 weeks of gestation (w.o.g.) were included into a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study. The primary endpoint was IUGR and/or perinatal death. Secondary endpoints were preterm birth, PE, and placental abruption. Pentaerithrityl-tetranitrate significantly decreased the risk for IUGR and/or perinatal death [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.410; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.184-0.914] and for IUGR (adjusted OR 0.436; 95% CI 0.196-0.970). Preterm birth before 32 w.o.g. (adjusted OR 0.204; 95% CI 0.052-0.801) was reduced, but not the risk for PE. No placental abruption occurred in the PETN, but five occurred in the placebo group [corrected]. These results suggest that secondary prophylaxis of adverse pregnancy outcome might be feasible in pregnancies exhibiting abnormal placentation using PETN."

Fetal therapy has substantial risks and its indications need better definition. Of 24,417 consecutive pregnant women, 618 (2.5%) were HPA-1a negative of whom 385 entered an observational study. All were HLA-DRB3*0101 genotyped and screened for anti-HPA-1a. Their partners and neonates were HPA-1 genotyped and the latter were assessed by cord blood platelet counts and cerebral ultrasound scans. Anti-HPA-1a was detected in 46 of 387 pregnancies (12.0%; 95% CI 8.7%-15.2%). All but one were HLA-DRB3*0101 positive (odds ratio 140; 95% CI 19-1035; P< .00001). One baby died in utero, and of 26 HPA-1a-positive babies born to women with persistent antenatal antibodies, 9 were severely thrombocytopenic (8 with a count <10 x 10(9)/L, 1 with a large porencephalic cyst), 10 were mildly thrombocytopenic, whereas 7 had normal platelet counts. Severe thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with a third trimester anti-HPA-1a titer >/= 1:32 (P = . 004), but was not observed in babies of women with either transient or postnatal-only antibodies. HPA-1a alloimmunization complicates 1 in 350 unselected pregnancies, resulting in severe thrombocytopenia in 1:1,200. HPA-1a and HLA-DRB3*0101 typing combined with anti-HPA-1a titration allows selection of the majority of pregnancies at risk of severe thrombocytopenia."

CD011053,0,12690566,0,Isolated internal cerebral venous thrombosis in a neonate with increased lipoprotein (a) level: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.,"Background. Internal cerebral venous thrombosis is a life-threatening condition, which requires immediate therapy. Being infrequent in childhood, internal venous thrombosis is very rare in the neonate and has never been observed without concomitant occlusion of further dural sinuses. Case Description. We report a neonate born at term, who developed seizures on the third day of life after normal pregnancy and uneventful delivery. Ultrasound and CT disclosed bilateral intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhage with an unusual distribution for germinal matrix hemorrhage. MRI disclosed thrombotic occlusion of the straight sinus and the internal cerebral veins with concomitant bleeding into the ventricles, the basal ganglia, thalamus and the periventricular hemispheres. The other sinuses were not affected. The clinical condition of the child improved after initiation of a low-dose heparin treatment with subsequent partial recanalization of the occluded vessels. The screening for risk factors disclosed an elevated lipoprotein (a) level, also present in both parents. Conclusion. Internal cerebral venous thrombosis may be encountered in neonates and must be included in the list of differential diagnosis of perinatal intraventricular and intracerebral bleeding. MRI allows the diagnosis even in the absence of widespread dural sinus occlusion. Low dose heparin may be a therapeutic option in these cases. This is the first report of neonatal internal venous thrombosis due to hereditary lipoprotein (a) level elevation, which must be included in the list of possible predisposing conditions."

In the first part of a two-part article outlining the history and process of this guidelines development, the author discusses several national and provincial initiatives in this area. A National Partnership for Quality in Health, involving many major physician organizations, was formed in 1990 to promote clinical practice guidelines in Canada. The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) participated in its workshops. CAR decided in 1994 to ask its Task Force on Standards to assume the task of development of appropriateness guidelines in diagnostic imaging. After review of British and US guidelines in radiology, the Task Force decided to develop guidelines tailored to the practice in Canada through interdisciplinary consensus. The CAR subsequently entered into an agreement with the Health Services Research in Radiology Initiative of McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont., to investigate guidelines development, and decided to avoid taking ""ownership"" of guidelines. Guidelines development is based on the Guidelines Development Cycle of Browman and associates and is condition-based, rather than being all-encompassing or equipment-based.

The number of requests for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in healthcare systems is continually on the rise. An MRI scan of the head is one of the most frequent locations, which if used inappropriately entails a loss of resources. Consequently, guidelines are needed to help the physician make decisions and allow better management of resources. AIM. To establish the key indications of MRI scans in cases of adults with headache. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used, that is, following a systematic review, a list of possible indications of MRI in cases of headache was drawn up. This list was then assessed by a panel of experts and given a score between 1 ('totally inappropriate') and 9 ('totally appropriate'). An initial round of scoring was carried out online, the results were then discussed at a face-to-face meeting of the experts and finally another online round was undertaken. MRI was considered appropriate in each indication if the mean score was 6.5 or higher and there was agreement among the experts (using the IPRAS index). RESULTS. MRI scanning was considered appropriate in cases of: new headache, new headache in immunodeficient patients, sudden intense headache, headache with focal neurological symptoms, postural headache, headache due to physical effort or Valsalva manoeuvres, suspected thrombosis in the venous sinuses, systemic involvement, progressive headache, headache in pregnancy, autonomic trigeminal headache or severe cranial traumatic injury with focus. CONCLUSIONS. It seems that indication can be summed up in headaches with a suspected secondary pathology. The methodology employed makes it possible to establish MRI indications that can be useful both in clinical practice and for healthcare management practitioners."

The patient was referred for a symptomatic deep venous thrombosis at 23 weeks of gestation. Ultrasonography demonstrated a massive thrombus in the left iliofemoral vein. Heparin was given intravenously. Due to the possibility of pulmonary embolism during or immediately after delivery, a temporary inferior vena cava filter was inserted at 36 weeks of gestation. Labor was induced at 37 + 5 weeks of gestation; labor proceeded uneventfully and a male infant was born. Postpartum computed tomography (CT) demonstrated compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery and lumbar vertebra. CT venogram demonstrated poor flow through the common iliac vein and well-developed collateral vessels. Critical stenosis at the origin of the left common iliac vein was consistent with a diagnosis of May-Thurner syndrome."

Additional transient electrocardiographic abnormalities (sinus bradycardia, QT interval prolongation) have been reported. Such clinical and laboratory manifestations are included in the so-called neonatal lupus syndromes, independently whether the mother is suffering from a systemic autoimmune disease or is totally asymptomatic. The prevalence of the congenital heart block is around 2%, of neonatal rash around 20%, while laboratory abnormalities in asymptomatic babies can be detected in up to 40% of cases. The risk of recurrence of complete heart block is almost 10 times higher in the following pregnancies. Most of the mothers are asymptomatic at delivery and are identified only by the birth of an affected child. Their long-term outcome is generally more reassuring than previously assumed. Serial echocardiograms and obstetric sonograms, performed at least every 2 weeks, starting from 16 weeks gestation, are recommended in anti-Ro/SSA positive pregnant women: the goal is to detect early fetal abnormalities, that might precede complete atrioventricular block and that might be a target for preventive therapy. Transplacental passage of maternal anti-SSA/Ro -SSB/La IgG is thought to be pivotal in inducing tissue damage. However, the discordant appearance of the syndrome in twins does suggest a role also for fetal or environmental factors."

All had abnormal liver histology and showed a variety of abnormalities, including Budd-Chiari syndrome, changes mimicking extrahepatic obstruction, lobular fibrosis, cholestasis, and hepatocyte giant cell transformation. We report recurrent significant perinatal liver disease in a family, associated with proven FTV in at least 1 pregnancy. A 30-year-old gravida 4 female with a history of heterozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate A1298C mutation had a normal 1st pregnancy and then experienced an intrauterine fetal demise at 38 weeks of gestation. Placental examination revealed extensive occlusive and mural thrombi of chorionic vessels associated with a large focus of avascular villi. Histologic examination of the liver showed extensive giant cell transformation and hepatocyte dropout. No excess hemosiderin pigment was present in the liver, pancreas, or heart. A 3rd pregnancy produced a live-born term infant with transient neonatal cholestasis. The 4th pregnancy also produced a term neonate who presented with acute hepatic failure of unknown cause, ultimately requiring liver transplantation. Fetal thrombotic vasculopathy is an underrecognized association with perinatal liver disease that may be associated with abnormal liver perfusion and that may recur in families, especially when a genetic thrombophilia is present."

The giant form with a small abdominal wall defect is a rare condition which, to our knowledge, has not been described previously. We describe three cases with the typical features of elongated vascular liver pedicle and angiomatosis of the hepatic portal system. The abnormal liver organogenesis, due to extra-abdominal development, represented a significant risk factor for hepatic thrombosis after visceral reduction and liver rotation. All the neonates underwent surgery on the first day of postnatal life. One died because of a postoperative liver infarction, and the survivors needed prolonged respiratory support. Prenatal sonographic features, timing, delivery, type of surgical repair, and postnatal outcome are reviewed. A prenatal sonographic diagnosis could be useful to evaluate the abdominal ring and serial ultrasound examinations are recommended to detect promptly ominous signs of hepatic and bowel damage. Color Doppler may be useful to assess the anatomy of the abdominal vessels and their relationships with the herniated organs, although it was not used in any of the cases reported here. This congenital malformation might be considered as a pathological entity separate from giant omphalocele with large abdominal defect, with a severe prognosis due possibly to its different embryological development."

There is consensus in treating patients with APS and first venous thrombosis with warfarin to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.3-3.0. However, a recent systematic review including observational studies found patients with APS and stroke to be at a high risk of recurrent events. We thus recommend a target INR>3.0 in this group. Likewise, the optimal approach for women with obstetric manifestations of APS is not completely defined; some authors recommend universal aspirin plus heparin whereas others consider aspirin in monotherapy useful for women with recurrent early miscarriage only.

OHSS is caused by increased vascular permeability (VP) through ovarian hypersecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-activating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). We previously demonstrated in an OHSS rodent model that increased VP was prevented by inactivating VEGFR-2 with a receptor antagonist (SU5416). However, due to its toxicity (thromboembolism) and disruption of VEGFR-2-dependent angiogenic processes critical for pregnancy, this kind of compound cannot be used clinically to prevent OHSS. Dopamine receptor 2 (Dp-r2) agonists, used in the treatment of human hyperprolactinemia including pregnancy, inhibit VEGFR-2-dependent VP and angiogenesis when administered at high doses in animal cancer models. To test whether VEGFR-2-dependent VP and angiogenesis could be segregated in a dose-dependent fashion with the Dp-r2 agonist cabergoline, a well-established OHSS rat model supplemented with prolactin was used. A 100 microg/kg low-dose Dp-r2 agonist cabergoline reversed VEGFR-2-dependent VP without affecting luteal angiogenesis through partial inhibition of ovarian VEGFR-2 phosphorylation levels. No luteolytic effects (serum progesterone levels and luteal apoptosis unaffected) were observed. Cabergoline administration also did not affect VEGF/VEGFR-2 ovarian mRNA levels. Results in the animal model and the safe clinical profile of Dp-r2 agonists encouraged us to administer cabergoline to oocyte donors at high risk for developing the syndrome. Prophylactic administration of cabergoline (5-10 microg/kg x d) decreased the occurrence of OHSS from 65% (controls) to 25% (treatment). Therefore, a specific, safe treatment for OHSS is now available."

A proportion of at-risk pregnancies may be identified from abnormalities in first or second trimester serum screening data, uterine artery Doppler waveforms or placental shape and texture at the time of the 18-20-week anatomical examination. In combination, these tests may be capable of recognizing a subset of at-risk pregnancies with 50% positive predictive values. Early recognition before fetal viability affords opportunities to direct women to regional perinatal care centres for enhanced maternal-fetal surveillance, corticosteroids to enhance fetal lung maturation, prophylactic measures to prevent pre-eclampsia and optimal decision making around the time of delivery. The creation of regional screening programs to use screening data with a placental focus is likely to be cost-effective, because existing patterns of care are utilized. More importantly, this strategy can direct women to participate in clinical research programs designed to reduce morbidity and mortality from this common group of conditions."

Although, several cases of pheochromocytoma during pregnancy have been published, fetal and maternal mortalities due to undiagnosed cases are still reported. We report a case of a patient whose delivery by cesarean section was complicated by severe hemodynamic instability resulting in a cardiac arrest.

CD011053,0,19344306,0,Cerebral venous thrombosis.,"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) was formerly considered a rare disorder, associated with an unfavorable outcome. More recent data based on modern imaging techniques, however, have changed our perception of this disorder. The use of angiography and, especially, MRI have allowed an early diagnosis and have proved that the incidence of CVT is, in fact, higher than previously thought, approximately 3-4 cases per million people per year, and that the majority of patients have a favorable outcome. At present, the most frequent causes are oral contraceptives assumption and pregnancy/puerperium; as a consequence, 75% of patients are females. CVT may cause isolated intracranial hypertension or lead to an ischemic stroke, which does not follow the distribution of an arterial vessel and has a relevant vasogenic edema. Venous strokes often have a hemorrhagic component, ranging from small petechiae to an actual intracerebral hemorrhage; the latter is associated with a worse clinical course. The clinical presentation of CVT is highly variable and includes patients with just a mild headache, others with focal neurological deficits and a few with a dramatic syndrome with coma; seizures are a frequent presenting symptom. The best radiological examination to confirm the suspicion of CVT is MRI of the brain, which can both demonstrate parenchymal lesions and directly show evidence of sinus occlusions. The available evidence suggests that anticoagulants are effective in reducing mortality and dependency in CVT patients; the possible role of systemic or localized thrombolysis is still to be established."

CD011053,0,14515183,0,Homozygous and double heterozygous Factor V Leiden and Factor II G20210A genotypes predispose infants to thromboembolism but are not associated with an increase of foetal loss.,"Prospective and controlled data about the individual risk profile in asymptomatic children with homozygous or double heterozygous risk genotypes for Factor V Leiden (FVL) and factor II (FII) G20210A are currently unavailable. The systematic and prospective observational study presented here was designed to determine the impact of the homozygous and double heterozygous FVL and FII G20210A genotypes on the prenatal and postnatal risk profiles of affected children. Risk infants and heterozygous controls were identified by screening of 85,304 neonates. Follow-up included the comparison of prenatal and postnatal development, ultrasonography of brain and kidneys, and a panel of independent determinants of thrombophilia. The numbers of identified or expected FVL homozygotes and double heterozygotes did not differ significantly (FVL: 116 versus 91, p=0.08; FVL/FII: 94 versus 76, p=0.17), indicating the absence of a prenatal disadvantage. A prenatal advantage was suggested in FII homozygotes, whose identified number far exceeded the expected (19 versus 4, p=0.002). Clinical and/or imaging abnormalities indicated spontaneous thromboembolic events in 4 of 129 risk infants (3%) but in none of the 178 controls (p=0.02). Physical and neurological development was normal in both groups during the first 2 years of life. The risk genotypes appear to confer a significant predisposition for spontaneous thromboembolic events in infancy without impeding development within the first two years of life. Foetal risk genotypes do not cause an increased foetal loss rate. Moreover, homozygous FII G20210A appears to be associated with a prenatal advantage."

The blood coagulation factor VII (FVII) R353Q polymorphism increases the risk for venous thrombosis. Our aim was to investigate the association of FVII R353Q polymorphism with the risk of puerperal CVT. A total of 100 women with puerperal CVT and 102 age-matched women without postpartum complications were investigated. FVII R353Q genotypes were identified using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Our results showed that the homozygous FVII 353QQ genotype was present in 9% and 8% of patients and controls, respectively; and 42% of patients and 31.4% of controls had the heterozygous 353RQ genotype (odds ratio = 1.55, 95% confidence interval = 0.89-2.70; p = 0.243). Our findings suggest that the FVII R353Q polymorphism is not associated with increased risk for CVT occurring during the puerperal period in Indian women."
CD011053,0,14757156,0,Thromboxane A2 (TP) receptor in the non-pregnant porcine myometrium and its role in regulation of spontaneous contractile activity.,"Although there are species-related differences in uterine prostanoid receptor subtypes, functional prostanoid receptors in the porcine uterus are similar with those in the human uterus (FP, TP, EP(1), EP(2), EP(3), DP and IP) except for the TP receptor. These similarities promoted us to determine whether TP receptors are present in the non-pregnant porcine uterus. For this purpose, the effects of TP receptor agonists and antagonists were investigated by a contraction study and by a binding study. 9,11-Dideoxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-methanoepoxy-prosta-5Z,13E-dien-1-oic acid (U46619, 1 nM-10 microM), a stable thromboxane A(2) mimetic, caused tetrodotoxin-resistant contraction in both longitudinal and circular muscles of the uterine cornu. The pEC(50) value in the longitudinal muscle (6.69) was lower than that in the circular muscle (7.62), but the maximum response in the longitudinal muscle was two times larger than that in the circular muscle. The longitudinal and circular muscles of other regions (corpus and cervix) also responded to U46619, and region-related difference in contractile responses was observed only in the longitudinal muscles. 4(Z)-6-(2-o-Chlorophenyl-4-o-hydroxyphenyl-1,3-dioxan-cis-5-yl) hexenoic acid (ICI192605) and 7-[3-[[2-[(phenylamino)carbonyl] hydrazino]methyl]7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-,[1S-[1 alpha,2 alpha(Z),3 alpha,4 alpha]]-]5-heptenoic acid (SQ29548) inhibited the contractile responses to U46619 competitively. The longitudinal and circular muscles in the cornu contained a single class of [3H]SQ29548 binding site with similar K(d) values (30 nM), but B(max) in the circular muscle (90.9+/-8.6 fmol/mg protein) was two times higher than that in the longitudinal muscle (58.2+/-8.6 fmol/mg protein). The ranking order of competition by TP receptor agonists and antagonists (with pK(i) values in parentheses) was [1S-[1,2(Z),3(1E,3S*),4]]-7-[3-[3-Hydroxy-4-(4-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid (I-BOP, 7.70)>SQ29548 (7.39)>7-[3-(3-Hydroxy-1-octenyl)bicycle[3.1.1]hept-2-yl]-,[2S-[2 alpha(Z),3 beta(1E,3R*)]]-5-heptenoic acid (CTA(2), 6.55)>7-[3-(3-hydroxy-1-octenyl)-6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-yl-,[1S-[1 alpha,2 beta(Z),3 alpha(1E,3R*),5 alpha]]-5-heptenoic acid (PTA(2), 6.50)>U46619 (6.41)>7-[5-(3-hydroxy-1-octenyl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.1] hept-6yl]-,[1S-[1 alpha,4 alpha,5 alpha(1E,3R*),6 beta(Z)]]-5-heptenoic acid (U44069, 6.34), and this order is consistent with current TP receptors. Treatment with indomethacin (100 nM) and N-tert-butyl-N cent -[(2-cyclohexylamino-5-nitrobenzene) sulfonyl] urea (BM-531, 10 microM) inhibited the spontaneous contractile activities of both longitudinal and circular muscles. The present results indicate that contractile TP receptors are present in the non-pregnant porcine uterus. Therefore, the prostanoid receptor subtypes that exist in the porcine uterus (TP, IP, DP, FP, EP(1), EP(2) and EP(3)) are the same as those present in the human uterus. The distribution of TP receptors in the porcine uterus differed depending on the type of myometrium (longitudinal and circular muscles) and region of the uterus. The endogenous thromboxane A(2)-TP receptor pathway is thought to play a physiological role in regulation of spontaneous contractile activity in the porcine uterus."

The placental vasculature was sub-maximally pre-constricted by infusion of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine (NOLA) or the thromboxane A2-mimetic U46619. In the presence of continuous infusion of 59.3 mumol/l NOLA, producing a mean pressure increase of 43.7 +/- 1.7 mmHg (n = 8, mean +/- SEM), alpha-ANP (10.7 to 325 nmol/l) produced significant pressure decreases (P < 0.05). In separate experiments (U46619 was either infused at concentrations (4.8 to 21.4 nmol/l) to produce a mean pressure increase (50.1 +/- 2.6 mmHg, n = 10) similar to that produced by NOLA infusion or was infused at a concentration (28.5 nmol/l) that produced a significantly higher pressure increase (104 +/- 15 mmHg), infusion of 1 mumol/l alpha-ANP significantly reduced perfusion pressure. However, 100 nmol/l alpha-ANP or less had no significant effect (n = 4-7). These results indicate that alpha-ANP attenuates NOLA-induced and U46619-induced vasoconstriction in the human placenta, but at concentrations higher than those in fetal or maternal plasma."

When doing so, only one in five or six suspected cases actually will have the disease. A low estimate of the clinical probability in conjunction with a negative D-Dimer test may rule out the diagnosis in 40-50% of cases. All other patients need imaging procedures. Current standard of care for deep vein thrombosis is venous ultrasound of the leg, for pulmonary embolism it is CT pulmonary angiography.

The incidence rate of aortic dissection is 5 to 30 cases per million people a year. Acute aortic dissection is a highly lethal cardiovascular emergency with an incidence of 2000 new cases per year in the United States and 3000 in Europe. The mortality rate of aortic dissection is 3.2/100,000 per year. In case of sudden death of nonhospitalized patients, aortic dissection was proved in 1.5% of necropsy cases. Most of patients die within 48 hours after admission or 1.4% per each hour. The main clinical manifestations of aortic dissection are acute myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, acute heart failure, acute pancreatitis, mesenteries thrombosis, which mislead the physician. The main measure, which might reduce the mortality, is early diagnosis of aortic dissection. The standard diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and verification by instrumental (imaging) methods. An alternative mean for diagnosis of aortic dissection might be the determination of concentration of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain protein in blood serum, the peak of which is found after 3 hours after the onset of pain. Normal value of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain protein concentration is 2.5 microg/L, while in case of aortic dissection it exceeds 22.4 microg/L.

CD011053,0,21986993,0,Translational analysis of mouse and human placental protein and mRNA reveals distinct molecular pathologies in human preeclampsia.,"Preeclampsia (PE) adversely impacts ~5% of pregnancies. Despite extensive research, no consistent biomarkers or cures have emerged, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms may cause clinically similar disease. To address this, we undertook a proteomics study with three main goals: (1) to identify a panel of cell surface markers that distinguish the trophoblast and endothelial cells of the placenta in the mouse; (2) to translate this marker set to human via the Human Protein Atlas database; and (3) to utilize the validated human trophoblast markers to identify subgroups of human preeclampsia. To achieve these goals, plasma membrane proteins at the blood tissue interfaces were extracted from placentas using intravascular silica-bead perfusion, and then identified using shotgun proteomics. We identified 1181 plasma membrane proteins, of which 171 were enriched at the maternal blood-trophoblast interface and 192 at the fetal endothelial interface with a 70% conservation of expression in humans. Three distinct molecular subgroups of human preeclampsia were identified in existing human microarray data by using expression patterns of trophoblast-enriched proteins. Analysis of all misexpressed genes revealed divergent dysfunctions including angiogenesis (subgroup 1), MAPK signaling (subgroup 2), and hormone biosynthesis and metabolism (subgroup 3). Subgroup 2 lacked expected changes in known preeclampsia markers (sFLT1, sENG) and uniquely overexpressed GNA12. In an independent set of 40 banked placental specimens, GNA12 was overexpressed during preeclampsia when co-incident with chronic hypertension. In the current study we used a novel translational analysis to integrate mouse and human trophoblast protein expression with human microarray data. This strategy identified distinct molecular pathologies in human preeclampsia. We conclude that clinically similar preeclampsia patients exhibit divergent placental gene expression profiles thus implicating divergent molecular mechanisms in the origins of this disease."
CD011053,0,15974882,0,"The pharmacologic approach to the prevention of preeclampsia: from antiplatelet, antithrombosis and antioxidant therapy to anticonvulsants.","Preeclampsia has been suggested to be a two-stage disorder of an alteration in placental perfusion (stage 1) leading to generalized vascular endothelial damage (stage 2). Because the mechanism linking the two stages remains unclear, effective primary prevention is still impossible. However, advances made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia have paved the way for secondary and tertiary prevention approaches. Platelets are known to be activated in early pregnancy. They also play a pivotal role in the process of inflammation, as demonstrated by the finding that CD40 ligand is shed from activated platelets to directly initiate inflammation of the vessel wall. According to the Cochrane Library Update summarizing data from over 30,000 women, secondary prevention with antiplatelet drugs is associated with a 19% decrease in the risk of preeclampsia. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the association between preeclampsia and thrombophilia. The effect of the antithrombotic agent heparin on pregnancy outcome in preeclampsia and its potential preventive action in high-risk patients need to be elucidated. One of the several hypotheses of the pathogenesis of preeclampsia focuses on the oxidative stress caused by the imbalance in prooxidant and antioxidant forces. Preliminary findings on vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation in preeclamptic women are encouraging, and suggest a rationale for larger clinical trials. Although there is currently no explanation for the positive effect of magnesium sulfate on eclamptic seizures, studies have provided enough evidence to encourage its worldwide use as the primary anticonvulsant of choice in the tertiary prevention of maternal and perinatal death in severe preeclampsia/eclampsia. In conclusion, secondary and tertiary prevention of preeclampsia is possible when targeted at reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality."

CD011053,0,19230779,0,Managing acute collapse in pregnant women.,"The most important causes of acute collapse in pregnancy are pulmonary embolism, amniotic fluid embolism, acute coronary syndrome, thrombosed mechanical prosthetic heart valves, acute aortic dissection, cerebrovascular incidents and anaesthetic complications like failed intubation, anaphylaxis, and problems relating to regional or local anaesthetic agents. The management is based on supporting the different organ systems that are affected. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is based on a clinical suspicion supported by certain diagnostic test. Tests like D-dimers have their limitations and cannot be used alone to exclude the diagnosis especially when there is a high clinical suspicion. The choice of the best diagnostic tool is based upon weighing long-term risks to both mother and foetus on the one side and delaying the diagnosis on the other side. The management of acute coronary syndrome is based on immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. Although there are reports of the use of clopidrogel in pregnancy, there are few data on its effect on the foetus. There is no clinical evidence for fibrinolytic therapy as a reperfusion strategy in pregnancy and it is best avoided as the risk of haemorrhage outweighs the possible benefit of treatment. Patients with a prosthetic heart valve that present with a disappearance of the prosthetic heart sounds or a new murmur should get an urgent cardiac ultrasound to rule out a thrombosed prosthetic valve.

CD011053,0,25450587,0,Early disturbed placental ischemia and hypoxia creates immune alteration and vascular disorder causing preeclampsia.,"Preterm preeclampsia (PE) remains a leading cause of maternal death and perinatal morbidity. The pathophysiological process that underlies PE has been proposed to occur in two episodes, the first is a reduced placental perfusion and then the maternal clinical syndrome. Placental ischemia/hypoxia is believed to result in the release of a variety of placental factors such as cytokines including TNF-Œ± and interleukin 6, activated circulating immune cells and autoantibodies that have profound effects on blood flow and arterial pressure regulation. PE is also associated with decreased formation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin. It is accompanied by widespread maternal vascular dysfunction and a chronic inflammatory response. Additionally, anti-angiogenic peptides are released, inhibiting vascular remodeling essential for increased blood flow to the growing uteroplacental unit. Although these factors accompany the clinical syndrome of PE, it is suggested that they are secondary to the maternal decrease in placental blood flow. Experimental evidence has demonstrated the importance of these soluble factors to increase blood pressure and stimulate the production of such anti-angiogenic factors, thereby eliciting a vicious cycle existing within the maternal vasculature as well as within the placental unit. These alterations in vascular function not only lead to hypertension but to multi-organ dysfunction. The quantitative importance of the various endothelial and humoral factors that mediate vascular dysfunction and hypertension during PE remains to be elucidated."

The most common genetic predispositions include autosomal dominant inheritance coagulative factors deficiencies, such as antithrombin III (AT III), C protein (CP), S protein (SP), G20210A mutation, hyperomocystinemia and the activated C protein resistance, caused by factor V Leiden mutation. Maternal thromboembolism as an inherited coagulopathy expression, may be associated with high fetal-maternal morbidity and mortality rate. Nowadays, a wide screening is not possible, but the patients with previous or familiar deep venous thrombosis episodes should at least undergo very careful examinations.

CD011053,0,17644567,0,Systemic hemodynamic and regional blood flow changes in response to chronic reductions in uterine perfusion pressure in pregnant rats.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is associated with increased total peripheral resistance (TPR), reduced cardiac output (CO), and diminished uterine and placental blood flow. We have developed an animal model that employs chronic reductions in uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) in pregnant rats to generate a ""preeclamptic-like"" state during late gestation that is characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction. Although this animal model has many characteristics of human PE, the systemic hemodynamic and regional changes in blood flow that occur in response to chronic RUPP remains unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that RUPP would decrease uteroplacental blood flow and CO, and increase TPR. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), CO, cardiac index (CI), TPR, and regional blood flow to various tissues were measured using radiolabeled microspheres in the following two groups of conscious rats: normal pregnant rats (NP; n = 8) and RUPP rats (n = 8). MAP was increased (132 +/- 4 vs. 99 +/- 3 mmHg) in the RUPP rats compared with the NP dams. The hypertension in RUPP rats was associated with increased TPR (2.15 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.98 +/- 0.08 mmHg x ml(-1) x min(-1)) and decreased CI (246 +/- 20 vs. 348 +/- 19 ml x min(-1) x kg(-1), P < 0.002) when contrasted with NP dams. Furthermore, uterine (0.16 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.09 ml x min(-1) x g tissue(-1)) and placental blood flow (0.30 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.10 ml x min(-1) x g tissue(-1)) were decreased in RUPP compared with the NP dams. These data demonstrate that the RUPP model of pregnancy-induced hypertension has systemic hemodynamic and regional blood flow alterations that are strikingly similar to those observed in women with PE."

CD011053,0,8739592,0,Prenatal diagnosis of thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome.,"Thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a thrombocytopenia and a bilateral radial aplasia with normal thumbs. Only TAR syndrome, out of diseases which may present with radial aplasia, typically has normal thumbs. The prenatal diagnosis is rarely made. We report two observations of TAR syndrome diagnosed in utero in the sibling. The malposition of fetal hands detectable as soon as 11 weeks of gestation requires careful search for longitudinal limb defect of the forearm, especially radial ray defect. The radial aplasia is associated with numerous causes (chromosomal, teratogenic, genetic, multifactorial). The determination of fetal hematologic values revealing a thrombocytopenia allows the prenatal diagnosis of the index case of TAR syndrome."
CD011053,0,13677267,0,Pregnancy-associated thrombosis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs infrequently but is a leading cause of illness and death during pregnancy and the puerperium. In the general population the incidence of pregnancy associated VTE is approximately 1 in 1500 deliveries The risk of VTE is five times higher in a pregnant than in a non-pregnant woman. Postpartum the VTE-risk is even higher. Women with congenital abnormalities or persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies have an increased risk of VTE during pregnancy and the puerperium. In individuals with well defined hereditary thrombosis risk factors, such as the factor V:R506Q mutation, the factor II:G20210A variation, antithrombin-deficiency or protein C-deficiency, a relative risk of pregnancy associated VTE between 3.4 and 15.2 has been found. Women with previous VTE have an approximately 3.5 fold increased risk of recurrent VTE during pregnancy compared to non-pregnant periods. Our ability to diagnose pregnancy-associated VTE clinically is generally poor, since dyspnea, tachypnea, swelling and discomfort in the legs are common. Objective diagnosis is essential for treatment decisions. Exposure to radiation of less than 50,000 microGy (5 rad) has not been associated with a significant risk of fetal injury Therefore, besides sonography, routine diagnostic procedures should be performed, if clinically necessary. Heparin does not cross the placenta and is therefore the anticoagulant of choice. In case of acute thrombosis during pregnancy, treatment is performed like in nonpregnant patients. There is ongoing debate, whether or not pregnant women with previous venous thrombosis should routinely receive prophylactic anticoagulation. In patients who have hereditary antithrombin deficiency, antiphospholipid antibodies, a combined abnormality or a history of a severe thrombotic event (pulmonary embolism, extended deep vein thrombosis) should be advised to use prophylactic heparin during pregnancy, starting during the first trimester. Post partum prophylaxis should be given in all women with an increased risk for VTE."

Decreased perfusion and local ischemia resulting in neonatal gangrene may result from the greater propensity for intravascular thrombosis in infants whose mothers have diabetes mellitus.

Other clinical features of this disease are cytopenia and an increased frequency of thrombotic events. We report a case of a pregnant woman with PNH on high-dosage anticoagulation therapy, the follow-up during the pregnancy, the delivery and the postpartum period. The obstetric literature on women with PNH is reviewed, the maternal and fetal risks are evaluated and the management of pregnancies and deliveries in such patients are discussed. During the pregnancy our patient was hypertransfused and used anticoagulation treatment. A healthy child was delivered in week 37 by cesarean section because of premature rupture of the membranes, unsuccessful induction and intrauterine infection. Because of bleeding problems a hysterectomy also had to be performed. In the postpartum period the patient developed her second episode of a liver vein thrombosis. She recovered gradually and 18 months after the delivery her disease is now in a stable phase. The literature shows a high maternal morbidity and mortality among pregnant PNH patients. Fetal wastage and prematurity rate are also high. Pregnancy in patients with PNH represents a high-risk situation for both the mother and the child and should not be recommended. A pregnant PNH woman should be followed closely by both obstetricians and hematologists."

CD011053,0,18677532,0,Failed retrieval of an inferior vena cava filter during pregnancy because of filter tilt: report of two cases.,"Thromboembolic disease during pregnancy is an important cause of obstetric morbidity and mortality. Pregnant patients with venous thromboembolism are usually managed by conventional anticoagulation. However, this must be discontinued during vaginal or caesarian delivery to avoid haemorrhage and to reduce the risk of possible epidural haematoma. Retrievable inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) offer protection against pulmonary embolism during this high-risk period, when anticoagulation is discontinued, while avoiding potential long-term sequelae of a permanent IVCF. Here we report two patients who presented in the third trimester of pregnancy with floating ileofemoral deep vein thrombosis. Both patients were initially treated with standard anticoagulation; however, shortly before delivery both patients had a retrievable IVCF placed in a suprarenal position. In both patients, retrieval failed at 28 days after insertion because of filter tilt. The timing and mechanism of filter tilt remains uncertain. We believe that a number of factors could have been involved, including change in the anatomic configuration with lateral displacement of the IVCF as a result of the gravid uterus as well as forceful uterine contractions during labour, which modified the shape and diameter of the IVC. We showed that failure to retrieve the IVCF has had considerable implications for the two young patients regarding long-term anticoagulation and have highlighted the need for further clinical trials regarding the safe use of retrievable IVCFs during pregnancy."

CD011053,0,8722850,0,Advantage of Inoue balloon catheter in mitral balloon valvotomy: experience with 220 consecutive patients.,"Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMV) using the Inoue balloon catheter was attempted in 220 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic mitral stenosis. Their age range was 10-63 mean 30 +/- 10 years; 161 patients were females and 59 were males; 29 patients were in atrial fibrillation. Eleven patients were pregnant; 14 patients underwent previous surgical commissurotomy. The procedure was technically successfully performed in 215 (97.7%) patients. The mean fluoroscopy time was 15.5 +/- 6.4 min and mean procedure time was 109 +/- 79 min. Optimal results (group I) was achieved in 207 patients who have mitral score of 7 +/- 1. PMV resulted in decrease in left atrial pressure from 23 +/- 5 to 14 +/- 4 mm Hg (P < 0.001), the mean mitral valve gradient (MVG) decreased from 15 +/- 4 to 6 +/- 3 mm Hg (P < 0.001). The mitral valve area (MVA) by catheter increased from 0.7 +/- 0.2 to 1.7 +/- 0.5 cm2 (P < 0.001) and MVA as determined by echocardiography (2DE) increased from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.9 +/- 0.3 cm2 (P < 0.001). The results were suboptimal in eight patients who have a mitral score of 10 +/- 1 (group II) MVA by catheter increased from 0.7 +/- 0.2 to 1 +/- 0.1 cm2 and Doppler MVA increased from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.3 +/- 0.1 cm2. There were no deaths or thromboembolism. Two patients developed cardiac tamponade; mild mitral regurgitation (MR) developed in 24 patients (11%) and increased by one grade in another 22 patients (10%). Severe MR was encountered in three patients (1.4%). A small ASD (QP/QS < or = 1.3) was detected by oximetry in 5% of patients and by color-flow mapping in 26% of patients. One hundred fifty-eight patients from group I were followed up, for a mean of 32 +/- 12 months; MVA remained at 1.7 +/- 0.4 cm2. Seven patients developed mitral restenosis in group I, and 5 out of 8 patients developed restenosis in group II. We conclude that the hemodynamic results are good and comparable with those reported with double balloon technique. However, the Inoue balloon has several advantages over the double balloon technique: (1) low incidence of mitral regurgitation and ASDs; (2) shorter procedure and fluoroscopy time; and (3) low complication rates and the valve anatomy affects the immediate and late outcome of mitral balloon valvotomy."

The paper presents a study of prevalence and clinical significance of IgG aPE in 28 patients (22 women and 6 men, mean age 47.6 +/- 11.6 years) with Sneddon's syndrome (SS), which consists in cerebrovascular disturbances and extensive livedo reticularis. IgG aPE were detected by immune-enzyme assay. The upper normal limit, calculated as mean + 3SD after studying 19 healthy donors, was 0.303 optic density units. aPE were found in 15 (54%), aKL and/or lupus anticoagulant (LA)--in 6 (21%) patients with SS. aPE were found in 10 (46%) out of 22 aKL- and LA-negative patients. Among the aPE-positive patients there was a higher incidence of cortic dementia (53% vs. 8%, p = 0.02), the widening of cortical sulci, detected by means of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (73% vs. 31%, p = 0.05), and mild renal syndrome (73% vs. 16%, p = 0.03). Besides, they displayed a higher rate of headaches (87% vs. 62%), chorea (33% vs. 8%), epilepsy (27% vs. 8%), non-carrying of pregnancy (91% vs. 50%), peripheral venous thrombosis (27% vs. 15%), coronary heart disease (47% vs. 31%), cardiac valvular thickening, detected by means of EchoCG (93% vs. 69%), arterial hypertension (87% vs. 54%), thrombocytopenia (20% vs. 0), anemia (40% vs. 15%); however, the difference was not significant. The results show that aPE detection, performed in addition to detection of classic immunological antiphospholipid syndrome markers (aKL and LA), increases the portion of aPE-positive patients with SS by 33%. aPE are often (in 46% of cases) found in aKL- and LA-negative patients with SS. aPE is likely to be the most significant factor of thrombosis in small arteries of the brain cortex and kidneys, which could explain their association with dementia and renal syndrome."
CD011053,0,25774504,0,Maternal anti-platelet Œ≤3 integrins impair angiogenesis and cause intracranial hemorrhage.,"Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a life-threatening disease in which intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the major risk. Although thrombocytopenia, which is caused by maternal antibodies against Œ≤3 integrin and occasionally by maternal antibodies against other platelet antigens, such as glycoprotein GPIbŒ±, has long been assumed to be the cause of bleeding, the mechanism of ICH has not been adequately explored. Utilizing murine models of FNAIT and a high-frequency ultrasound imaging system, we found that ICH only occurred in fetuses and neonates with anti-Œ≤3 integrin-mediated, but not anti-GPIbŒ±-mediated, FNAIT, despite similar thrombocytopenia in both groups. Only anti-Œ≤3 integrin-mediated FNAIT reduced brain and retina vessel density, impaired angiogenic signaling, and increased endothelial cell apoptosis, all of which were abrogated by maternal administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). ICH and impairment of retinal angiogenesis were further reproduced in neonates by injection of anti-Œ≤3 integrin, but not anti-GPIbŒ± antisera. Utilizing cultured human endothelial cells, we found that cell proliferation, network formation, and AKT phosphorylation were inhibited only by murine anti-Œ≤3 integrin antisera and human anti-HPA-1a IgG purified from mothers with FNAIT children. Our data suggest that fetal hemostasis is distinct and that impairment of angiogenesis rather than thrombocytopenia likely causes FNAIT-associated ICH. Additionally, our results indicate that maternal IVIG therapy can effectively prevent this devastating disorder."

CD011053,0,9732087,0,"Recurrent miscarriage: causes, evaluation, and treatment.","Recurrent miscarriage or fetal loss syndrome (also known as fetal wastage syndrome) is characterized by recurrent spontaneous abortion. There are many syndromes associated with recurrent fetal loss, including anatomic anomalies, endocrine/hormonal abnormalities, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, and blood coagulation protein/platelet defects. Many of these syndromes are treatable, leading to normal term pregnancy, if the clinician is astute and vigorously pursues a thorough evaluation of why the patient has suffered unexplained, spontaneous miscarriages. There is no uniform agreement on how many spontaneous, unexplained miscarriages are needed to diagnose recurrent fetal loss; we generally pursue an evaluation for causation if a women has had 2 or more such events. In this article, we discuss the common reasons for recurrent fetal loss, plus diagnostic procedures to consider in pinpointing the problem, such as cytogenetic studies, blood coagulation protein/platelet tests, hysterosalpingography, sonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. We also describe management strategies that often lead to successful pregnancy outcome when the underlying problem is addressed. For example, in the case of thrombotic defects, a common cause of recurrent fetal loss, we report a 100% success rate in achieving a normal-term delivery among women who took low-dose (81 mg/day) aspirin preconception followed by postconception low-dose (5000 units q 12 h) heparin."

CD011053,0,16549345,0,Investigating suspected pulmonary embolism during pregnancy.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the commonest cause of maternal death in UK. It is a frequently occurring diagnostic challenge. The false negative and false positive rates for the diagnosis of PE are spectacularly high. Undiagnosed PE has a mortality rate as high as 30%, which falls to 2-8% if the condition is diagnosed and treated appropriately. [Rodger M, Wells PS. Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

Physiologic changes of pregnancy further complicate the diagnosis of PE. Although the danger of maternal and foetal death secondary to maternal PE and unnecessary anticoagulation far outweighs the risk of radiation involved in scanning, doctors still hesitate to request appropriate investigation because of concern regarding radiation exposure to the foetus and the absence of any clear, updated guideline. Worried parents need to be counselled appropriately before tests to alleviate anxiety and misunderstanding."
CD011053,0,19065909,0,[Ocular changes in preeclampsia].,"The pregnancy is associated with modifications involving multiple systems and organs, including the eye. The retinal vascular changes are present in 30-100% of the PE cases. The most frequent ocular modification is the vasoconstriction of the retinal arterioles. The exudative retinal detachment is a rare cause (under 1%) of visual loss in the PE-E syndrome, being produced by the involvement of the choroidal vascularization. Most cases of blindness during pregnancy have been determined by cortical, occipital anomalies, the used terminology in these circumstances being cortical blindness. The pathogenesis of the Purtscher retinopathy is the embolism of the retinal arterioles, by leucocytic aggregation, as a response to the activation of the complement. The evaluation of the ophthalmic arterial flow by eco Doppler might offer new perspectives regarding the understanding of the physiopathology, the diagnosis and the quantification of the PE severity. The decrease of the IP values and the increase of the median velocity in the ophthalmic artery in pregnant women with PE, suggest a hyperperfusion process and the decrease of the vascular resistances at the level of the orbital vessels, but also in the CNS. In the severe forms of PE, the increase of the impedance of the orbital vessels has been noted. The described vascular changes cannot disappear completely 6 weeks after birth; a residual arteriolar constriction might persist, as a permanent stigma of the PE. The evaluation, monitoring, therapeutical approach of the patients with PE must be performed by a complete team: obstetrician, ophthalmologist, neurologist, radiologist, in order to decrease the materno-fetal risks and improve the prognosis of PE."

Humoral factors such as estrogen, which increases in the placenta and maternal circulation throughout human pregnancy, may regulate these vascular beds as studies of animal arteries have shown that 17Œ≤-estradiol, or agonists of estrogen receptors (ER), can exert acute vasodilatory actions. The aim of this study was to compare how acute exposure to ER-specific agonists, and 17Œ≤-estradiol, altered human placental and uterine arterial tone in vitro. Uterine and placental arteries were isolated from biopsies obtained from women with uncomplicated pregnancy delivering a singleton infant at term. Vessels were mounted on a wire myograph, exposed to the thromboxane receptor agonist U46619 (10(-6) M), and then incubated with incremental doses (5 min, 0.03-30 ¬µM) of either 17Œ≤-estradiol or agonists specific for the ERs ERŒ± (PPT), ERŒ≤ (DPN) or the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER-1 (G1). ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ mRNA expression was assessed. 17Œ≤-estradiol, PPT and DPN each relaxed myometrial arteries (P < 0.05) in a manner that was partly endothelium-dependent. In contrast, 17Œ≤-estradiol or DPN relaxed placental arteries (maximum relaxation to 42 ¬± 1.1 or 47.6 ¬± 6.53% of preconstriction, respectively) to a lesser extent than myometrial arteries (to 0.03 ¬± 0.03 or 8.0 ¬± 1.0%) and in an endothelial-independent manner whereas PPT was without effect. G1 exposure did not inhibit the constriction of myometrial nor placenta arteries. mRNA expression of ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ was greater in myometrial arteries than placental arteries. ER-specific agonists, and 17Œ≤-estradiol, differentially modulate the tone of uterine versus placental arteries highlighting that estrogen may regulate human uteroplacental blood flow in a tissue-specific manner."

In the presented case a very large placental hemangioma was connected with polyhydramnios, premature delivery, fetal anemia and thrombocytopenia, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein elevation and congenital lactic acidosis. After delivery a severe state of the newborn was caused by oligovolemic shock. In the course of the disease the neonatal state steadily deteriorated mainly because of sepsis, cerebral hemorrhage and metabolic acidosis despite adequate therapy. The organic acids assessment in the blood serum of a newborn child showed a very strong signal of lactic acid and an increase in parahydroksyfenylolactic acid. Postmortal examination confirmed prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and cerebral hemorrhage. These symptoms probably resulted from the presence of a placental tumor of considerable size of 12 cm and congenital lactic acidosis, which to our knowledge, have not been described in the available literature until now. In conclusion it should be underlined, that there exists difficult to explain relationship between the presence of a placental haemangioma and severe metabolic changes resulting in high mortality and morbidity of the newborn."
CD011053,0,21972999,0,Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy and the postpartum period.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy and the postpartum is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality; yet, there are few robust data from clinical trials to inform an approach to diagnosis and management. Failure to investigate symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism (PE) is a consistent finding in maternal death enquiries, and clinical symptoms should not be relied on to exclude or diagnose VTE. In this consensus statement, we present our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE. All women with suspected DVT in pregnancy should be investigated with whole leg compression ultrasonography. If the scan is negative and significant clinical suspicion remains, then further imaging for iliofemoral DVT maybe required. Imaging should be undertaken in all women with suspected PE, as the fetal radiation exposure with both ventilation/perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography is within safe limits. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred therapy for acute VTE that occur during pregnancy. In observational cohort studies, using once-daily regimens appears adequate, in particular with the LMWH tinzaparin; however, pharmacokinetic data support twice-daily therapy with other LMWH and is recommended, at least initially, for PE or iliofemoral DVT in pregnancy. Treatment should continue for a minimum duration of six months, and until at least six weeks postpartum. Induction of labour or planned caesarean section maybe required to allow an appropriate transition to unfractionated heparin to avoid delivery in women in therapeutic doses of anticoagulation."

Because of the severity of the thrombocytopenia, some of these infants will have intracranial hemorrhage with resultant long-term disability. Obstetricians and neonatologists have recommended delivery by caesarean section and the rapid institution of appropriate treatment for the infant; however, it is theoretically possible that a hemorrhagic event could precede the delivery and consequently not be prevented by these perinatal interventions. In this report we describe a neonate in whom the diagnosis of alloimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia was suspected because of antenatal ultrasound evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. This case demonstrates the importance of antenatal fetal assessment and indicates the need for the development of therapeutic strategies to maintain fetal hemostasis."

Recently there are few reports about a thrombolytic therapy use in parturient in medical publications. The article deals with a case of successful application of thrombolysis in a complex cardio-pulmonary resuscitation in parturient with massive pulmonary thromboembolism. Unexpected dyspnea and hypotension occurred in the 30 years old woman after elective caesarian operation. Syndrome S1-Q3 was fixed on an ECG monitor. Cardiac arrest was fixed in 10 minutes later. Streptokinase was administrated in a 1 hour after beginning of the resuscitation. Haemodynamic parameters recovered almost after the administration of streptokinase. Severe uterine bleeding occurred in 20 minutes after the administration. Uterine extirpation and tight tamponade of the small pelvis was performed for the bleeding stopping. Later a floating thrombus was diagnosed in the right femoral vein. Tromboectomy was performed. Convulsions had place on first and second day after the resuscitation. Cerebral edema was diagnosed by computed tomography. Consciousness occurred on the fourth day and the woman was weaned from the ventilator on the fifth day. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 20th day without neurological complications.

Pulsed wave Doppler was used to sample the uterine arcuate artery system beneath the placenta within 8 days of delivery in 47 patients with type I diabetes mellitus. A placental pathologist, without knowledge of either clinical outcome or Doppler information, classified the histological appearance of the decidual arteries as normal, type A (hyalinization, mural thickening), or type B (fibrinoid necrosis, atherosis, thrombosis). Patients were then grouped according to the histology of the decidual arteries. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratios (log.

Chest radiography and computed tomography showed bilateral multiple infiltrative shadows over the lung field. After an initial diagnosis of pneumonia, antibiotics were administered, but the therapy failed to improve the symptoms and abnormalities observed on the chest radiograph. The patient was then admitted to our hospital. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was slightly bloody, but we were not able to make any specific findings in BALF. In order to confirm the pathological diagnosis, video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy was performed aiming at the right middle and lower lobes. There were bleeding pulmonary infarctions in a biopsy specimen from the right middle lobe. Atypical cells positive for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) proliferated in the pulmonary arteries, and so a diagnosis of pulmonary embolic metastasis of choriocarcinoma was made. After the diagnosis, it became clear that urine and serum hCG values were very high. The patient has since received systemic chemotherapy in the gynecology unit at our hospital. Pulmonary embolic metastasis of choriocarcinoma diagnosed by video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy has never been reported in the literature. However, early hCG measurement may have detected this syndrome in the earlier stages, and pulmonary metastasis of choriocarcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of women with past pregnancy presenting with intractable multiple pulmonary shadows."

Our hypothesis: IIH results in part from inadequate drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resulting from thrombotic obstruction to CSF resorption-outflow, favored by thrombophilia-hypofibrinolysis. We conducted the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and assessed serologic coagulation measures in 65 women (64 of them white) with IIH, PCR in 102 healthy white female controls (72 children, 30 age-matched adults), and serologic measures in the 30 adults. Of the 65 patients, 37 (57%) were found to have PCOS; 16 (43%) were obese (BMI > or = 30 to < 40), and 19 (51%) were extremely obese (BMI > or = 40). Of the 65 women with IIH, 25 (38%) were homozygous for the thrombophilic C677T MTHFR mutation, compared with 14% of controls (14/102) ( P = .0002). Thrombophilic high concentrations of factor VIII (>150%) were present in 9 of 65 (14%) IIH cases, compared with 0 of 30 controls (0%) (Fisher's p [p f ] = .053). An increased concentration of lipoprotein A (> or = 35 mg/dL), associated with hypofibrinolysis, was present in 19 of 65 IIH cases (29%), compared with 3 of 30 controls (10%) (p f = .039). IIH occurred in 18 of 65 IIH patients taking estrogen-progestin contraceptives (28%), in 6 patients taking hormone-replacement therapy (9%), and in 5 pregnant subjects (8%). We speculate that PCOS, associated with obesity and extreme obesity, is a treatable promoter of IIH. We also speculate that if thrombophilia-hypofibrinolysis and subsequent thrombosis are associated with reduced CSF resorption in the arachnoid villi of the brain, thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis-often exacerbated by thrombophilic exogenous estrogens, pregnancy, or the paradoxical hyperestrogenemia of PCOS-are treatable promoters of IIH."

CD011053,0,25073867,0,Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: update on diagnosis and management.,"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is less frequent than ischemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage. Its incidence is comparable to that of acute bacterial meningitis in adults. Because of the increased use of magnetic resonance imaging (MR) for investigating patients with acute and subacute headaches and new onset seizures, CVT are now being diagnosed with increasing frequency. CVT have a more varied clinical presentation than other stroke types as they rarely present as a stroke syndrome. Their most frequent presentations are isolated headache, intracranial hypertension syndrome, seizures, a focal lobar syndrome and encephalopathy. The confirmation of the diagnosis of CVT relies on the demonstration of thrombi in the cerebral veins and/or sinuses by MR/MR venography or veno CT. The more frequent risk factors for CVT are prothrombotic conditions, either genetic or acquired, oral contraceptives, puerperium and pregnancy, infection and malignancy. The prognosis of CVT is in general favourable, as only around 15% of the patients remain dependent or die. The main intervention in the acute is anticoagulation with either low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin. In patients in severe condition on admission or who deteriorate despite anticoagulation, local thrombolysis or thrombectomy is an option. Decompressive surgery is life-saving in patients with large venous infarcts or haemorrhage. After the acute phase patients remain anticoagulated for a variable period of time, depending on their inherent thrombotic risk. CVT patients may experience recurrent seizures. Prophylaxis with antiepileptics is recommended after the first seizures, in particular in those with hemispheric lesions. There are several ongoing multicentre registries sand trials which will improve evidence-based management of CVT in the near future."

Cardiovascular risk factors may mediate vascular dysfunction both during pregnancy but also later in life. This study aims to investigate microvascular reactivity, and its relationship with several cardiovascular risk factors, in women with a history of preeclampsia and controls. In this cross-sectional study we compared women with a history of preeclampsia (PE, n=22) with women with uneventful pregnancies only (CON, n=29) 23 years after their first delivery. Participants were matched for BMI, age and date of delivery. We assessed blood concentrations of fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin, (total, HDL-, LDL-) cholesterol, triglycerides and CRP. Endothelial function was assessed by measurement of skin microcirculatory blood flow by Laser Doppler flowmetry at the dorsal and ventral site of the finger during post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH). PE had higher fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR compared with CON. The PORH response was similar in both groups. The area under the curve of PORH correlated with insulin and HOMA-IR at both sites, with BMI, triglycerides at the dorsal site and with CRP at the ventral site of the finger in PE and not in CON. In conclusion, 23 years after pregnancy we did not observe a difference in the microvascular hyperemic response between women with a history of preeclampsia and controls. Meanwhile, the results of our study suggest that insulin resistance and other cardiovascular risk factors are related to microvascular reactivity in middle-aged women with a history of preeclampsia."

CD011053,0,7788238,0,Technical note: compression stockings and posture: a comparative study of their effects on the proximal deep veins of the leg at rest.,"Graduated compression stockings have been shown to reduce the incidence of deep venous thrombosis. While they are thought to act primarily by increasing venous flow velocity, their mode of action remains uncertain. Doppler ultrasound was employed to study the relative effects of three types of support stocking on the deep venous diameter, flow velocity and pulsatility in 10 non-pregnant female subjects. In addition, the effect of altered posture on the same parameters was assessed. Significant effects of the graduated stockings were found at the level of the popliteal vein, where a reduction in both the diameter and the amplitude of respiratory phasicity was recorded (p < 0.05). No significant increase in flow velocities was recorded. Adopting the left lateral position significantly increased flow velocity in the right common femoral vein (p < 0.05). The application of stockings in this position produced no additional increase in flow velocities, but did alter the amplitude of respiratory phasicity. These data do not support the widely held view that graduated compression stockings increase flow velocities at rest. Adopting a lateral recumbent position significantly increases flow velocity in the non-dependent leg."

Investigations included clinical examination, listing of symptoms and plethysmography, venous pressure and Doppler ultrasound. At follow-up there were clinical signs or symptoms of venous insufficiency in 35% of the legs with earlier DVT but in none of the non-thrombosed contralateral legs. Objective evidence of venous insufficiency was present in 15 (65%) of the legs with earlier DVT and in only five (22%) of the non-thrombosed legs. The differences between thrombosed and non-thrombosed legs are statistically significant. There was no correlation between objectively measured venous insufficiency and extent of the DVT. It is concluded that a DVT during pregnancy often leads to venous insufficiency and the risk seems to be higher than after DVT occurring in other groups of patients."

Since its introduction practitioners have increasingly utilized fetal ultrasonography for the management of pre-eclampsia. Ultrasonographic diagnostic modalities including fetal biometric growth curves, the biophysical profile and umbilical artery Doppler have been used to detect fetal growth restriction and assess fetal wellbeing, respectively.

We investigated the effect of LMWH on the pregnancy outcome, on maternal blood pressure values, and on uteroplacental flow in ACE DD nonthrombophilic women with history of preeclampsia. Eighty nonthrombophilic ACE DD women were randomized in 2 groups: 41 treated with dalteparin 5000 IU/day and 39 untreated (control group). Women underwent 24-hour automated blood pressure monitoring in the preconceptional period and every 2 weeks from weeks 8 to 36 and transabdominal color flow/pulsed Doppler examination at weeks 16, 20, and 24. LMWH reduced the risk of clinical negative outcomes (74.1% reduction of preeclampsia and 77.5% reduction of fetal growth restriction) and the severity (88.3% reduction of early onset of preeclampsia and 86.4% reduction of early onset of fetal growth restriction). In treated women, the relative risk for preeclampsia was 0.26 (P=0.02), and the relative risk for fetal growth restriction was 0.14 (P<0.001). Systolic (P=0.002) and diastolic (P=0.002) blood pressures, as well as awake (P=0.04) and asleep (P=0.01) period values, and the resistance indexes of both uterine arteries (P=0.002) were lower in the treated group. LMWH reduces the recurrence of preeclampsia, of negative outcomes, and the resistance of uteroplacental flow, and also prevents maternal blood pressure increase in ACE DD homozygote women with a previous history of preeclampsia."

Documentation of an association between the risk of such adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and inherited thrombophilias prompted initial studies to evaluate the benefit of anticoagulants for the prevention of recurrences both in patients with and without inherited thrombophilias. Prenatal administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been evaluated in case control, cohort and randomized clinical trials. The evidence suggests a benefit of LMWH in the reduction of recurrences of APOs, with a number needed to treat of 6 (95% confidence interval: 4-10) to prevent one case of recurrent APOs. Such benefit is independent of the presence of inherited thrombophilias or the administration of low dose aspirin. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal duration for the prophylaxis, to better delineate the mechanism of action of LMWH and to explore the role, if any, of maternal serum markers and uterine artery Doppler findings in the modulation of the LMWH prophylaxis."

It can predispose to life-threatening complications due to torsion of its vascular pedicle, splenic infarction, portal hypertension, and haemorrhage. A 27-year-old, 36-week prima gravida underwent emergency caesarean section for tachycardia and hypotension. A healthy baby girl was delivered. However, she remained shocked despite aggressive fluid therapy and intraoperatively it was noted that there was significant intraperitoneal bleeding and the on-call surgical team was summoned. Midline laparotomy revealed a lacerated, infarcted, hypermobile spleen found with free intraperitoneal bleeding. The unsalvageable spleen was resected and the patient went on to make an excellent recovery. The aetiology of WS is contentious. With an increased frequency among multiparous females of reproductive age, some suggest the hormonal effects of pregnancy as contributing factors. Clinical presentations range from an asymptomatic abdominal mass to acute abdominal pain with hypovolaemic shock. WS poses a serious threat to life due to thrombosis, bleeding, or infarction.

CD011053,0,20227213,0,Imaging of acute pulmonary embolism using multi-detector CT angiography: an update on imaging technique and interpretation.,"Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the pulmonary arteries has become the main diagnostic test for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism (PE). Not only due to the good availability, low cost and minimal invasiveness of this technique, but mainly because of the introduction of multi-detector CT techniques resulting in significant improvement in resolution, speed and image quality. This continuous gain in image acquisition speed went along with the introduction of new techniques of image acquisition, such as the dual-source CT scanning and novel concepts of image interpretation beyond morphological findings including the definition of the resulting perfusion defects and assessment of the cardiopulmonary circulation as a functional unit. This article will focus on technical and practical aspects to optimize CTPA examinations with modern multi-detector CT scanners, discusses aspects to be considered in specific patient groups (e.g., during pregnancy, young patients) and outlines new advents such as dual-source lung perfusion and automatic detection of pulmonary emboli."

CD011053,0,3085750,0,Substrate for endothelial prostacyclin production in the presence of platelets exposed to collagen is derived from the platelets rather than the endothelium.,"Interactions between vascular endothelial cells and blood platelets have been investigated using a model microcirculation consisting of microcarrier beads colonized with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and perfused with washed platelet suspensions. To simulate the effects of endothelial desquamation and exposure of subendothelium, fibrillar collagen in suspension was coinjected with the platelets. In this model, neither the passage of platelets alone nor collagen alone stimulated prostacyclin (PGI2) production by the HUVECs. Platelets activated by coinjection with collagen released thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and this was associated with the simultaneous production of PGI2 by the HUVECs. By means of double-isotope experiments with [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) incorporated into platelets and [14C]-AA into HUVECs, it was shown that all the PGI2 generated was derived from platelet AA and/or endoperoxides. This interpretation was strengthened by the finding that PGI2 production was not prevented by treatment of HUVECs with indomethacin followed by perfusion with collagen-stimulated platelets. AA metabolites in double-isotope label experiments were further characterized by reverse-phase chromatography, and it was shown that both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products of the HUVECs were derived from platelet membrane lipid. Thrombin regularly produced transient PGI2 release, but showed rapid tachyphylaxis. Platelet-derived compounds including ADP, ATP, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) did not produce PGI2 release by HUVECs in this system. Thus, the transfer of AA and metabolites from collagen-stimulated platelets is likely to be the mechanism for PGI2 production in the context of minor degrees of endothelial desquamation."
CD011053,0,16813281,0,[Stroke in young woman in the first day after delivery].,"Strokes among young people are not only the most threatening complications of the cerebrovascular diseases, but they also lead to considerable disability and society' dependency. Among patients under 40 years old heart diseases constitute about 18% causes of ischaemic strokes. Other causes of strokes are: artery wall dissection, blood clotting disturbances, birth control pills, stimulants (alcohol abuse, cigarettes, narcotics), vascular immunological diseases. Among these causes there are modifiable factors, which can be eliminated through patients' education, change of the lifestyle and proper treatment of diseases. In paper there is presented the case of 22-year-old woman, who had in the first hours after delivery the paresis of left limbs with paresis of left facial nerve, proceded by loss of consciousness and convulsions. In computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) there was extensive angiogenic lesion in the area of right internal cervical artery revealed in duplex ultrasonography. In transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) there was revealed haemodynamically significant patent foramen ovale (PFO). In the patient in ten months after stroke there was performed diagnostic cathetarization and then transvascular occlusion of PFO using Starflex 28 mm implant. The patient was rehabilitated from the early time after stroke. Based on carried out examination results that the most likely hypothesis seems to be embolic-thrombotic stroke in the course of hemodynamically significant heart defect (paradoxical embolism in patent foramen ovale) revealed in drastic way during delivery. The earlier lasted process of dissection of cervical internal right artery cannot be also excluded as a cause of stroke."

The major clinical components are marked ovarian enlargement and increased capillary permeability leading to ascites, hydrothorax and pericardial effusion. Severe cases are associated with thromboembolic phenomena, respiratory distress and renal failure. The definitive pathophysiology is unknown. The available evidence would support a central role for inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic growth factors. Ultrasound examination and serum oestradiol values are currently used to predict patients at risk. The ideal treatment is prevention, but there has been only limited success. The main aims of treatment are to correct fluid imbalance, maintain renal perfusion and support the patient until the condition resolves. Drug therapy has a limited role, although anticytokine agents may prove useful."

The case presented is a 33-year-old patient in 16 weeks' in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer pregnancy who developed acute cholecystitis. Previously there were two unsuccessful cycles, one complicated with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Due to clinical deterioration during intravenous antibiotic therapy laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed and acute cholecystitis found. The postoperative course was uneventful. During the first 24 h tocolysis with intravenous fenoterol in addition to peroral atenolol 2 Œß 50 mg was administered. Postoperative course was uneventful with further normal pregnancy. Elective cesarean section was made in term pregnancy (39 weeks) with singleton with Apgar 10/10. Current guidelines do not recommend prophylactic tocolysis in pregnant population with acute abdomen but there is no mention of the IVF-ET subpopulation of patients.

CD011053,0,1432274,0,Thromboxane synthetase inhibition produces maternal and fetal vasodilation during ovine pregnancy-induced hypertension: a Doppler flow velocimetric study.,"Changes in maternal and fetal umbilical arterial vasoreactivity during ovine pregnancy-induced hypertension and following intravenous administration of CGS 12970 [3-methyl-2-(3-pyridyl)-1-indoleoctanoic acid] were assessed. Continuous wave Doppler flow velocimetry was used to assess vascular reactivity during normotensive baseline, during ovine pregnancy-induced hypertension triggered by a 72-hour fast, and following thromboxane synthetase inhibition with CGS 12970. Uterine and umbilical arterial systolic/diastolic flow ratios increased significantly with the onset of sustained hypertension. After thromboxane synthetase inhibition, uterine and umbilical artery systolic/diastolic flow ratios were not different from baseline, and maternal blood pressure had returned to baseline values. These data indicate that thromboxane produces maternal and fetal vasoconstriction during ovine pregnancy-induced hypertension. Furthermore, these data provide strong evidence that thromboxane synthetase inhibition allows vasodilation, resulting in improved maternal and fetal condition."
CD011053,0,22023947,0,Angiomyolipoma with vascular invasion during pregnancy.,"Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare, benign tumor composed of fat cells, smooth muscle cells, and blood vessels. They are commonly found in the kidney but have also been reported to occur in the liver, ovary, fallopian tube, spermatic cord, palate, and colon. Most often, they are discovered as an incidental finding on computed tomography scan and remain inconsequential; however, certain characteristics such as size, presence of aneurysms, and location can transform this disease process into a life-threatening entity. Here, we describe the case of a 30-year-old pregnant woman with bilateral renal AMLs in which there was invasion of the right renal vein and extension of the tumor into the inferior vena cava. The patient was believed to be at significant risk of hormone-mediated rapid expansion, embolization, and life-threatening pulmonary embolus during the pregnancy and was taken to the operating room for right nephrectomy and removal of the tumor from the vena cava. We report the first case of elective nephrectomy with the removal of the tumor from vena cava complicating pregnancy. The major risks of rupture, spontaneous hemorrhage, renal failure, and¬†tumor thrombus were avoided, thereby demonstrating that despite pregnancy, successful surgery can be performed during the second trimester for the management of complicated AMLs."

CD011053,0,15344894,0,Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a review.,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) is a blood clot that arises in the brain parenchyma in the absence of trauma or surgery. This entity accounts for 10 to 15% of all strokes and is associated with a higher mortality rate than either ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Common causes include hypertension, amyloid angiopathy, coagulopathy, vascular anomalies, tumors, and various drugs. Hypertension, however, remains the single greatest modifiable risk factor for SICH. Computerized tomography scanning is the initial diagnostic modality of choice in SICH, and angiography should be considered in all cases except those involving older patients with preexisting hypertension in thalamic, putaminal, or cerebellar hemorrhage. Medical management includes venous thrombosis prophylaxis, gastric cytoprotection, and aggressive rehabilitation. Anticonvulsant agents should be prescribed in supratentorial SICH, whereas the management of hypertension is controversial. To date, nine prospective randomized controlled studies have been conducted to compare surgical and medical management of SICH. Although definitive evidence favoring surgical intervention is lacking, there is good theoretical rationale for early surgical intervention. Surgery should be considered in patients with moderate to large lobar or basal ganglia hemorrhages and those suffering progressive neurological deterioration. Elderly patients in whom the Glasgow Coma Scale score is less than 5, those with brainstem hemorrhages, and those with small hemorrhages do not typically benefit from surgery. Patients with cerebellar hemorrhages larger than 3 cm, those with brainstem compression and hydrocephalus, or those exhibiting neurological deterioration should undergo surgical evacuation of the clot. It is hoped that the forthcoming results of the International Surgical Trial in IntraCerebral Hemorrhage will help formulate evidence-based recommendations regarding the role of surgery in SICH."
CD011053,0,1863883,0,"Inotropic agents. Catecholamines, digoxin, amrinone.","Three broad categories of pharmacologic support that enhance myocardial contractility and modify organ blood flow are reviewed. Appropriate selection among these compounds will minimize the occurrence of adverse effects. The catecholamines increase cardiac work and myocardial oxygen demand. In the setting of a failing ventricle, the increase in oxygen requirement may be balanced by improved coronary blood flow. Problems associated with catecholamines include tachycardia, induction of dysrhythmias, and unsuitable vasoconstriction. Epinephrine and isoproterenol are most likely to increase heart rate excessively. Norepinephrine is most likely to be associated with poor tissue perfusion. Amrinone, a bipyridine, has a favorable effect on oxygen balance in the failing ventricle and is unlikely to produce tachycardia or dysrhythmias. Principal concerns are the potential for accumulation in the patient with multiple organ system failure and the lack of pharmacokinetic information in critically ill patients, including children. Thrombocytopenia may be a problem as well. Digitalis glycosides are venerable drugs. Acute and chronic toxicity are problems that the intensivist is called on to treat frequently.

Thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis were studied in 11 cases (eight women, three men; all white) with amaurosis fugax, 57 +/- 17 years old, selected by the absence of abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), magnetic resonance venography (MRV), ipsilateral internal carotid artery plaque, atrial fibrillation, or cardiac thrombus. Cases were compared to 78 healthy adult white controls (53 +/- 18 years old) for serologic measures, and by polymerase chain reaction to 248 healthy white controls (78 adults, 170 children) for gene mutations. All 11 cases had one or more familial thrombophilic coagulation disorder including one heterozygous for the G1691A factor V Leiden mutation, two with low free protein S, four with high factor VIII, three with resistance to activated protein C, three homozygous for the C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation, two compound C677T-A1298C MTHFR heterozygotes, and three with hypofibrinolytic 4G4G homozygosity for the PAI-1 gene. The case with factor VIII of 160% had two other thrombophilias (compound MTHFR C677T-A1298C heterozygosity, resistance to activated protein C), and hypofibrinolytic high Lp(a). Thrombophilic C677T MTHFR homozygosity or compound C677T-A1298C heterozygosity was present in five of 10 (50%) cases vs. 30 of 248 (12%) controls, Fisher's p (p(f)) = .005. Thrombophilic factor VIII was high in four of 10 (40%) cases vs. 0 of 38 controls, p(f) = .001. Thrombophilic hyperestrogenemia in five of the eight women (four exogenous estrogen, one pregnant) may have interacted with inherited thrombophilia-hypofibrinolysis, promoting thrombus formation. In cases selected by the absence of abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging, significant ipsilateral internal carotid artery plaque, atrial fibrillation, or cardiac thrombus, we speculate that amaurosis fugax can be caused by reversible (by anticoagulation) retinal artery thrombi associated with heritable thrombophilia and/or hypofibrinolysis, often augmented by estrogen-driven acquired thrombophilia."

Algorithms and clinical considerations for diagnosis of pulmonary emboli with V/P(SPECT) and MDCT.,"As emphasized in Part 1 of these guidelines, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is confirmed or refuted using ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy (V/P(SCAN)) or multidetector computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries (MDCT). To reduce the costs, the risks associated with false-negative and false-positive diagnoses, and unnecessary radiation exposure, preimaging assessment of clinical probability is recommended. Diagnostic accuracy is approximately equal for MDCT and planar V/P(SCAN) and better for tomography (V/P(SPECT)). V/P(SPECT) is feasible in about 99% of patients, while MDCT is often contraindicated. As MDCT is more readily available, access to both techniques is vital for the diagnosis of PE. V/P(SPECT) gives an effective radiation dose of 1.2-2 mSv. For V/P(SPECT), the effective dose is about 35-40% and the absorbed dose to the female breast 4% of the dose from MDCT performed with a dose-saving protocol. V/P(SPECT) is recommended as a first-line procedure in patients with suspected PE.

CD011053,0,7547731,0,"Diagnosis, prevention and management of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.","The overall incidence of clinically important (moderate to severe) OHSS ranges from 1% to 10% of IVF cycles, but only a small proportion (0.5% to 2%) of the cases are severe. In extreme but rare cases, secondary complications such as deep vein thrombosis, respiratory distress and acute hepato-renal failure may occur. The main risk factors are the presence of polycystic ovaries, high ovarian response to superovulation therapy, the use of hCG to trigger the ovulatory process or for luteal phase support, and the endogenous production of hCG by an early pregnancy. The pathogenesis of OHSS is unknown, although the predominant biochemical mediator is thought to be the renin-angiotensin system. Ovarian stimulation should always be carefully monitored to identify those women at risk. In IVF cycles, the hCG injection should be withheld if the risk is judged to be too great. Some women will benefit from a policy of proceeding to collect oocytes, but electively cryopreserving any resulting embryos, thus allowing the ovarian stimulation cycle not to be wasted. The administration of albumin at the time of oocyte collection will reduce the chance of severe OHSS occurring. If a decision is made to proceed with oocyte recovery and embryo transfer, it may be advisable to give 5000 IU of hCG, rather than 10,000 IU, as the ovulatory trigger. Progesterone, and not hCG, should be given in the luteal phase. Women developing mild or moderate OHSS should be kept under outpatient surveillance to detect the minority that may progress to severe OHSS. Those with severe OHSS should be hospitalised for fluid and electrolyte management. Paracentesis under ultrasound guidance is recommended where there are tense ascites, but further surgical intervention should rarely be undertaken and only when there is good clinical evidence of ovarian torsion or haemorrhage."

Seventy-eight percent of cases with reported outcome resulted in either death or adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at ages 3 months to 6 years. Fetal stroke appears to have different risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes than other perinatal or childhood stroke syndromes. A better understanding of those risk factors predisposing a fetus to cerebral infarction may provide a basis for future therapeutic intervention trials.

CD011053,0,23018478,0,Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy. Consensus and controversies.,"Venous thrombotic events (VTE) occur 1-2 per 10,000 pregnancies and remain one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in the developed world. The two largest risk factors are a personal history of VTE and heritable thrombophilias. D-dimer tests for VTE in pregnancy have a high false positive rate and at least some false negatives have been reported. Compression ultrasound should be used to evaluate pregnant women for deep venous thrombosis followed by magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis for a negative test and strong remaining clinical suspicion. For pulmonary embolism, a chest x-ray should be used to triage the patient to either a ventilation/perfusion study after a normal X-ray or a CT pulmonary angiogram after an abnormal one. Treatment generally consists of low molecular weight heparin through a minimum of six weeks post-partum. Thombolysis might have merit in life-threatening, massive pulmonary embolism. VTE prophylaxis in at-risk populations remains a major area of uncertainty. Mechanical prophylaxis for all women undergoing cesarean, in particular, has a paucity of supportive evidence."

The yield and costs of such a practice may not be justifiable. Medical charts of infants with IUGR who had a workup for toxoplasmosis, other (infections), rubella, cytomegalovirus (infection), and herpes (simplex) (titer) (TORCH) infections were reviewed for the presence of clinical findings, laboratory and head ultrasound abnormalities associated with intrauterine infections. Maternal charts and reports of placental pathology were reviewed for identifying maternal illnesses and placental causes associated with IUGR. Seventy-five out of 182 infants (41%) with IUGR had a workup for TORCH infection. Maternal conditions associated with IUGR included: pregnancy-induced hypertension (19%), tobacco use (43%), alcohol abuse (21%), illicit drug use (24%), chronic hypertension, diabetic vasculopathy or collagen vascular disease (12%), and multiple gestation (3%). Placental pathology was available in 53/75 cases. Thirty-six of fifty-three (67%) placentae had abnormalities associated with IUGR: placental infarcts (22 of 36), vasculitis/villitis (15 of 36), placenta previa (1 of 36), abruptio placenta (2 of 36), and velamentous insertion of umbilical cord (1 of 36). Clinical findings among infants included hepatosplenomegaly, cataract or rash (1 of 75), thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia and/or direct hyperbilirubinemia (11 of 75). Seven out of 75 infants had dysmorphic features. None of the infants (0 of 75) had positive IgM titers for toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), or herpes simplex virus (HSV). No infants (0 of 43) had elevated total IgM titers; one infant (1 of 57) had a positive urine culture for CMV. One infant had evidence of calcifications on head ultrasound and a second infant had hydrocephalus (2 of 43).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), physiological and pathophysiological regulators of vascular tone, are elevated in preeclampsia (PE), a disease of pregnancy characterized by increased fetoplacental vascular resistance. We tested the hypothesis that ROS modulate vascular reactivity in placental chorionic plate arteries. Wire myography was used to examine (1) the effects of acute exposure to ROS on arterial function in normal pregnancy and (2) the effects of maternal antioxidant supplementation on arterial reactivity in women at high risk for PE participating in the Vitamins in Pre-eclampsia (VIP) trial. ROS generated by xanthine plus xanthine oxidase enhanced basal tension, vasoconstriction in response to the thromboxane mimetic U46619, and relaxation in response to sodium nitroprusside. Hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite increased basal tone and relaxed preconstricted arteries (U44619), respectively. In women at risk for PE, chorionic plate artery constriction in response to U46619 was greater in the women receiving placebo compared to the women supplemented with the antioxidant vitamins C and E. ROS may regulate fetoplacental vascular resistance and blood flow in the short term, and chronic exposure to raised ROS could contribute to elevated fetoplacental vascular resistance in PE and fetal growth restriction (FGR)."

Secondary causes of hemorrhage include retained products of conception and, rarely, subinvolution of the placental implantation site. Uterine dehiscence or rupture may be occult on ultrasound examination and may be better visualized on sagittal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Obstetric trauma during prolonged vaginal or cesarean delivery may lead to fistula formation, ureteral injury, or bowel injury. Later potential complications of cesarean delivery include cesarean delivery scar ectopic, endometrial implants in the cesarean scar, and placenta accreta. Thromboembolic complications can include pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as well as ovarian vein thrombosis, the latter of which can be difficult to clinically differentiate from appendicitis in the postpartum female."

Medical records, radiographic studies, and echocardiograms were reviewed. All infants underwent follow-up echocardiograms every 2 to 3 days until the aneurysm spontaneously resolved or surgery was performed. The infants were predominantly term males; six had evidence of fetal distress, two were diagnosed prenatally by fetal echocardiogram, chest X ray evidenced mediastinal mass in six patients. The first echocardiogram showed structurally normal heart with an aneurysmal patent ductus arteriosus. In eight patients the aneurysm completely resolved by 5 to 10 days. One infant underwent surgical resection of the aneurysm after observation for 11 days with no change in size. Thrombosis of the aneurysm was noted in two patients; both underwent surgery. Increasing reports of ductal aneurysms in infants may reflect the availability of high-resolution echocardiography and more frequent use of echocardiography in the neonatal intensive care unit. Spontaneous resolution occurred in the majority of cases as in previous reports. We postulate that, at least in some cases, aneurysm of the ductus arteriosus is a congenital lesion that may represent poststenotic dilation of the ductus due to turbulent flow through a stenotic segment at its pulmonary artery end during fetal life. The presence of aneurysm of the ductus arteriosus should be excluded in selected cases of fetal distress, by fetal echocardiography."

The leading symptoms are lower abdominal pain localized anteriorly to the psoatic muscle and a tender, barrel shaped unilateral tumor. Discrepancy between the grave clinical picture and the insignificant findings on gyn. examination is common. Ultrasound and computed tomography frequently add in the correct diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy and anticoagulation are recommended in an uneventful course. If clinical improvement is delayed despite non-invasive treatment, surgical intervention with resection of the involved veins and all septic foci becomes mandatory.

Despite only moderately reduced platelet count a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II was diagnosed by heparin-induced platelet activation test. By treatment with plasmin activator lysis the thrombus was diminished. An operative procedure had been prevented. We conclude that also in cases with only moderately reduced platelet count during and after administration of heparin, especially in patients with wide spread and accumulating thrombosis, the presence of a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be taken into consideration. In contrast to difficulties in the management of puerperal ovarian vein thrombophlebitis--occurring independently from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (surgical treatment necessary in most cases)--occurrence of puerperal ovarian vein thrombophlebitis in relation to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia seems to response better to fibrinolysis and anticoagulation."

In the PE group, there was no significant association between serum visfatin MoM and uterine artery PI MoM (P=0.589), gestation at delivery (P=0.763) or birth weight percentile (P=0.646). Serum visfatin levels at 11-13 weeks are increased in women who develop PE by a mechanism unrelated to impaired placental perfusion."

CD011053,0,2180005,0,[Diagnostic imaging of Budd-Chiari syndrome in adults and children].,"Budd-Chiari syndrome is caused by the obstruction of the hepatic veins or of the inferior vena cava. It is characterized by the classic symptomatological triad: ascites, hepatomegaly, and abdominal pain. In 2/3 cases its etiology remains unknown. Budd-Chiari syndrome may be associated with polycythemia vera, neoplasms, chronic leukemia, congenital abnormalities, hypercoagulation conditions, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, and constrictive pericarditis. Even though its clinical diagnosis is difficult, radiology plays a decisive role with US, CT, MR imaging and, above all, angiography; the latter, together with liver biopsy, generally provides with an unquestionable diagnosis. Through the definition of stage of the disease, of level (intrahepatic, venous, caval, cardiac), of type (intrinsic or extrinsic), and degree of both obstruction and consequent development of collateral channels, radiology determines which patients should undergo a medical or a surgical treatment. In some case, percutaneous angioplasty can be performed. Four cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome, including two children, were investigated with US, CT, angiography, and liver biopsy; MR imaging was also employed in one case. The underlying cause was identified in 3 patients: constrictive pericarditis of probable congenital origin and web occlusion of the inferior vena cava near the right atrium in the 2 children; hepatic vein thrombosis due to essential thrombocythemia in the third case. In the fourth patient, thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins was unexplained. The diagnosis was established by means of liver biopsy and phlebography of the hepatic veins. Good diagnostic information was also supplied by non-invasive techniques, such as US, CT, and MR imaging.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Nine days later, after reporting a severe headache, the patient experienced loss of vision in both eyes. An emergency computed tomographic brain scan was performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage, and cesarean delivery was performed. Twelve hours after the operation, the patient's vision improved gradually and returned to normal after 24 hours. The placenta was submitted to pathologic examination, and magnetic resonance imaging was performed 4 days after birth. Recent thrombosis observed in the histologic section of the placenta, ischemic changes in the brain seen in the computed tomographic and magnetic resonance scans, and severe proteinuria manifested clinically suggest vascular endothelial damage as the underlying mechanism in this case of preeclampsia-related transient cortical blindness."
CD011053,0,23676374,0,Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with amniotic fluid embolism associated with severe cardiopulmonary complications.,"Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare but devastating complication of pregnancy. Acute circulatory failure and obstetric disseminated intravascular coagulopathy are often associated with AFE and lead to poor prognosis of this syndrome. Although many reports of AFE and its cardiopulmonary complications exist, their etiology remains unknown. Classically, it was believed that the fatal cardiopulmonary complication in AFE is due to acute and severe pulmonary hypertension caused by critical obstruction of the pulmonary vessels by embolized amniotic fluid. However, recent hypotheses are suggesting that anaphylactic reaction or a cytokine effect induced by amniotic fluid is the main pathophysiological mechanism. We report a case in which cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed at the chronic stage of AFE. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was detected at the mid-wall of the left ventricle with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. This finding suggests that the pathophysiological mechanism of severe cardiac complications in AFE may include direct left ventricular myocardial injury through an immune reaction or cytokine release, rather than pulmonary embolism."

CD011053,0,7782589,0,[Parvovirus B19 infection and pregnancy].,"Parvovirus B19 was identified in 1975. It causes infections megalerythemia in adults associated with skin eruptions and joint pain (about 50% of the adult population is immunized). The risk of contamination in case of an epidemia is high in school teachers and school personnel. In 1984, the parvovirus B19 was implicated as the cause of fetal anasarca. The risk of transplacental contamination is estimated at 33% in case of maternal infection. Pregnant women with parvovirus B19 infection and confirmed serology should have an echography every 15 days. Fetal anasarca can be complicated by in utero fetal death related to erythroid stem-cell anaemia. The diagnosis of fetal infection is based on PCR techniques on fetal blood. Symptomatic antenatal treatment with in utero transfusion was proposed as early as 1988. This method does not however appear to be necessary in all cases as the outcome in several reports of untreated fetuses was delivery of a normal child. There is the possibility of myocardial damage caused by parvovirus B19 which would make in utero transfusion difficult and limit its beneficial effect. Finally associated thrombopenia is often severe and increased fetal risk."

We evaluated the effect of a low-dose aspirin (LDA) on PGI2 and TXA2 production and on pregnancy outcome in RSA women with and without detectable anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA). Of 82 RSA women studied, 66 became pregnant, and of them, 33 (six with elevated and 27 with normal ACA concentrations) were randomized to receive LDA (50 mg/day) and 33 (six with elevated and 27 with normal ACA concentrations) to receive placebo (PLA) from a mean of 6.6 days after the missed period to delivery. Treatment with LDA inhibited platelet TXA2 production similarly in RSA women with and without detectable ACA and with continuing pregnancies (7.0 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, LDA group versus 254.5 +/- 37.8 ng/ml, PLA group, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.0001) or miscarrying pregnancies (13.8 +/- 3.8 ng/ml compared with 233.6 +/- 59.8 ng/ml, P < 0.0001 respectively). Furthermore, LDA decreased urinary excretion of the TXA2 metabolite (2,3-dinor-TXB2) both in pregnancies which went to term (6.1 +/- 0.6 ng/mmol creatinine, LDA group versus 19.3 +/- 3.0 ng/mmol creatinine, PLA group, P < 0.0001) or again ended in miscarriage (4.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mmol creatinine versus 17.3 +/- 4.4 ng/mmol creatinine, P < 0.0001 respectively), but did not affect the excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite (2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1alpha). Early pregnancy ultrasound examination revealed a living fetus in 58 women. Of these, seven in the LDA group (23.3%, four with elevated and three with normal ACA concentrations) and five in the PLA group (17.9%, two with elevated and three with normal ACA concentrations; not significant) experienced a miscarriage. All infants were healthy, and the frequency of growth retardation was similar in both groups (13.0%). One woman in the LDA group (4.3%) and three women receiving PLA (13.0%) developed pre-eclampsia (not significant). Therefore, although treatment with LDA caused a desirable biochemical effect, it did not improve pregnancy outcome in RSA women with or without detectable ACA."

Their etiology is related to physiological changes during pregnancy. The majority of strokes are seen in the third trimester and postpartum and are etiologically related to three conditions: reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, preeclampsia/eclampsia and cerebral venous thrombosis. The first two conditions are etiologically connected and can lead to ischemic and hemorrhagic events, whereas cerebral sinus thrombosis is mainly related to hypercoagulation and causes venous infarcts and brain hemorrhages. MRI and CT scans are safe to use for diagnosis of stroke in pregnancy, although use of iodine-based contrast may affect thyroid function of the neonate. Management of stroke in pregnancy is specific to cause and depends on management of blood pressure and delivery in preeclampsia/eclampsia, expected management or calcium channel blockers in reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and anticoagulation for cerebral sinus thrombosis."

CD011053,0,22265954,0,Current management and therapeutical perspectives in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a particular form of thrombotic microangiopathy typically characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, profound peripheral thrombocytopenia, and a severe deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 (acronym for A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin-1 motifs [13th member of the family]). ADAMTS13 deficiency is usually severe (<10% of normal activity) and results from autoantibodies directed to ADAMTS13 (acquired TTP) or from biallelic mutations of the encoding gene. In some cases, acquired TTP occurs in association with specific conditions that must be identified for appropriate management: a HIV infection, a connective tissue disease, a pregnancy, a cancer or a treatment with antiplatelet agents. TTP requires a rapid diagnosis and an adapted management in emergency, which allows current remission rates of 80 to 90%. Maximal measures of resuscitation may be required. Daily sessions of therapeutical plasma exchange (TPE) until durable platelet count recovery remain the basis of management of acquired TTP. In the last few years, the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been increasingly used in patients with a suboptimal response to standard treatment, such as those with refractory disease (‚àº10% of cases) or an exacerbation of the disease despite intensive TPE (‚àº50% of cases). Rituximab prevents 1-year but not long-term relapses. Further studies should specify the optimal schedule of rituximab administration and its role as a prophylactic treatment in asymptomatic patients with severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency that persists even in disease remission. In hereditary TTP, also known as Upshaw-Schulman syndrome (USS), a diagnosis early in life is mandatory. Prophylactic infusions of plasma should be performed in chronic relapsing forms to prevent long-term organ complications, which have to be assessed accurately and regularly. In the upcoming years, new targeted therapies evaluated through international trials should further improve the management of these diseases. Consensual guidelines for the treatment of very specific and rare situations (such as management during pregnancy in USS patients and prevention of relapses in chronic relapsing acquired TTP) should arise from the shared experience of national groups."

CD011053,0,23065510,0,Predicting deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy: external validation of the LEFT clinical prediction rule.,"The assessment of clinical probability represents an important step in the diagnostic strategy of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis. The recently derived LEFt clinical prediction rule for pregnant women combines three variables: symptoms in the left leg (L), calf circumference difference of 2 centimeters or over (E for edema) and first trimester presentation (Ft) but is lacking an external validation. The LEFt rule was computed among pregnant women with suspected deep vein thrombosis who were included in a multicenter prospective diagnostic management outcome study. We calculated the proportion of women and the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis in each probability group, along with the diagnostic performances of the LEFt rule. All variables needed to compute the rule could be retrieved in 157 of the 167 pregnant women with suspected deep vein thrombosis. The prevalence of confirmed deep vein thrombosis was 13 of 157 (8.3%). The LEFt rule was negative in 46 (29%) women. A deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 13 of 111 (11.7%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 8.3-20.9%) of women with at least one of the LEFt criteria, as compared with none of 46 (0.0%, 95%CI: 0.0-7.9%) of women with none of the LEFt criteria. These results suggest that a negative LEFt rule accurately identifies pregnant women in whom the proportion of confirmed deep vein thrombosis appears to be very low. The rule should not be used as stand-alone test for excluding DVT during pregnancy, but might rather be implemented in a diagnostic strategy in association with D-dimer measurement and compression ultrasonography."

CD011053,0,18824660,0,Early and late preeclampsia: two different maternal hemodynamic states in the latent phase of the disease.,"Because early and late preeclampsia (PE) are thought to be different disease entities, we compared maternal cardiac function at 24 weeks gestation in a group of normotensive asymptomatic patients with subsequent development of early (<34 weeks gestation) and late (>or=34 weeks gestation) PE (blood pressure >140/90+proteinuria >300 mg/dL) to detect possible early differences in the hemodynamic state. A group of 1345 nulliparous normotensive asymptomatic women underwent at 24 weeks gestation uterine artery Doppler evaluation and maternal echocardiography calculating total vascular resistance. In the subsequent follow-up 107 patients showed PE: 32 patients had late and 75 had early PE. Five of 32 patients with late PE and 45 of 75 patients with early PE had bilateral notching of the uterine artery at 24 weeks (15.6% versus 60.0%; P<0.05). Total vascular resistance was 1605+/-248 versus 739+/-244 dyn . s . cm(-5), and cardiac output was 4.49+/-1.09 versus 8.96+/-1.83 L in early versus late PE (P<0.001). Prepregnancy body mass index was higher in late versus early PE (28+/-6 versus 24+/-2 kg/m(2); P<0.001). Early and late PE appear to develop from different hemodynamic states. Late PE appears to be more frequent in patients with high body mass index and low total vascular resistance; earlier forms of PE appear to be more frequent in patients with lower BMI and with bilateral notching of the uterine artery. These findings support the hypothesis of different hemodynamics and origins for early PE (placental mediated, linked to defective trophoblast invasion with high percentage of altered uterine artery Doppler) and late PE (linked to constitutional factors such as high body mass index)."

In the past, cerebral palsy was thought to be due to poor obstetric care and management; however, epidemiological studies have refuted this, suggesting that there is usually an antenatal timing to the neuropathology of cerebral palsy. There are many known risk factors for cerebral palsy, including multiple gestation, prematurity, and low birth weight. Recently, intrauterine infection, maternal pyrexia, and the presence of thrombophilic disorders (thrombophilia) have been identified as major risk factors for subsequent cerebral palsy. This review examines the links between intrauterine infection, the fetal inflammatory response, and thrombophilia as possible causes of cerebral palsy.

CD011053,0,12061291,0,Management of thromboembolic disease in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in developed countries including Singapore. The physiological changes of pregnancy and other factors, such as maternal age, parity, obesity, operative delivery, general anaesthesia and congenital and acquired thrombophilia, further increase the risk of VTE throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy, including the puerperium. VTE has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and a high index of clinical suspicion is vital. Clinicians should not withhold the use of chest X-rays and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scans in pregnancy as the radiation emitted is well within the safety limits to the fetus. Most treatment guidelines are based on studies in non-pregnant populations. Heparin is the preferred anticoagulant as it does not cross the placenta and therefore carries no teratogenic risk to the fetus. There is increasing experience and confidence in the use of fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) which removes the need for cumbersome monitoring, thereby allowing outpatient treatment. LMWH may also have a lower risk of osteopaenic complications compared to unfractionated heparin. With the exception of acute phase treatment of pulmonary embolism, LMWH is used in all other aspects of the treatment of VTE in pregnancy, including thromboprophylaxis. Risk stratification of women into high and low risk allows judicious use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis. Antenatal thromboprophylaxis with LMWH is reserved for high-risk women, while low-risk women will only require such cover in the postpartum period."

CD011053,0,2929032,0,Repeated cranial computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans in two cases of eclampsia.,"In two cases of eclampsia with consumptive thrombocytopenia, the maximum increase in blood pressure and the lowest platelet count coincided with the maximum degree of neurologic and neuroradiologic abnormality. Computed tomograms showed decreased attenuation, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showed increased signal intensity focally in the cerebral cortex and the deep gray and white matter. Blood pressure, platelet count, clinical status, and roentgenograms normalized completely in both cases. Severe arterial hypertension and disseminated transitory microvascular occlusions presumably caused multiple small foci of brain edema that resolved without remaining detectable ischemic brain damage."

It is associated with poor perinatal prognosis. However, prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography is often difficult. We report a case of massive subchorionic thrombosis developing dermatomyositis after the delivery, followed by magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, we review other 4 cases assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is very useful for confirmation of diagnosis and follow-up in combination with ultrasonography."
CD011053,0,18487390,0,Modelling the effect of lead and other materials for shielding of the fetus in CT pulmonary angiography.,"The aim of this work is to construct and validate a model to describe the variation in fetal dose as a function of the thickness of abdominal lead shielding used during CT pulmonary angiography and to determine the optimal shielding material. An anthropomorphic phantom was modified to contain a 15 cm(3) ionization chamber at the site of the uterus. Fetal dose was measured with varying thicknesses of lead shielding at four values of tube potential (kV(p)). Data generated by the proposed model were compared with experimental data to determine the validity of the model. The effect of lead shielding has been modelled accurately and results have shown that, although alternative materials could be used, lead is an effective and practical shielding material. In conclusion, lead remains a suitable shielding material and a pair of conventional lead aprons provides significant shielding for the fetus; we recommend that aprons should be reserved specifically for this purpose. However, it is possible that a dedicated and specifically designed lead shield could reduce fetal dose more effectively whilst also reducing patient discomfort."

CD011053,0,21370212,0,Tissue factor dependent pathway and the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia.,"Pre-eclampsia (P-EC) is a major contributor to perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its etiology and pathogenesis remains poorly understood, and differential diagnosis is problematic. During a normal pregnancy, coagulation activation is essential for physiological placental hemostasis, but women with P-EC tend to be more hypercoagulable than normal pregnant women. A common proposed mechanism for P-EC is utero-placental thrombosis. Indeed, multiple placental microthrombi are frequently observed in women with P-EC, and these may compromise placental perfusion and fetal development. This suggests that predisposing factors to thrombosis could contribute to the development of P-EC. Thus studying circulating hemostatic proteins may help elucidate some of the pathogenesis of P-EC and may provide a rational basis for its differential diagnosis and effective treatment. Preliminary studies by our group on third-trimester women suggest that raised circulating factor VII (FVII) is a selective marker for P-EC when women with P-EC were compared with healthy nonpregnant or normal pregnant women groups. Plasma FVII levels have shown good sensitivity and specificity for P-EC of 90% and 80%, respectively. However, significant comparable changes in the other tissue factor (TF)-dependent pathway factors (activated FVII), TF, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor were not observed. Thus we propose the use of plasma FVII as a potential marker of P-EC."
CD011053,0,22487110,0,Pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging medical diseases in the emergency department. PE is a potentially life threatening diagnosis that is seen in patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea but can span the clinical spectrum of medical presentations. In addition, it does not have any particular clinical feature, laboratory test, or diagnostic modality that can independently and confidently exclude its possibility. This article offers a review of PE in the emergency department. It emphasizes the appropriate determination of pretest probability, the approach to diagnosis and management, and special considerations related to pregnancy and radiation exposure."
CD011053,0,20921952,0,Adapting in vitro dual perfusion of the human placenta to soluble oxygen tensions associated with normal and pre-eclamptic pregnancy.,"For decades, superoxic ex vivo dual perfusion of the human placental lobule has been used as a model to study the physiology and metabolism of the placenta. The aim of this study was to further develop the technique to enable perfusion at soluble oxygen concentrations similar to those in normal pregnancy (normoxia) and in pre-eclampsia (PE; hypoxia). Our design involved reducing the mean soluble oxygen tension in the maternal-side intervillous space (IVS) perfusate to 5-7% and <3% for normoxia and hypoxia, respectively, while providing a more ubiquitous delivery of perfusate into the IVS, using 22 maternal-side cannulae. We achieved quasi-steady states in [O‚ÇÇ](fetal venous (soluble)), which were statistically different between the two adaptations at t=150 to t=240‚Äâmin of dual perfusion (2.1, 1.2, 2.8 and 0.4, 0.0, 1.5%; median, 25th, 75th percentiles, n=20 and 24 readings in n=5 and n=6 lobules, normoxic and hypoxic perfusion, respectively; P<0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in fetal and maternal venous outflow perfusates were unaffected by the adaptations. There was also no difference in tissue lactate release between the two adaptations. Glucose consumption from the fetal circulation and maternal-side 'venous' pyruvate release were higher under normoxic conditions, indicative of a greater metabolic flux through glycolysis. Furthermore, there was greater release of the hypoxic-sensitive marker, macrophage inflammatory protein-1Œ±, into the maternal venous perfusate in the hypoxic model. Also, during hypoxic perfusion, we found that fetal-side venous placental growth factor (PlGF) levels were higher compared with normoxic perfusion. We conclude that these ex vivo adapted methods of placental perfusion provide a means of studying aspects of placental metabolism in relation to normal oxygenation and hypoxia-associated pregnancy disease."

CD011053,0,16310036,0,Reactivity of human placental chorionic plate vessels is modified by level of oxygenation: differences between arteries and veins.,"Normal fetal development in utero is dependent upon adequate perfusion of the placental vasculature, yet how fetoplacental blood flow is matched to maternal blood flow is unknown. In the perfused placental cotyledon in vitro, reduced oxygenation promotes vasoconstriction, which may act to direct blood in fetoplacental vessels to effectively perfused regions of the intervillus space. We aimed to demonstrate that oxygen tension could directly modify placental chorionic plate vessel vasoreactivity. Small arteries and veins from the chorionic plate were dissected from biopsies from term placentae of uncomplicated pregnancies and studied using parallel wire myography. Chorionic artery and vein vasoconstriction in 20%, 7% and 2% oxygen was assessed utilizing the thromboxane-mimetic U46619. Reduced oxygenation increased arterial maximal active effective pressure production and sensitivity to U46619. This effect was cyclo-oxygenase independent. In veins, modified oxygenation did not alter vasoconstriction. Vasodilatation in response to the NO donor sodium nitroprusside was increased in lowered oxygenation in veins but not in arteries. We suggest that modified oxygenation may play a role in the control of the blood flow in the fetoplacental circulation."

CD011053,0,22015024,0,Thromboxane and isoprostane share the same prostanoid receptors to increase human placental tone.,"As the placenta is devoid of autonomic innervation, umbilical-placental vascular tone should be under the control of tissue and humoral factors. Among the numerous stimuli capable of challenging the placental circulation, we propose that prostanoids could be responsible for the regulation of placental vascular tone. Consequently, we measured vasomotor responses to the thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) mimetic U-46619 and the isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin E(2) (8-isoPGE(2)) in the human placental vasculature. Placental tissues were collected from normotensive women after elective caesarean delivery. Cotyledons were set up in a perfusion system, whereas chorionic arteries were prepared as rings and installed in glass-jacketed tissue baths. The effects of U-46619 and 8-isoPGE(2) were measured in the absence and presence of blockers of TXA(2) receptors (TP), SQ29,548 and ICI192,605, and of PGE(2) receptors (EP), AH6809. The influence of nitric oxide (NO) was assessed with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). U-46619 and 8-isoPGE(2) markedly increased perfusion pressure in cotyledons and tension in chorionic arteries. Dose-response curves to both prostanoids were competitively shifted to the right by all antagonists, but to different extents. L-NAME had no significant impact on the dose-response curves to U-46619. The effects of U-46619 and 8-isoPGE(2) were found to be mediated by both TP and EP. The presence of these receptors and the actions exerted by their agonists support our postulate that prostanoids play an important regulatory role in placental vascular tone and resistance. NO, however, does not seem to be involved."
CD011053,0,15485091,0,Cytokines in recurrent miscarriage.,"Cytokines act at all stages of pregnancy from implantation to parturition. This review examines their relevance in recurrent miscarriage. However, recurrent miscarriage may be due to an inherently abnormal embryo (e.g., chromosomal abberations) or maternal factors (e.g., uterine anomalies or antiphospholipid antibodies). In the former, cytokines are not causative, but may be part of the mechanism of abortion. In the antiphospholipid syndrome, cytokines such as TNFalpha and IL-6 may be responsible for the associated thrombosis. Hence, an appropriate cytokine milieu could be responsible for whether the antibodies are pathogenic or merely an epiphenomenon. Natural killer cells seem to have a key role in immunosurveillance of the invading trophoblast. However, if activated by TNFalpha, natural killer cells may induce apoptosis in the trophoblast possibly leading to miscarriage. This action is inhibited by TGFbeta. Early ultrasound scanning and embryoscopy have revealed structural anomalies in karyotypically normal embryos which have terminated in first trimester missed abortion. Teratogens such as cyclophosphamide cause fetal demise by excessive apoptosis. Excessive apoptosis may be mediated by TNFalpha, TGFbeta and other cytokines. GM-CSF has been reported to prevent teratogenesis in laboratory animals. Both immunomodulation and hormonal support (progesterone or hCG supplements) have been used to improve the live birth rate in recurrently aborting women. Each may modulate the balance between various cytokines. Although neither hormonal support or immunopotentiation have been proven to be beneficial, the results and the role of cytokines themselves can only be assessed in trials of karyotypically normal embryos."

CD011053,0,679555,0,Efficacy of graded-compression antiembolism stockings in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.,"A prospective randomized trial evaluated graded-compression antiembolism stockings for prevention of leg vein thrombosis as assessed by Doppler ultrasound, in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The study was terminated after the evaluation of 18 patients revealed a significantly greater incidence of deep vein thrombosis, documented by phlebography, in patients without stockings (5 of 10) compared to those with stockings (none of 8, p less than 0.03). Three of the patients with thrombosis developed pulmonary emboli. Although the sample size of this study is small, the implication that graded-compression stockings reduce the incidence of leg vein thrombosis is strong and is supported by the results of other recent trials. These findings are at variance with earlier studies which failed to document efficacy of elastic stockings, which involved products which did not provide graded limb compression."

Compromise to any part of this exchange would be detrimental to pregnancy outcome. Pre-eclampsia is associated with reduced maternal spiral artery flow, resulting in reduced placental perfusion. This in turn creates an ischaemic environment, which may predispose to morphological changes in placental villi. This pilot study sought to assess whether there were morphological alterations in the fetal component of the placenta which could be detrimental to exchange and therefore pregnancy outcome."

CD011053,0,9013009,0,Venous thrombotic complications of pregnancy.,"A total 30,040 pregnancies were reviewed at one institution over 5 years to determine the incidence of venous thrombotic complications. Thirty-one patients experienced such complications related to pregnancy (incidence 0.1%); 13 had deep venous thrombosis and 14 had superficial venous thrombophlebitis diagnosed by duplex ultrasound. Four had pelvic vein thrombophlebitis diagnosed by computed tomography scan; three patients (one from each group) sustained a non-fatal pulmonary embolus. Of those with deep venous thrombosis, 10 (77%) were left-sided, and three (23%) were right-sided. Three had a prior history of deep venous thrombosis and one of pulmonary embolism. Of those with superficial venous thrombophlebitis, seven (50%) were left-sided, six (43%) were right-sided, and one (7%) was bilateral. Most with deep venous thrombosis presented later in pregnancy; three in the first trimester, two in the second, three in the third, and five early postpartum. Most (10/14) with superficial venous thrombophlebitis presented within 48 hours of delivery. Distribution of thrombi in those with deep venous thrombosis was compared with 643 non-pregnant women with a similar condition. A pattern of proximal involvement on the left was found, with left common femoral vein (54% versus 28%, P = 0.03) and superficial femoral vein (62% versus 26%, P = 0.006) more often involved in pregnant patients. The average number of vein segments involved was greater on the left than the right (5.3 versus 3.7). Symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency developed in three with deep venous thrombosis (25%) and in three with superficial venous thrombophlebitis (27%). None had recurrence of deep venous thrombosis. It is concluded that venous thrombotic complications associated with pregnancy are not necessarily benign, with the risk of pulmonary embolism and chronic venous insufficiency not limited to patients with deep venous thrombosis only."

Pregnant women after adenomyomectomy sometimes suffer some adverse events, among which uterine rupture has been widely acknowledged. We describe a post-abortive woman who had uterine artery pseudoaneurysm occupying the entire uterine cavity. She underwent adenomyomectomy and became pregnant. She experienced a missed abortion and underwent evacuation and curettage, which caused bleeding. Several days later, ultrasound revealed an intrauterine mass with marked blood flow. Angiography revealed the un-ruptured left uterine artery pseudoaneurysm, with arterial embolization stopping the flow within the pseudoaneurysm. Adenomyomectomy with subsequent curettage was considered to have caused the pseudoaneurysm. We must be cautious that pseudoaneurysm may occur in post-abortive women after adenomyomectomy."

The woman had been treated with gonadotropin due to infertility and gone through in vitro fertilisation before the symptoms started. She was pregnant in the first trimester when we first saw her. We did not find any predisposing factors, and the clinical examination, including biochemical analysis, MRI arteriography and echocardiography, did not reveal any cause for the cerebral infarction (CI). The risk of CI during pregnancy itself is less than among non-pregnant women (0, 7) but increases in the postpartum period (8, 7). The cause of cerebral infarction in this case was idiopathic, but we must be aware of the possible link between treatment with gonadotropin for infertility and the development of cerebral infarction."

CD011053,0,2277204,0,[Effect of low-dose aspirin therapy on utero-placental blood flow and malondialdehyde (MDA) as an indicator of its therapeutic effect].,"Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia develop when an imbalance occurs between prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production. PGI2 promotes vasodilation and decreases platelet adhesiveness, while TXA2 acts as a vasoconstrictor and enhances platelet aggregation and adhesion to vascular walls. The PGI2/TXA2 ratio appears to be important in pregnancy and the development of the functioning uteroplacental unit. Recently, antiplatelet treatment such as low-dose aspirin therapy has been effective in preventing the development of PIH and preeclampsia. TXA2 breaks down spontaneously into a stable substance, TXB2, which is inactive. Another stable, inactive metabolite, malondialdehyde (MDA), is formed via the same pathway. TXB2 and MDA are produced in approximately equimolar quantities. We studied the effects of a low-dose aspirin prescription. Production of MDA was remarkably suppressed during the low-dose aspirin therapy. Furthermore, pulsed doppler ultrasound assessment of blood flow was performed in the fetal descending aorta, umbilical artery and uterine artery of the low-dose aspirin therapy patients. Doppler abnormalities were improved during the therapy. It is concluded that low-dose aspirin improves the uteroplacental blood flow assessed by pulse doppler waveform and that determination of MDA is useful as an indicator of platelet thromboxane synthesis."

The maternal and fetal risks associated with pregnancy in women with KTS are proportional to disease severity, which can be exacerbated by pregnancy. Complications include bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolic events and pain. Here, we report the case of a pregnant woman with KTS who had an uneventful pregnancy, labor and postpartum course, but had splenic and large vulvar vein varices.

The patient was treated with two courses of platelet apheresis at the beginning of the gestation. Subsequent to this procedure, the platelet count decreased progressively and remained at about 500,000/microl of blood until delivery without any further treatment. Caesarian section was performed at the 37th week when the placenta presented grade III lesions on ultrasound examination. Histology of the placenta revealed multiple infarcts. Platelet count in the newborn was normal. We concluded that essential thrombocythemia is not a risk factor for pregnancy, and that platelet count may decrease during pregnancy.

Mortality is high and treatment is problematic. Neurological melioidosis is unusual but meningoencephalitis, encephalomyelitis and brain microabscess can occur Dural sinus thrombosis is not an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder with various etiologies. Hypercoagulable state, pregnancy, dehydration, certain blood dyscrasia and contraceptive pills are common causes however meningitis and local head & neck infections may lead to this condition. Dural sinus thrombosis complicating septicemic melioidosis has never been reported. The authors report a 42-year-old Thai man suffering from septicemic melioidosis with dural sinus thrombosis. He had high fever, headache, left hemiparesis, focal seizure and increased intracranial pressure. Diabetes and mild alcoholic cirrhosis were diagnosed in this admission. CT scan, MRI brain and MRV revealed superior saggital sinus thrombosis with complicating venous infarction over right posterior parietal lobe. Hemoculture demonstrated Burkholderia pseudomallei and CSF was acellular Investigations for causes of dural sinus thrombosis were all negative. This patient gradually improved after treatment with ceftazidime, antiepileptic drug and heparin without clinical recurrence. Neuromelioidosis is a rare syndrome that may present as brain abscess, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. The authors report dural sinus thrombosis associated with septicemic melioidosis. The authors' hypothesis of venous thrombosis in the presented case is sepsis induced hypercoagulable state.

CD011053,0,10069759,0,The special case of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.,"Pulmonary thromboembolism remains a major cause of maternal death in the Western world. The frequency of antepartum deaths, including deaths in the first and second trimester, which can be associated with early pregnancy problems such as hyperemesis, is similar in number to the deaths occurring following delivery. Risk factors for deep vein thrombosis have been identified and include age > 35 years, operative delivery (particularly emergency Caesarean section), obesity and a personal or family history of thrombosis or thrombophilia. These risk factors should be used to guide administration of thromboprophylaxis during both pregnancy and the post-partum period, particularly after Caesarean section. Specific consideration towards thromboprophylactic agents is required. Warfarin crosses the placenta, is a known teratogen when used in early pregnancy and can also be associated with bleeding problems in the foetus, particularly at the time of delivery. Thus, warfarin has a limited use in the antenatal period and is usually only employed in patients such as those with artificial heart valves who require long-term anticoagulation. However, as warfarin does not cross the breast in any significant amount, it is suitable during breast feeding. In contrast, heparin does not cross the placenta or the breast therefore foetal problems are not associated with this treatment. However, heparin can be associated with problems such as heparin-induced osteoporosis, allergy and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The risk of some of these complications can be reduced by the use of low-molecular-weight heparins. When venous thromboembolism is suspected in pregnancy, it is critically important to obtain an objective diagnosis. This will include real-time or duplex ultrasound scan of the legs to elaborate the venous system, ventilation perfusion lung scan and, occasionally, venography. Treatment of established venous thromboembolism is similar to that in the non-pregnant patient and it is likely that low-molecular-weight heparins will play a major role in thromboprophylaxis in the future."

MSCT is characterized by a clinical symptom complex comprising marked intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios, and fetal distress due to placental circulatory problems. Perinatal outcomes are appreciably determined by the term of pregnancy, the degree of placental insufficiency, and neonatal status. Prolonged MSCT makes it possible to diagnose this pathology by echographic and magnetic resonance imaging studies and to attempt to treat placental dysfunction through tocolytic therapy and correction of oligohydramnios, to prolong pregnancy, and to have a viable newborn infant. The clinical and morphological diagnosis of MSCT calls for its differential diagnosis with other focal placental lesions, such as subamniotic, intraplacental, and retroplacental hematomas, cytotrophoblastic cyst, umbilical cord cysts, and chorangioma."
CD011053,0,8841812,0,Eclampsia after polychemotherapy for nodal-positive breast cancer during pregnancy.,"We report the case of a 39-year-old para-4 gravida-4 who received polychemotherapy 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 for invasive breast cancer (pT2N2Mo) with extensive metastatic involvement of all 23 axillary lymph nodes removed at 29 gestational weeks. Soon after the second course of chemotherapy at 35 weeks, she developed two eclamptic tonic-clonic seizures which were treated by antihypertensive and anticonvulsive drugs and delivery of a healthy infant, 1650 g (< 10th percentile) by cesarean section. That this patient indeed suffered from eclampsia was supported by the findings of transient postpartum severe hypertension (peak 170/110 mmHg), proteinuria (peak 3.2 g/24 h), incomplete features of the HELLP syndrome (thrombocytopenia 81,000/mm3, haptoglobin < 10 mg/dl) and of DIC, and by the results of cerebral CT scanning showing two 1-cm ischemic lesions. Since the detrimental effect of antineoplastic agents on the rapidly proliferating trophoblast is well known and as abnormal placental function, such as in triploidy, trisomy or hydatiform mole, has been associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia, a possible causal relationship between polychemotherapy and the subsequent development of this rare disorder is suggested."

CD011053,0,21416713,0,[Diagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease during pregnancy].,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the leading cause of maternal mortality in western countries. The similarity between some of the physiological symptoms of pregnancy and symptoms of VTE makes the diagnosis difficult. The D-dimers can be useful for the exclusion of VTE during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. In case of suspicion of DVT, the diagnosis can be made by non-invasive means with lower limb venous compression ultrasonography (CUS). In case of suspicion of PE, pulmonary imaging is often necessary. Scintigraphy is the best validated diagnostic test, but helical computed tomography is frequently proposed due to its higher availability. Fetal radiation is very low with both imaging techniques, and the potentially fatal outcome of undiagnosed PE widely justifies performing these tests."

CD011053,0,15706480,0,"Travel, venous thromboembolism, and thrombophilia.","Current evidence indicates that prolonged air travel predisposes to venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. An effect is seen once travel duration exceeds 6 to 9 hours and becomes obvious in long-haul passengers traveling for 12 or more hours. A recent records linkage study found that increase in thrombosis rate among arriving passengers peaked during the first week and was no longer apparent after 2 weeks. Medium- to long-distance travelers have a 2- to 4-fold increase in relative thrombosis risk compared with nontravelers, but the averaged absolute risk is small (approximately one symptomatic event per 2 million arrivals, with a case-fatality rate of approximately 2%) and there is no evidence that thrombosis is more likely in economy class than in business- or first-class passengers. It remains uncertain whether and to what extent thrombosis risk is increased by short-distance air travel or prolonged travel by motorcar, train, or other means. Most travelers who develop venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism also have one or more other predisposing risk factors that may include older age, obesity, recent injury or surgery, previous thrombosis, venous insufficiency, malignancy, hormonal therapies, or pregnancy. Limited (though theoretically plausible) evidence suggests that factor V Leiden and the prothrombin gene mutation predispose to thrombosis in otherwise healthy travelers. Given that very many passengers with such predispositions do not develop thrombosis, and a lack of prospective studies to link predisposition with disease, it is not now possible to allocate absolute thrombosis risk among intending passengers or to estimate benefit-to-risk ratios or benefit-to-cost ratios for prophylaxis. Randomized comparisons using ultrasound imaging indicate a measurable incidence of subclinical leg vein thrombosis after prolonged air travel, which appears to increase with travel duration and is reduced by graded pressure elastic support stockings. Whether this surrogate outcome measure translates into clinical benefit remains unknown, but support stockings are likely to be more effective and have less adverse effects than the use of aspirin."

Apropos of 3 cases].,"The diagnosis of partial thrombosis of mitral disc valve prostheses is particularly difficult because the clinical presentation is often atypical and the motion of the two hemi-discs is hard to analyse by transthoracic echocardiography. The authors report three cases of partial thrombosis of mitral double-disc valve prostheses. It was not possible to analyse the motion of the two hemi-disc correctly in any of the three patients. The mitral transprosthetic flow recorded by continuous wave Doppler was abnormal with respect to the reference postoperative recording. In addition, in one case, an abnormal echo was observed floating in the left ventricular inflow tract and was suggestive of a thrombus. Transesophageal echo showed abnormal motion of one of the hemi-discs. In two patients this consisted in immobility of the hemi-disc in the semi-closed position; in the other patient, limited excursion of the hemi-disc was recorded. Abnormal retrograde flow in the left atrium was observed in 2 cases and abnormal echoes on the atrial surface of the valve were recorded in one case. After fibrinolysis the transthoracic and transesophageal Doppler echocardiographic parameters returned to normal. These three cases underline the complementarity of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of dysfunction of mitral disc valve prostheses."

Despite the difficulties in clinical diagnosis and the concerns regarding radiation of the fetus, the British Thoracic Society guidelines for imaging pulmonary embolism do not specifically address the issue of imaging for pulmonary embolism in this group. This communication discusses the difficulties of diagnosis and imaging pulmonary embolism in pregnancy and proposes a suitable imaging protocol. Clinical exclusion of patients from further imaging is recommended if the patient has a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism and a normal d-dimer. It is advised that all remaining patients undergo bilateral leg Doppler assessment. If this test is positive, the patient should be treated for pulmonary embolism; if negative, all patients should be referred for CT pulmonary angiography. Ideally, informed consent should be obtained prior to CT scanning. All neonates exposed to iodinated contrast in utero should have their thyroid function tested in the first week of life due to the theoretical risk of contrast induced hypothyroidism."
CD011053,0,8465738,0,A comparison of cardiac valvular involvement in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome versus anticardiolipin-negative systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Recurrent thrombosis and pregnancy loss are well-recognized features of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Uncertainty exists, however, as to whether other reported features of the antiphospholipid syndrome such as cardiac valvular vegetations are truly part of this disorder or more reflective of associated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Several recent studies have concluded that patients with antiphospholipid antibodies have a higher risk of developing Libman-Sacks endocarditis. This study was performed to determine whether antiphospholipid antibodies are the only risk factors for cardiac valvular disease in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) or SLE. Ten patients with PAPS were matched with 20 patients with SLE and 20 healthy control subjects by sex. All participants were tested for anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies by means of a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, and all underwent two-dimensional and color-flow Doppler echocardiography. The echocardiograms were interpreted by two cardiologists blinded to the patients' underlying disease. Sixty percent of the PAPS group had cardiac valvular involvement compared with 40% of the SLE group (p = NS). We conclude that cardiac valvular vegetations are common both in aCL-negative patients with SLE and in patients with PAPS. This suggests that aCL antibodies either play no causative role or are not the only risk factors in the development of cardiac valvular vegetations."
CD011053,0,9536483,0,Reversible intracerebral pathologic entities mediated by vascular autoregulatory dysfunction.,"Several cerebral pathologic processes thought to result from derangements in vascular autoregulatory mechanisms show reversible abnormalities on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance images. The hypertensive encephalopathies are characterized by intracranial abnormalities due to subacutely elevated blood pressure; these entities include hypertensive encephalopathy, preeclampsia and eclampsia, and cyclosporine toxicity. Imaging studies reveal symmetric confluent lesions with mild mass effect and patchy enhancement centered in the immediate subcortical white matter of the occipital lobes. The uremic encephalopathies are characterized by intracranial abnormalities due to an elevated level of blood urea nitrogen; these entities include uremia and glomerulonephritis, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Imaging studies reveal multiple areas of symmetric edema in the basal ganglia; in severe cases, focal infarcts with or without hemorrhage can be seen. As radiologists become more familiar with these entities, cases can be recognized earlier in the disease process, allowing more timely initiation of appropriate therapy."
CD011053,0,15794972,0,Deep vein thrombosis.,"Deep vein thrombosis and its sequelae pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome are some of the most common disorders. A thrombus either arises spontaneously or is caused by clinical conditions including surgery, trauma, or prolonged bed rest. In these instances, prophylaxis with low-dose anticoagulation is effective. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis relies on imaging techniques such as ultrasonography or venography. Only about 25% of symptomatic patients have a thrombus. Thus, clinical risk assessment and D-dimer measurement are used to rule out deep vein thrombosis. Thrombus progression and embolisation can be prevented by low-molecular-weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists. Use of these antagonists for 3-6 months is sufficient for many patients. Those with antithrombin deficiency, the lupus anticoagulant, homozygous or combined defects, or with previous deep vein thrombosis can benefit from indefinite anticoagulation. In cancer patients, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective than and is at least as safe as vitamin K antagonists. Women seem to have a lower thrombosis risk than men, but pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy represent important risk factors."

CD011053,0,12756475,0,[Myocardial infarction and thromboembolism during pregnancy].,"Acute myocardial infarction is a very rare event during pregnancy and bears the problem of misdiagnosis. However, about 150 cases have been published worldwide with a preponderance of anterior wall infarcts. With more women delaying childbearing until an older age and increasing prevalence of smoking in young women, it can be expected that all forms of coronary artery disease--including acute myocardial infarction--will be seen more often in the future. Among the causes of coronary artery occlusion in pregnancy are (1) rupture of very small coronary artery plaques triggered by different events, e.g., hypertension; (2) plain coronary artery disease; (3) dissection of coronary arteries; (4) coronary artery spasms with/without arterial thrombosis. Prompt diagnosis and immediate therapy are necessary to lower the high mortality of mother and fetus. The gold standard in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction during pregnancy is immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent implantation. Application of thrombolytics (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [rt-PA], r-PA, streptokinase [SK], urokinase [UK]) has been reported in single patients but should be limited to cases where acute PTCA is not available and where the infarct occurs before the 14th week of pregnancy because of possible embryopathy. If the patient is in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy, anticipation of delivery should be part of the medical planning. Consultation with an obstetrician must be obtained as soon as the patient enters the hospital. Besides bleeding complications, venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism is among the most common causes of death during pregnancy. Pregnancy-related changes in physiology - increase in the resistance to flow from the lower extremities to the heart - and congenital coagulation abnormalities are most important to be recognized. This leads to the fact that superficial and deep venous thromboses occur more often in pregnancy than in the nonpregnant state. Among the coagulation abnormalities found in pregnancy are hypercoagulability (increased levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, factor VIII, factor X), decreased fibrinolytic activity due to an increased level of plasminogen activator inhibitor, increased adhesion and aggregation of platelets, decreased level of protein C and of the APC (activated protein C) ratio. Individual risks factors justifying diagnostic screening include contraception, smoking, immobilization, infection, adiposity, placental insufficiency, and a family history of thrombosis. It is even more important to establish/rule out the diagnosis of thrombosis in pregnancy than in the nonpregnant state, because the use of anticoagulants carries certain risks during pregnancy. Doppler vein studies should be used for diagnosis. If necessary, venography may be used with shielding of the maternal abdomen. Therapy consists of subcutaneous application of heparin, compression, and early mobilization. Alternatively, especially for long-term management, treatment with low molecular weight heparins is feasible. Thrombolytic treatment is contraindicated in most cases due to the high risk of bleeding complications. However, the application of thrombolytics can be contemplated in single cases after careful consideration of the pros and cons. Most cases of pulmonary embolism should also be handled conservatively with heparin. Only in massive pulmonary embolism with severe hemodynamic compromise, thrombolytic treatment is indicated. To guide future therapy in the patients, it is necessary to establish the lifetime risk of recurrent events by determining: APC resistance, prothrombin mutation 20210 A, homocysteine, AT III, protein C and S, antiphospholipid antibodies, and anticardiolipin antibodies."

CD011053,0,1957037,0,Regulation of fetal vascular tone in the human placenta.,"Using an in vitro placental lobule perfusion technique, the human fetal placental vasculature has been found to respond vigorously with high sensitivity to various vasoconstrictor substances, including angiotensin II, endothelins 1 and 3, prostaglandins F2 alpha, E2 and D2 and the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619. Thromboxane A2 receptors mediating vasoconstriction have been characterized in fetal placental vessels and appear to be identical to those on human platelets and pulmonary blood vessels. Although the isolated fetal placental vessels are largely unresponsive to exogenous vasodilatory stimuli, when preconstricted they respond by vasodilatation to several vasodilator substances, including arachidonate, prostacyclin, prostaglandin E1, theophylline and nitroglycerine. The resistance offered to flow in vitro by the villous vasculature is therefore low, as it is in vivo. Both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms probably operate to cause relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle with the vasodilatory effects of locally released autacoids dominating the effects of those having vasoconstrictor actions."
CD011053,0,2363094,0,[Plasminogen deficiencies in 2 Spanish families. Response to the administration of DDAVP].,"We describe two families with heterozygous plasminogen deficiency. In the first the patient was a 27 year-old female who suffered an acute episode of ischemic cerebrovascular disease affecting the left temporal lobe documented by arteriographic, gammagraphic and CAT studies. She had no family history of thrombotic conditions. In the other family the propositus was a 31 year-old man with spontaneous deep venous thrombosis in the left leg. His father was also symptomatic, with a history of recurrent thrombotic complications after predisposing factors, that included multiple venous thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Laboratory data showed normal hemostasis test results. Antigenic and functional levels of protein C, protein S and antithrombin III were within normal limits. The only abnormality found was decreased plasminogen activity in plasma; antigenic and functional levels were reduced to about half-normal levels. In both cases crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed a normal migration pattern of plasminogen. Thus, we conclude that our patients were carriers of congenital hypoplasminogenemia or familial type I plasminogen deficiency, due to decreased synthesis. We also reported on fibrinolytic response to infusion of DDAVP, a synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone. Fibrinolytic activity was normal in basal conditions as well as in response to DDAVP infusion."

A pulmonary perfusion scintigram revealed a defect in the left lower lung field with no evidence of thrombus in a pulmonary artery angiogram. In this case, an underlying disease which caused pulmonary hypertension might have been the underfined cause. For this reason, primary pulmonary hypertension was the diagnosis. In the present case there is a danger that congestive heart failure may be induced by pregnancy and delivery and, furthermore, there is a possibility that during the clinical course of the illness pulmonary infarction might occur."

CD011053,0,23986360,0,Chronic carbon monoxide inhalation during pregnancy augments uterine artery blood flow and uteroplacental vascular growth in mice.,"End-tidal breath carbon monoxide (CO) is abnormally low in women with preeclampsia (PE), while women smoking during pregnancy have shown an increase in CO levels and a 33% lower incidence of PE. This effect may be, in part, due to lowered sFLT1 plasma levels in smokers, and perhaps low-level CO inhalation can attenuate the development of PE in high-risk women. Our previous work showed maternal chronic CO exposure (<300 ppm) throughout gestation had no maternal or fetal deleterious effects in mice. Our current study evaluated the uteroplacental vascular effects in CD-1 maternal mice that inhaled CO (250 ppm) both chronically, gestation day (GD) 0.5 to 18.5, and acutely, 2.5 h on each of GD 10.5 and 14.5. We demonstrated, using microultrasound measurements of blood velocity and microcomputed tomography imaging of the uteroplacental vasculature, that chronic maternal exposure to CO doubled uterine artery blood flow and augmented uteroplacental vascular diameters and branching. This finding may be of benefit to women with PE, as they exhibit uteroplacental vascular compromise. The ratio of VEGF protein to its FLT1 receptor was increased in the placenta, suggesting a shift to a more angiogenic state; however, maternal circulating levels of VEGF, sFLT1, and their ratio were not significantly changed. Doppler blood velocities in the maternal uterine artery and fetal umbilical artery and vein were unaltered. This study provides in vivo evidence that chronic inhalation of 250 ppm CO throughout gestation augments uterine blood flow and uteroplacental vascular growth, changes that may protect against the subsequent development of preeclampsia."

CD011053,0,19331834,0,Pulmonary embolism: a clinician's perspective.,"Recent advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have both improved diagnostic accuracy as well as made management algorithms safer and more accessible. Physicians need to more frequently consider PE in patients with chest pain or dyspnea and should be aware of the proper diagnostic approach. Diagnostic strategies should include pretest clinical probability, D-dimer assays, and imaging tests. Although it has been proven that the use of algorithms result in better outcomes, there are patient-specific issues that must be considered. Approaches that use computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning appear equally safe, but each approach has advantages and disadvantages that should be appreciated to provide the best care. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating whether these diagnostic processes can be made even easier and less expensive. Importantly, patients at low risk with a negative D-dimer can avoid imaging tests and those at moderate risk with a negative high sensitivity D-dimer can have venous thromboembolism excluded without the need for imaging. However, these patients also represent those most likely to have false-positive tests and clinically irrelevant PE. V/Q scanning may be more appropriate in premenopausal women, in those with renal dysfunction or diabetes, in those with known contrast allergies, and perhaps in patients with known family history of breast cancer. As with any illness, there is room for improvement in the management of PE, but it remains unknown whether preventive measures, diagnosis, treatment modalities, or physician or patient education should be the focus."
CD011053,0,19331835,0,The use of leg venous ultrasonography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"The role of ultrasonography of the lower extremities for the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism has become more clearly defined with time. Ultrasonography is a useful first-line test for pulmonary embolism in clinical circumstances in which radiographic imaging is contraindicated or not readily available (eg, pregnancy). Ultrasonography is likely not required for the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism who have a negative computed tomography pulmonary angiography, particularly if there are no symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Ultrasonography is helpful to exclude a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in patients who have nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion scans. For patients with nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion scans and negative ultrasonography who are considered clinically highly likely to have pulmonary embolism, it is recommended that computed tomography pulmonary angiography be performed."

The clinical signs are usually mild during childhood, often with isolated thrombocytopenia. But their symptoms become more evident when patients have infections or get pregnant. We identified 43 USS-patients in Japan, who ranged in age from early childhood to 79 years of age. Analysing the natural history of these USS patients based on ADAMTS13 gene mutations may help characterise their clinical phenotypes. Severe neonatal jaundice that requires exchange blood transfusion, a hallmark of USS, was found in 18 of 43 patients (42%). During childhood, 25 of 43 patients were correctly diagnosed with USS without gender disparity. These 25 patients were categorised as having 'the early-onset phenotype'. Between 15 and 45 years of age, 15 were correctly diagnosed, and, interestingly, they were all female. The remaining three patients were male and were diagnosed when they were older than 45 years of age, suggesting that they were 'the late-onset phenotype'. Two of these three males developed sudden overt TTP when they were 55 and 63 years old, respectively. These two men had two different homozygous ADAMTS13 gene mutations, p.R193W/p.R193W and p.C1024R/p.C1024R, respectively. Both of which were not discovered in the US or Western countries. In vitro expression studies showed that these two proteins were consistently secreted into the culture medium but to a lesser extent and with reduced activity compared to the wild-type protein. Our results indicate that 'the late-onset phenotype' of USS is formed with ethnic specificity."

CD011053,0,20920634,0,Radiation dosimetry and safety issues in the investigation of pulmonary embolism.,"When considering the investigation of the patient with possible pulmonary embolism, one needs to balance the likelihood of disease and the diagnostic utility of the test against the risks associated with the investigation. Both computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan involve exposure to ionizing radiation. The effect of low-level ionizing radiation remains an issue of some controversy. CTPA delivers a greater effective dose and, in particular, greater doses to breast tissue, than the V/Q scan (typically 10-70 mGy for CTPA vs <1.5 mGy for V/Q to breast). Since breast tissue is particularly radiosensitive in younger women, the V/Q study has an advantage over CTPA in this group. In the pregnant patient, fetal exposure has been raised as a concern. In fact, there is typically only low fetal exposure from either study (<1 mGy). The CTPA does deliver less fetal exposure, particularly in the first trimester, but the difference between CTPA and V/Q scan is small when compared with the difference in dose to maternal breast from the 2 investigations. The ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ie, ALARA) principle favors the use of V/Q scans in young women, assuming the diagnostic power of the 2 tests is comparable. CTPA requires a contrast injection that can cause adverse reactions in a small number of patients. No significant risk, however, has been demonstrated with the radiopharmaceuticals involved in V/Q scans."

Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura results from platelet destruction due to autoantibodies. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage is a rare but devastating complication of these patients.

The clinical course and treatment of this unusual clinical complication is discussed in relation to the world literature.
CD011053,0,20920633,0,V/Q SPECT and computed tomographic pulmonary angiography.,"Planar ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy has been largely displaced by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in recent years for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). This change can be attributed to multiple studies that demonstrate CTPA has a reasonable sensitivity and good prognostic value in negative cases, associated with the ability to deliver few indeterminate results and provide an alternate diagnosis in a significant number of patients. However, the technique has significant limitations. The Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II) study has shown a sensitivity of 83%, which is not optimal. However, CT technology has greatly progressed since this time, and therefore it is likely that this number has improved. The PIOPED II study has also shown that there may be a problem in positive or negative predictive value when the imaging results are discordant with the clinical probability. Additional concerns include allergies, contrast nephropathy associated with the use of intravenous contrast in patients with impaired creatinine clearance, suboptimal results in pregnant women, and high radiation exposure. In recent years, V/Q single-photon emission computed tomography has emerged as a mature technique for the diagnosis of PE and has been shown to be clearly superior to planar V/Q. The technique has excellent sensitivity for PE and is not associated with most of the limitations of CTPA, although it has its own set of limitations in patients with very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or with a severely abnormal chest x-ray. V/Q single-photon emission computed tomography can be used as the initial modality for PE diagnosis in a wide variety of situations although CTPA remains invaluable in specific scenarios."
CD011053,0,12678202,0,Isolated noncompaction cardiomyopathy presenting with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia--case report and literature review.,"Isolated noncompaction cardiomyopathy is an exceedingly rare congenital cardiomyopathy. A case of isolated noncompaction cardiomyopathy is reported and the literature on the subject collected through a comprehensive literature search is reviewed. Fewer than 100 cases of this condition have been reported. Isolated noncompaction cardiomyopathy is caused by a defect in cardiac morphogenesis resulting in an arrest of compaction of loose interwoven meshwork of myocardial fibers during intrauterine life, which results in severe systolic dysfunction as well as undue hypertrophy of the involved walls of the ventricles. Although the most frequent sites involved are left ventricular apex and inferior wall, involvement of other left ventricular walls and right ventricle has also been reported. Etiology of the isolated noncompaction of myocardium is not clear. Familial cases have been reported and the mode of inheritance is heterogeneous. In X-linked form of the disease, a locus has been found on Xq28, and mutations have been reported in G4.5 gene. The age of onset of symptoms ranges from infancy to the geriatric age. Patients with isolated noncompaction cardiomyopathy have a high incidence of heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism. The most common presentation is congestive heart failure. Arrhythmias include atrial arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death. The patient reported in this article presented with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Echocardiography is the procedure of choice to establish diagnosis. Due to the lack of associated cardiac anomalies, antenatal detection is difficult. The treatment is that for congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism. The end-stage congestive heart failure is managed with heart transplantation and potential life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Prognosis is poor and the common causes of death are intractable heart failure and sudden cardiac death."

In our department, 22% of kyphoplasties were performed with calcium phosphate cement and the remainder with polymethylmethacrylate. All patients were initially assessed by an interdisciplinary kyphoplasty colloquium, composed of consultants in traumatology, radiology, and endocrinology. Indications included fresh traumatic vertebral fractures; painful sintered osteoporotic vertebrae; osteolysis and painful vertebral body collapse caused by multiple myelomas; and lymphomas and pathological fractures due to metastases of malignant tumors (prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and malignant melanoma) or benign vertebral tumors (hemangioma). Contraindications included patients with instability of the posterior wall and/or pedicles, an infection of the fractured vertebra, a severe hemorrhagic diathesis, known allergies to the cements, pregnancy, and ASA score of 4. The standard postoperative computed tomography scan of the kyphoplasty-treated vertebrae revealed a dorsal cement leakage in 38 vertebrae representing 3.3% of all levels. A permanent monoparesis of the left leg, 2 cases of temporary neurological deficits, 2 cases of hemorrhage, and 1 asymptomatic pulmonary embolism were observed as postoperative complications. We observed no complications relating to polymethylmethacrylate described in the literature. By careful interdisciplinary indication setting and a standardized treatment model, kyphoplasty presents a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of various vertebral fractures."

CD011053,0,15027587,0,[Vascular placental pathology in high-risk groups: definition and synopsis].,"The vascular placental pathology (VPP) is associated with many etiologies. Some are the consequence of a maternal genetic or acquired predisposition. Others are associated with a chronic maternal disease (hypertension, lupus, obesity, diabetes, ...). Finally, some others are associated with placental implantation leading to fetal ischemia (multiple pregnancy, chorioangioma, primiparity, feto-placental hydrops) or to environmental (altitude) or nutritional factors (famine and specific alimentary depressions). We classify these factors into three categories according to the risk level (moderate, significant and elevated). While any of these factors can increase the risk of VPP, no one is sufficiently sensitive or specific in predict inevitable onset of VPP. In most cases VPP results from a combination of two (or more) risk factors. The risk factors of VPP classified as moderate include age (> or = 35 years), increased blood pressure during the second trimester of pregnancy, a new paternity, dietetic factors or environmental factors, smoking and controlled diabetes (class B, C), or inactive systemic diseases. Risk is significantly elevated among obese (BMI > or = 25), primiparous women, women with a past familial history (first degree) of preeclampsia or eclampsia, cocaine use or association of tobacco and caffeine use, increased placental mass (associated with twin pregnancy, fetal hydrops or molar pregnancy), uncontrolled diabetes, lupus, active scleroderma. Risk is considered to be high among patients with chronic hypertension, women with a past history of preeclampsia, diabetes (class D, F, R), patients with active systemic disease or with antiphospholipid antibodies or women with lupus or renal lesions and/or proteinuria as well as chronic kidney disease resulting in proteinuria, hypertension and renal insufficiency. Finally, the risk of VPP is considered to be increased in the presence of acquired thrombophilia. It remains moderate in the presence of isolated genetic thrombophilia, except in forms presenting with multiple genetic mutations or associated with an hyperhomocysteinemia. A ""high-risk group"" is defined among women with past history of deep venous thromboembolic events outside pregnancy, or with a past history of placental vascular pathology (intra-uterine death, placental abruptio, severe and precocious placental, intra-uterine growth retardation, early and repetitive fetal loss) and who, in addition, present with acquired thrombophilia (antiphospholipid antibodies, thrombocytemia), unique homozygous genetic thrombophilia, amultiple genetic thrombophilia or unique heterozygous genetic thrombophilia associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Prophylactic treatment of acquired thrombophilia and of the multiple genetic forms or associated with hypercysteinemia is a logical rationale, particularly among women with a past history of placental vascular pathology, or with a past history of venous thromboembolic events. On the contrary, prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin in the event of asymptomatic genetic thrombophilic mutations and for women without a past history of deep venous thromboembolism or vascular placental pathology remains controversial."

Most cases of red cell alloimmunization associated with fetal anemia are caused by the antibody to the D red cell antigen. The intravascular transfusion of red cells to a hydropic fetus in such cases has notably improved survival. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis due to maternal parvovirus infection has also been treated successfully with the intravascular transfusion of red cells, whereas fetomaternal hemorrhage has not proved amenable to such therapy. Sensitization to the PLA-1 platelet antigen is the most common cause of fetal thrombocytopenia in maternal platelet alloimmunization. Fetal platelet transfusions have not proved to be a practical therapeutic modality for this disorder owing to the short half-life of the platelets. Platelets transfusions to the fetus just before delivery may avert the need for cesarean section in cases of severe thrombocytopenia."

The indications for these procedures depend on how advanced the pregnancy is. The authors point out the indications for interruption of the vena caval flow during pregnancy in the light of four recent case histories. The main one is failure of medical treatment. Interruption of the vena caval flow is to be recommended when there is impaired circulation or when a thrombus is threatening.

We have recently taken the challenge of treating asymptomatic newborns on the basis of active sonographic brain lesions in order to prevent labyrinth destruction. We would also like to stress the importance of suspecting children with congenital hearing loss, or hearing loss that develops in the first year of life, of having an asymptomatic congenital CMV-infection.

CD011053,0,12069928,0,Vascular mechanisms of increased arterial pressure in preeclampsia: lessons from animal models.,"Normal pregnancy is associated with reductions in total vascular resistance and arterial pressure possibly due to enhanced endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and decreased vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictor agonists. These beneficial hemodynamic and vascular changes do not occur in women who develop preeclampsia; instead, severe increases in vascular resistance and arterial pressure are observed. Although preeclampsia represents a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, the vascular and cellular mechanisms underlying this disorder have not been clearly identified. Studies in hypertensive pregnant women and experimental animal models suggested that reduction in uteroplacental perfusion pressure and the ensuing placental ischemia/hypoxia during late pregnancy may trigger the release of placental factors that initiate a cascade of cellular and molecular events leading to endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction and thereby increased vascular resistance and arterial pressure. The reduction in uterine perfusion pressure and the ensuing placental ischemia are possibly caused by inadequate cytotrophoblast invasion of the uterine spiral arteries. Placental ischemia may promote the release of a variety of biologically active factors, including cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and reactive oxygen species. Threshold increases in the plasma levels of placental factors may lead to endothelial cell dysfunction, alterations in the release of vasodilator substances such as nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI(2)), and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, and thereby reductions of the NO-cGMP, PGI(2)-cAMP, and hyperpolarizing factor vascular relaxation pathways. The placental factors may also increase the release of or the vascular reactivity to endothelium-derived contracting factors such as endothelin, thromboxane, and ANG II. These contracting factors could increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) and stimulate Ca(2+)-dependent contraction pathways in vascular smooth muscle. The contracting factors could also increase the activity of vascular protein kinases such as protein kinase C, leading to increased myofilament force sensitivity to [Ca(2+)](i) and enhancement of smooth muscle contraction. The decreased endothelium-dependent mechanisms of vascular relaxation and the enhanced mechanisms of vascular smooth muscle contraction represent plausible causes of the increased vascular resistance and arterial pressure associated with preeclampsia."

Previously, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has been identified as a plausible causative factor. Cell-free Hb and its degradation products are known to cause oxidative stress and tissue damage, typical of the PE placenta. A1M (Œ±1-microglobulin) is an endogenous scavenger of radicals and heme. Here, the usefulness of A1M as a treatment for PE is investigated in the pregnant ewe PE model, in which starvation induces PE symptoms via hemolysis. Eleven ewes, in late pregnancy, were starved for 36 hours and then treated with A1M (n = 5) or placebo (n = 6) injections. After injections, the ewes were re-fed and observed for additional 72 hours. They were monitored for blood pressure, proteinuria, blood cell distribution and clinical and inflammation markers in plasma. Before termination, the utero-placental circulation was analyzed with Doppler velocimetry and the kidney glomerular function was analyzed by Ficoll sieving. At termination, blood, kidney and placenta samples were collected and analyzed for changes in gene expression and tissue structure. The starvation resulted in increased amounts of the hemolysis marker bilirubin in the blood, structural damages to the placenta and kidneys and an increased glomerular sieving coefficient indicating a defect filtration barrier. Treatment with A1M ameliorated these changes without signs of side-effects. In conclusion, A1M displayed positive therapeutic effects in the ewe starvation PE model, and was well tolerated. Therefore, we suggest A1M as a plausible treatment for PE in humans."

Diabetes in the maternal rat was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight) on day 7 of pregnancy. Contraction to noradrenaline was analyzed in isolated MRA from offspring of diabetic (O-DR) and non-diabetic (O-CR) rats at 3, 6 and 12 months of age. Release of thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) and prostaglandins E(2) (PGE(2)) and F(2Œ±) (PGF(2Œ±)), was measured by specific enzyme immunoassay kits. O-DR developed hypertension from 6 months of age compared with O-CR. Arteries from O-DR were hyperactive to noradrenaline only at 6 and 12 months of age. Endothelial removal abolished this hyperreactivity to noradrenaline between O-CR and O-DR. Preincubation with either the COX-1/2 (indomethacin) or COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398) decreased noradrenaline contraction only in 6- and 12-month-old O-DR, while it remained unmodified by COX-1 inhibitor SC-560. In vessels from 6-month-old O-DR, a similar reduction in the contraction to noradrenaline produced by NS-398 was observed when TP and EP receptors were blocked (SQ29548+AH6809). In 12-month-old O-DR, this effect was only achieved when TP, EP and FP were blocked (SQ29548+AH6809+AL8810). Noradrenaline-stimulated TxB(2) and PGE(2) release was higher in 6- and 12-month-old O-DR, whereas PGF(2Œ±) was increased only in 12-month-old O-DR. Our results demonstrated that in utero exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia in rats increases the participation of COX-2-derived prostanoids on contraction to noradrenaline, which might help to explain the greater response to this agonist in MRA from 6- and 12-month-old offspring. As increased contractile response in resistance vessels may contribute to hypertension, our results suggest a role for these COX-2-derived prostanoids in elevating vascular resistance and blood pressure in offspring of diabetic rats."

However, the results of US are not always sufficient. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which uses no ionizing radiation, may be an ideal method for further evaluation. Although MR imaging is not recommended during the first trimester and use of contrast material is not recommended in pregnant patients, fast MR imaging is useful in various obstetric settings and can provide more specific information with excellent tissue contrast and multiplanar views. In pregnant patients with acute conditions, various diseases (eg, red degeneration of a uterine leiomyoma) may be diagnosed. MR imaging allows characterization of pelvic masses discovered during pregnancy and diagnosis of postpartum complications (eg, abscess, hematoma, ovarian vein thrombosis). In pregnant patients with hydronephrosis, MR urography can demonstrate the site of obstruction and the cause (eg, a ureteral stone). MR pelvimetry may be beneficial in cases of breech presentation. Contrast material-enhanced dynamic MR imaging allows one to evaluate the vascularity of a placental polyp, detect the viable component of a gestational trophoblastic tumor, and diagnose a uterine arteriovenous malformation.

CD011053,0,18854808,0,Predictors and risk factors of pre-eclampsia.,"Understanding the mechanisms of disease responsible for the syndrome of pre-eclampsia (PE) as well as early risk assessment is still a major challenge. Risk factors for PE are nulliparity, a family or own history of PE, pre-existing diabetes or increased body mass index, multiple pregnancy, maternal age, renal disease, hypertension or raised blood pressure at booking and chronic autoimmune disease. Other factors are thrombophilias and insulin resistance together with obesity. On the other hand identification of predictors of the development of pre-eclampsia would enhance the ability to diagnose women likely to develop pre-eclampsia before the onset of the disease and would improve their monitoring and enable to convey them to randomized trials for evaluating prophylactic treatment. A number of biochemical agents have been assessed as markers for predicting pre-eclampsia. None of them has been proved to be of clinical value yet. Much effort has been put into evaluating novel potential markers and their combination with other screening methods such as Doppler sonography. The most promising biochemical markers, to date, are placenta protein 13 (PP-13) as well as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng). These markers allow screening at a relatively early stage and, most importantly, show relatively high predictive values and improved diagnostic performance if combined with first trimester Doppler sonography. However, until now, too little data are available to justify the clinical use of these markers. Large-scale prospective studies, assessing these markers, are important to advance progress in reducing maternal and perinatal morbidity and relieving the heavy burden of pre-eclampsia."

A review and case report].,"Foetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of severe thrombocytopenia in the newborn. It is an acute disorder which implies that foetal platelets are destroyed during the pregnancy due to a maternal alloimmune IgG antibody. More than 80% of Caucasians are HPA-1a specific. Intracranial haemorrhage, which occurs in 30% of cases, is the most serious complication, with a 10% mortality rate or a 20% rate of irreversible neurological sequels. The high risk of a recurrence of serious bleeding in future pregnancies led us to consider prophylaxis or prenatal treatment. An early diagnosis of this process allows an effective therapy to be carried out based on the infusion of compatible phenotype HPA platelets or endovenous immunoglobulins. We present the case of a 27 year old pregnant woman, who in the 35th week of a second pregnancy was diagnosed using echography with a bilateral foetal hydrocephaly. After caesarean delivery in the 36th week, the newborn presented haematomas in the left shoulder and gluteus, macrocephalia with tension of the fontanellas and hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid after insertion of an external ventricular derivation catheter. The haemogram revealed a severe trombocytopenia (9 x 109/L). In the light of clinical suspicion of foetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, infusion was made of platelets from a non-phenotyped donor for the HPA-1a system, and an endovenous immunoglobulin treatment was followed, with a recovery of platelet counts, but with neurological sequels that are probably irreversible. The immunohaematologal study confirmed the negative HPA-1a maternal phenotype, the neonatal HPA-1a positive phenotype and the presence of anti-HPA-1a alloantibodies in the maternal serum. Nowadays, the prophylaxis and treatment continue to be a controversial issue that is open to discussion, as is the possibility of implementing antenatal screening."
CD011053,0,18841531,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of maternal diseases of the abdomen and pelvis in the pregnant patient.,The diagnosis of abdominal and pelvic diseases during pregnancy can be challenging. Ultrasonography has been the traditional first-line imaging tool in evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis in a pregnant patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become one of the most useful methods in management of pregnant women in recent years. It does not expose mother and fetus to ionizing radiation and provides cross-sectional images in any plane with high anatomic resolution even without intravenous contrast administration. The goals of this article are to discuss the role of MRI in the evaluation of maternal diseases involving the abdomen and pelvis and to review the MRI findings of these diseases.
CD011053,0,12522527,0,Peripartum acute myocardial infarction: management perspective.,"Acute myocardial infarction in pregnancy and puerperium is an uncommon event with substantial morbidity and mortality rates. Atherosclerosis may be the cause, but often the coronary arteries are healthy at angiography. In such cases, the suggested mechanism is a decreased coronary perfusion related to coronary spasm or in situ thrombosis. Most pregnant women who died after myocardial infarction did so at the time of initial infarction, and maternal mortality was greatest if the infarction was late in pregnancy. Increasing cardiovascular stresses of late pregnancy, especially when intensified by parturition, seriously compromise women with ischemic heart disease. Therefore, there should be efforts to limit myocardial oxygen demand throughout pregnancy, and particularly during parturition. It is important for diagnosis to have increased awareness of its possible occurrence. Although principles of management can be generalized, it is necessary to provide individualized care for these high-risk patients by a multidisciplinary team of cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and obstetricians."

Contrast and radionuclide venography are valuable diagnostic techniques. Prophylactic, subcutaneously administered heparin is useful in preventing deep venous thrombosis in the high-risk pregnant patient. Warfarin is not recommended because of its effect on the fetus."

CD011053,0,3541667,0,In utero cerebral hemorrhage in alloimmune thrombocytopenia.,"Central nervous system hemorrhage is a well-recognized complication of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia attributed to perinatal trauma from passage through the birth canal. That central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage can occur in utero is not as well recognized, and congenital CNS lesions have only circumstantially been linked to thrombocytopenia. We report two cases of intrauterine CNS hemorrhage shown to have occurred prenatally, resulting in porencephaly. The second case is unique in that the necropsy finding of a porencephalic cyst arising from an old hemorrhagic site pathologically confirms that the etiology of congenital CNS lesions in alloimmune thrombocytopenia is due to hemorrhage. This second case received close prenatal monitoring and yet died as a result of hemorrhage that was not detected until emergency operative delivery. A review of the literature revealed 10 cases, including two other pairs of siblings, who had CNS damage attributable to intrauterine hemorrhage. These findings indicate that congenital CNS lesions in alloimmune thrombocytopenia are due to intrauterine hemorrhage that careful obstetric and prenatal care may not identify or prevent. This fact should be included when genetic counseling is offered to alloimmunized mothers."

In the past, total occlusion of the abdominal aorta and its major branches was associated with high mortality. Successful aortic thrombectomy in the neonatal period has been reported only once in English literature. The successful management of 2 infants described here shows the need for early diagnosis and aggressive approach, including surgical thrombectomy when indicated. Thromboembolism of abdominal aorta and iliac arteries can be diagnosed by noninvasive methods, such as 2-dimensional echoaortography and Doppler blood flow measurement."

This presentation is typical of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), a diagnosis that may be unfamiliar to many Emergency Physicians. With the increasing frequency of in vitro fertilization procedures, this disease process is becoming more common. Numerous complications can occur with OHSS, including third-space fluid accumulation, hemoconcentration, renal failure, and thromboembolic phenomena.

CD011053,0,14711763,0,Thromboembolism.,"Venous thomboembolism (VTE) causes only about 2% of maternal deaths in the developing world but is a leading cause of direct maternal deaths in developed countries. Pregnancy increases the risk of VTE through venous stasis, changes in blood coagulability and damage to vessels. Early diagnosis of VTE depends crucially on awareness of the condition but clinical diagnosis is unreliable in pregnancy and objective testing is essential. Compression or duplex ultrasonography is used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis and a ventilation/perfusion scan for pulmonary embolism. Low molecular weight heparins are safe and effective for treatment and for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy. All women should undergo risk assessment in early pregnancy or preferably before pregnancy. Identifying risk factors such as obesity, or a past or family history of thromboembolism, allows at-risk women to be offered thromboprophylaxis. Guidelines on thromboprophylaxis have reduced deaths after caesarean section and are now being developed for all women."

The authors report a series of 9 infants with thrombotic events and the associated genetic risk factors. The clinical and laboratory records of newborns and infants with a history of thrombotic events were summarized, while patients with underlying diseases were excluded. The frequency of the genetic mutations was compared to a control group of 80 children from the same ethnic origin. In 6 patients a cerebrovascular accident was diagnosed and in 3 newborns, CT scan could diagnose antenatal brain infarct. In another 2 patients deep-vein thrombosis associated with femoral catheterization was diagnosed. Seven infants were factor V Leiden heterozygous and another one homozygous. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotype was found in 5 infants. Five cases were found to be double heterozygous for those two mutations, and another one double heterozygous for FVL and factor II. The results of this small series of patients indicate that cerebrovascular accident is the major thrombotic event in infants and the combination of more than one prothrombotic factors may be the cause of those events. The correct management, including anticoagulant therapy, is still under discussion and waiting for larger series and long-term follow-up results until accurate recommendations can be made."

CD011053,0,8539576,0,"[Hypertension and pregnancy. Diagnosis, physiopathology and treatment].","This review on hypertension in pregnancy focuses mainly on the pathophysiology and prevention of pregnancy induced hypertension which, when associated with proteinuria, is usually called preeclampsia. Rather than a genuine hypertensive disease, preeclampsia is mainly a systemic endothelial disease causing activation of platelets and diffuse ischemic disorders whose most obvious clinical manifestations involve the kidney (hence the proteinuria, edema and hyperuricemia), the liver (hence the hemolytic elevated liver enzymes and low platelets, or HELLP syndrome), and the brain (hence eclamptic convulsions). Hypertension is explained by increased vascular reactivity rather than by an imbalance between vasoconstrictive and vasodilating circulating hormones. This increased reactivity is due to endothelial dysfunction with imbalance between prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 and possibly dysfunction of NO and endothelin synthesis. The aggressive substances for endothelium are thought to be of placentar origin and the cause of their release is explained by placentar ischemia related to a defect of trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries. The etiology of this latter defect is unknown but involves immunologic mechanisms with genetic predisposition. The only effective treatment for PIH is extraction of the baby with the whole placenta. The decision for extraction is often a very delicate obstetric problem. Antihypertensive drugs are mainly indicated in severe hypertension (> 160-100 mm Hg), with the aim of preventing cerebral hemorrhage in the mother, but have not been shown to improve fetal morbidity or mortality. Eclamptic seizures can be prevented and treated more effectively with magnesium sulfate than with diazepam or phenytoin. Prevention of preeclampsia remains the main challenge. Whereas antihypertensive drugs are ineffective, calcium supplementation and low dose aspirin have proven effective but mainly in selected populations with a relatively high incidence of preeclampsia (> 8-10%). In multiparas the selection of such a high risk population is relatively easy when at least 2 (or 1?) previous pregnancies were complicated with early preeclampsia and/or intrauterine growth retardation. In nulliparas the selection of the high-risk population is still a subject of research. The 2 most promising criteria are abnormal Doppler velocimetry of the uterine arteries at around 20 weeks of amenorrhea, and abnormally high plasma levels of beta HCG at 17 weeks of amenorrhea."
CD011053,0,2191373,0,Placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas and infarction: sonographic-pathologic correlation.,"High-resolution ultrasound (US) and pathologic analysis were used to define the relationship between placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas, frequently seen in the third trimester, and the clinically significant entity of placental infarction. Placentas were obtained from three groups of patients: those prospectively demonstrating one or more placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter on third-trimester sonograms (n = 14), those with risk factors for vascular disease (n = 12), and control patients without risk factors (n = 16). Pathologic analysis demonstrated significantly more infarcts in patients with risk factors than in control patients (17 vs three, P = .047). Of a total of 22 infarcts from all three groups, 19 (86%) were isoechoic to viable placenta and therefore not detected with US. The three infarcts identified with US contained hypoechoic or anechoic foci of fibrin or hemorrhage. Of 26 placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas 23 (88%) were decidual septal cysts or intervillous thrombosis without infarction. The authors conclude that nonhemorrhagic placental infarction cannot be identified with ex utero US and, by inference, that prenatal US is probably insensitive for detection of placental infarction."

A case-control study.,"To assess the influence of oral contraceptives (OC) on the risk of cerebral thrombosis and transient cerebral ischemic attacks, a 5-year case-control study including all Danish hospitals was conducted. All women 15-44 years old who suffered a cerebral thromboembolic attack (CTA) during the period 1994-95 and 1200 age matched control subjects were included. Of 309 patients and 1200 control subjects questionnaires sent out, 271 patients (87.7%) and 1074 control subjects (89.5%) responded and agreed to participate. After exclusion of women with nonvalid diagnoses, previous thromboembolic diseases, or current pregnancy, 219 patients and 1041 control subjects were available for analysis. After confounder control and with nonusers as reference, current users of first generation OC (50 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol [EE] or estrans) had an odds ratio (OR) of CTA of 1.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-3.92); users of second generation OC (levonorgestrel or norgestimate) had an OR of 2.37 (1.35-4.16); and users of third generation OC (desogestrel or gestodene) had an OR of 1.32 (0.78-2.22). Users of OC with 50, 30-40, or 20 micrograms EE had OR of 2.65 (1.11-6.34), 1.60 (1.05-2.43), and 1.59 (0.57-4.58), respectively. Odds ratios for specific progestin types were as follows: estrans 1.37 (0.60-3.13), levonorgestrel 2.43 (1.40-4.21), norgestimate 7.09 (1.87-26.8), desogestrel 1.62 (0.72-3.63), and gestodene 1.24 (0.67-2.30). Duration of use was without significant influence on the risk and the OR were constant across the age bands. Compared with women who had never used OC, former users had an OR of CTA of 0.95 (0.66-1.51). In conclusion, use of OC with 50 micrograms of EE and OC with second generation progestins increased the risk of CTA significantly. OC with third generation progestins did not have any significant influence on the risk of CTA. The risk of CTA among former users of OC was not increased."
CD011053,0,8000608,0,10-year experience with the Biocor porcine bioprosthesis in the aortic position.,"Six hundred and nineteen consecutive patients had aortic valve replacement between January 1983 and January 1993 with the zero pressure fixed Biocor porcine bioprosthesis. Mean age was 66.2 years (range 17-88 years). Male/female ratio was 416/203. Concomitant cardiac procedures, mainly coronary bypass surgery, were performed in 35% (214/619). Early mortality was 5.9% (37/619). Late mortality was 15.8% (92/582). Actuarial survival at 10 years was 60.0 +/- 4.9% and freedom from valve-related mortality was 97.6 +/- 0.8%. Total follow up was 2308 years. The follow up was 99.2% complete. Thromboembolic rate was 1.1%/pty (fatal 0.1%/pty, major 0.3%/pty and minor 0.6%/pty). The incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis was 0.3%/pty (fatal 0.1%/pty). Freedom from reoperation due to structural valve deterioration, non-structural dysfunction and prosthetic valve endocarditis was 78.1 +/- 10.7%, 98.5 +/- 0.6% and 97.6 +/- 0.9%, respectively. The occurrence of structural valve deterioration varied considerably between age groups. In patients below 50 years of age the actuarial freedom from structural valve deterioration was 52.4 +/- 22.0%, while it was 96.2 +/- 1.1% for those between 71 and 80 years. At the 10-year follow up all patients had improved clinically. Preoperatively, 75% of the patients were in NYHA classes III or IV compared to 8% at the 10-year follow up. We conclude, that the Biocor bioprosthesis has a low rate of complications in terms of thromboembolism, anticoagulant-related bleeding, prosthetic valve endocarditis and valve-related mortality as compared to mechanical valves and also to other bioprostheses. The durability of the Biocor bioprosthesis has increased slightly compared to that reported with other, earlier models when inserted in patients above 50 years of age."

However, definite fetal valve replacements require growing implants adaptive to fetal and postnatal development. The presented study investigates the fetal implantation of prenatally engineered living autologous cell-based heart valves. Autologous amniotic fluid cells (AFCs) were isolated from pregnant sheep between 122 and 128 days of gestation via transuterine sonographic sampling. Stented trileaflet heart valves were fabricated from biodegradable PGA-P4HB composite matrices (n = 9) and seeded with AFCs in vitro. Within the same intervention, tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs) and unseeded controls were implanted orthotopically into the pulmonary position using an in-utero closed-heart hybrid approach. The transapical valve deployments were successful in all animals with acute survival of 77.8% of fetuses. TEHV in-vivo functionality was assessed using echocardiography as well as angiography. Fetuses were harvested up to 1 week after implantation representing a birth-relevant gestational age. TEHVs showed in vivo functionality with intact valvular integrity and absence of thrombus formation. The presented approach may serve as an experimental basis for future human prenatal cardiac interventions using fully biodegradable autologous cell-based living materials."

CD011053,0,12751902,0,Heterogeneity of microvascular endothelial cells isolated from human term placenta and macrovascular umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"The present study compares some phenotypic and physiologic characteristics of microvascular and macrovascular endothelial cells from within one human organ. To this end microvascular endothelial cells from human full-term placenta (PLEC) were isolated using a new method and compared with macrovascular human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and an SV40-transformed placental venous endothelial cell line (HPEC-A2). PLEC were isolated by enzymatic perfusion of small placental vessels, purified on a density gradient and cultured subsequently. Histological sections of the enzyme-treated vessels showed a selective removal of the endothelial lining in the perfused placental cotyledons. The endothelial identity of the cells was confirmed by staining with the endothelial markers anti-von Willebrand factor, Ulex europaeus lectin and anti-QBEND10. The cells internalized acetylated low-density lipoprotein and did not show immunoreactivity with markers for macrophages, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The spindle-shaped PLEC grew in swirling patterns similar to that described for venous placental endothelial cells. However, scanning electron microscopic examination clearly showed that PLEC remained elongated at the confluent state, in contrast to the more polygonal phenotype of HPEC-A2 and HUVEC that were studied in parallel. The amount of vasoactive substances (endothelin-1,2, thromboxane, angiotensin II, prostacyclin) released into the culture medium and the proliferative response to cytokines was more similar to human dermal microvessels (MIEC) derived from non-fetal tissue than to HUVEC. Potent mitogens such as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF121, VEGF165) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) induced proliferation of all endothelial cell types. Placental growth factors PIGF-1 and PIGF-2 effectively stimulated cell proliferation on PLEC (142 +/- 7% and 173 +/- 10%) and MIEC (160 +/- 20% and 143 +/- 28%) in contrast to HUVEC (9 +/- 8% and 15 +/- 20%) and HPEC-A2 (15 +/- 7% and 24 +/- 6%) after 48 h incubation time under serum-free conditions. These data support evidence for (1) the microvascular identity of the isolated PLEC described in this study, and (2) the phenotypic and physiologic heterogeneity of micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells within one human organ."

The author treated selected cases of PE with long-term epidural analgesia (LTEA), that reduced labour pain and operated directly on the PE aetiopathogenesis, not on the symptoms. A total of 15 women with PE were hospitalised at 35-37 weeks of pregnancy, checked for blood pressure, liver and renal function, platelet count and had an epidural catheter inserted for a continuous administration of an analgesic mixture of Naropin, Sufentanil and Clonidine. The average weeks at delivery were 37 weeks and 1 day; 10 women had a spontaneous delivery and five a caesarean section: the mean birth weight was 2,906 g and the Apgar scores at 1 min and 5 min exceeded 7 in all cases. All the parameters improved after hospital admission and at discharge. All the patients were discharged in good condition and no patients needed supplementary antihypertensive treatment.

It was a prospective cohort study and included 273 couples with previous recurrent implantation failure. Each patient (all under 40) underwent a pre-treatment work-up, consisting of pelvic ultrasound scan for hydrosalpinx, hysteroscopy and screening for acquired and congenital thrombophilia. Detected abnormalities were dealt with accordingly: proximal occlusion for hydrosalpinx, hysteroscopic management for intrauterine pathology and thromboprophylaxis with daily low-molecular weight heparin from the day of embryo transfer for thrombophilia. The patients then underwent IVF/ICSI with laser-assisted hatching. 112 patients (41%; group 1) had abnormalities detected (17 hydrosalpinx, 11 intrauterine pathology, 63 congenital thrombophilia, 21 acquired thrombophilia) and the remaining 161 (59%; group 2) had normal work-up. The pregnancy rates per cycle started for all patients, group 1 and group 2 were 47%, 55% and 41%, respectively.

Most cases of TTP are due to an acquired autoimmune or hereditary (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome [USS]) severe deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13). In the present study, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the national registry of the French Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies from 2000-2010 to identify all women who were pregnant at their initial TTP presentation. Among 592 adulthood-onset TTP patients with a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, 42 patients with a pregnancy-onset TTP were included. Surprisingly, the proportion of USS patients (n = 10 of 42 patients [24%]; confidence interval, 13%-39%) with pregnancy-onset TTP was much higher than that in adulthood-onset TTP in general (less than 5%) and was mostly related to a cluster of ADAMTS13 variants. In the present study, subsequent pregnancies in USS patients not given prophylaxis were associated with very high TTP relapse and abortion rates, whereas prophylactic plasmatherapy was beneficial for both the mother and the baby. Pregnancy-onset TTP defines a specific subgroup of patients with a strong genetic background. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as number NCT00426686 and at the Health Authority, French Ministry of Health, as number P051064."

CD011053,0,17365848,0,Doppler velocimetry alterations related to platelet changes in third trimester pregnancies.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between the haematological parameter mean platelet volume and Doppler velocimetry parameters in order to improve clinical management in third trimester complicated pregnancies (pre-eclampsia, PE, and IUGR) affected by altered uterine resistances. Fifty-one patients were included in the abnormal uterine arteries Doppler velocimetry group (25 pregnancies were complicated by PE, 26 pregnancies were complicated by IUGR). Ninety-nine normotensive pregnant women taking no drugs for at least 2 weeks prior to testing and with no difference in gestational age at evaluation, with normal Doppler velocimetry profiles at routine screen, were used as controls. From all pregnant women, 20 mL of whole blood were obtained into citrate tubes after Doppler velocimetry evaluation and analysed for red blood cell counts (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), haemoglobin (HGB), haematocrit level (HCT), white blood cells count (WBC), platelet counts (PLT), mean platelets volume (MPV) and other biochemical parameters. From all blood parameters studied, MPV was significantly higher in women with altered uterine artery Doppler velocimetry compared with those with normal Doppler profiles (9.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 8.05 +/- 1.2 fL, P<0.001). In the group with altered uterine artery Doppler velocimetry, pregnancies complicated by PE showed a MPV value higher than pregnancies affected by IUGR (9.5 +/- 1.6 vs. 8.9 +/- 1.1, P<0.001). Finally, mean uterine arteries RI values were significantly related to MPV (fL) in both PE and IUGR groups (P<0.01, r=0.37 and P<0.01, r=0.38, respectively). Our study shows that a periodical monitoring of haematological parameters such as MPV can be associated to Doppler velocimetry in order to improve the management of pregnancies with uterine arteries Doppler velocimetry alterations."
CD011053,0,15473178,0,Paradoxical embolism in a preterm infant.,"Cerebral paradoxical embolism has not until now been described as a cause of cryptogenic stroke in newborn infants. A male infant was born at 27 weeks 2 days' gestational age by emergency Caesarean section in a twin pregnancy because of intrauterine growth retardation and absence of diastolic flow in the twin. His birthweight was 950g (50th centile). Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. At 17 days of life he showed sudden respiratory distress and signs of encephalopathy. Presence of deep venous thrombosis, patent foramen ovale (PFO), and clinical progression suggested paradoxical embolism which were confirmed by neuroradiological findings. The high incidence of PFO and central venous catheter-related deep venous thrombosis in newborn infants suggest that paradoxical embolism is probably a more common complication than has been thought."

CD011053,0,12890918,0,Usefulness of a second temporary vena cava filter for preventing acute pulmonary thromboembolism.,"The usefulness of a temporary inferior vena cava filter (t-IVC-f) for the prevention of acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APTE) associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been established, but not the requirement for an additional therapeutic method when the t-IVC-f has captured a thrombus. A woman underwent implantation of a t-IVC-f just caudal to the bifurcation of the renal vein immediately before cesarean section (C/S) for VTE that had occurred during the third trimester of pregnancy. After receiving a combination of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapies after the C/S, the t-IVC-f was found to contain a thrombus and in order to prevent its dissemination during the removal of the closed filter, another filter was inserted and expanded proximal to the first. Insertion of an additional t-IVC-f may prevent occurrence of APTE during removal of the primary filter containing a friable thrombus after fibrinolytic therapy, and the technique proved useful in the present case of VTE during pregnancy."

In 1992, at the clinical presentation, she had abdominal pain, asthenia, and weight loss. Splenomegaly, signs of flogosis, sideropenic anemia, and cholestasis were observed. Laparoscopic abdominal exploration and histological analysis demonstrated noncaseating granulomas of the liver, abdominal lymph nodes, and mesenteric connective tissue. The clinical course was severe with episodic remissions and recrudescences characterized by ascites (mild or moderate), elevation of bilirubin levels (mean: 1.1 mg/dl; range: 0.9-3.5 mg/dl), reduction of albumin levels (mean: 4 g/dl; range: 3.4-4.2 g/dl), and prolongation of elevated international normalized ratio (mean: 1; range: 0.9-1.4). In 1997, the patient had variceal bleeding. Complete hemostasis was obtained with band ligation. Liver function was preserved, and until 2000 the disease remained stable. In 2001, the patient became pregnant. At the 36th week of gestation, the patient delivered a healthy female infant and afterwards remained in clinical remission. This report stresses that sarcoidosis can have a hepatic and mesenteric involvement in absence of thoracic lymphadenopathy. Portal hypertension may be severe, and in absence of cirrhosis it may be associated with portal thrombosis. Finally, portal hypertension in patients with hepatic sarcoidosis and preserved liver function should not be considered as an absolute contraindication to pregnancy."

CD011053,0,20593976,0,Spontaneous twin anemia-polycythemia sequence complicated by recipient placental vascular thrombosis and hydrops fetalis.,"Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) is an atypical form of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) that presents as a large intertwin hemoglobin difference with one twin developing anemia and the other developing polycythemia, without oligohydramnios-polyhydramnios sequence (Lopriore et al., Placenta 2007;28:47-51). The prenatal diagnostic criteria for TAPS require that the middle cerebral artery-peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) measure greater than 1.5 multiples of median (MoM) in the donor twin and less than 0.8 MoM in the recipient twin (Robyr et al., Am J Obstet Gynecol 2006;194:796-803; Klaritsch et al., Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2009;34:149-154; Mari et al., N Engl Med 2000;342:9-14). The presumed etiology of TAPS involves the presence of small caliber arteriovenous anastomoses, which generate a slow transfusional process allowing for hemodynamic compensation (Lopriore et al., Placenta 2007;28:47-51; Lopriore et al., Placenta 2009;30:223-225; Lewi et al., Am J Obstet Gynecol 2006;194:790-795; Lopriore et al., Am J Obstet Gynecol 2008;112:753-758; Van den Wijngaard et al., Placenta 2007;28:611-615). The resulting polycythemia in the recipient twin is a risk factor for fetal and placental thrombosis (Van den Wijngaard et al., Am J Physiol 2005;288:R799-R814). We present a case of spontaneous TAPS complicated by a large placental vessel thrombosis and hydrops fetalis. Treatment via selective laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels (SLPCV) resulted in normalization of the MCA-PSV discordance."

The diagnosis can be made by clinical observation at birth or a few hours later. Color duplex ultrasound is the first imaging test used to confirm the diagnosis. The etiology appears to be complex and multifactorial. We report 2 cases of intrauterine limb ischemia involving the upper limb in 2 newborns. Both children were heterozygous for the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677C>T gene variant. The first patient was born by caesarean section at 34 weeks of gestation. At delivery, the infant presented with pallor in his right upper limb and weak radial arterial pulsation. Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography angiography demonstrated a totally occlusive thrombus within the right brachial artery. The newborn underwent systemic thrombolysis with good recovery. The second patient was born via cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. At delivery, the infant presented with a motionless, cold, and gangrenous right upper limb. The demarcation line was just below the right elbow. Doppler ultrasound revealed a complete occlusion of the right subclavian artery. After failure of antithrombotic therapy, the limb was amputated with no further complication. We discuss the epidemiology, etiology, and clinical features of this rare pathology."

A 40-year-old woman was referred at 8 weeks of gestation because of a chronic intense pain in the left iliac cavity which had spread to her lower back. Clinical examination revealed a poorly defined pelvic mass. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated a gestational sac containing a viable embryo whose size was consistent with the period of amenorrhea. While the splenic area in the left hypocondrium was found to be empty, a homogeneous and elongate mass measuring 152 x 123 mm with a maximum thickness of 53.4 mm was observed in the left iliac cavity above the uterus. This mass, the ectopic spleen, was monitored by Doppler velocimetry at monthly intervals until delivery and no variation throughout gestation was observed; therefore, despite the occasional occurrence of heavy pain, it was possible to exclude circulatory complications such as thrombosis or torsion. Doppler ultrasound proved to be a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of this rare anatomical variation."
CD011053,0,12362542,0,"[The SBU on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis: New methods critically scrutinized].","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) causes more than 1,000 deaths and leads to the admission to hospital of 11,000 patients each year in Sweden. Prevention of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is therefore of great importance. Diagnosis is difficult as the symptom profile is diffuse and difficult to interpret. Acute treatment and secondary prophylaxis are complicated as the risk of severe bleeding is great. A systematic review was carried out of the literature on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of VTE. Only randomized controlled studies were included and, to assess diagnostic methods, only studies with an independent comparison with a known reference method. Approximately 1,300 scientific studies met the requirements for high scientific quality. The scientific evidence strongly suggests that low molecular weight heparin can replace unfractionated heparin in preventing and treating venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Treatment with a single daily injection, rather than two, of low molecular weight heparin yields equally favorable effects. The risk for hemorrhage is lower with low molecular weight heparin and management is simpler, which facilitates outpatient treatment. Longer-term secondary prophylaxis with warfarin reduces the risk for relapse, but several years of treatment also increases the risk for severe hemorrhage. The presence of treatment-demanding VTE can be excluded in outpatients by combining the assessment of clinical probability, using clinical decision rules, with measurement of D-dimer. Thorough ultrasonic examination of the leg and a CT scan of the pulmonary vessels usually provide sufficient diagnostic reliability, which strongly supports the use of these methods in clinical practice. It is not meaningful to conduct extensive investigations of patients with venous thrombosis to find possible underlying cancer. It is essential to develop more cost-effective methods to investigate genetic predisposition for thrombosis."

CD011053,0,19562336,0,EANM guidelines for ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy : Part 1. Pulmonary imaging with ventilation/perfusion single photon emission tomography.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) can only be diagnosed with imaging techniques, which in practice is performed using ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy (V/P(SCAN)) or multidetector computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries (MDCT). The epidemiology, natural history, pathophysiology and clinical presentation of PE are briefly reviewed. The primary objective of Part 1 of the Task Group's report was to develop a methodological approach to and interpretation criteria for PE. The basic principle for the diagnosis of PE based upon V/P(SCAN) is to recognize lung segments or subsegments without perfusion but preserved ventilation, i.e. mismatch. Ventilation studies are in general performed after inhalation of Krypton or technetium-labelled aerosol of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) or Technegas. Perfusion studies are performed after intravenous injection of macroaggregated human albumin. Radiation exposure using documented isotope doses is 1.2-2 mSv. Planar and tomographic techniques (V/P(PLANAR) and V/P(SPECT)) are analysed. V/P(SPECT) has higher sensitivity and specificity than V/P(PLANAR). The interpretation of either V/P(PLANAR) or V/P(SPECT) should follow holistic principles rather than obsolete probabilistic rules. PE should be reported when mismatch of more than one subsegment is found. For the diagnosis of chronic PE, V/P(SCAN) is of value. The additional diagnostic yield from V/P(SCAN) includes chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), heart failure and pneumonia. Pitfalls in V/P(SCAN) interpretation are considered. V/P(SPECT) is strongly preferred to V/P(PLANAR) as the former permits the accurate diagnosis of PE even in the presence of comorbid diseases such as COPD and pneumonia. Technegas is preferred to DTPA in patients with COPD."
CD011053,0,17438064,0,Fetal gene defects precipitate platelet-mediated pregnancy failure in factor V Leiden mothers.,"We describe a mouse model of fetal loss in factor V Leiden (FvL) mothers in which fetal loss is triggered when the maternal prothrombotic state coincides with fetal gene defects that reduce activation of the protein C anticoagulant pathway within the placenta. Fetal loss is caused by disruption of placental morphogenesis at the stage of labyrinth layer formation and occurs in the absence of overt placental thrombosis, infarction, or perfusion defects. Platelet depletion or elimination of protease-activated receptor 4 (Par4) from the mother allows normal placentation and prevents fetal loss. These findings establish a cause-effect relationship for the observed epidemiologic association between maternal FvL status and fetal loss and identify fetal gene defects as risk modifiers of pregnancy failure in prothrombotic mothers. Pregnancy failure is mediated by Par4-dependent activation of maternal platelets at the fetomaternal interface and likely involves a pathogenic pathway independent of occlusive thrombosis. Our results further demonstrate that the interaction of two given thrombosis risk factors produces markedly disparate consequences on disease manifestation (i.e., thrombosis or pregnancy loss), depending on the vascular bed in which this interaction occurs."

Infectious and ischemic central nervous system (CNS) manifestations due to embolism through pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) represent the main causes of morbidity. To improve the phenotypic characterization of HHT with PAVM, we conducted a retrospective multicenter study of patients with HHT and at least 1 PAVM detected by chest computed tomography (CT) and/or pulmonary angiography, with particular attention to CNS and infectious manifestations. The study included 126 patients (47 men, 79 women), with a mean age of 43.1 +/- 17.4 years; 45 patients had a mutation of the ENG gene and 16 had a mutation of ACVRL1. PAVMs were diagnosed as a result of systematic screening procedures (29%), incidental imaging findings (15%), dyspnea (22%), or CNS symptoms (13%). The PAVMs were diagnosed at a mean age of 43 +/- 17 years, with a linear distribution of diagnosis between 20 and 75 years. Dyspnea on exertion was present in 56% of patients. Four patients had a hemothorax, including 1 during pregnancy. Fifty-three CNS events directly related to HHT (excluding migraine) were observed in 35% of patients: cerebral abscess (19.0%), ischemic cerebral stroke (9.5%), transient cerebral ischemic attack (6.3%), and cerebral hemorrhage (2.4%). The median age of onset was 33 years for cerebral abscesses (range, 11-66 yr), and 53.5 years for ischemic cerebral events (range, 2-72 yr). Migraine was reported in 16% of patients. The diagnoses of PAVM and HHT were made at the time of the cerebral abscess in 13 cases (54%). Forty-three percent of patients were hypoxemic at rest. Contrast echocardiography showed intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting in 87% of tested patients. PAVMs were seen on chest radiograph in 54% of patients, and on the CT scan in all patients. One hundred five patients (83%) underwent treatment of the PAVM, by percutaneous embolization (71%) and/or by surgical resection (23%). A high frequency of CNS and infectious complications was observed in this large series of patients with HHT-related PAVM. Physicians may not be sufficiently aware of the clinical manifestations of this orphan disorder. Patients diagnosed with HHT should be informed by physicians and patient associations of the risk of PAVM-related complications, and systematic screening for PAVM should be proposed, regardless of a patient's symptoms, familial history, or genetic considerations."
CD011053,0,7959322,0,HELLP syndrome: CT evaluation.,"Patients with the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) require careful observation and expedient delivery. However, those who develop this syndrome peripartum do not always fulfill its diagnostic criteria before labor begins. We investigated the potential usefulness of liver and spleen CT evaluation in identifying such patients. Seven patients with this syndrome were studied by CT scanning on postpartum days 0-3 and again 3-4 weeks after delivery. Although 3 patients with severe thrombocytopenia had a reduced liver-spleen CT number ratio (< 1.1) and subsequent normalization, the remaining 4 with less severe thrombocytopenia demonstrated no CT changes. Thus, antepartum evaluation of liver and spleen by CT may not be sensitive enough to detect patients who develop HELLP syndrome during the peripartum period. Serial examination of platelet counts may be more useful than CT in detecting patients at risk for this peripartum syndrome."
CD011053,0,22891569,0,[Developmental toxicity of the over-the-counter analgetics and antypiretics].,"Over-the-counter antipyretics (acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen) and/or analgesics (acetaminophen, aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen) are relatively safe for adults. However, data on their developmental toxicity is sparse. Moreover, experimental and clinical findings are commonly incompatible. The highest developmental toxicity was found for aspirin. However, unlike full-dose of aspirin, its low doses are compatible during pregnancy. Over-the-counter nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAID) may induce miscarriage, stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm constriction of the ductus arteriosus with a secondary persistent pulmonary hypertension, reduced fetal renal perfusion that led to oligohydramion, prolonged pregnancy as well as an increase prevalence of intracranial bleeding in newborns. For acetaminophen and ibuprofen an increased risk of cryptorchidism was also pointed. Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may also induce bronchial asthma during childhood, preeclampsia, preterm birth, maternal phlebothrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Furthermore, epidemiological data suggest higher risk of cardiac, abdominal wall and orofacial defects of evaluated drugs."

CD011053,0,22859017,0,Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of MYH7 non-compaction cardiomyopathy.,"We report on two prenatal ultrasound diagnoses of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) associated with mutation of the cardiac Œ≤-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7). LVNC is characterized by a trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular myocardial recesses communicating with the left ventricular cavity. Clinical features range from non-penetrant disease in adult carriers to heart failure, arrhythmia and thromboembolism. Both cases showed cardiomegaly on prenatal ultrasound examinations, with features indicating non-compaction of the myocardium apparent in the third trimester. Mutations in the MYH7 gene were identified postnatally in each case in both the proband and the father. One infant underwent surgical mitral valvuloplasty and a mechanical valve implant later; in the other, left ventricular function was unimpaired at birth. Cardiac function in both cases remained stable at last follow-up. These cases highlight the importance of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of LVNC and the need for cardiologic and molecular testing of first-degree relatives who may be unknown carriers of an MYH7 mutation."

In this paper we discuss the pathophysiology and the many different causes of stroke in children. In many of the cases more than one prothrombotic condition exists. If the cause is not obvious an extensive programme of examinations is recommended. This is important not only in order to give the best individual treatment, but also necessary in order to decide whether the stroke has a genetic cause. Initially, the treatment is symptomatic, attaching importance to achieving good perfusion of the cerebrum and lowering the energy consumption of the cerebrum. The rational treatment might be prompt reperfusion by thrombolytic medicine: this regime has been tried in adults, but as yet no consensus about this treatment modality exists. In some cases causal treatment is possible. If the stroke has a genetic cause genetic consultation is important and prenatal investigations might be possible. Overall, the mortality in stroke in children is about 25%. About 25% will live without any sequelae and approximately 50% of the children will disabled to a greater or lesser extent."

In the preterm group, ANG II caused greater maximal increases in perfusion pressure than in normal term pregnancies without affecting sensitivity. Also, preparations from normal term pregnancies showed a marked development of tachyphylaxis compared to placentae from preterm pregnancies. Indomethacin (10(-6) M) increased the maximum pressor response to ANG II by 33.6% in normal term, however, in preterm placentas a 39.2% reduction was observed. Infused ANG II 10(-6) M) decreased the concentrations of thromboxane B(2) and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) in both pregnancy groups, but this effect was not statistically different from the baseline values. In the current study, we show that the placenta of preterm pregnancies in basal conditions produce 7.6 times as much thromboxane as the normal term placenta (2,800+/-470 vs. 366.5+/-62 pg/min, respectively), without significant change in prostacyclin levels (preterm 88.6+/-11.0 vs. Term 100.6+/-30.7 pg/min). These observations provide evidence that the contribution of basally released thromboxane from placental tissue appears to contribute to abnormalities in the regulation of fetoplacental hemodynamics in premature pregnancies."

Antiphospholipid syndrome is one of the most commonly acquired hypercoagulable states, defined by the association of laboratory evidence of anti-phospholipid antibodies with arterial or venous thrombosis or recurrent pregnancy losses. The presence of these antibodies is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic phenomena, including peripheral thrombophlebitis, pulmonary thromboembolism, stroke, retinal artery occlusion, myocardial infarction, placental thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome. In this report we discuss the uncommon case of a young male patient with both antiphospholipid syndrome and fibromuscular dysplasia that came to our attention for pulmonary embolism and ""angina abdominis"" due to occlusion of three mesenteric vessels. The possible relationship between antiphospholipid syndrome and fibromuscular dysplasia encountered in our patient still remains unclear. We treated the patient as if he had the two different diseases. After partial failure of endovascular surgery, the patient underwent surgery with reimplantation of three visceral arteries to the aorta. Subsequently he was treated with stent placement after development of a re-stenosis of one of the three reimplanted visceral arteries. The patient was treated conservatively for antiphospholipid syndrome with anticoagulant oral therapy for life."
CD011053,0,12080413,0,Pathophysiology of preeclampsia: linking placental ischemia/hypoxia with microvascular dysfunction.,"Studies during the past decade have provided a better understanding of the potential mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The initiating event in preeclampsia has been postulated to be reduced uteroplacental perfusion as a result of abnormal cytotrophoblast invasion of spiral arterioles. Placental ischemia/hypoxia is thought to lead to widespread activation/dysfunction of the maternal vascular endothelium which results in enhanced formation of endothelin, thromboxane, and superoxide, increased vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II, and decreased formation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin. These endothelial abnormalities, in turn, cause hypertension by impairing renal function and increasing total peripheral resistance. While recent studies support a role for cytokines and other factors such as lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen intermediates as potential mediators of endothelial dysfunction, finding the link between placental ischemia/hypoxia and maternal endothelial and vascular abnormalities remains an important area of investigation. The quantitative importance of the various endothelial and humoral factors in mediating the vasoconstriction and elevation in arterial pressure during preeclampsia has also not been completely elucidated."

CD011053,0,21740314,0,Analysis of the original causes of placental oxidative stress in normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia: a hypothesis.,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) and eclampsia remain enigmatic despite intensive research. Growing evidence suggests that placental oxidative stress (OS) is involved in the etiopathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Reduced perfusion as a result of abnormal placentation was proposed to be responsible for placental OS in PE. However, placental OS was also observed in normal pregnancy. The exact differences and correlation of placental OS in PE and normal pregnancy remain elusive. In this review, we attempted to link both normal pregnancy and PE on the causes of placental OS and proposed a hypothesis that placental OS in normal pregnancy, plus the exploration of other placental and/or maternal factors, could provide a novel explanation of that in PE. We concluded that pregnancy, placental abnormality and preexisting maternal constitutional conditions are three principle factors that could contribute to placental OS in PE. The specific causes in each clinical case could be heterogeneous, which requires individual analysis."

We have identified 37 patients with USS (24 females, 13 males) belonging to 32 families. The nine women from six families who were diagnosed during their first pregnancy are the focus of this report. Six of the nine women had episodes of thrombocytopenia during childhood misdiagnosed as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Thrombocytopenia occurred during the second-third trimesters in each of their 15 pregnancies, with 16 babies (one twin pregnancy), often followed by TTP. Of 15 pregnancies, eight babies were stillborn or died soon after birth, and the remaining seven were all premature except one, who was born naturally following plasma infusions to the mother that had started at 8 weeks' gestation. All nine USS women had severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity. ADAMTS13 analyses demonstrated that eight women were compound heterozygotes of Y304C/G525D (2 siblings), R125VfsX6/Q1302X (2 siblings), R193W/R349C (2 siblings), I178T/Q929X, and R193W/A606P; one woman was homozygous for R193W.

CD011053,0,1534728,0,Methotrexate for treatment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy.,"Clinical experience with and adverse effects of methotrexate for the treatment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy are described. Ectopic pregnancy is suspected in the presence of the following: positive results on pregnancy test (e.g., test for beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]), lower abdominal pain, a normal or slightly enlarged uterus, and a mass on either side of the midline. When laparoscopy is required for diagnosis, surgical correction is done at the same time. However, use of serial beta-hCG titers, vaginal ultrasound examinations, serum progesterone concentrations, and dilation and curettage (when the pregnancy is confirmed to be nonviable) allows earlier detection of ectopic pregnancy without laparoscopy. If rupture has not occurred, i.v. or i.m. methotrexate is administered; usually, i.m. leucovorin is given, on alternate days, to prevent hematologic toxicity. Adverse effects of methotrexate include stomatitis, gastritis, and hepatic enzyme elevation. Use of a single-dose regimen of i.m. methotrexate without leucovorin has been associated with a lower frequency of toxicity. Selection criteria for patients are as follows: (1) an unruptured ectopic pregnancy less than or equal to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension on transvaginal ultrasound, (2) no active renal or hepatic disease, and (3) no evidence of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Intramuscular methotrexate therapy is a safe and effective alternative to surgery for the treatment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy."

Therefore, refluxing pelvic veins should be identified and treated. We present our experience with pelvic vein embolisation in patients presenting with varicose veins. Patients presenting with varicose veins with a duplex-proven contribution from perivulval veins undergo transvaginal duplex sonography (TVUS) to identify refluxing pelvic veins. Those with positive scans undergo embolisation before surgical treatment of their lower limb varicose veins. A total of 218 women (mean age of 46.3 years) were treated. Parity was documented in the first 60 patients, of whom 47 (78.3%) were multiparous, 11 (18.3%) had had one previous pregnancy, and 2 (3.3%) were nulliparous. The left ovarian vein was embolised in 78%, the right internal iliac in 64.7%, the left internal iliac in 56.4%, and the right ovarian vein in 42.2% of patients. At follow-up TVUS, mild reflux only was seen in 16, marked persistent reflux in 6, and new reflux in 3 patients. These 9 women underwent successful repeat embolisation. Two patients experienced pulmonary embolisation of the coils, of whom 1 was asymptomatic and 1 was successfully retrieved; 1 patient had a misplaced coil protruding into the common femoral vein; and 1 patient had perineal thrombophlebitis. The results of our study showed that pelvic venous embolisation by way of a transjugular approach is a safe and effective technique in the treatment of pelvic vein reflux."

CD011053,0,15168653,0,[Antiphospholipid syndrome and pregnancy].,"The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) is multisystem, autoimmune disease, which is characterized by: thrombosis, obstetrics complications and thrombocytopenia. The two most clinically significant antiphospholipid antibodies (APLa) that are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss and thrombosis are anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL) and lupus anticoagulant (LA). The laboratory diagnosis is based on the presence of moderate to high positive ACL and/or LA. The inhibitory effect of antiphospholipid antibodies /APLa/ on trophoblast intercellular fusion, hormone production and invasion may cause pregnancy loss. Once placentation is established their thrombogenic action leads to decreased placental perfusion and subsequent infarction. The APLa--mediated inhibition of trophoblastic invasion and APLa--mediated vasculopathy in the placental bed arteries result in abnormal uterine artery /UA/ Doppler waveforms. The association between APLa and high resistance index /RI/ and/or diastolic notch /DN/ in the Doppler waveforms is high predictive for adverse pregnancy outcome, including pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, placental abruption, intrauterine fetal death.

Amniocentesis and CVS are safe and widely available procedures, which can be used to diagnose a multitude of abnormalities through karyotype analysis and molecular studies. CVS allows earlier diagnosis, but both procedures can provide highly accurate results in the first half of pregnancy. Cordocentesis has fewer indications, but allows direct laboratory testing of fetal blood. Fetocentesis and fetal biopsy are reserved for limited indications, but can play a crucial role in the diagnosis of some conditions, which cannot be assessed less invasively. Fetal transfusion is an important tool in the treatment of isoimmunization, some other forms of fetal anemia, and alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Amnioreduction is a commonly used procedure for the treatment of polyhydramnios and TTTS. Multifetal reduction and selective termination offer previously unavailable options to patients carrying multiple gestations. Fetal shunts can reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality in cases of bladder outlet obstruction and hydrothorax. The limited experience with cord ligation procedures and balloon valvuloplasty suggests these relatively new procedures may serve a greater role in the future as techniques are improved. By providing guidance for all of these procedures, real-time ultrasonography has revolutionized prenatal diagnosis and therapy; it will continue to be a crucial component in evaluating and treating complicated pregnancies."

The possible mechanisms responsible for this unfortunate event include dehydration with resultant relative polycythaemia and raised intracranial pressure at high altitudes. CVT should be considered in mountain climbers presenting with progressive neurological deterioration that is not solely attributable to AMS."

Pregnancy and the postpartum period constitute a major additional risk factor for thromboembolism in deficient women. However, pregnancy may be envisaged without risk since there has been an improvement in knowledge concerning the physiology of the AT III molecule, its exact role in coagulation, the application of accurate laboratory tests which measure the deficiency, and especially the programming of pregnancy under cover of preventive treatment consisting of the perfusion of AT III concentrate in association with heparin. The treatment is restricting and costly but is, nevertheless, the only one to recreate conditions that are similar to physiological conditions, and its effect is therefore more certain."
CD011053,0,9312519,0,[Observations on pe-eclampsia-eclampsia and the advances in the evolution of some laboratory tests].,"The preeclampsia-eclampsia syndrome is a vasospastic disorder and probably has a placental origin. Once the hypertensive syndrome is established the uteroplacental blood flow is reduced as well as the intervillous blood flow. Since 18-24 weeks of gestation and before the symptoms of preeclampsia become overt, changes in placental flow velocity can be detected with Doppler technics. The placental theories for the etiology of preeclampsia are focused on the hypoxic effect in the trophoblastic tissue of second trimester. The placental ischemic changes are evident and seen in the uteroplacental bed. They are interrelated with the stages of trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries during the 14 and 20 weeks. When the trophoblastic invasion is over, the spiral arteries become a high resistance system. The defect observed in preeclampsia is the lack of invasion of the trophoblast to the maternal arteries. The diminished placental perfusion probably creates endothelial damage. This damage has several effects: decreased prostaglandin production, activated coagulation cascade, stimulated fibrin aggregation, and increased vascular permeability. The ideal laboratory test for preeclampsia shall predict the onset of this entity. Recent findings seem promising. The fibronectin concentration increases 2-3 wks. prior to the clinical manifestation of preeclampsia. Severe hypertension shows an abnormal decrease in fibronectin levels. Hypocalciuria has been described as an early predictor in the development of preeclampsia. Other agents undergoing extensive evaluation as predictors are: uric acid, b-thromboglobin, prolactin and atrial natriuretic peptide. Recently high levels of b-HCG (human corionic gonadotrophin) have been linked to a lack of trophoblastic invasion during the second trimester, therefore this is a potential marker for those patients that will eventually develop preeclampsia."

Thromboembolic disease is believed to occur in 0.05 to 0.1 per cent of all pregnancies. Historically, postpartum thromboembolic disease was more common; decreased hospital stay may shift the thromboembolic disease to the antepartum period. A 5-year retrospective review of 4910 births assessed for incidence of thromboembolic disease, methods of diagnosis and treatment, and risk factors. A total of 4910 deliveries with 3978 transvaginal resulted in 30 episodes of deep venous thrombosis and five pulmonary emboli. All incidences of deep venous thrombosis but one were left-sided; four of five pulmonary emboli were postpartum. Of the epidsodes of deep venous thrombosis 17 per cent were first trimester, 50 per cent second trimester, 27 per cent third trimester, and 6 per cent postpartum.

CD011053,0,23065165,0,Imaging after cesarean delivery: acute and chronic complications.,"Cesarean delivery is a commonly performed operation and accounts for nearly one-third of all births in the United States. Although it is a safe procedure, cesarean delivery has a variety of acute and chronic complications that prompt imaging with ultrasonography (US), computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Acute complications include hematomas in specific locations that are unique to the procedure, as well as a variety of infections. A bladder flap hematoma occurs in the space between the bladder and the lower uterine segment, whereas a subfascial hematoma is an extraperitoneal collection located in the prevesical space posterior to the rectus muscles and anterior to the peritoneum. Puerperal infections after cesarean delivery include abscesses, wound infections and dehiscence, uterine dehiscence and rupture, and pelvic thrombophlebitis. The prevalence of chronic complications related to the healed cesarean delivery scar is unknown, but the scar may result in technical limitations for pelvic US due to the adhesions between the anterior lower uterine segment and the anterior abdominal wall. The cesarean delivery scar also leaves the patient susceptible to several unique diagnoses. A cesarean scar ""niche"" is a tethering of the endometrium that can serve as a reservoir for intermenstrual blood and fluid. Intrauterine devices can be malpositioned in the cesarean delivery scar, and endometrial implants can develop in the abdominal wall years after surgery. These patients are also at increased risk for implantation abnormalities including cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy, retained products of conception, and placenta accreta. Familiarity with the normal postoperative findings following cesarean delivery is necessary to recognize acute and chronic complications, which are being encountered with increasing frequency."

In the third trimester of gestation and on the seventh day post partum, venous occlusion plethysmographic studies and vein caliber measurements were performed on arms and legs of 20 patients. A significant reduction in leg vein diameter following delivery was found. There were no differences in the diameters of arm veins measured in the third trimester and post partum. The results of venous occlusion plethysmography, as an indicator of venous function, revealed no differences between the third trimester and post partum in either the arm or the leg. Since hormonal changes during gestation must affect the entire venous system, i.e., also the arms and legs, mechanical displacement of the blood drainage pathways by the gravid uterus is most probably responsible for the significant dilatation of leg veins in the third trimester. A displacement of the higher sections of the femoral vein was demonstrated by Doppler sonography. Increased distensibility of the veins in the third trimester, continuing post partum, is probably the measurable basis of the much higher incidence of varicosis among women who have had children. It appears possible to detect extreme dilatations of leg veins sonographically, and to counter the increased risk of thrombosis and perhaps also to reduce the risk of later varicosis by timely compression treatment."

On the initial visit to our hospital, the NIH stroke scale was 6, and the brain MRI revealed high intensity areas in the left insular cortex and the periventricular white matter with occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) branches. We diagnosed her as having cerebral embolism, and treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) with subsequent recanalization of the occuluded left MCA branches. Her motor aphasia and hemiparesis disappeared within a few hours of initiating the therapy. She received aspirin for four months and then heparin until delivery to prevent recurrence. She delivered a healthy term infant without any apparent complications. An 18-week pregnancy itself is not considered a risk factor of stroke, and we ruled out the possibilities of dysfibrinogenemia, homocysteinemia, hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III deficiencies, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. However, her plasma factor VIII level was significantly elevated to more than 200% (reference for 18-week pregnant woman: 151 +/- 44%), which may have led to her acquired activated protein C resistance or hypercoagulability. As safety of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA during pregnancy has not been established, this therapy could be carefully used upon due consideration of risks and benefits for both mother and fetus."

Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients in whom the risk of HIT is considered to be > 0.1%, we recommend platelet count monitoring (Grade 1C). For patients who are receiving therapeutic-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), we suggest at least every-other-day platelet count monitoring until day 14, or until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first (Grade 2C). For patients who are receiving postoperative antithrombotic prophylaxis with UFH (HIT risk > 1%), we suggest at least every-other-day platelet count monitoring between postoperative days 4 to 14 (or until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first) [Grade 2C]. For medical/obstetric patients who are receiving prophylactic-dose UFH, postoperative patients receiving prophylactic-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), postoperative patients receiving intravascular catheter UFH ""flushes,"" or medical/obstetrical patients receiving LMWH after first receiving UFH (risk, 0.1 to 1%), we suggest platelet count monitoring every 2 days or 3 days from day 4 to day 14, or until heparin is stopped, whichever occurs first (Grade 2C). For medical/obstetrical patients who are only receiving LMWH, or medical patients who are receiving only intravascular catheter UFH flushes (risk < 0.1%), we suggest clinicians do not use routine platelet count monitoring (Grade 2C). For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, whether or not complicated by thrombosis, we recommend use of an alternative anticoagulant, such as lepirudin (Grade 1C+), argatroban (Grade 1C), bivalirudin (Grade 2C), or danaparoid (Grade 1B). For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, we recommend routine ultrasonography of the lower-limb veins for investigation of deep venous thrombosis (Grade 1C); against the use of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [coumarin] therapy until after the platelet count has substantially recovered; that the VKA antagonist be administered only during overlapping alternative anticoagulation (minimum 5-day overlap); and begun with low, maintenance doses (all Grade 2C). For patients receiving VKAs at the time of diagnosis of HIT, we recommend use of vitamin K (Grade 2C) [corrected] For patients with a history of HIT who are HIT antibody negative and require cardiac surgery, we recommend use of UFH (Grade 1C)."

CD011053,0,22149747,0,Ultrasound markers for the detection of women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia.,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a consequence of an abnormal placental invasion. Uterine artery Doppler (Ut-AD) is directly related to trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries, which occurs before 18 weeks‚Äô gestation. A correct interpretation of Ut-AD indices and waveform patterns requires a rigorous and standardized methodology, in particular for the definition of notches. To date, aspirin is the only treatment associated with a decreased incidence of PE, and early identification of women at risk is crucial to optimize its use. The diagnostic performance of Ut-AD as a screening test should take into account the characteristics of the population studied. In women at high-risk of PE (i.e., women with a previous history of PE), results vary from a detection rate of 63%, with 25% false-positive results for all forms of PE, to 91% detection with 5% false-positive for early PE if repeated measurements, combined with maternal characteristics, are performed. Multicenter randomized clinical trials failed to demonstrate a benefit from administering aspirin in low-risk women with abnormal Ut-AD. In unselected populations, the use of Ut-AD, alone or integrated into algorithms including maternal characteristics, cannot be recommended for clinical practice at any gestational age. Combination with biological markers is a new field of research that could improve the performance of Ut-AD."
CD011053,0,7592284,0,Abdominal pain in the postpartum: role of imaging.,"The post-delivery evaluation of the obstetric patient presenting with severe abdominal pain can be a challenge to the obstetrician, the internist, and the radiologist. Besides non-pregnancy-related causes of abdominal pain, several pregnancy-related complications should be included in the list of differential diagnoses. Based on pathogenesis, these conditions can be divided in four categories: thromboembolic disease, infectious complications, mechanical complications, and complications of preeclampsia. Most disease processes can be adequately visualized with sonography. CT can be indicated for the evaluation of the extent of ovarian vein thrombosis and for depiction of deep abdominal collections in obese patients or in cases of abundant overlying abdominal gas. MRI can be useful to provide the specific diagnosis of hemorrhagic liver infarction in the clinical setting of a HELLP syndrome."
CD011053,0,866444,0,[Septic phlebitis.

Septic phlebitis occurs either spontaneously (staphylococcosis, syndrome of angina pectoris and infarction), or through secondary infection by secondary microbial colonization of a thrombosis of gynecological or obstetrical origin or, thirdly, as the consequence of venous catheterization (perfusion, pacemaker, explorations). Prevention is based on the selection of the material (silastic piercing catheters), the choice of the site of injection, the observation of strict surgical asepsis and of choice of the fluid injected (no corticoids, nor heparin which inactivates the oligosaccharides). As regards the curative treatment, no use should be made either of heparin or of anti-inflammatory agents (especially no corticoids); first of all, the material that has caused the thrombophlebitis should be withdrawn immediately; secondly, 24 to 36 hours later, a specific antibiotic treatment should be instituted and after two weeks, if still necessary, surgical ligation may be carried out of the inferior vena cava, the subclavian vein or the brachiocephalic venous trunk, depending on the localization of the phlebitis."
CD011053,0,18289672,0,Spontaneous intrauterine umbilical artery thrombosis leading to severe fetal growth restriction.,"Intrauterine thrombosis of umbilical cord vessels is a rare event (2.5-4.5/10,000) and usually followed by poor fetal outcome. We present the rare case of spontaneous intrauterine thrombosis of an umbilical artery leading to severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and provide clinical and pathological findings. A 28-year-old nulliparous third gravida was referred to our institution because of IUGR at 32+4 weeks of gestation. Fetal growth had been appropriate until the 31st week of gestation and had stopped thereafter. There were no signs of abruption of the placenta and no structural abnormalities except an absent paravesical colour Doppler flow in the region of the right umbilical artery. Other Doppler measurements, karyotype and TORCH serology were normal. Intermittent non-reassuring fetal heart rate led to cesarean section at 34+3 weeks of gestation. A healthy girl with measurements on the 3rd centile was born (weight of 1,590 g, length of 41 cm and head circumference of 29 cm). Gross examination displayed an elongated, highly twisted umbilical cord with a length of 70 cm, central insertion and three umbilical vessels. Microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of umbilical artery thrombosis along the entire length of the umbilical cord. Calcification within the thrombus and microcalcification in occluded chorionic vessels were observed as well as hemorrhagic endovasculitis and endangiopathia obliterans in the stem villi arteries. This fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (FTV) comprised about 40% of the parenchyma. The coagulation parameters and blood counts of the mother and the infant were normal apart from transient neonatal thrombocytopenia. The reason for thrombosis remained unclear but could be attributed to the elongated and highly twisted umbilical cord. Intrauterine arterial thrombosis may cause severe IUGR. This condition might be detectable by ultrasound in the course of an IUGR workup, especially when no other reasons can be found."
CD011053,0,9166067,1,The value of ventilation-perfusion imaging in pregnancy.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of maternal death during pregnancy. The aims of this retrospective study were to review 5 years experience of ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) imaging in pregnancy, to evaluate the effect of the V/Q scan report on the referring clinician's use of anticoagulants and to monitor the course and outcome of pregnancy. 82 patients (aged 17-44 years, gestation 6-40 weeks) underwent V/Q imaging for suspected PE, over a 5 year period. Modified PIOPED criteria were used to assess the probability of PE. 31 patients were shown to have normal scans (38%); 19 (23%) had low probability (LP) scans; 14 (17%) had intermediate probability (IP) scans and 18 (22%) had high probability (HP) scans for PE. Referring clinicians saw the reports and took action within 12 h. Anticoagulation was continued or started in 31 patients (all HP, 12 IP and 1 LP). Anticoagulation was considered unnecessary in 52 patients (all normal, 19 LP and 2 IP). None of the patients with normal or LP scans had documented PE during the follow-up period (median 25 months, range 3-60 months). No complications of anticoagulation were observed and no adverse outcome of pregnancy were reported. V/Q imaging is a valuable technique in the management of pregnant women suspected of having PE."
CD011053,0,9643416,0,Renal venous thrombosis: an unusual cause of fetal distress.,"Renal venous thrombosis (RVT) is a rare event in neonates and infants. Its incidence varies from 0.5 per thousand concerning admissions in neonatal intensive care units to 0.5% in autopsic findings. Some cases may occur in the antenatal period. Clinical presentation in infants includes a mass in the flank. hematuria and thrombocytopenia. We report a case of RVT which was diagnosed at 34 weeks' gestation by ultrasound in a fetus showing cardiotocographic signs of fetal distress. We observed the typical pattern reported by pediatric radiologists: renal enlargement, loss of the cortico-medullary boundary, echoic streaks following the direction of interlobular veins, lack of definition of renal sinus echoes and loss of venous flow in the right kidney by Doppler velocimetry. After delivery by caesarean section and transient hyperbilirubinemia and moderately impaired renal function the infant weighing 2435 g had a full recovery at 1 week and a normal evolution at 1 month of life."
CD011053,0,8889382,0,Diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism.,"The prevalence of acute pulmonary embolism in a general hospital was evaluated. Importantly, the prevalence of unrecognized pulmonary embolism at autopsy has not changed in three decades. Further evaluation was made of the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. As with the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, the alveolar arterial oxygen difference is usually abnormal, but a normal value does not exclude pulmonary embolism. The criteria used for a low probability interpretation of ventilation-perfusion lung scans in the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) were modified. Criteria for a very low probability assessment (< 10% positive predictive value) were also determined. Progress was made with helical computed tomography and contrast-enhanced electron-beam computed tomography, but with present technology their role is limited. Selective digital subtraction angiography with a flow directed catheter seems to have been useful in some patients. A strategy for diagnosis of thromboembolic disease that uses serial noninvasive leg tests was described. The strategy reduces the number of pulmonary angiograms required. The Fourth American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy was published. Extensive and detailed analysis was made of the literature related to the antithrombotic treatment of pulmonary embolism and the use of antithrombotic therapy during pregnancy."

CD011053,0,7545576,0,Reduced contractile effect of endothelin-1 and noradrenalin in human umbilical artery from pregnancies with abnormal umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms.,"This study on the human umbilical artery was undertaken in order to elucidate possible correlations between changes in response to vasoactive substances in vitro and abnormal umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms in vivo associated with preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation. The vascular reactivity to endothelin-1, noradrenalin, serotonin, the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619, substance P and prostacyclin was determined in umbilical artery segments from 13 normal pregnancies and 29 pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia and/or intrauterine growth retardation with normal or abnormal umbilical flow velocity waveforms. The contractile effect in vitro of endothelin-1 and noradrenalin was reduced in segments from pregnancies complicated by abnormal umbilical flow velocity waveforms in vivo. No differences were detected in the contractile effect of serotonin and U46619, or in the relaxatory effect of substance P and prostacyclin. In conclusion, endothelin-1- and noradrenalin-related mechanisms could be involved in the abnormal umbilical flow velocity waveforms associated with preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation."

CD011053,0,24452081,0,"Duplex ultrasound, clinical score, thrombotic risk, and D-dimer testing for evidence based diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis and alternative diagnoses in the primary care setting and outpatient ward.","Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has an annual incidence of 0.2% in the urban population. First episodes of calf vein thrombosis (CVT) and proximal DVT are frequently elicited by risk factors, including varicose veins, cancer, pregnancy/postpartum, oral contraceptives below the age of 50 years, immobility or surgery. Leg pain and tenderness in the calf and popliteal fossa on physical examination may result from other conditions than DVT labeled as alternative diagnosis (AD) Congenital venous thrombophilia is present in every third first DVT, increased FVIII in every fourth first DVT, and FV Leiden/FII mutation in 40% of women on oral anticonceptive pill before reaching the menopause. Routine thrombophilia testing for FV Leiden/prothrombin mutation and FVIII as main risk factor for venous thrombosis is recommended. Primary superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) and DVT patients with a autosomal dominant family history of DVT are candidates for thrombophilia testing for congenital AT, PC and PS deficiency. The requirement for a safe diagnostic strategy of CVT and DVT should be based on an objective post-test incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) of less than 0.1% with a negative predictive value for exclusion of DVT of 99.9% during 3 months follow-up. Modification of the Wells score by elimination of the ""minus 2 points"" for AD is mandatory and will improve the diagnostic accuracy of CVT/DVT suspicion in the primary care setting and outpatient ward. The sequential use of complete DUS, ELISA D-dimer testing and modified clinical Wells' score assessment is safe and effective for the exclusion and diagnosis of CVT, DVT and AD. About 10% to 20% of patients with DVT develop overt post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) at one year post-DVT, and both PTS and DVT recurrences further increase to about 30% during long-term follow-up. Objective risk stratification of PTS complications using DUS for recanalization and reflux and D-dimer testing will become an integral part in routine clinical practice to assess the optimal duration of wearing medical elastic stockings and anticoagulation for the prevention DVT recurrence as the best option to reduce the incidence and costs of suffering from irreversible PTS."

Review of the literature apropos of 7 new cases].,"Non immunologic hydrops fetalis (NIHF) is relatively more frequent now since prevention and treatment of blood incompatibilities are common. Seven cases of NIHF were observed between November 1984 and April 1987; antenatal diagnosis by ultrasound scanning was possible in six of these seven cases. Fetal prognosis is usually poor. Only one of the seven children survived, four infants died shortly after birth; two women chose an elective termination of pregnancy at 18 and 23 weeks of gestation, respectively. The review of the literature shows that more than 150 etiologies are associated with this condition. An etiology was found in five of our seven cases, these were all different; renal vein thrombosis, cardiac malformation, cystic hygroma, osteogenesis imperfecta and one case of recurrent NIHF (four affected siblings). Two cases remained idiopathic. Diagnosis of NIHF is best oriented by three investigations: obstetrical ultrasound scanning, fetal echocardiography and any kind of amniocentesis, either for karyotype alone, or to evacuate pleural, pericardial of peritoneal effusions. Ultrasound scanning can evaluate the importance of these effusions and help to choose other etiological investigations. Fetal echocardiography is mandatory because out of the 150 etiologies described in association with NIHF, 25% are cardiac (malformation or dysrhythmias). As already mentioned, fetal prognosis in our series was poor, but perhaps more aggressive in utero treatment could have improve it."

This report concerns two cases of women who developed CVT within 14 days of cesarean delivery. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain (venous phase) is the best modality to diagnose the condition, and parenteral application of low-molecular-weight heparin is the most beneficial treatment. The first patient was found to have an elevated factor VIII level. In the second patient, homozygosity of the C677T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene was found. The puerperal period and Cesarean Section (CS) are risk factors for thrombotic complications, including CVT. It is necessary to search for risk factors in a patient's history and within the group of at-risk patients to prolong preventive administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). CVT (including puerperium related) is not a detrimental to future pregnancies."
CD011053,0,7882599,0,Uterine artery waveform as a predictor of pregnancy outcome in women with underlying renal disease.,"To investigate the use of uterine artery flow velocity waveforms in predicting gestational hypertension (GH), preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), Colour Doppler ultrasound of the uterine arteries was performed at 19-24 weeks gestation in 51 women with known renal disease. On four consecutive waveforms, peak systolic (A), end-diastolic (B) and early diastolic (C) velocities were measured. Resistance index (RI) was calculated as (A-B)/A, and the severity of the waveform notch expressed as the AC ratio (A/C). Gestational hypertension was defined as a blood pressure (BP) > or = 140/90 mmHg with an increase of at least 15 mmHg in diastolic BP. PE included women with gestational hypertension and proteinuria > 300 mg/24 h or a doubling of early gestation protein excretion. IUGR was defined as a birthweight less than the 10th percentile for gestation. RI and/or AC ratio in 14 women (27%) exceeded the 90th percentile for gestational age of our low risk control population. Of the women with an abnormal test, 11 (79%) developed complications, 8 (57%) developed GH or PE, 3 (21%) IUGR alone, 2 (14%) GH and IUGR, and in one women intrauterine fetal death of an IUGR infant occurred, and 3 (21%) had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Of the women with a normal test, 34 (92%) had an uncomplicated pregnancy, and only 3 (8%) developed GH or IUGR. In summary, uterine artery waveform indices at 19-24 weeks gestation may be useful for the prediction of pregnancy complications in woman with underlying renal disease."

We demonstrated that the inflammatory mediator, C5a, a C5a agonist analogue peptide, and the thromboxane mimetic U46619 caused increased fetal perfusion pressure and increased tissue weight when administered via the fetal arterial circulation. Occlusion of the fetal venous effluent tubing caused significantly greater increases in tissue weight than the pharmacological agents. Detectable increases in tissue weight occurred within 47 +/- 3 sec (n = 21) following pressure increases caused by the pharmacological agents. In each case, the increase in tissue weight was accompanied by an increased permeability of the materno-fetal barrier, shown by the transfer of Evans blue albumin from the fetal circulation to the maternal compartment."
CD011053,0,9303788,0,[Results of surgical treatment of pregnancy-associated pelvic vein thrombosis].,"We report the results of surgical treatment of iliofemoral vein thrombosis in 49 pregnant women in a seven years period. The patients mean age was 26.5 years (range 18-41 years). Isolated descending pelvic vein thrombosis (PVT) occurred between the 20th and 36th week of pregnancy and was located predominantly left sided. 89.8% of PVT developed in the late period of gestation, three cases of pelvic vein thrombosis were diagnosed after vaginal delivery. An iliac vein spur in one patient and an AT-III deficiency in two cases were registered as additional risk factors. After venous catheter thrombectomy an arteriovenous fistula between the superficial femoral artery and the femoral vein was performed to increase blood flow and velocity in the pelvic veins. Abdominal delivery was performed simultaneously, if thrombosis occurred after the 34th week of pregnancy. Late re-thrombosis was registered in 4 patients (9.0%) after a mean follow-up of 42 months. We have seen symptoms of mild, not life threatening pulmonary embolism in two patients on the first postoperative day (complication rate 4.0%). Re-occlusion rate was high (3/5) after surgical thrombectomy carried out between the 20th and 26th week of gestation. Risk factors were an AT III deficiency in two cases and the continued compression syndrome of the pelvic veins caused by the enlarging uterus. In the late period of gestation surgical thrombectomy of PVT is the preferential method of treatment in selected patients with good therapeutical results. The operation reduces the risk of future venous insufficiency and post-thrombotic syndrome in the young female patients."
CD011053,0,17656661,0,Intravenous alteplase for stroke: beyond the guidelines and in particular clinical situations.,"Because of the risk of hemorrhage, especially in the brain, thrombolytic therapy with intravenous alteplase is restricted by guidelines, and only a small number of selected patients are being treated. Findings from metaanalyses, post hoc analyses of the randomized trials, and postlicensing experience suggest that more subjects, who otherwise have a poor predicted outcome without treatment, might benefit from intravenous alteplase. Summary of Review- There is a strong indication that treatment may still be beneficial beyond 3 hours up until 4.5 hours. The risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage is not increased in patients aged 80 years or older. Excluding patients with severe stroke or with early ischemic changes in more than one third of the middle cerebral artery territory on baseline CT scan is probably not necessary when treatment is started <3 hours of symptom onset. Patients with minor or improving symptoms can also benefit. Intravenous thrombolysis appears appropriate as first line therapy for posterior circulation stroke. Alteplase can be given to patients with cervical artery dissection, seizure at onset and evidence of acute ischemia on brain imaging, and after carefully weighing risk and benefit in pregnancy and during menstruation. There are anecdotal reports on its use in children, patients with recent myocardial infarction, cardiac embolus, intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, prior stroke and recent surgery. There appears to be a substantially increased risk of symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage in hyperglycemic stroke patients. The combined intravenous and intraarterial approach to recanalization appears safe and is currently under investigation in a randomized trial."
CD011053,0,15301843,0,Renal ultrasound.,"Renal US is one of several imaging modalities available to the EP in the evaluation of patients with acute urologic disorders. It offers excellent anatomic detail without exposure to radiation or contrast agents but is limited in its assessment of renal function. It is an important alternative to helical CT scanning for evaluating renal colic, especially in children and pregnant women. It has an important role in excluding bilateral renal obstruction as the cause of acute renal failure. It is likely that Doppler renal US also will take on a prominent role in the evaluation of renal vascular disorders. It already has become the standard of care in the management of renal transplant patients. Bedside emergency renal US performed and interpreted by EPs with limited training and experience is increasing in use and gaining acceptance. At present, the primary role of renal US is to identify hydronephrosis in patients with renal colic or acute renal failure but, in the future, its role likely will expand as technology advances and its use increases. In many patients, bedside renal US may obviate the need for further diagnostic workup and speed the diagnosis and treatment of an emergency patient."

CD011053,0,3469120,0,The effect of oxytocin and betamimetic stimulation on prostaglandin release in perfused human fetal placenta.,"The existing data on prostaglandins indicate that they are involved in human parturition and regulation of fetoplacental blood flow. The interference of endogenous and exogenous oxytocin and prostaglandins and, on the other hand, betamimetics, which are commonly used during pregnancy, in the regulation of these phenomena is poorly understood. The production of prostaglandins by fetal placental cotyledons was studied using an in vitro perfusion technique. Isolated cotyledons were perfused without (control) or with oxytocin (200 pg/ml, 2000 pg/ml) or the betasympathomimetic drug ritodrine (10 micrograms/ml, 50 micrograms/ml). The release of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) was measured by radioimmunoassay. The release of prostaglandins was also studied during a recovery period after the drug infusion. Oxytocin at a concentration of 200 pg/ml significantly decreased the release of PGF2 alpha. A higher concentration of oxytocin did not cause any changes in prostaglandin production. During ritodrine infusion the perfusion pressure was decreased, but the addition of ritodrine to the perfusion medium had no effect on prostaglandin release. During the recovery period, after ritodrine infusion, the release of PGF2 alpha was significantly decreased. It is suggested that oxytocin at the physiological concentration may protect the fetus from adverse effects of PGF2 alpha before labor in decreasing the release of PGF2 alpha, yet this small decrease in formation of PGF2 alpha is obviously of minor clinical importance because the perfusion pressure remained constant. Ritodrine had no effect on prostaglandin release and so the decrease in the perfusion pressure is probably the result of beta 2-receptor stimulation."

Clinical, phlebographic and plethysmographic evaluation of early and late results.","The investigation comprises 19 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis of the leg treated with streptokinase. The acute clinical symptoms rapidly subsided in 15 patients. Phlebography, performed immediately after treatment, revealed complete thrombus regression in 7 cases, restoration of venous flow but remnants of thrombi in 4 and no effect in 7. One woman was not evaluated radiologically due to pregnancy. The phlebographic restoration seemed to be correlated to the duration of the thrombotic symptoms. Follow-up examinations 6-50 months after the thrombotic incident demonstrated normal phlebograms in 8 patients, all of whom were also free from post-thrombotic symptoms. Venous occlusion plethysmography confirmed that these patients had a normal venous outflow capacity and valvular function in the relevant limbs. By contrast, the remaining 11 patients, with more or less extensive remnants of thrombi at the follow-up phlebography, were found to have plethysmographic signs of venous obstruction and sometimes also valvular insufficiency. The results indicate that thrombolytic treatment is able to give a complete and lasting anatomical and functional restitution of the deep veins after an acute thrombosis in the leg, provided that treatment is induced early enough."
CD011053,0,9033705,0,[Ilio-femoral vein thrombosis treated with tissue plasminogen activator in a pregnant woman].,"A 27-year-old woman, after 31 weeks of amenorrhoea during her second pregnancy, developed a left external iliac and femoral deep vein thrombosis, confirmed by venous ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. The infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA: 1.2 mg/kg, i.e. 80 mg over 3 hours), on the 2nd day, allowed revascularization of the femoral junction, while the external iliac vein remained occluded. The patient did not develop pulmonary embolism or haemorrhage, particularly obstetric haemorrhage. The subsequent pregnancy was uneventful until delivery, six weeks later, of a normal child. Three years later, the patient has no sequelae of her deep vein thrombosis. When required by the patient's condition, it seems that rt-PA can be used to treat severe deep vein thrombosis during pregnancy, either isolated or complicated by pulmonary embolism. Very rigorous cardiological, obstetric and laboratory surveillance is essential. A sufficient dosage, identical to that used in clinical settings other than pregnancy and a brief treatment duration (2 to 3 hours) are probably more effective and more reliable than lower doses continued for several days. However, the risk of haemorrhage remains difficult to predict and its prognosis, especially foetal, is often very poor. A larger series of cases is therefore necessary before this drug can unreservedly recommended in pregnant women."

HL has been associated with complications of pregnancy and the aim of our research was to review the literature, and add a new unpublished case from our group. We searched the internet-based medical databases for case reports and case series of hyperreactio luteinalis and we evaluated diagnostic path, treatment and outcome of pregnancies. We found 96 cases of HL from 1955 to 2013. HL was asymptomatic in 28% of cases but in 72% of patients there were symptoms like lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, ascites and signs of virilization. Suspicion of malignancy was raised in 38% of cases. Surgical treatment of various types was performed in 48% of cases, with oophorectomy in 40% of this group. Several complications were associated with HL, in particular preeclampsia (PE) occurred in 24% of cases and fetal growth restriction (FGR) in 12%. Mean gestation at delivery was 35 weeks (range 25-42). Although preoperative diagnosis occurred in most cases, suspicion of malignancy was extensive, as was oophorectomy, demonstrating suboptimal understanding of the underlying physiopathology. We propose a diagnostic algorithm for this condition. Training of obstetricians in making the correct diagnosis may prevent unnecessary oophorectomies and may lead to early diagnosis and correct management of associated complications."

CD011053,0,6132081,0,Relation between umbilical prostacyclin production and blood-flow in the fetus.,"Umbilical blood-flow (UBF) was measured by ultrasonography in 28 pregnant women. A superfusion preparation was used to investigate the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), a breakdown product of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2), a breakdown product of TxA2, by specimens from the umbilical arteries of the infants born to these 28 mothers and those born to 36 other women in whom UBF had not been measured. UBF was significantly related to 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production. 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production was lower in infants of the 8 pre-eclamptic mothers (14.5 ng min-1 g-1) than in those of 45 healthy mothers (26.9 ng min-1 g-1). Generation of TxA2 by the umbilical artery was 15-25 times less than that of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and TxA2 concentrations were unrelated to UBF or the type of pregnancy.

CD011053,0,16344726,0,Sonography for deep venous thrombosis: current and future applications.,"Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a one of the most common problems facing the clinician in medicine today. It is often asymptomatic and goes undiagnosed with potentially fatal consequences. Ultrasound has become the ""gold standard"" in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and with proper attention to technique sensitivity of this test is approximately 97%. An understanding of anatomy, pathophysiology, and risk factors is important. Thrombus formation usually begins beneath a valve leaflet below the knee. Approximately 40% will resolve spontaneously, 40% will become organized, and 20% will propagate. Whether or not a calf vein thrombus is identified, a repeat examination in 7 to 10 days is recommended in patients with risk factors or when deep venous thrombosis is suspected. The three main risk factors for thrombus formation are age greater than 75 years, previous history of deep venous thrombosis, and underlying malignancy. Other diagnostic studies include the contrast venogram, CT or MRI venogram, Tc99m Apcitide study, and the laboratory test D-Dimer. The D-Dimer study is being used more frequently as a screening test with 99% sensitivity in detecting thrombus, whether deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. However, specificity is only approximately 50% with many conditions leading to false-positive exams. Therefore, a negative examination is useful in avoiding other diagnostic studies, but a positive one may be misleading. Conditions that can lead to a false-positive examination include, but are not limited to diabetes, pregnancy, liver disease, heart conditions, recent surgery, and some gastrointestinal diseases. Like the sonogram, two negative D-Dimer studies a week apart exclude the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Compression sonography with color Doppler remains the best overall test for deep venous thrombosis. It is easy to perform, less expensive than most ""high tech"" studies, can be performed as a portable examination, and is highly reliable when done properly."

We considered the altered maternal-fetal Doppler velocimetry group (n = 57) pregnant women admitted to our Institution for a pregnancy complication associated to the event Pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), with altered Doppler velocimetry in the umbilical artery ( UA) (high pulsatility index, absence or reverse end diastolic flow (ARED), blood flow cephalisation) and/or bilateral increased resistance in uterine arteries. Out of these cases, 25 pregnancies were complicated by PE and 32 pregnancies were complicated by IUGR. We included 145 normotensive third trimester pregnant women as a normal maternal-fetal Doppler velocimetry control group. From all women, 20 ml of whole venous blood was obtained from the antecubital vein soon after Doppler velocimetry evaluation. MPV was significantly higher in women with abnormal Doppler velocimetry compared to those with normal Doppler velocimetry (8.0 fl [7.0-8.7] vs. 9.1 fl [8.0-10.6], <0.001. Values are median [interquartiles]). We performed a ROC curve in order to find an MPV cut-off able to predict an uneventful event in Doppler velocimetry compromised fetuses (neonatal O(2) support > 48 hrs or intubation and/or pH < 7.2 at umbilical blood gas analysis (UBGA)). An MPV > or = 10 fl was significantly related to the former diagnostic endpoints compared to that of non-compromised fetuses (sensitivity: 45%, specificity: 89.7%, 95 CI: 18.8-66, p < 0.01).

A 34-year-old primiparous Japanese woman with a history of myomectomy was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound at 27 weeks of gestation. Unfractionated heparin was administered, which soon ameliorated swelling in the right thigh. A transient IVC filter was implanted just before cesarean section. An enhanced computed tomography scan 2 days after cesarean section revealed a wide thrombus just distal to the filter. We performed catheter thrombus fragmentation with fibrinolysis just before the removal of the IVC filter, resulting in re-canalization of blood flow. No significant PE occurred.

This article reviews the pathophysiology of pregnancy-related DVT and suggests diagnostic strategies, highlighting the pitfalls specific to this patient population. The treatment of DVT in pregnant patients is difficult because unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins, the cornerstones of initial therapy, may have significant maternal side effects and warfarin can cause embryopathy and other adverse fetal effects. As well, there are limited data regarding the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in the treatment and prophylaxis of DVT during pregnancy. This article briefly reviews the areas of controversy and provides recommendations for the treatment of acute DVT and thromboprophylaxis in pregnant patients."

CD011053,0,11964271,0,How we diagnose and treat deep vein thrombosis.,"Making a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires both clinical assessment and objective testing because the clinical features are nonspecific and investigations can be either falsely positive or negative. The initial step in the diagnostic process is to stratify patients into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories using a validated clinical model. When the clinical probability is intermediate or high and the venous ultrasound result is positive, acute symptomatic DVT is confirmed. Similarly, when the probability is low and the ultrasound result is normal, DVT is ruled out. A low clinical probability combined with a negative D-dimer result can also be used to rule out DVT, thereby obviating the need for ultrasonography. In contrast, when the clinical assessment is discordant with the results of objective testing, serial venous ultrasonography or venography is required to confirm or refute a diagnosis of DVT. Once a patient is diagnosed with an acute DVT, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the agent of choice for initial therapy and oral anticoagulant therapy is the standard for long-term secondary prophylaxis. Therapy should continue for at least 3 months; the decision to continue treatment beyond 3 months is made by weighing the risks of recurrent thrombosis and anticoagulant-related bleeding, and is influenced by patient preference. Screening for associated thrombophilia is not indicated routinely, but should be performed in selected patients whose clinical features suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state. Several new anticoagulants with theoretical advantages over existing agents are undergoing evaluation in phase 3 studies in patients with venous thromboembolism."

An anthropomorphic phantom was modified to contain a 15 cc ionization chamber at the site of the uterus to enable fetal dose to be measured. The effects of a range of scan parameters, positioning of lead and thicknesses of lead were investigated. Fetal dose was lower with lower values of kV(p) and mAs. An increasing thickness of lead decreased the radiation dose to the uterus, as did increasing the proportion of the patient covered by the lead shielding. Fetal dose increased exponentially as the edge of the scan volume moved closer to the point of measurement. In no experiment was the dose to the fetus increased by the presence of the lead. It was found that the fetal radiation dose from a CT scan following a pulmonary embolism protocol can be effectively reduced by the use of lead shielding."

CD011053,0,23479698,0,MR imaging for acute nontraumatic abdominopelvic pain: rationale and practical considerations.,"Medical imaging is becoming an increasingly vital component of patient care in the emergency department. Computed tomography has been the diagnostic imaging method of choice for emergency department patients with acute abdominopelvic pain; however, the use of ionizing radiation and the potential need for exogenous contrast material adversely affect patient safety and work flow efficiency, respectively. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging holds promise as an alternative for the evaluation of acute abdominopelvic pain. Critical causes of abdominopelvic pain may be detected with MR imaging without exogenous contrast material. MR imaging is sensitive for depicting tissue or fluid changes related to inflammation, a common process in causes of acute abdominopelvic pain. Fat suppression allows the detection of abnormal signal caused by inflamed tissue. MR imaging has proved sensitive in the detection of acute inflammatory diseases of the gallbladder and bile ducts, liver, pancreas, kidneys, collecting system, bowel, and pelvic soft tissues. Moreover, MR imaging without exogenous contrast material may be safely used in pregnant patients. Evolving roles for emergency department MR imaging include the assessment of vascular disease (including thromboembolic disease) and right upper quadrant pain. Emergency department MR imaging currently has limited availability, and its continued use will require further education regarding operation and image interpretation as well as further validation of cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, current understanding of the diagnostic utility of this imaging method warrants continued study and the increased use of MR imaging in the evaluation of emergency department patients with acute abdominopelvic pain."

We present a healthy, 27-year-old, full-term parturient admitted for postdate induction of labor. Cesarean delivery was required following fetal distress. During delivery, the mother became bradycardic and required advanced cardiac life support for resuscitation. Serial hemoglobin values, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and a magnetic resonance image of the head were all normal. No fetal squamous cells were found in the patient's blood. She required 6 days of ventilation, was successfully extubated, and was discharged 14 days after the cesarean delivery. The differential diagnosis in this patient's care centered on a pulmonary embolic event. Thromboembolism was unlikely, based upon the patient's rapid clinical improvement without definitive therapy for thrombotic disease or detection of peripheral thrombosis. Amniotic fluid embolus was unlikely, although not excluded, by the absence of fetal cells in the maternal circulation and the lack of an accompanying intravascular coagulopathy. Air embolism may occur in up to 50% of women undergoing cesarean delivery. A lethal embolism may follow a bolus of 3 to 5 mL/kg of air. Chief among the many symptoms of air embolism are tachypnea, chest pain, and gasping. The diagnosis may be facilitated by precordial Doppler monitoring, transesophageal echocardiography, or by the identification of air when aspirating from a right heart catheter. Management includes optimum patient positioning, aspiration of air, discontinuation of nitrous oxide, administration of 100% oxygen, and flooding the surgical site with saline to avoid further air entry. Preventive strategies are also discussed."

CD011053,0,17070574,0,Vasoreactivity of chorionic plate arteries in response to vasoconstrictors produced by preeclamptic placentas.,"Inadequate blood flow and increased vasoconstriction of the placenta contribute to pregnancy associated disorders such as preeclampsia (PE). Because placental vessels lack autonomic innervation, humoral effects of the placenta must play critical roles in regulation of fetal-placental vascular contractility. In this study, we examined the nature of humoral factors produced by PE trophoblasts on placental vessel contractility using an organ bath perfusion model. Vasomotor responses were studied in vitro using placental chorionic plate arteries. Vessel rings from third branch chorionic plate arteries were dissected from human placentas following normal or PE delivery. The arterial rings were equilibrated in Krebs Henseleit buffer and exposed to placental conditioned medium, which was prepared by culture of villous tissue from PE placentas. Receptor antagonists for angiotensin II (ANG II), thromboxane (TX), and endothelin (ET) were used to determine which humoral factor produced by placental tissue (trophoblasts) was more effective in promoting vasoconstriction. The role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and non-ACE ANG II generating enzymes in regulation of placental vasomotor tone were also investigated. A total of 80 arterial rings from 48 placentas were studied. Our results showed: 1) enhanced vasomotor tone in arteries from PE placentas compared to those from normal placentas; 2) PE-CM induced vaso-constrictive activity could be partially attenuated by receptor antagonists for TX, ANG II and ET, respectively; and 3) chymostatin (a chymase inhibitor) produced a stronger inhibitory effect than captopril (ACE inhibitor) on PE conditioned medium induced vasoconstriction. Our data demonstrate increased vasocontractility in PE placentas and suggest that the non-ACE pathway is probably a major source of ANG II produced in the human placenta."

CD011053,0,11446658,0,Alloimmune thrombocytopenia in the fetus and newborn.,"Alloimmune thrombocytopenia is an interesting and challenging disease. Identification in the fetus and newborn by screening remains to be clarified. The primary clinical criterion for neonatal diagnosis appears to be a neonatal platelet count of <50 x 10(9)/L. Treatment of the neonate can be accomplished with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) +/- steroids or with matched platelet transfusion. Cranial ultrasonography is important. Testing can be performed on the parents and requires a highly experienced laboratory. If an affected fetus is identified, based on a previous affected neonate and a homozygous father, antenatal management is needed. Studies have been completed that inform the still controversial decision. IVIG remains the basis of therapy but appears to require a higher dose (2 g/kg/week) and/or the addition of 1 mg/kg of prednisone in the highest risk cases, those with antenatal intracranial hemorrhage."

Maternal total serum vitamin D, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured at 11-13 week gestation in 90 cases that developed PE, including 30 that required delivery before 34 weeks (early PE) and 1000 unaffected controls. The median values of vitamin D, PAPP-A, uterine artery PI and MAP expressed as a multiple of the unaffected median (MoM), in the patients developing early PE and late PE were compared with the controls. There was no significant difference in the median serum vitamin D MoM or raw values within the outcome groups (P=141 and P=0.231, respectively) whereas the median PAPP-A MoM, uterine PI MoM and MAP MoM were significantly different (P=0.031, P=0.001 and P<0.0001, respectively). Serum PAPP-A was decreased in both early PE and late PE (0.54 and 0.88 versus 1.03 MoM, P<0.0001 and P=0.010, respectively), MAP was increased in both early PE and late PE (1.09 and 1.06 versus 0.99 MoM, P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively) and uterine artery PI was increased in early PE but not in late PE (1.32 and 1.12 versus 1.01 MoM, P<0.0001 and P=0.083, respectively).

CD011053,0,1500806,0,[A trial of low-dose aspirin therapy in high-risk pregnancy].,"Intra-uterine growth retardation, intra-uterine fetal death and pre-eclampsia have common abnormalities: A reduction of uteroplacental perfusion, lack of vasodilation of spiral arteries and subsequent thrombosis. These physiological processes have been explained by an imbalance between prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 production. Many studies have suggested that treatment with low-dose aspirin and steroids is effective in preventing pregnancy loss or pre-eclampsia, but the mechanism has not been established. We evaluated the effectiveness of these therapies in patients at risk for pregnancy loss with the aspect of intracellular ionized calcium mobilization. Low-dose aspirin directs the prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 balance to the dominance of prostacyclin and steroids suppress the activities of lupus anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies. The intracellular ionized calcium concentration in platelets is decreased significantly after these therapies. Concerning the pathological examination of placenta, there were deposits of fibrin in only 2 out of 8 cases and there were no abnormal findings in the other 6 cases. These data show that the aggregation of platelets is suppressed in microvascular circulations. These therapies do not cause any adverse effect on the mother or fetus.

CD011053,0,9064000,0,Effects of severe preeclampsia with different doppler velocimetries on extra- and intrauterine environments.,"We evaluated the perinatal outcome of fetuses and maternal condition of 47 patients with severe preeclampsia. Antepartum fetal surveillance (within 2 days of delivery or fetal death) included the nonstress test, Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical and uterine arteries, amniotic fluid assessment, maternal blood chemistry and hemogram. Pregnancies with abnormal Doppler velocimetry in the umbilical and uterine arteries had poor perinatal outcomes as judged by the incidence of abnormal antepartum fetal surveillance, acute fetal distress mandating immediate delivery, small for gestational age infants, perinatal morbidity and mortality and prematurity. These fetuses were at a high risk of acute and chronic hypoxia. Maternal blood chemistries and hemograms revealed a high incidence of hepatocellular dysfunction, renal insufficiency, hemoconcentration and thrombocytopenia. In cases of severe preeclampsia, those with abnormal Doppler velocimetry of both umbilical and uterine arteries, had poor extra- and intrauterine environments. Therefore, aggressive rather than expectant management was more suitable. For those with normal umbilical artery resistance and either normal or abnormal uterine artery resistance, careful management with close monitoring of both maternal and fetal status was possible in patients who were far from term."

Estimation if antiphospholipid syndrome and antiphospholipid antibodies are the risk factor for myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease in patients with TRU. We examined 129 patients with SLE (114 women and 15 men). All the patients underwent comprehensive physical examination. ECG, ultrasound heart examinations were performed. They were followed by heart scintygraphic examination if indicated. Routine biochemical and hematological laboratory tests were performed including fasting glucose level, concentration of homocysteine, uric acid and lipids. Wide range of immunological essays were performed, testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA), antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies--aCL, lupus anticoagulant--LA, antiprothrombine antibodies aPT, anti-beta2glicoprotein-I antibodies), anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-nucleosome antibodies, antihistone antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and antiendothelial antibodies (AECA). Statistical analysis was performed with chi2 Yates, chi2 Pearson and R rang Spearman tests. Multivariate regression analysis was also done.

CD011053,0,17127250,0,Emerging concepts in preeclampsia investigation.,"Preeclampsia is a disorder that uniquely affects pregnancy and profoundly alters the short- and long-term health of the mother and fetus. The pathophysiologic processes that underlie preeclampsia can be thought of in two stages: stage 1, reduced placental perfusion, and stage 2, the maternal clinical syndrome. Multiple pathophysiologic processes influence stage one, affecting trophoblast invasion and placental function. These processes in some women result in stage two, with subsequent maternal inflammatory, metabolic, and thrombotic responses, converging to alter vascular and endothelial health. An increasingly comprehensive understanding of these factors is emerging, which we will introduce in this chapter and which will be detailed in the chapters that follow. The translation of this understanding into clinical trials and ultimately into effective preventive and therapeutic measures remains the ultimate goal of preeclampsia research."

Because anticoagulant therapy poses a greater health risk to mother and fetus than does the radiation required for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, clinicians should aggressively pursue objective evidence of venous thromboembolism. Once the diagnosis is made, anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin should be used prepartum followed by warfarin therapy after delivery."

CD011053,0,19664975,0,Prenatal stroke.,"The main focus of this chapter is the comprehensive description of the neuropathology, the imaging correlates and underlying mechanisms of prenatal stroke. We describe established prenatal stroke in subgroups similar to postnatal stroke: arterial (forebrain or hindbrain) infarction, venous thrombosis, primary lobar haemorrhage. This longitudinal classification should facilitate the study of risk factors and mechanisms. Forebrain lesions of arterial type present as porencephaly, (hemi)hydranencephaly, multicystic encephalopathy or schizencephaly. Venous prenatal forebrain stroke presents as simple porencephaly (in some of genetic nature) and sinus thrombosis. A list of rare porencephaly-like conditions is added for differentiation from arterial and venous porencephaly. Hindbrain infarctions (so far the only reported variants seem to be of arterial nature) present as brainstem disconnection, focal brainstem destruction, uni- or bilateral cerebellar destruction and focal spinal cord ischaemia. Prenatal intracranial haemorrhage and congenital brain infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of prenatal stroke."
CD011053,0,555781,0,"[Grave obstetrical phlebitis. Physiopathology, diagnosis and treatment (6 case histories) (author's transl)].","The authors detail their concepts of the physiopathology, the diagnostic methods and the treatments of grave puerperal phlebitis, having seen six cases in their two departments recently. They consist of 5 cases of iliofemoral thrombosis, 2 of whom were diagnosed during their pregnancies and 3 others whom were diagnosed after delivery. One of these died of pulmonary embolus: and there was one case of thrombosis of the right ovarian vein during post-partum. Over and above the classical factors that predispose to this condition in pregnancy, the authors draw attention to the anatomical constitutional factors that have been observed by Cockett in the physiopathology of these cases. The diagnosis is made using non-invasive methods: Doppler, plethysmography, labelled fibrinogen and isotope phlebography after delivery, supplemented when the results are positive by radiography of the iliac and vena caval systems which alone gives a precise diagnosis of the site. Therapeutic possibilities change according to the time that the condition is perceived, according to the topography of the lesions, and according to the existence or non-existence of moving thrombi. The treatment is directed to avoiding the complications of emboli and to preventing secondary functional sequellae. Finally the gynaecological problems of contraception and of further pregnancies are considered."
CD011053,0,1806565,0,Modern management of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.,"The number of women receiving ovulation induction has markedly increased with the advent of medically assisted reproduction. Consequently, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has become a frequent clinical problem. It is a potentially life-threatening situation. In its severe forms it is complicated by haemoconcentration, hypovolaemia, hypotension, acute renal insufficiency and thromboembolism. The pathophysiology of OHSS is poorly understood. The occurrence of OHSS correlates well with the level of oestradiol, the number of follicles, and administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). The risk is increased in polycystic ovarian disease. The aim of this paper is to review critically the published literature on prediction, prevention and modern management of OHSS. Complete prevention of OHSS is not possible although several methods are used to predict and reduce its occurrence. Endocrine profile and ultrasonic follicular monitoring are the mainstays of prediction. The presence of a large number of small and intermediate size follicles at sonography is a risk factor. Withholding HCG, continuation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues and cryopreservation of embryos are optional courses of action for prevention. Mild OHSS is usually self-limiting and requires no active therapy. Moderate and severe cases are treated by correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and by prevention of thromboembolism. The use of surgery is limited to cases of torsion or rupture of ovarian cysts, or the presence of concomitant ectopic pregnancy. Aspiration of the ascitic fluid, preferably by the transvaginal route, is recommended in cases with severe ascites."

CD011053,0,10544900,0,Genetic risk factors for superficial vein thrombosis.,"Inherited thrombophilic states are associated with an increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but whether they are also risk factors for superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is uncertain. We assessed the risk conferred by inherited thrombophilic states in patients with a first episode of SVT in whom the coexistence of DVT had been ruled out by ultrasonography. Sixty-three patients with SVT, after exclusion of patients with varicose veins, malignant or autoimmune disease, and 537 healthy individuals were investigated. The G1691A mutation in the factor V gene, the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene, and deficiencies of the naturally occurring inhibitors of coagulation (antithrombin, protein C, protein S) were searched. The prevalence of each thrombophilic state was higher in patients than in controls. The odds ratios for SVT were 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6 to 14.2) in patients with the G1691A factor V mutation, 4.3 (95% CI, 1.5 to 12.6) in those with the G20210A prothrombin mutation, and 12.9 (95% CI, 3.6 to 46.2) in those with deficiencies of the naturally occurring inhibitors of coagulation taken together. Risks did not substantially change when the analysis was restricted to 43 patients who had SVT as their only thrombotic manifestation, being 4.3 (95% CI, 1.5 to 12.3) in patients with factor V mutation, and 3.6 (95% CI, 1.0 to 13.1) in those with the prothrombin mutation. Among the circumstantial risk factors investigated (surgery, trauma, prolonged immobilization, oral contraceptives and pregnancy or puerperium), pregnancy or puerperium was the most frequently associated with SVT, being present in 38% of women. Our findings indicate that inherited thrombophilic states are associated with an increased risk for SVT. Hence, a laboratory search of these alterations is recommended in patients with SVT, because it allows the identification of patients at high risk of DVT in whom antithrombotic prophylaxis is particularly warranted."

CD011053,0,21868576,0,Is heparin a placental anticoagulant in high-risk pregnancies?,"Randomized control trials show beneficial effects of heparin in high-risk pregnancies to prevent preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. However, the lack of placental pathology data in these trials challenges the assumption that heparin is a placental anticoagulant. Recent data show that placental infarction is probably associated with abnormalities in development of the placenta, characterized by poor maternal perfusion and an abnormal villous trophoblast compartment in contact with maternal blood, than with maternal thrombophilia. At-risk pregnancies may therefore be predicted by noninvasive prenatal testing of placental function in mid-pregnancy. Heparin has diverse cellular functions that include direct actions on the trophoblast. Dissecting the non-anticoagulant actions of heparin may indicate novel and safer therapeutic targets to prevent the major placental complications of pregnancy."

CD011053,0,16820203,0,Differential release of plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) during dual perfusion of human placenta: implications in preeclampsia.,"Plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) play critical roles in regulating cellular invasion and fibrinolysis. An increase in the ratio of PAI-1/PAI-2 in placenta and maternal serum is suggested to result in excessive intervillous fibrin deposition and placental infarction in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In the current study we used dual (maternal and fetal) perfusion of human term placentas to examine the release of PAIs to the intervillous space. ELISA revealed a significant time-dependent increase in total PAI-1 levels in maternal perfusate (MP) between 1 and 7h of perfusion. Conversely, PAI-2 levels decreased resulting in a 3-fold increase in the PAI-1/PAI-2 ratio in MP. Levels of PAI-1, but not PAI-2, in placental tissue extracts increased during perfusion. In perfusions carried out with xanthine and xanthine oxidase (X + XO), compounds used to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), no time-dependent increase in total PAI-1 levels was observed. In addition, X + XO treatment promoted a 3-fold reduction in active PAI-1 levels in MP, indicating that ROS decrease PAI-1 release to MP. The finding of a time-dependent change in patterns of PAI expression and response to ROS indicates the utility of dual perfusion as a model to dissect mechanism(s) promoting aberrant fibrinolysis in pregnancies complicated by PE and IUGR."
CD011053,0,15637124,0,A2B adenosine receptor mediates human chorionic vasoconstriction and signals through arachidonic acid cascade.,"Because adenosine is a vascular tone modulator, we examined the effect of adenosine and congeners in the vascular reactivity of isolated human placental vessels and in perfused cotyledons. We characterized its vasomotor action and tentatively identified the receptor subtypes and their intracellular signaling mechanisms. We recorded isometric tension from the circular layer of chorionic vessel rings maintained under 1.5 g of basal tension or precontracted with KCl. The relative order of potency of adenosine and structural analogs is consistent with the expression of A2B receptors, 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA) being the most potent. The maximal contraction ranged from 45% to 60% of the KCl standard response, except for an A2A receptor agonist that did not exceed 15%. Consistently, NECA was 100-fold more potent than adenosine to raise the perfusion pressure of ex vivo perfused cotyledons. In contrast, a selective A3 receptor agonist relaxed precontracted rings of chorionic vessels. Whereas a selective A3 receptor antagonist was ineffective to antagonize adenosine-induced contraction, A2 or A1 receptor antagonists reduced adenosine-induced vasoconstriction concentration-dependently. Denudation of the endothelial layer reduced adenosine- and NECA-induced contractions by 50-70%. Furthermore, indomethacin reduced adenosine- or NECA-induced contractions concentration-dependently in intact and endothelium-denuded rings. A thromboxane receptor antagonist blocked adenosine- and NECA-induced contractions in intact and endothelium-denuded rings, suggesting the involvement of an arachidonic acid metabolite as the mediator of the vasoconstriction. We propose that adenosine A2B receptors mediate the adenosine-induced contraction vasomotor effect in human chorionic vessels and that this involves synthesis of a thromboxane receptor activator or a related prostanoid."
CD011053,0,12439150,0,Treatment of acute pulmonary embolism during pregnancy with low molecular weight heparin: three case reports.,"We report three patients who presented with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) at gestational weeks 13-19. The diagnosis was based on spiral computer tomography of the lungs. In one of the cases, PE was submassive with signs of right ventricle overload. All of the patients were treated with low molecular weight heparin enoxaparine with an initial dose of 1 mg/kg twice daily during 1 month, and therafter with a reduced dose (80%). The target anti-activated factor X levels 3 h after injection were easily kept in the therapeutic range (0.5-0.9 IU/ml). In all cases, the symptoms were relieved within 4 days and no thrombotic or bleeding complications were observed during the rest of the pregnancy. We conclude that low molecular weight heparin seems to be an efficient and practical treatment of PE during pregnancy."

The mother had raised anticardiolipin IgG antibodies at the time of delivery of her second child, with no thrombotic symptoms. Therefore, during this pregnancy, she had been treated with low molecular weight heparin and aspirin. The baby's mother had raised IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies and the baby had IgG anticardiolipin antibodies at the upper range of normal 4 days after delivery. The seizures were controlled with phenobarbitone and phenytoin. CT and MRI scans showed evidence of cerebral ischaemia. A repeat MRI scan at 4 months of age was normal, anticonvulsants were discontinued, and her latest neurological examination at 5 months was normal."

CD011053,0,23193111,0,Control of soluble fms-like tyrosine-1 (sFlt-1) production response to placental ischemia/hypoxia: role of tumor necrosis factor-Œ±.,"Although abnormal soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) production is thought to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE), the mechanisms that regulate the production of sFlt-1 during PE are unclear. While our laboratory has shown tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±) and sFlt-1 to be elevated in pregnant rats in response to placental ischemia, the importance of TNF-Œ± in the regulation of sFlt-1 production is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the role of TNF-Œ± in mediating the increase in sFlt-1 in response to placental ischemia or hypoxia. Reductions in uterine perfusion pressure in pregnant rats significantly increased plasma levels of sFlt-1 and tended to increase TNF-Œ±, an effect markedly attenuated by pretreatment with a TNF-Œ± inhibitor etanercept (0.4 mg/kg). To further assess chronic interactions between TNF-Œ± and sFlt-1, we examined a chronic effect of TNF-Œ± infusion (50 ng/day) into normal pregnant rats to increase plasma sFlt-1 levels, as well as the effects of acute hypoxia on placental sFlt-1 production in the absence and presence of TNF-Œ± blockade. Placental explants exposed to hypoxic conditions had enhanced TNF-Œ± levels versus normoxic conditions, as well as increased sFlt-1 production. Pretreatment of placental explants with etanercept (15 ŒºM) significantly reduced TNF-Œ± levels in response to hypoxia but did not attenuate sFlt-1 production. These data suggest that while TNF-Œ± may not play an important role in stimulating sFlt-1 production in response to acute hypoxia, a more chronic hypoxia, or placental ischemia may be an important stimulus for enhanced sFlt-l production."

CD011053,0,19206179,0,The clinical spectrum of fetal Niemann-Pick type C.,"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a lysosomal neurovisceral storage disease. The spectrum of the clinical presentation as well as the severity of the disease and the age of presentation may be highly variable. Fetal presentation is rarely described in the literature. Here, we report on seven new cases of fetal onset NPC of whom two were diagnosed in utero and five postnatally. The fetal clinical presentation, included, in utero splenomegaly (6/7), in utero hepatomegaly (5/7), in utero ascites (4/7), intra uterine growth retardation (IUGR) (2/7), and oligohydramnios (2/7). Placentomegaly was present in two of the three pregnancies examined. Congenital thrombocytopenia (4/4), congenital anemia (2/4), and petechial rash (2/5) were diagnosed immediately after birth. Three patients were born preterm. Pregnancy and postnatal outcome were remarkably poor with one case of intrauterine fetal death, one elective termination of pregnancy, and four patients who died within the first months of life from a rapidly fatal neonatal cholestatic disease. NPC1 gene mutation analysis identified all of the mutant alleles including three novel mutations. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and ascites were the most consistent prenatal ultrasonographic findings of the NPC fetuses. We suggest that once identified these findings, should raise the suspicion of fetal NPC. Our study further expands the antenatal clinical spectrum of NPC and provides clues to its prenatal diagnosis."
CD011053,0,15251149,0,The value of autopsy in determining the cause of failure to respond to resuscitation at birth.,"Autopsy is invaluable in identifying the causes of severe depression and very low Apgar score after birth and in assessing contributory conditions. Brain scans are increasingly used in the care of neonates who fail to respond to resuscitation at birth but their interpretation depends on the information gained from sound neuropathological studies. Asphyxia, both acute intrapartum asphyxia and chronic asphyxia, is an important cause of low Apgar scores. The gestational age and the nature of the asphyxial insult both have a profound influence on the ultimate pattern of injury. Asphyxia in the preterm brain tends to damage preferentially the white matter but some white matter damage is also seen in many infants who have an hypoxia-ischaemic insult at term though the predominant site of injury is to the central grey matter. The nature of the cellular damage and reactive change seen at autopsy is described. There is an association between low Apgar scores and intrauterine exposure to infection and maternal pyrexia. Detailed autopsy examination should include the search for infection. The placenta, cord and membranes should be examined in view of the mounting evidence of the association between intrauterine infection of the placenta and fetal membranes and prenatal brain damage. Additionally, the presence of placental thrombosis and infarction should be sought in relation to focal and global injury in the full term infant. Acquired prepartum lesions rarely cause the infant to present with a low Apgar score. The exception to this is severe damage to the brainstem and basal ganglia. Traumatic injury to the brain is now much less common than in previous decades. Subdural haemorrhage occurs more frequently than intraventricular or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Instrumental and assisted deliveries are associated with an increased incidence of subdural haemorrhage though these rarely cause significant long term damage. Careful autopsy, particularly of the neck and paravertebral tissues, spinal cord, brainstem and nerve roots is important where trauma is suspected. Tearing of nerve roots or fibre bundles in the spinal cord is readily demonstrated under the microscope using immunocytochemistry to beta-amyloid precursor protein. Disorders of the spinal cord, peripheral nerve and muscle as well as some metabolic diseases may cause a baby to be both floppy and weak. Metabolic disease, including peroxisomal disorders, non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia, lipid and glycogen storage disorders and mitochondrial diseases may cause profound hypotonia and respiratory failure at birth or shortly afterwards."

All those with previous venous thrombo-embolism have been free from recurrence when on warfarin. During the half century 1931-1981, all 11 full term pregnancies in four affected patients were associated with venous thromboembolism; one patient was enigmatic having one full term pregnancy, without thrombotic event; between 1982 and 1989 three pregnancies have been actively managed with no clinical thrombosis. Management involved use of monitored, self administered, subcutaneous heparin before or very soon after conception and throughout pregnancy (warfarin having been stopped), planned delivery under cover of intravenous antithrombin III, reduction of heparin dosage at delivery and reintroduction of warfarin in the puerperium. The recognised hazards of heparin therapy in pregnancy did not occur. The involvement of the arterial system is reviewed. Clinical evidence provides tentative suggestions on (a) possible additional risk of cigarette smoking (b) avoidance of venography (c) avoidance of varicose vein surgery.

CD011053,0,23065159,0,Imaging of the female pelvis through the life cycle.,"The appearance of the normal reproductive tract on radiologic images changes dramatically over the female patient's life span, reflecting the influence of hormones on these organs. In female children and adolescents, the appearance of the reproductive tract reflects the stage of sexual maturation. In women of reproductive age, physiologic changes such as those occurring in the corpus luteum are routinely imaged and must be distinguished from pathologic conditions. In the postmenopausal years, as reproductive hormone levels diminish, the endometrium and ovaries undergo progressive involution. Imaging findings that might be considered physiologic in younger women may represent pathologic or even neoplastic changes in postmenopausal women. Although postpartum imaging is typically performed in symptomatic patients, including those with greater than expected vaginal bleeding, suspected obstetric trauma, thromboembolic disease, or infectious complications, clinicians who interpret these radiologic results should be familiar with expected findings in asymptomatic patients after childbirth. Familiarity with the spectrum of ultrasonographic, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance imaging appearances of the normal female reproductive tract from birth through the postmenopausal years will ultimately help clinicians avoid misinterpreting these normal physiologic changes as pathologic conditions."

A 49-year-old woman with a history of deep venous thrombosis and recurrent miscarriages was found to have active autoimmune hemolytic anemia after being admitted to the hospital for cholelithiasis. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 1 month later. Two weeks after surgery she had acute adrenal insufficiency. Activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged, and antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in significant titer. Her illness responded well to corticosteroid therapy. Her direct Coombs' test remained positive. It appears that the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome contributed to the development of venous thrombosis, recurrent miscarriages, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, adrenal insufficiency, and indirectly, pigment stone cholelithiasis in this patient."

CD011053,0,17963329,0,Peripartum cardiomyopathy: review of the literature.,"Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare but serious form of cardiac failure affecting women in the last months of pregnancy or early puerperium. Clinical presentation of PPCM is similar to that of systolic heart failure from any cause, and it can sometimes be complicated by a high incidence of thromboembolism. Prior to the availability of echocardiography, diagnosis was based only on clinical findings. Recently, inclusion of echocardiography has made diagnosis of PPCM easier and more accurate. Its etiopathogenesis is still poorly understood, but recent evidence supports inflammation, viral infection and autoimmunity as the leading causative hypotheses. Prompt recognition with institution of intensive treatment by a multidisciplinary team is a prerequisite for improved outcome. Conventional treatment consists of diuretics, beta blockers, vasodilators, and sometimes digoxin and anticoagulants, usually in combination. In resistant cases, newer therapeutic modalities such as immunomodulation, immunoglobulin and immunosuppression may be considered. Cardiac transplantation may be necessary in patients not responding to conventional and newer therapeutic strategies. The role of the anesthesiologist is important in perioperative and intensive care management. Prognosis is highly related to reversal of ventricular dysfunction. Compared to historically higher mortality rates, recent reports describe better outcome, probably because of advances in medical care. Based on current information, future pregnancy is usually not recommended in patients who fail to recover heart function. This article aims to provide a comprehensive updated review of PPCM covering etiopathogeneses, clinical presentation and diagnosis, as well as pharmacological, perioperative and intensive care management and prognosis, while stressing areas that require further research."

CD011053,0,24906915,0,Retrograde shear rate in formerly preeclamptic and healthy women before and after exercise training: relationship with endothelial function.,"Blood flow patterns in conduit arteries characterized by high levels of retrograde shear stress can be detrimental for vascular health. In this study we examined whether retrograde shear rate and endothelial function are related in healthy and formerly preeclamptic (PE) women and whether this relationship is altered by exercise training. Formerly PE women (32 ¬± 4 yr, n = 20) and controls (32 ¬± 4 yr, n = 20), all 6-12 mo postpartum, performed 12-wk aerobic exercise training. We measured brachial artery shear rate (SR) and endothelial function by flow-mediated dilation (FMD, echo-Doppler). We additionally performed power spectral analysis of heart rate variability and calculated low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio. Antegrade SR was not different between groups, while retrograde SR was significantly higher and FMD% lower in PE women compared with controls (both P < 0.05). Retrograde shear correlated strongly with FMD% in PE women and controls (P < 0.05). LF/HF ratio inversely correlated with brachial artery retrograde SR and FMD% (both P < 0.05) in PE women and controls. Exercise training reduced retrograde shear, improved FMD%, and reduced LF/HF ratios similarly in both groups (all P < 0.05). Training-induced changes in retrograde SR correlated with changes in FMD% and LF/HF ratio. A higher brachial artery retrograde SR relates to lower brachial artery endothelial function, in both controls and formerly PE women. Exercise training improves retrograde SR, while the magnitude of this change correlated strongly with improvements in FMD and reductions in LF/HF ratio. Therefore, the impact of PE and exercise training on endothelial health may, at least partly, be related to retrograde shear rate."
CD011053,0,17392178,0,Thrombin regulates soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) expression in first trimester decidua: implications for preeclampsia.,"The primary placental defect in preeclampsia is shallow trophoblast invasion of the decidua leading to incomplete vascular transformation and inadequate uteroplacental perfusion. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) seems to interfere with these events by inhibiting local angiogenesis and/or by impeding trophoblast invasion. Preeclampsia is also associated with maternal thrombophilias and decidual hemorrhage, which form thrombin from decidual cell-expressed tissue factor. Although sFlt-1 is highly expressed by trophoblasts, sFlt-1 expression has not been studied in decidual cells, which are the predominant cell type encountered by invading trophoblasts. Here, we demonstrate that isolated decidual cells express sFlt-1 mRNA, suggesting that they can synthesize sFlt-1. Moreover, in first trimester decidual cells, thrombin enhanced sFlt-1 mRNA levels, as measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and levels of secreted sFlt-1 protein, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The thrombin antagonist hirudin blocked this effect, demonstrating that active thrombin is required. Emphasizing the specificity of the thrombin response, neither interleukin-1beta nor tumor necrosis factor-alpha affected sFlt-1 expression in the decidual cells. In contrast to first trimester decidual cells, thrombin did not affect sFlt-1 levels in cultured term decidual cells. In early pregnancy, thrombin may act as an autocrine/paracrine enhancer of sFlt-1 expression by decidual cells to promote pre-eclampsia by interfering with local vascular transformation."

CD011053,0,9457624,0,Coagulation disorders in young adults with acute cerebral ischaemia.,"We analysed the results of coagulation studies in an unselected series of young adults with acute cerebral ischaemia. Our aims were (a) to determine the prevalence of coagulation disorders among these patients, (b) to investigate the relation between the presence of coagulation abnormalities and large vessel disease or potential sources of cardiac embolism and (c) to evaluate the occurrence of thrombotic events in patients with or without coagulation disorders. One hundred and twenty consecutively admitted patients (53 men, 67 women, median age 38 years, range 15-45) who presented with acute cerebral infarction (n = 89) or a transient ischaemic attack (n = 31) were evaluated. Diagnostic studies consisted of electrocardiography, echocardiography, duplex scanning, and/or angiography. Coagulation studies included activity tests of protein S, protein C, antithrombin, plasminogen, measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA), and a dilute prothrombin assay. Initially, 30 patients had increased ACLA titres and 28 had an abnormal dilute prothrombin assay, suggesting lupus anticoagulant. Decreased protein S, protein C and antithrombin activity were detected in 20, 3 and 3 patients, respectively, excluding patients in whom the abnormalities could be explained by the use of medication, by pregnancy or puerperium. We detected a decreased activity of plasminogen in 5 patients. The disorders could be confirmed by a second assessment in only 2 patients with a protein S deficiency, in none of the patients with a protein C or antithrombin deficiency and in 1 patient with plasminogen deficiency. However, the abnormalities persisted in 19 of 21 patients with increased anticardiolipin IgG titres and in 9 of 20 patients with lupus anticoagulant. A confirmed coagulation disorder was not associated with stroke type or vascular risk factors, but it was more common among patients with large vessel disease (odds ratio: 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-12.8). Sixteen patients had a recurrent thromboembolic event, but the risk of recurrence was not increased among patients with a confirmed coagulation disorder. Our results suggest that idiopathic coagulation disorders are found in about a quarter of young stroke patients. They are difficult to predict and probably interact with other risk factors."

Three weeks after recovering from OHSS, the patient presented with left neck pain and swelling. Ultrasound revealed a thrombus in the left jugular vein and left subclavian vein. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was initiated with symptom resolution within 1 week. The patient remained on LWMH throughout her pregnancy and delivered at term. A literature review showed 97 published cases of thromboembolism following ovulation induction. A majority of these cases was associated with OHSS and pregnancy and the site of involvement was predominantly in the upper extremity and neck. Infertility physicians and obstetricians should be aware of this complication and keep in mind that it may occur weeks after resolution of OHSS symptoms."

A case of routine ultrasound examination at 23 weeks' gestation demonstrating foci of hepatic hyperechogenicity and cardiomegaly is presented. Colour Doppler detected absence of flow in the ductus venosus and markedly increased blood flow through an aberrant channel connecting the umbilical vein with the right atrium. The pregnancy was terminated and anomalous venous drainage of the umbilical vein into an enlarged hepatic vein was found, as well as hepatic congestion and focal hepatic necrosis and calcifications. Incidental findings of fetal hepatic hyperechogenicities require colour Doppler investigation of the intra- and extra-hepatic venous systems. We propose that a thrombo-embolic mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions."
CD011053,0,9177697,0,A high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of cortisol and metabolites in placental perfusate.,"A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry assay (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed to quantitate cortisol, cortisone, 20 alpha- and beta-dihydrocortisol, 20 alpha- and beta-dihydrocortisone, tetrahydrocortisol, and tetrahydrocortisone. The technique was used to analyze perfusate from the isolated human placental lobule for cortisol and its metabolites. Analytes were prepared from the perfusion medium using C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges. The internal standard for the analyses was 6 alpha-methylprednisolone. Chromatography was performed on a Novapak C18 column at ambient temperature using 53% methanol and 47% 10 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 4.0) as mobile phase, at a flow rate of 80 microL/min. A PE-SCIEX API III triple quadrupole instrument was used for mass spectrometric detection. An ionspray (pneumatically assisted electrospray) interface was used in negative and positive ionization mode. The assay was linear over the range 100-2000 micrograms/L for each analyte. The instrumental limit of detection was 50 pg. Assay imprecision at 400 and 800 micrograms/L was < or = 10% (total coefficient of variation). Accuracy ranged between 83.2% for 20 beta-dihydrocortisone to 102.6% for cortisone. Recovery of 1000 micrograms/L analyte ranged from 91.3% for cortisone to 109.7% for tetrahydrocortisol."

CD011053,0,22383171,0,The complex spectrum of forensic issues arising from obesity.,"The increasing numbers of obese and morbidly obese individuals in the community are having a direct effect on forensic facilities. In addition to having to install more robust equipment for handling large bodies, the quality of autopsy examinations may be reduced by the physical difficulties that arise in trying to position bodies correctly so that normal examinations can proceed. Accelerated putrefaction is often an added complication. Metabolic disturbances resulting from obesity increase susceptibility to a range of conditions that are associated with sudden and unexpected death, and surgery may have increased complications. The rates of a number of different malignancies, including lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma and multiple myeloma, and carcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, colon, gallbladder, thyroid, prostate, breast and endometrium, are increased. In addition, obese individuals have higher rates of diabetes mellitus, and sepsis. The unexpected collapse of an obese individual should raise the possibility of a wide range of conditions, many of which may be more difficult to demonstrate at autopsy than in an individual with a normal body mass index. Although sudden cardiac death due to cardiomegaly, pulmonary thromboembolism, or ischemic heart disease may be the most probable diagnosis in an unexpected collapse, the range of possible underlying conditions is extensive and often only determinable after full postmortem examination."
CD011053,0,21722954,0,Reduced uterine perfusion pressure model is not successful to mimic severe preeclampsia.,"The aim of the study was to investigate maternal (hemoglobin, hematocrit, and biochemical parameters of blood and urine) and fetal parameters (number and weight of alive fetus) of preeclampsia in a rat model. Placental oxidative stress markers (protein carbonyl, malondialdehyde) and placental antioxidant values (CuZn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase) were also measured. Preeclampsia was induced experimentally in timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats by using the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) model. Placental oxidative stress that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of placenta-related disorders, most notably preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were demonstrated by using RUPP model. On day 14 of gestation, silver clips were placed around the aorta below the renal arteries and on the left and right uterine arcade at the ovarian artery. In the RUPP model animals (n = 15), when compared with the normotensive controls (n = 15), arterial pressure on day 19 of gestation was significantly higher in the RUPP rats (151.7 ¬± 17.6 mmHg) than normal pregnant rats (113.9 ¬± 11.4 mmHg). The RUPP rats showed a significant increase in protein excretion when compared with the normal pregnant rats (0.3 ¬± 0.04 vs 0.47 ¬± 0.07 g/dL) (p < 0.05). Associated with the hypertension in RUPP rats, placental levels of malondialdehyde (2.4 ¬± 0.2 vs. 1.6 ¬± 0.2 umol/gm tissue) and protein carbonyl (1.4 ¬± 0.3 vs. 0.9 ¬± 0.3 nmol/mg protein) were increased, while superoxid dismutase (0.03 vs 0.42 U/mg protein) and glutathione peroxidase (1.04 ¬± 0.31 vs 0.76 ¬± 0.22 U/g protein) were decreased. Pup number (6.6 ¬± 3.1 vs. 9.93 ¬± 2.0) and litter weight (17.4 ¬± 7.7 vs. 22.9 ¬± 6.7 g) were lower in the preeclamptic group. None of the complete blood counts and biochemical values other than sodium and chlorine were significantly different in preeclamptic group. Our findings suggest that the RUPP model cannot mimic severe preeclampsia; however, further studies using different settings may be helpful to obtain a preeclampsia model that is capable of successfully producing severe preeclampsia findings."

Due to the advanced technology and the frequent use of ultrasonography these lesions are diagnosed more and more often. A female neonate was admitted to our hospital because of a progressive thrombocytopenia. Pregnancy was complicated by an autoimmune thrombocytopenia of the mother. While there were no remarkable findings on clinical presentation, a sonogram of the brain revealed an area of increased echogenicity in the midline which was interpreted as an intracerebral hemorrhage. In absence of any respective clinical signs a magnet-resonance-tomography of the brain was performed leading to the hypothesis of a lipoma of the corpus callosum (LCC) that could be verified by a densitometry in a cranial computer tomography (CT). Obviously, the initially performed sonogram was misinterpreted as an intracerebral hemorrhage due to the coincidence with the thrombocytopenia. At last the discrepancy of clinical and ultrasonographical findings led to the diagnosis by magnet-resonance-tomography and CT scan. Knowledge of the typical sonographic appearance of an LCC may be helpful for the differential diagnosis of this rare lesion even in fetal ultrasound."

CD011053,0,20347559,0,[Circulatory and respiratory problems in preeclampsia].,"The hemodynamic and cardiovascular changes seen during PE vary according to the natural history of the disease, its severity and eventual therapeutic measures taken. In the early stages of pregnancy, patients who will eventually develop PE, present with a blood pressure which even though within normal limits, is higher than in other women. Similarly, their cardiac output is higher with a normal or decreased peripheral vascular resistance. As soon as the clinical signs of the disease appear, the hemodynamic picture usually shifts toward that of a high peripheral resistance with low cardiac output. Sometimes however, a clinically hyperkinetic circulation may be demonstrated. In PE patients, cardiac preload pressures are usually normal even though the circulatory volumes are lower by 600 to 800 ml when compared to those found in normal pregnancy. The cardiac function is however usually preserved during PE. PE induces an exaggerated capillary permeability. This results in the worsening of the airway edema which may render the intubation very difficult. The increased capillary permeability contributes, among other factors, to the heightened risk of acute pulmonary edema. It is not justified to administer an anti-hypertensive treatment to PE women presenting with only moderate hypertension. An anti-hypertensive treatment must only be initiated whenever the hypertension is severe (i.e. SBP> or =160 mmHg and/or DBP> or =110 mmHg) in order to reduce the risk of maternal complications. In the absence of objective comparative data assessing anti-hypertensive agents for the PE patient, the choice of therapy relies predominantly on the practitioners' own experience. Systematic circulatory volume expansion has not been proven to improve the maternal nor the neonatal prognosis. Such treatment is to be reserved solely for situations in which correcting a hypo-volemia is absolutely necessary. The treatment of acute pulmonary edema in a PE patient is symptomatic and includes the administration of vasodilating agents and of diuretics. A benefit in setting-up an invasive monitoring of the pulmonary artery occlusive pressure has not been demonstrated. The sonographic surveillance of the hemodynamic state can however be useful in these circumstances."

We report the frequency and clinical correlations of abnormally coiled cords among 1329 cases referred to our placental pathology services. Twenty-one percent of cords were overcoiled and 13% were undercoiled. Abnormal cord coiling was seen at all gestational ages. Principal clinical correlations found in overcoiled cords were fetal demise (37%), fetal intolerance to labor (14%), intrauterine growth retardation (10%), and chorioamnionitis (10%). For undercoiled cords, the frequencies of these adverse outcomes were 29%, 21%, 15%, and 29%, respectively. Abnormal cord coiling was associated with thrombosis of chorionic plate vessels, umbilical venous thrombosis, and cord stenosis. Thus, abnormal cord coiling is a chronic state, established in early gestation, that may have chronic (growth retardation) and acute (fetal intolerance to labor and fetal demise) effects on fetal well-being. The cause of abnormal cord coiling is not known. Its effects on neurological status of survivors are also unknown. Antenatal detection of abnormal cord coil index by ultrasound could lead to elective delivery of fetuses at risk, thereby reducing the fetal death rate by about one-half. We recommend that the cord coil index become part of the routine placental pathology examination."
CD011053,0,20347556,0,[Liver and preeclampsia].,"HELLP syndrome complicates PE in 5 to 20 % of cases. The clinical manifestations (i.e. epigastric pain, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia and hemolysis) are secondary to the fibrin deposit within the peri-portal sinusoids. The clinical presentation of HELLP syndrome can be misleading. It is therefore necessary to suspect this complication whenever a PE patient develops gastro-intestinal pain. The interruption of pregnancy is the only effective treatment against HELLP syndrome. If it can be safely performed passed the 34(th) week of amenorrhea, a protective attitude should be adopted prior to reaching this date. This consists of the administration of corticosteroid therapy for fetal pulmonary maturation, intensive clinical, biological and sonographic monitoring of the mother's parameters. The administration of corticosteroids or performing a plasmapharesis is not recommended for the treatment of established HELLP syndrome because neither improves the maternal or neonatal outcome. The differential diagnosis may also include acute fatty liver of pregnancy. An early liver impairment, polyuria-polydipsia syndrome and a rise in INR support this diagnosis."

CD011053,0,2181652,0,[Doppler ultrasound findings in umbilical cord abnormalities. An in vivo model for clarifying resistance relations of the fetoplacental circulation].,"In cases with different umbilical cord anomalies the influence of foetoplacental resistance on the flow velocity wave forms is discussed. If there is no anastomosis between the two umbilical arteries, the end-diastolic flow velocities depend on the volume of the foetoplacental vessel tree, i.e. higher resistance indices (RI) are found in the arteria with the smaller placental area. If there is only one umbilical artery, the peripheral resistance is reduced to 50%, because the part of the placenta part belonging to this solitary umbilical artery is twofold compared to cases with two umbilical arteries. This leads to a higher perfusion pressure gradient with higher flow velocities and lower RI values, resulting in an underestimation of the foetoplacental resistance. In cases of thrombosis of chorionic membrane vessels or stem villi vessels, placental regions are excluded from the perfusion, followed by an increasing foetoplacental resistance in the same manner as it happens in slowly developing failures of villus maturation. This means that the presented cases of umbilical cord anomalies and function disorders of allantois vessels can be interpreted as an in-vivo model to show pressure and resistance parameters in foetoplacental circulation."

Chloroquine, quinine and pyrimethamine, administered after macrogametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum had been found in the blood smear, eliminated the parasites from the peripheral blood, but respiratory failure and treatment-resistant pneumonia occurred, leading to the adult respiratory distress syndrome (Morel stage 4). Because of threatened intrauterine death (resulting from premature placental separation during artificial ventilation) the child was delivered by an emergency section. Despite extensive conventional therapeutic measures the mother's respiratory state progressively deteriorated so that extracorporeal membrane CO2 elimination was instituted on the 17th day. First signs of improvement in respiratory functions were noted after six days. The extracorporeal CO2 elimination was discontinued after twelve days, because artificial ventilation could now be adequately controlled. The woman was gradually weaned from the ventilator and discharged home without symptoms after a total of 11 weeks in hospital. Her child has not shown any neurological symptoms."

CD011053,0,17950416,0,Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of possible neonatal sinovenous thrombosis.,"There are few data on magnetic resonance imaging findings in newborns for whom there is a concern for cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. The study objective was to document findings on magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance venography in cases of suspected neonatal sinovenous thrombosis. A retrospective search of the institutional database was performed to find neonates whose cranial computed tomography raised the suspicion for thrombus. Documented abnormalities were detected on magnetic resonance venography, diffusion-weighted imaging, and T(2)-weighted imaging. Of 15 neonates with suspicious computed tomography studies, 2 had a definite intraluminal clot in the deep venous system; the remainder showed decreased flow-related enhancement within the dural venous sinuses. In all these cases, the sinus was compressed by adjacent subdural hematoma or sutural diastasis. Of the 15 patients, 5 had parenchymal abnormalities (2 of these had definite intraluminal clot). Parenchymal abnormalities were classified as hemorrhage (3/5), cytotoxic edema (3/5), or vasogenic edema (1/5). Intraluminal clot in the newborn is more often identified in the deep than in the superficial venous system. With evidence of venous injury in the absence of identified thrombus, it is possible that either clots dissolve quickly, escaping detection, or that the superficial venous system is vulnerable to mechanical forces during delivery."
CD011053,0,12657506,0,Placental growth from the first to the second trimester of pregnancy in SGA-foetuses and pre-eclamptic pregnancies compared to normal foetuses.,"The aim of this study was to determine placental growth between 12-22 weeks in normal pregnancies compared to pregnancies complicated by foetal SGA and maternal pre-eclampsia (PE). The placentae of 1199 women were measured 3D sonographically at 12, 16 and 22 weeks of gestation. Placental volume growth was then calculated. Neonatal birthweight, birth centile and the occurrence of pre-eclampsia were recorded in every woman and correlated with placental growth (four groups: normals, SGA, PE, SGA+PE). SGA-placentae are already smaller at 12 weeks but then develop in a similar way to normal placentae. PE placentae are slightly, but significantly, larger at 12 weeks, grow rapidly until 16 weeks and then stop growing normally between 16 and 22 weeks. If SGA goes together with PE, both placental volume (PV) at 12 weeks as well as growth is reduced significantly. Nevertheless, placental growth between week 12 and 22 is too heterogeneous to justify using this method as a clinical tool, but it can provide new information on placental physiology underlying unfavourable obstetric outcomes."

CD011053,0,8710804,0,Short communication: the effect of mode of delivery on contractile function of placental arteries in vitro.,"This study was designed to determine the effect of the mode of delivery on the in vitro assessment of placental blood vessel function. Twenty-two subjects with uncomplicated pregnancies, normal antenatal Doppler flow velocity waveforms and normal birth weights were recruited for the study. The 11 subjects who were delivered by elective caesarean section were matched with 11 controls, who had uncomplicated labours and spontaneous vaginal delivery. Two tertiary chorionic plate arteries were dissected free 1 h after delivery and mounted in a myograph. Cumulative concentration response curves were constructed to the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619, prostaglandin F2 alpha and angiotensin II. After a period of 12 h a further two vessels were mounted and a concentration response curve to U46619 was repeated to determine whether a delay of several hours after delivery would have an effect on the responses of these vessels. These placental arteries constrict to U46619, prostaglandin F2 alpha and angiotensin II in a dose-dependent manner. There was no statistical difference in the maximum contractile responses or pD2 values between the different modes of delivery. A delay in dissection of up to 12 h had no effect on the maximum response or pD2 with U46619. Therefore, contractile function of placental arteries is unaffected by mode of delivery or a delay in dissection."

No significant improvement in the factors was observed after an intravenous or intraamniotic injection of vitamin K two to four days before the delivery. Vitamin K was injected intramuscularly into four foetuses in utero using an ultrasonic multitransducer scanner. Three of these infants had normal coagulation factors at birth.

The left kidney of one fetus was hyperechoic and enlarged with echoic streaks following the direction of interlobular veins and the loss of corticomedullary differentiation. In the following weeks, left kidney became smaller and echoic, and Doppler examination showed no flow in both artery and vein. The right kidney had totally normal appearance in the beginning, but it became enlarged and hyperechoic, and progressed into a small echoic kidney with no flow in artery and vein. In the postnatal ultrasound examination, both kidneys appeared hyperechoic with no vascularization in the hilum region. There was thrombosis in arteries and veins of both kidneys, as well as in the inferior vena cava.

EPO-alfa is erythropoietin manufactured by recombinant human DNA technology (rhEPO). After counseling, a pregnant woman with anti-Js(b) in her serum was started on rhEPO (600 U/Kg, biweekly) to prevent anemia secondary to serial donations of her blood for fetal transfusions. After a total of 25 rhEPO infusions and autologous donation of 8 units of whole blood, maternal hemoglobin prior to the elective cesarean section at 37 weeks was 11.3 gm/dL. Serum EPO concentration was determined in paired maternal and fetal blood samples, before ultrasound guided intravascular transfusions, in this alloimmunized Js(b)-negative and another Rh(D) alloimmunized pregnancy to determine possible correlations between maternal and fetal serum EPO. rhEPO prevented anemia in a patient who donated 8 units of blood from 18-37 weeks of pregnancy without inducing adverse biological effects such as hypertension or thrombotic complications in the placenta.

Treatment failures, even when IVIgG is used optimally, may result from product differences. Using an in vitro placental perfusion model there was significant inhibition of placental anti-D IgG transfer with three commercial IVIgG preparations where circulating maternal IgG concentrations were > 20 g/l. One IVIgG product, which was not inhibitory, had lower circulating IgG levels (16.5 +/- 0.9 g/l) and significantly reduced placental transfer of total IgG, suggesting that the reduced functional activity of IgG from IVIgG preparations may correlate with poor clinical efficacy."

CD011053,0,8928281,0,[Decline in cerebral thromboembolism among younger women after introduction of low-dose oral contraceptives. A study of the incidence for the period 1980-1995].,"The aim of this study was to analyze age specific incidence rates (IRs) of cerebral thromboembolic attacks (CTA) among women and men 15-44 years of age in Denmark from 1980 through 1993 and quantify possible influences from oral contraceptives (OC) on the incidence figures. The discharge diagnoses ICD 432-436 from all Danish neurological, neurosurgical and medical departments during the period 1980-1993 were identified in a central diagnosis register. The use of OC was achieved from complete sale statistics during the study period and cross-sectional studies assessing the type-specific use of OC at different ages. During the 14-year study period, 2100 female and 2552 male attacks were registered. Men had an exponentially increasing IR with increasing age. Compared with men in the period 1980-1986, women had more attacks in the 20-35-year age group and fewer attacks above the age of 35. After 1987 the sex differences below the age of 35 were not significant. From the first half (1980-1986) to the last half (1987-1993) of the study period, women below 30 years had a significantly falling CTA IR of -20.4%, compared with a nonsignificant fall of -9.5% among men below 30 years. In the age group above 30 years, women experienced a non significant increase of 4.2%, men a significant increase of 11.4%. Assuming that use of OC implied an average relative risk of CTA of 2.5 and pregnancy a relative risk of 4, a correction was made for the contribution of incident cases among women. The corrected IRs had a close co-variation with the IRs of men up to the age of 35. Thereafter, men had higher IR as is the case for older age groups. It is concluded that women's pregnancies and use of OC may explain the higher IRs of CTA in young fertile age compared to those of men. The more pronounced fall in IRs among young women compared with young men through the last 14 years may be a consequence of the reduced hormonal content of OC."

CD011053,0,8586956,0,[Pulmonary embolism and pregnancy: report of a case; review of the literature].,"Pulmonary embolism occurring during pregnancy is a rare accident but that still brings about a high mother mortality; it seems to be five to six times more frequent during the pregnancy and the post-partum than for non-parturient women who don't take any estro-progestogens, pulmonary embolism would involve complications for 0.5/1000 pregnancies before delivery. As it presents a lot of diagnostic problems, it is under-estimated. The vascular radiological examinations expose the foetus or embryo to considerable radiation and to a risk of foetal hypothyroidism leading to backwardness. The lung perfusion scanning has the advantage of not injecting iodine but is not specific. Fortunately, some medical examinations such as plethysmography or Doppler echography are safe and can also guide the clinician. As far as therapy is concerned, intravenous heparin is the first intention treatment, it can be replaced subsequently by subcutaneous heparin (low molecular weight heparin). In case of heavy pulmonary embolism endangering the vital prognosis of the patient, in case of clinical or biological resistance to the medical treatment, it could be necessary to perform a pulmonary embolectomy with, if necessary, vena cava interruption with insertion of a mechanical filter."

CD011053,0,18926376,0,Acquired hemophilia A associated with therapeutic cupping.,"Acquired hemophilia A is defined as the development of factor VIII inhibitors in a nonhemophilic patient. The inhibitors can develop in association with autoimmune disease, allergic drug reactions [1,2], malignancies [2], and pregnancy [3]. It is rare, but frequently complicated by severe bleeding and compartment syndrome [1,4]. Therapeutic cupping is a traditional remedy done by applying heated cup over the back and limbs to cause congestion. This procedure is mostly used by South Asian and Middle Eastern countries. We report a 58-year-old woman who presented with extensive and compressive bruising which led to pending compartment syndrome of her left thigh in 2 days after cupping. The coagulopathy was first considered owing to new-onset severe deep tissue bleeding. Acquired hemophilia A was diagnosed with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (83 seconds) and incorrectable mixing plasma test. Quantitative assays revealed reduced level of factor VIII (b0.1%) and the presence of factor VIII inhibitors (20 BU) in the serum. Fresh frozen plasma transfusion, coagulation factor supply, and immunosuppressive therapy with steroid began immediately after diagnosis was made. Her activated partial thromboplastin time was gradually normalized. She was discharged home with improving symptoms and minimized bruises 1 week later. To our knowledge, acquired hemophilia A associated with therapeutic cupping has never been mentioned before in the literature."
CD011053,0,1699823,0,Correlation of ultrasound and pathologic findings of placental anomalies in pregnancies with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein.,"Twenty pregnancies with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), a normal fetus and unusual or abnormal placental/cord sonographic features are reported. These include: (A) gigantic enlargement with multiple sonolucent spaces of different size and shape (n = 2; Swiss cheese); (B) placental masses of variable echogenicity (n = 5); (C) cord masses with central echo-dense zone and peripheral hypoechoic areas (n = 2); (D) enlarged placentas with patchy decrease of echogenicity (n = 6; jelly-like); and (E) large sonolucent spaces with turbulent blood flow surrounded by normal placental tissue (n = 5; placental lakes). After delivery, these ultrasound features were compared with pathologic findings. Diffuse mesenchymal hyperplasia of the stem villi were found in the gigantic placentas (n = 2). The placental masses corresponded to chorioangiomas (n = 3), infarct (n = 1) or subamniotic hematoma (n = 1) and the cord masses to angiomyxomas (n = 2). The 'jelly-like' placentas were related to subchorial thrombosis (n = 2), massive fibrin deposition (n = 1) or hypertrophy with no obvious abnormalities (n = 3). Large subchorial thrombosis (n = 2), or no obvious abnormalities (n = 3) were observed in placentas with large lakes. These findings suggest that a large range of placental and cord anomalies are associated with elevated MSAFP and are potentially diagnosable by routine sonographic examination at the time of AFP screening."

A cross sectional analysis was done based on the most recent visit to determine chronic venous diameter changes following DVT. Venous diameters in recanalized segments were smaller at all levels compared to those never occluded (p = 0.06 for CFV and p < 0.05 for SFV and PV). After accounting for a previous history of occlusion, the diameters of the segments with and without reflux were not significantly different. There was also no evidence of venodilation in segments caudal to cephalad reflux or thrombus. Recanalized veins are smaller in diameter than those which were never thrombosed. Cephalad thrombus or reflux is not associated with venodilatation of caudal segments. Reflux following DVT is probably secondary to valvular damage rather than hypertension, since there was no diameter difference between refluxing and non-refluxing segments."

Recently we encountered a 26-year-old woman suspected of pulmonary embolism of villotrophoblastic tissues after therapeutic abortion. Although her serum beta-hCG was low, a computed tomography scan showed multiple nodules in both lungs. Histological examination of a nodule in a lung-biopsy specimen showed granulation tissue surrounding a hemorrhagic mass within which were structures resembling degenerating chorionic villi. Immunohistochemical study on the patient's lung nodule, and a second endometrial-curettage specimen, six control endometrial and tubal specimens containing degenerating chorionic villi, and four endometrial specimens containing viable chorionic villi were performed. The patterns of immunostaining for cytokeratin, human chorionic gonadotropin, human placental lactogen, placental alkaline phosphatase, and inhibin-alpha of the chorionic villus-like structures in the lung nodule were almost identical to those in the degenerating chorionic villi, but different from those of viable villi.

Paired human umbilical veins were perfused at high/low shear stress (25/<4 dyn/cm(2)) at identical intraluminal pressure (20 mmHg) for 1.5, 3, or 6 hours in a computerized vascular model. High shear perfusion induced a significant, monophasic upregulation of PGS and TXS gene expressions after 6 hours. COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA showed a biphasic response with peaks at 1.5 and 6 hours, with a nadir level at 3 hours. Shear-induced gene expression was associated with a significantly greater accumulation of 6-keto prostaglandin F(1alpha) and TXA(2) in the perfusion medium. Thus, shear stress independently of perfusion pressure alters the expression of prostacyclin synthesis-related enzymes and the biosynthesis of their vasoactive metabolites."

Case report.,"There is a wide variety of disorders associated with thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), including infectious disease. noninfectious conditions such as vasculitis and hypercoagulable states, and complications arising from pregnancy or use of oral contraceptive medications. Despite these well-defined associations, approximately 25% of the cases remain idiopathic. In this article the authors describe a patient who was found to have SSS thrombosis while experiencing a thyrotoxic phase of Graves disease. The patient presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure, coma, a raised fibrinogen concentration, low protein C activity, and atrial fibrillations. Thrombolysis was successfully performed despite the coexistence of thrombosis and intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with thyrotoxicosis and a diffuse goiter may be predisposed to the development of SSS thrombosis, as a result of hypercoagulation and stasis of local venous blood flow.

These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that the systemic hypertension that occurs during reduced uteroplacental perfusion pressure is mediated by the prostaglandin system. Trained chronically instrumented pregnant dogs in the last third of gestation were studied. When uterine perfusion pressure was reduced to 60 mmHg for 60 min using an inflatable aortic occluder placed distal to the renal but proximal to the uterine and ovarian arteries, systemic arterial pressure increased from 95 +/- 5 to 110 +/- 7 mmHg. On another day in the same animals, the prostaglandin system was blocked with meclofenamate. Subsequent reduction of uterine arterial pressure caused no significant change in systemic pressure, from 96 +/- 4 to 99 +/- 6 mmHg, suggesting an important role for the prostaglandin system in mediating the normal response. In additional experiments, the thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 29,548 was given. Arterial pressure averaged 94 +/- 5 mmHg after administration of SQ 29,548 and did not change significantly when uterine perfusion pressure was reduced during SQ 29,548. These data suggest that at least one component of the prostaglandin system, thromboxane, contributes to the rise in systemic arterial pressure during reduced uteroplacental perfusion pressure."

In 13 cases, prosthetic valve thrombosis occurred in the first month after valve replacement. 18 patients were in functional class IV of the NYHA classification. Among the thrombosed prostheses, 91% were mechanical, and 61% in mitral position. Adequacy of anti-coagulation was the most important risk factor, as this treatment was inappropriate in 20 patients. In 10 other patients, it had been changed for medical (bleeding events, pregnancy) or surgical (non cardiac surgery) reasons. The perioperative mortality rate was high (32.4%). It was 12% in patients in functional class II and 46% in those in class IV (p < 0.05).

CD011053,0,1296206,0,Evidence for inhibition by endothelium-derived relaxing factor of thromboxane A2 receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the fetal vessels of the human perfused placenta.,"Three inhibitors of the release or effects of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), N-nitro-L-arginine, methylene blue and oxyhemoglobin, caused further increases in perfusion pressure during vascular constriction with submaximal concentrations of the thromboxane A2-mimetic, U46619 in fetal vessels of human placental lobules perfused in vitro. The results suggest the EDRF, released during constriction of fetal placental vessels in response to thromboxane A2 receptor stimulation, attenuates the vasoconstrictor response. Hence, impairment of EDRF release or function could contribute to the reduced placental blood flow observed in various disease states associated with increased thromboxane A2 production such as pre-eclampsia."

CD011053,0,11728652,0,Influence of magnesium sulphate and isradipine on human placental cotyledon fetal vessels in vitro.,"Increased systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure during pregnancy may be due to impaired prostacycline PGI(2)-thromboxan (TX) A(2) balance. The aim of the study was to compare the influence of magnesium sulphate and isradipine on the placental vascular resistance induced by stable thromboxan A(2) analogue U 46619 in experimental bilateral perfusion of the human placental cotyledon. The research used the experimental model described by Schneider et al. [Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 114 (1972) 822]. The control group consisted of six placental lobule perfusions lasting 120 min each. Constant increase in perfusion pressure of mean value 185% of the initial pressure was obtained from about the 60th min of the experiment and maintained till the end. Having obtained constant increase in perfusion pressure from the 60th min of the experiment, magnesium sulphate and isradipine were administered along with thromboxan A(2) analogue U 46619 into the fetal circulation. Both drugs lowered perfusion pressure, experimentally increased by thromboxan A(2) analogue U 46619. The onset of magnesium sulphate activity was quicker than isradipine. According to the results of our in vitro study, magnesium sulphate and isradipine may have a beneficial effect on vascular resistance of cotyledon vessels in PIH in vivo, too."

Pre-eclamptic (PE) transgenic rats (TGR) (hAngiotensinogen female x hRenin male) and non-PE reversely mated (RM) TGR rats were compared to normal Sprague-Dawley rats (C). Day 18 implantation sites were collected and the presence of endovascular trophoblast, fibrinoid, endothelial and smooth muscle cells were evaluated in spiral arteries in three parallel layers in the mesometrial triangle using an image analysis system (KS-400). In a separate group of animals peak-systolic and end-diastolic velocities were measured by Doppler in uterine and arcuate arteries, and the resistance indices (RI) were calculated. In PE and RM rats, the entire mesometrial triangle contained significantly more endovascular trophoblast and vascular fibrinoid deposits than the C group. No difference was found between the groups in the overall amount of smooth muscle surrounding the lumen, but in the PE and RM groups significantly more muscle was present in parts of the contours covered by trophoblast. There was significantly less CD31-positive endothelium in the total lumen contours of the PE and RM groups than in the C group, but in parts of the contours covered by trophoblast more residual endothelium was present in both TGR groups. Comparison of the three layers indicated deeper invasion in both the PE and RM groups than in the C group. By Doppler analysis of the proximal uterine artery the RI was found to be significantly lower in the PE and the RM group than in the C group. In the arcuate artery, the RI was significantly lower in the PE group as compared to the RM and C groups. We conclude that in this transgenic PE rat model there is deeper endovascular invasion of spiral arteries and decreased RI of uterine arteries at day 18 of pregnancy."

The pain, which radiated to the anterior aspect of the thigh, was associated with nausea and vomiting and was exacerbated by extension of the left lower extremity. The patient was hemodynamically stable, yet during the first 24 h of hospitalization a marked decrease in hematocrit from 29% to 22% occurred. Contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed an extensive abdominal-pelvic, retroperitoneal hematoma extending approximately 15 cm in length from above L5 cephalad to below the greater trochanter of the left femur caudally. The retroperitoneal hemorrhage self-tamponaded and did not require surgical management.

We induced CVST in rat by topical application of ferric chloride over the exposed superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and pathological changes were monitored on days 1, 2 and 7. Thrombus weight was estimated and H&E staining was performed for comparison with MRI data. T2 weighted signal changes were present in all the study group rats. T2 hyper intensity decreased over the time. In study group, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was decreased by 31.94% on day 1 compared to the controls. There was 15.5% increase in the ADC value on day 2 compared to day 1 which reached almost equal to control value on day 7. On histological evaluation, neuronal necrosis and cellular infiltration were observed in cortical region after thrombosis. The early decrease in ADC could be attributed to cytotoxic edema that precedes vasogenic edema indicated by normalization of ADC and a decreased T2 hyper intensity. In conclusion, ferric chloride induced CVST in the rat produces cytotoxic edema in early stage followed by vasogenic edema which is related to recanalization of the superior sagittal sinus."

Review of the original prenatal sonograms showed features suggestive of early closure of the foramen ovale. Homozygosity for the 5, 10 methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase mutation was shown only in the affected twin after the parents were found to be heterozygous for the mutation. The difference in outcome of the twins following prenatal treatment with beta mimetics and corticosteroids for preterm labor may be related to the added susceptibility factor for thromboembolism associated with presumed hyperhomocysteinemia in the proband which was not shared by the surviving healthy twin. The role of premature closure of the foramen ovale and prenatal treatment are discussed but remain uncertain."

CD011053,0,12105797,0,The natural history of venous thromboembolism: impact on ventilation/perfusion scan reporting.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are separate but related aspects of the same dynamic disease process known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Recent community studies have shown that VTE is a major health issue for the developed world, with at least 201,000 new cases each year in the United States, comprising 107,000 with DVT and 94,000 with PE. A quarter of PE cases die within 7 days, some so rapidly that treatment or intervention is impossible. Despite the availability of heparin prophylaxis, the annual incidence of VTE has remained constant at 1 event per 1,000 person-years since 1979 but reaches 1 event per 100 person-years for the over-85-year-olds. The most important risk factors for VTE are hemostatic and environmental. The recent discoveries of factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, and high concentrations of factor VIII have highlighted the increasing importance of a genetic predisposition to thrombophilia. Acquired hemostatic factors include pregnancy and the puerperium, oral contraception, hormone-replacement therapy, malignant tumors, and antiphospholipid syndromes. Important environmental risk factors include hospitalization with previous surgery or trauma, confinement in a care facility, neurologic disease or paraplegia after stroke, current or recent central venous catheter or transvenous pacemaker, and long airplane flights. Internists may be confused about the risk of PE after ventilation/perfusion (VQ) imaging. This may well arise from their use of the relative risk of PE after a low-probability category scan rather than the absolute risk obtained by incorporating the PE prevalence for their particular patient in the risk analysis. Ideally, personal communication with an experienced referring physician provides this clinical information for nuclear medicine. Diagnostic tools or checklists can be used as an alternative. A general knowledge of the natural history of VTE will encourage the nuclear medicine physician to provide an appropriate clinical signal to complement VQ categorical analysis. Combination of these 2 dynamic elements of the art and science of VQ scan reporting-the clinical pretest probability of PE and lung scan category-will permit an accurate prediction of the absolute risk of PE posttest."

The first case was discovered in a 21-year-old primigravida at 15 weeks gestation and thereafter six evacuation lumbar punctures were necessary, and a treatment by acetazolamide, 1000mg/day, was prescribed until parturition. Labor was induced at 37 weeks for intrauterine growth retardation associated with oligohydramnios. The second patient, a 38-year-old tertigravida primipara presented clinical signs of IIH at 28 weeks gestation in the context of preterm labour after a suicide attempt by massive ingestion of venlafaxine. She was given an evacuation lumbar puncture and went into labour at 29 weeks, after tocolysis failure. The diagnosis of IIH is to be done only by exclusion, in front of a normal biological composition of the spinal fluid at lumbar puncture with increased opening pressure, and after a brain imaging excluding any expansive intracranial process or hydrocephaly. Obstetrical prognosis is usually favourable. The main complication of this pathology resides in the ocular impact. Outside pregnancy the risk factors of IIH which have been evoked are polycystic ovary syndromes and blood coagulation anomalies as thrombophilia or hypofibrinolysis. Treatment of this pathology should be medical in the first instance and surgical only in the case of resistance or for severe ocular involvement."

CD011053,0,24395887,0,Inflammation in rat pregnancy inhibits spiral artery remodeling leading to fetal growth restriction and features of preeclampsia.,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) and preeclampsia (PE) are often associated with abnormal maternal inflammation, deficient spiral artery (SA) remodeling, and altered uteroplacental perfusion. Here, we provide evidence of a novel mechanistic link between abnormal maternal inflammation and the development of FGR with features of PE. Using a model in which pregnant rats are administered low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational days 13.5-16.5, we show that abnormal inflammation resulted in FGR mediated by tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF). Inflammation was also associated with deficient trophoblast invasion and SA remodeling, as well as with altered uteroplacental hemodynamics and placental nitrosative stress. Moreover, inflammation increased maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and was associated with renal structural alterations and proteinuria characteristic of PE. Finally, transdermal administration of the nitric oxide (NO) mimetic glyceryl trinitrate prevented altered uteroplacental perfusion, LPS-induced inflammation, placental nitrosative stress, renal structural and functional alterations, increase in MAP, and FGR. These findings demonstrate that maternal inflammation can lead to severe pregnancy complications via a mechanism that involves increased maternal levels of TNF. Our study provides a rationale for the use of antiinflammatory agents or NO-mimetics in the treatment and/or prevention of inflammation-associated pregnancy complications."

One hour later she gave birth spontaneously to a preterm infant in footling breech delivery. The infant did well neonatally. Streptokinase infusion was recommenced 8 h after delivery. Because of increasing blood loss on the second day after delivery, streptokinase was withdrawn after a total treatment time of 29 h. Total hemorrhage amounted to 8.9 litres. Serial perfusion lung scans showed complete resolution of the emboli and normal lung function was restored."

CD011053,0,18212351,0,The effect of a mast cell degranulating agent on vascular resistance in the human placental vascular bed and on the tone of isolated placental vessels.,"The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a mast cell degranulating agent, compound 48/80, on vascular resistance in the perfused human placenta and on the tone of isolated human chorionic vessels. Human placenta was obtained from term nonlaboring women undergoing cesarean delivery. Placental vascular bed perfusion pressure and isometric tension for segments of chorionic plate artery and vein were obtained in response to potassium chloride, compound 48/80, a mast cell stabilizer (cromolyn), and thromboxane A2 mimetic (U46619). Compound 48/80 significantly increased perfusion pressure in isolated human placental cotyledons. This effect was significantly potentiated further after induction of active vascular tone by thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619. Cromolyn significantly attenuated responses to compound 48/80 in these preparations. Compound 48/80 also significantly increased tone in isolated human chorionic artery and vein rings, and responses were abolished by cromolyn. In conclusion, degranulation of placental and intravascular mast cells by compound 48/80 leads to the release of vasoconstrictive substances. This could impair placental blood flow and result in growth restriction in fetuses of women with type l hypersensitivity reactions."
CD011053,0,15474764,0,Headaches in pregnancy.,"Migraine and TTH are primary headache disorders that occur commonly during pregnancy. Migraine sometimes occurs for the first time with pregnancy. The majority of migraineurs improve while pregnant; however, migraine often recurs post partum. Some disorders that produce, headache, such as stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, eclampsia, and SAH, occur more frequently during pregnancy. Diagnostic testing serves to exclude organic causes of headache, to confirm the diagnosis, and to establish a baseline before treatment. If neurodiagnostic testing is indicated, the study that provides the most information with the least fetal risk is the study of choice. Drugs commonly are used during pregnancy despite insufficient knowledge about their effects on the growing fetus. Most drugs are not teratogenic. Adverse effects, such as spontaneous abortion, developmental defects, and various postnatal effects, depend on the dosage and route of administration and the timing of the exposure relative to the period of fetal development. Although medication use should be limited, it is not absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. In migraine, the risk for status migrainosus may be greater than the potential risk of the medication used to treat the pregnant patient. Nonpharmacologic treatment is the ideal solution; however, analgesics, such as acetaminophen and narcotics, can be used ona limited basis. Preventive therapy is a last resort."

CD011053,0,17235001,0,Imaging of neurologic disorders associated with pregnancy and the postpartum period.,"Diverse pathologic conditions affect the central nervous system (CNS) and pituitary gland during pregnancy and the puerperium. Some are specific to the physiologic process of reproduction (eg, eclampsia, postpartum cerebral angiopathy, Sheehan syndrome, lymphocytic adenohypophysitis). Others are nonspecific but occur more often in pregnant women (eg, cerebral infarction, dural venous thrombosis, pituitary apoplexy). Recognition of the characteristic imaging findings in eclampsia, for example, may allow exclusion of other disorders. Even when imaging changes are nonspecific, knowledge of those entities associated with pregnancy and awareness of the increased likelihood of certain diseases in pregnancy will allow a more informed differential diagnosis. Differentiation of primary nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from aneurysmal SAH is an example. Moreover, earlier use of imaging will result in fewer delayed diagnoses. For example, magnetic resonance venography allows early diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis. Even when the imaging changes are less specific, knowledge of likely possibilities will lead to more appropriate earlier use of imaging. For example, the stimulatory effects of pregnancy on prolactinoma, meningioma, hemangioblastoma, vestibular schwannoma, and metastatic tumors such as breast cancer and choriocarcinoma suggest the early use of CNS imaging to avoid the consequences of a delayed diagnosis."

We studied the influence of endotoxin infusion at day 14 upon the vascular antithrombotic ADPase present in the labyrinth of the rat placenta just before term (day 21). Pregnant Wistar rats were infused with either endotoxin (1 microgram/kg body weight) or saline through permanent vena jugularis catheters and their placenta and kidneys were examined at day 21 using light electron microscopy and enzyme cytochemistry at the ultrastructural level. Also, placenta perfusion ex vivo was done using platelets and ADP to test the thrombotic tendency of placental vessels in endotoxin treated and control rats. The results show in both maternal as well as the fetal vessels of the placental labyrinth vascular occlusions and decreased membrane ADPase activity exclusively in endotoxin treated and not in saline infused pregnant animals. Alternate placenta and kidney perfusion ex vivo resulted in intraplacental and intraglomerular platelet aggregation again exclusively in endotoxin-treated rats. It is concluded that vascular ADPase may be affected by endotoxin due to the pregnant condition, resulting in a functional defect in antithrombotic potention which may promote intravascular formation of microthrombi in situ."

Risk factors are advance maternal age (> 30), multiparity, twin pregnancy, african origin, obesity, pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and prolonged tocolytic therapy. Treatment of acute phase is identical to usual treatment of acute systolic heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and VKA are contra indicated during pregnancy. After delivery, VKA treatment should be discussed in case of systolic function < 25 % because of higher risk of thrombus. Complete recovery of systolic function is observed in 50 % of the case.

The effect was independent of the method of administering the medicine and continued during the whole period of time examined. Values, with which an increased tendency toward hemorrhage could be expected, did not occur. The values possibly reflect an increased disaggregation of the thrombocytes.

The ""vanished"" twin is sometimes recognized as a fetus papyraceous (compressus) incorporated into the placenta of the survivor. Death of one twin later in pregnancy may have serious implications for the survivor, especially in cases of monochorionic twins. One postulated mechanism has been that thromboplastic proteins from the dead twin are transfused into the survivor's circulation, resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation. More recently it has been proposed that massive blood loss may occur from the survivor into the more relaxed circulation of a dead monochorionic twin through vascular anastomoses. These mechanisms may explain the higher frequency of cerebral palsy in monochorionic twins. These concepts emphasize the importance of careful examination and thoughtful interpretation of twin placentas."

Clinicians must be aware of which patients are at risk, as deep venous thrombosis is frequently asymptomatic. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism; therefore, objective tests are required. Venography is the gold standard test for deep venous thrombosis but is invasive. It has been superseded by less invasive tests such as compression ultrasound. This test, although not yet rigorously scrutinized in pregnancy, is now the first-line investigation. Where doubt remains, venography, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging have a role. Ventilation-perfusion scanning is the pivotal test for pulmonary thromboembolism for pregnancy, and it need not expose the fetus to excess radiation. If the results of this test are unclear, deep venous ultrasound can guide management of suspected pulmonary thromboembolism, thus avoiding pulmonary angiography."

A foetal or prenatal cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is defined as an ischaemic, thrombotic or arterial or venous haemorrhagic event that occurs between the 14th week of gestation and the onset of labour. PATIENTS AND METHODS. We report a retrospective study of a series of 10 patients suffering from a, presumably foetal, stroke that went unnoticed during the pregnancy and was diagnosed in the early infant stage. The symptoms and the age at which they were identified are highlighted. RESULTS. None of the 10 patients studied presented any relevant events in the mothers' medical history, but there were four threats of a preterm birth that were solved using the usual means and without the occurrence of any alterations that later affected the foetus. The studies that led to the diagnosis were carried out between the sixth and ninth months of life, and the reason for visiting was reported by the family as being a lower degree of mobility on one side of the body with respect to the other. Two patients presented thrombophilia. With a mean follow-up time of six years, all the patients have an associated infantile cerebral palsy, a third of them have epilepsy and 75% have learning difficulties or intellectual disability. CONCLUSIONS. When CVA are not detected in the prenatal period, it is important in primary care to look for and detect the warning signs of the psychomotor development of the infant at an early stage in order to begin a study of the case and to undertake rehabilitation as early as possible."

The discovery that beta 2GPI is the target antigen for the autoantibodies detected in solid-phase immunoassays has opened a number of areas of research linking these autoantibodies to atherogenesis and thrombus formation. Although the role of beta 2GPI in the regulation of blood coagulation in unclear, current evidence suggests that anti-beta 2GPI antibodies interfere with its ""normal"" role and appear to promote a procoagulant tendency. The expansion of research in this area and the diversity of the clinical manifestations of patients with APS have resulted in the inclusion of molecular biologists and pharmaceutical companies joining immunologists, hematologists, rheumatologists, obstetricians, neurologists, vascular surgeons, and protein and lipid biochemists in attempting to understand the pathophysiology of this condition. Although the published literature may result in conflicting results and introduce new controversies, developing standardized laboratory methods and extrapolation of in vitro experimental results to the vivo situation will advance our understanding of the regulation of the immune system and its interaction with normal hemostatic mechanisms. Since the authors' last review in 1991, the study and understanding of the pathophysiology of APS have evolved from lipid biochemistry to molecular techniques that may eventually provide specific therapies for the clinical manifestations of this condition. Although current treatment has improved the morbidity associated with this condition, especially in improving pregnancy outcomes, future therapies, as outlined in this review, may specifically address the biological abnormalities and have fewer side effects. Better diagnostic tools, such as magnetic resonance imaging with perfusion studies, will allow the study of the true incidence and prevalence of vascular flow changes/tissue ischemia and infarction associated with aPL antibodies and help determine treatment and prophylaxis for APS patients.

Venous thrombi were demonstrated in ovarian, iliofemoral, and inferior vena caval vessels. In six women with ovarian vein involvement and no evidence of iliofemoral thrombophlebitis, resolution followed intravenous antimicrobial therapy alone, and in three of these, resolution was confirmed by x-ray tomography. In contrast, three of five women with symptomatic iliofemoral thrombophlebitis had a prolonged febrile course despite antimicrobial and heparin therapy. The clinical courses of these 11 women were consistent with the observation that pelvic thrombophlebitis is associated with pelvic infection. Disease manifested within a few days after parturition was more likely due to ovarian vein involvement, whereas disease with later onset of symptoms was more likely due to iliofemoral thrombosis, with or without vena caval extension.

CD011053,0,22670579,0,Overestimation of umbilical cord coiling index with segmental versus total length assessment.,"The umbilical cord is the only communication between the fetus and the placenta and, not surprisingly, lesions or conditions affecting it may have detrimental effects in both. One important feature of the umbilical cord is its coiling index (UCI), with hypo- and hypercoiling being associated with fetal thrombotic vasculopathy, intolerance of labor, intrauterine growth restriction, cord stricture, thrombosis of cord and chorionic blood vessels, and fetal demise. It is essential that every placenta report include the UCI. The UCI could also be assessed prenatally, but there is currently no way of accurately assessing the entire length of the umbilical cord. The aim of this study was to compare UCI measured in a segment of cord 10 cm long (UCI-10) and over its total length (UCI-T). One hundred fifty consecutive placenta reports in which both measurements were recorded were retrieved from the files and analyzed. Gestational age ranged from 16 to 42 weeks, with a mean of 33.67 ¬± 5.96 weeks and a median of 36 weeks. Mean UCI-10 was 0.4360 ¬± 0.2625 coils/cm and mean UCI-T was 0.3530 ¬± 0.2022 coils/cm; the difference between these measurements was highly statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Counting the number of umbilical cord coils in 10 cm led to an overestimation of the UCI-T by 23.5%; it can be concluded, therefore, that the latter should be used."

The entry criteria were a fetal abdominal circumference < 10th per centile together with an umbilical artery Doppler systolic/diastolic ratio > 95th per centile between 28 and 36 weeks' gestation. Compliance was assessed by serial measurement of maternal serum thromboxane B2 levels. The mean gestational age at enrolment was 32 weeks and at delivery was 36 weeks. There were no differences between the 2 groups in gestational age at birth; birth-weight or birth-weight ratio; circumferences of the head, chest or abdomen; skin fold thicknesses; or neonatal morbidity. Low dose aspirin therapy did not alter Doppler systolic/diastolic ratios. After 14 days therapy, mean thromboxane B2 levels fell more than 80% from baseline values; 10.5% of women did not demonstrate biochemical confirmation of aspirin ingestion, despite verbal confirmation of compliance. We conclude that low dose aspirin therapy is not of benefit in the treatment of pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction and umbilical-placental insufficiency between 28 and 36 weeks' gestation."

We report a case of right atrial aneurysm which required an early management and its follow up during one year. The abnormality was detected at 32 weeks gravida during a systematic echography. At birth the newborn was asymptomatic but with the progressive increase of the aneurysm size shifting the heart and vessels and the occurrence of an intra-cardiac thrombus, a surgical management was decided at the age of one month. The resection of the aneurysm was therefore performed and no complication occurred during recovery. After one year the child remains healthy. The surgical indications are difficult to precise as the majority of these aneurysms are detected at an adult age. Surgical management appears to be essential in case of poor tolerance. The prognosis after surgery seems favorable."
CD011053,0,20121538,0,From monster to twin reversed arterial perfusion: a history of acardiac twins.,"A human being born without heart and head, i.e., the acardius/acranius malformation, has been described since antiquity. Superstition and fear made it a mystical disorder, a sign of God's wrath. The inquisition ruled that acranic infants should not be baptized and located the soul in the brain. Acardia was not associated with twin gestation until the reports of Mery in 1720 and Winslow in 1740. In 1850, Meckel identified the pathogenetic mechanism as reversed perfusion due to large arterio-arterial and veno-venous anastomoses; he believed the heart would fail to develop or arrest during development, and the acardiac fetus would be maintained by arterial perfusion from the pump twin. In 1859, Claudius articulated that after normal initial development, the heart degenerates when reversed flow in the aorta leads to thrombosis. Today, it is assumed that both mechanisms may exist. With the advent of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis and radiofrequency ablation of the acardiac twin's circulation, it became possible to save the pump twin."
CD011053,0,6661842,0,Thromboembolic complications of pregnancy.,"Physiologic changes in clotting parameters and venous flow during pregnancy increase the likelihood of deep venous thrombosis. Conditions that place the pregnant patient at a higher risk include a previous history of thromboembolic disease and surgery or bedrest for any reason during the pregnancy. In the high-risk patient, prophylactic therapy with low-dose heparin is advised beginning around the 34th week of pregnancy and continuing until 4-6 weeks after delivery. The clinical diagnosis of thrombophlebitis or pulmonary embolus is unreliable and should be confirmed objectively before therapy is started. During pregnancy, doppler ultrasound and impedance plethysmography should be the first-line diagnostic tests, but one should seek confirmation with venography if in doubt. The preferred method of therapy for the acute thrombolic event is full anticoagulation with continuous intravenous heparin from 7-10 days, followed by therapy with subcutaneous heparin for the remainder of the pregnancy and the puerperium, although there is considerable controversy regarding long-term therapy. Fibrinolytic agents have little place in pregnancy, and surgical therapy should be reserved for the critically ill patient only."

CD011053,0,18568986,0,Placental pathology in trap sequence: clinical and pathogenetic implications.,"Twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence (TRAP) resulting in an acardiac twin is a rare occurrence. Acardia requires the presence of arterial-arterial anastomosis, with retrograde perfusion of poorly oxygenated blood from the normal twin to the acardiac twin, venous-venous anastomosis carrying blood back from the acardiac to the normal twin, and circulatory failure of the acardiac twin. Although vascular anastomoses in cases of TRAP have been well described, there is little published literature on the microscopic changes in the placenta in TRAP sequence. We report a case of monochorionic monozygotic twins with an acardiac twin, large arterial-arterial anastomosis, and direct continuity of the umbilical cord veins. The placenta showed villous immaturity, striking villous calcifications, and extensive fetal thrombotic vasculopathy of the umbilical vein of the donor twin and the chorionic plate vessels. Thrombi in the umbilical vessels of the acardiac twin have been reported, and trombi in donor twin organs have been seen after fetal demise in utero. But to our knowledge there is no previously reported thrombi in the donor twin umbilical vessels or the chorionic plate veins. This may have implications not only as a possible factor in the etiology of TRAP, but also and more important as a possible risk factor for thrombotic events in the donor twin. Further studies with clinico-pathological correlation are needed to explore this issue."
CD011053,0,22647511,0,[A case of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation with a newly developed dural arteriovenous fistula after successful embolization].,We report a case of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) with a newly developed dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) subsequent to successful embolization. A male neonate diagnosed as VGAM with prenatal ultrasonography and MRI presented severe cardiac and respiratory failure soon after birth. Five sessions of transarterial embolization using NBCA were performed during the first 6 months of his life. The shunt flow was effectively reduced and heart failure was resolved after the treatment. Follow-up angiography performed 2.5 years after the last embolization revealed complete obliteration of VGAM and newly developed small dural AVF on the wall of the thrombosed falcorial sinus. We believe that the dural AVF in this case was caused by local venous hypertension or induction of angiogenic factor during the thrombosing process of VGAM.
CD011053,0,3078972,0,Venous thrombosis: the clinical problem.,"Although the exact cause of DVT is not known, venous thrombosis and its sequelae remain important clinical problems. Pulmonary embolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the hospitalized population, and the postthrombotic syndrome affects a large portion of the general population. While specific screening tests are not readily available to detect those patients who are likely to develop DVT, certain clinical risk factors have been identified that predispose to thrombosis. These groups include patients undergoing a wide variety of surgical procedures, patients with cardiac disease or cancer, pregnant or postpartum women, and individuals with previous history of DVT. The diagnosis of thrombosis is based on clinical findings and must be confirmed with appropriate laboratory tests. While contrast venography remains the gold standard, noninvasive tests have become increasingly more accurate. The recent use of real-time B-mode ultrasonic imaging and duplex sonography for the diagnoses of DVT has been shown to be efficacious. The postthrombotic syndrome with its associated chronic pain and ulcerations remains a significant clinical problem. The general diagnosis of this condition is readily made on clinical grounds in the advanced state. However, exact knowledge of the location and cause of the venous pathology can only be obtained using objective diagnostic tests. Older noninvasive and invasive tests may diagnose the presence of venous obstruction, valvular incompetence, and also may document venous hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011053,0,11373940,0,[Physiological cardiovascular adaptation in pregnancy--its significance for cardiac diseases].,"Stroke volume and heart rate rise at the very beginning of a pregnancy and decline after birth, over the course of months. Arterial blood pressure is lowered, plasma volume is increased while central venous pressure stays constant during pregnancy. The rise in cardiac output in early pregnancy can be induced quantitatively by oestrogen. The pregnancy-induced rise in cardiac output is based on the fairly general remodelling of the cardiovascular system. In a process of development, many portions of the cardiovascular system undergo programmed dilation (expansion): There is a programmed dilation of the heart, of the aorta, of the resistance vessels of the kidney and the resistance vessels of the placenta, and a programmed dilation of the venous system. All the changes favour the perfusion of the pregnant body. Cardiac dilation increases directly stroke volume, aortic dilation increases the susceptance (Windkessel function) of the aorta, the peripheral dilation increases the vascular conductance, and the venous dilation raises blood volume. Since the vascular conductance increase by peripheral dilation is higher than the increase in stroke volume, arterial pressure drops and evokes, via the baroreceptor reflex, an increase in heart rate; the increase in cardiac output occurs to an equal extent by an increase in stroke volume and an increase in heart rate. Compression of the caval vein by the pregnant uterus increases peripheral venous pressure and possibly slows down blood flow in the limbs. Increase in cardiac output means a burden for the heart, especially when associated with increase in heart rate. In this condition, cardiac energy expenditure is increased while oxygen supply is decreased. The rise in energy expenditure by an increase in flow rate is especially high for turbulent flow conditions at stenotic valves. In addition, there is an increased risk of arterial rupture by arterial remodelling and an increased risk of thrombosis by deceleration of venous blood flow velocity. Thus, the cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy means an increased cardiovascular risk which may, on the basis of a basic cardiac disease, lead to cardiac failure."

CD011053,0,3064415,0,Management of alloimmune neonatal and antenatal thrombocytopenia.,Neonatal and antenatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is induced by maternal antibodies against platelet-specific fetal antigens. This disease is rare but potentially severe because of intracranial bleedings which may occur during pregnancy or around birth. In the last decade our knowledge of this disorder has markedly advanced. New techniques are used in platelet immunology. New platelet antigens involved in these perinatal thrombocytopenias have recently been discovered. A group of women likely to produce the responsible platelet antibodies has been genetically defined as regards the PLA1 antigen. The quality of the sonographies and the possibility of performing cord vein puncture in early pregnancy afford a new approach in the management of perinatal alloimmune thrombocytopenias. But more must be done to prevent the complications of this disease.
CD011053,0,23208954,0,Novel ADAMTS13 mutations in an obstetric patient with Upshaw-Schulman syndrome.,"Upshaw-Schulman syndrome (USS) is a rarely reported congenital form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) that results from mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. Many USS patients are diagnosed during the second or third trimester of their first pregnancy. We present a patient diagnosed with USS following retinal detachments and intrauterine fetal demise at 34 weeks of gestation. The patient's plasma was tested for ADAMTS13 activity, inhibitor, and antibody. Subsequently, she and her first-degree relatives had ADAMTS13 gene sequencing. Initially, the patient was found to have an ADAMTS13 activity of <5% in the absence of an ADAMTS13 inhibitor (FRETS assay) or antibody (immunoassay). Repeat studies in the months following hospital discharge showed persistent, undetectable ADAMTS13 activity and she was given a clinical diagnosis of USS. Molecular sequencing demonstrated two novel missense mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene: one in the maternal exon 17 (p.Ala690Thr due to nucleotide substitution c.2068 G>A) and another in the paternal exon 22 (p.Arg915Cys due to nucleotide substitution c.2746 C>T). In addition to being compound heterozygous for two ADAMTS13 mutations, the patient also had two maternally inherited single nucleotide polymorphisms: p.P618A (exon 16) and p.A732V (exon 18). Her parents and only sister had normal or near-normal ADAMTS13 activity. Each was heterozygous for one of the novel missense mutations. This case highlights the importance of molecular analysis of the ADAMTS13 gene in patients and family members when the severe ADAMTS13 deficiency does not appear to be autoimmune in nature."
CD011053,0,23841663,0,Relationship between placental grade and mean platelet volume.,"This study was performed to investigate the correlation between mean platelet volume, as an indicator of thrombocyte function, and placental grade classified by the Grannum scoring system. Placental sonographic images were graded according to the Grannum scoring system, and synchronous haemogram samples were taken from patients who attended foetal assessments during the second and third trimesters. A total of 75 patients were in their second trimester, and 40 patients were in their third trimester. The relation between week of pregnancy and placental Grannum score was significant (p<0.001); i.e. placental Grannum score increased with gestational age. The association between Grannum score and mean platelet volume was analysed, including trimester and mean platelet volume, by linear regression analysis. The results indicated a distinct trimester-independent correlation between mean platelet volume and Grannum score (partial correlation coefficient=0.455; p<0.001). However, no correlation was observed between Grannum score and gravity (r=0.87; p=0.356), parity (r=0.97; p=0.302) or abortion (r=0.011; p=0.91). The correlation between mean platelet volume and placental calcification was investigated, and mean platelet volume in patients with a calcified placenta was 8.23 ¬± 1.14, whereas mean platelet volume in placentas with no calcification was 7.92 ¬± 1.18 (p=0.233). Mean platelet volume was an independent indicator of Grannum score, which is an indicator of placental grade, in women in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Assessing mean platelet volume during routine screening may identify functional placental disorders."

CD011053,0,19274539,0,D-dimers as a screening test for venous thromboembolism in pregnancy: is it of any use?,"In non-pregnant women, D-dimers are used successfully to aid diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolus (PE), as they have high sensitivity, moderate specificity and high negative predictive value. However, D-dimer levels are physiologically raised in pregnancy and thus overlap the values normally associated with PE. The aim of this retrospective study therefore was to investigate the use of D-dimer levels as a screening test for suspected PE in pregnancy and to determine if a negative D-dimer level could exclude the diagnosis in pregnant women. A total of 37 women suspected of PE had both ventilation perfusion (VQ) scans and D-dimer levels performed. Thirteen were reported as having a low probability of PE following VQ scan, while 24 were thought to have a moderate or high probability of PE. Women who had a low probability of PE following VQ scanning were found to have D-dimer levels ranging from 0.25-2.2 mg/l, while women who had a high probability of PE following scanning had D-dimer levels ranging from 0.31-1.74 mg/l. The sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer as a test for suspected PE in pregnancy was calculated to be 0.73 and 0.15 respectively, while the negative likelihood ratio was 1.8. Current guidelines advocate the use of a negative D-dimer result to exclude the diagnosis of PE in pregnancy. However, this study suggests that D-dimer testing in pregnancy has a high negative likelihood ratio and should not be used. Larger prospective observational studies are required to collaborate the findings from this study."
CD011053,0,12198588,0,[Prevention of pre-eclampsia by low-dose acetylsalicylic acid--a critical appraisal].,"Pre-eclampsia has been shown to be associated with platelet activation and excessive release of vasoconstricting thromboxane preceding the onset of the disease. Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) substantially inhibits thromboxane formation and may thus prevent pre-eclampsia from developing. In agreement with this hypothesis early randomised trials reported on promising reductions in pre-eclampsia risk and possible fetal growth retardation. Subsequent multicentre trials during the nineties failed to confirm a large benefit, which may in part be explained by late initiation of treatment, low dosages, low patient compliance and wide inclusion of women with concomitant disorders such as chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and kidney disease. A recent systematic review of all randomised trials showed an acceptable safety profile and a significant but only moderate reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia regardless of gestation at trial entry or dose of ASA. There is now growing evidence that the earlier ASA treatment is started, the greater the reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia is. Moreover, ASA has much stronger effects at higher (80 - 150 mg/day) than at lower doses in the protection against pre-eclampsia and the prevention of severe fetal growth retardation. No clinically important effects, however, have been found in patients with chronic hypertension, kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. In contrast, low dose ASA (100 mg/day) might benefit women with unfavourable obstetric history, in particular those with severe fetal growth retardation or pre-eclampsia with onset at < 32 weeks. The crucial time for starting treatment may be before 16 weeks and daily ingestion before bedtime appears useful. To start low-dose ASA at 20 - 24 weeks gestation seems only justified in women with abnormal uterine Doppler flow."

All the same there are certain complications that can occur as the haematological state is concerned (thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects such as bleeding, particularly post-partum from the genital organs).

On the basis of this experience, we developed a computer-assisted procedure for determining the volume to be transfused, which provides an adequate final concentration. Fetal weight was estimated using ultrasound measurements. Fetoplacental blood volume was estimated from the regression line: fetoplacental volume (ml) = 1.046 + fetal weight (g) X 0.14. The volume to be transfused was calculated using the simple dilution formula: Vtransfused = Vfetoplacental.(Cfinal - Cinitial)/Ctransfused where C is the hematocrit or platelet count. The entire procedure is computerized, simple and rapid, and avoids resorting to repeated intermediate sampling. The dilution formula used appears to be more reliable than a formula taking into account the volume added, even in erythroblastosis fetalis where relatively large volumes are injected. This suggests rapid plasma loss during the procedure."

CD011053,0,12871278,0,Management of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.,"The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) probably increases 2-4-fold in pregnancy and is higher after a caesarean section than after vaginal delivery. Management of VTE in pregnancy is challenging. Many diagnostic tests are less accurate in pregnant than in non-pregnant patients and some radiologic procedures expose the fetus to ionizing radiation, although this can be reduced by taking appropriate precautions. Compression ultrasonography (CUS) is the test of choice for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), whereas for PE, V/Q lung scan is the first-line test, followed by CUS if the results are non-diagnostic. Anticoagulants that have been evaluated for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pregnancy include heparin and heparin compounds, and coumarin derivatives. When determining the optimal treatment regimens, it is important to consider: (i) the safety of the drug for the fetus and mother; (ii) the efficacy of the regimen; and (iii) the dose regimens for acute and secondary treatment, and during delivery and postpartum. Heparins are safer than coumarins for the fetus, as they do not cross the placental barrier. Heparins, particularly unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) tend also to be safer for the mother than other compounds. Of the two, LMWHs, although more expensive, are associated with lower rates of bleeding complications, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis, than UFH, and should therefore be the treatment of choice in VTE during pregnancy. Patients with prior VTE or a hypercoagulable state have an increased risk of VTE during pregnancy. Depending on the presence of one or both of these factors, clinical surveillance, with anticoagulant treatment where necessary, is recommended."

Because pregnant women were excluded from many clinical trials, clear treatment guidance for them is not shown in the package inserts or guidelines of many drugs. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) who developed sudden onset of left visual field defect, left hemiparesis, and dysesthesia over the left forearm during her fourth month of pregnancy. Brain diffusion-weighted MRI showed high intensity areas in the right occipital lobe, and magnetic resonance angiography revealed an occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery. She was treated with an intravenous injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator 2 h 55 min after symptom onset, and the visual field and sensorimotor deficits improved. MRA obtained 3 days after the onset showed recanalization of the right posterior cerebral artery. We also conducted electrocardiography, neck vascular ultrasound, cardiovascular ultrasound, transcranial Doppler recordings from the temple area, and laboratory examinations for complete blood count, biochemistry, coagulation factors, endocrine secretion, and autoantibodies. Reduced protein S activity (35%) along with high intensity transient signals on transcranial Doppler indicated microemboli to be the embolic source. All other tests were negative. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated to prevent recurrence. She was initially given intravenous heparin, and then switched to warfarin therapy at 15 weeks of gestation. The patient delivered a healthy infant via caesarean section.

CD011053,0,12871274,0,Magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging.,"As blood clots it goes through predictable stages that reflect the oxygenation state of hemoglobin within the red cells.

This substance acts an endogenous contrast agent when imaged using a T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequence (Magnetic Resonance Direct Thrombus Imaging, MRDTI) - appearing as high signal. MRDTI can therefore be used to detect subacute thrombosis. This technique has been applied in a number of clinical settings arising as a result of thrombosis. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are both readily detected using MRDTI, providing a single imaging modality for the detection of venous thromboembolic disease. The technique is also effective in the peripheral arterial tree. Furthermore, thrombosis within vessel wall atherosclerosis is a marker of vulnerable plaque likely to produce symptoms. The MRDTI technique has thus proved useful in identifying complicated plaque in the carotid arteries in the setting of transient and permanent cerebral ischemia. MRDTI therefore holds promise as a technique that is capable of detecting high risk vessel wall disease prior to significant or permanent end organ damage. Because of the non-invasive nature of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), application of MRDTI in the research setting for the monitoring of therapeutic interventions in a wide number of settings within vascular disease is very appealing."

At our serving the entire Osaka Prefecture, infants suffering from birth asphyxia with severe perinatal brain damage were found to have CT findings distinguishable from those of GMH. We report three asphyxiated newborn infant who had hemorrhagic infarction in bilateral caudate nucleus, striatum and thalamus on the CT scan. Reports of similar findings are rare, and ours is the first serial observation of such CT scan image in newborn infants. The mechanism of development and pathology of this pathological condition have been variously argued as pathophysiology of GMH. The present study lacks postmortem examination, however, the findings in serial CT scans in three infants and review of the literatures related to the pathology of neonatal asphyxia indicate the following course. The thrombosis in the internal cerebral veins led to severe swelling of the brain, and hemorrhage occurred with the reduction in the swelling, eventually resulting in diffuse leukomalacia. Etat marbr√© (status marmoratus), mentioned earlier, is considered to represent a milder stage of this pathologic course.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The true in utero incidence of DAA is unknown, as most affected fetuses are asymptomatic at birth. Potential complications include thromboembolism, rupture, and death. We report a unique lethal case of a large DAA detected by mid-2nd trimester fetal echocardiography, complicated by stricture and massive occlusive thrombosis extending into the pulmonary artery branches. Stricture and thrombosis of the DAA led to interruption of fetal circulation, cardiac failure, and fetal hydrops, ultimately resulting in fetal demise."

CD011053,0,24773309,0,How do we treat fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia?,"Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a potentially devastating disease, seen in one in 800 to 1000 neonates. FNAIT is the most common cause of early-onset isolated severe neonatal thrombocytopenia in maternity wards. The complication of this disorder most to be feared is intracranial hemorrhage, leading to death or to neurologic sequels. As there is no systematic screening of at-risk pregnancies, FNAIT is often discovered when signs of bleeding are observed during pregnancy or at delivery. Platelet transfusion is required in case of bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia (<30‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10(9) /L) during the 48-hour-postdelivery period. Diagnosis of alloimmunization is important for management of the index case and for subsequent pregnancies, due to the increasing severity of this syndrome as it recurs. Noninvasive antenatal therapy is based on maternal perfusion of intravenous immunoglobulins and risk stratification. In our experience, the addition of corticoids during the last trimester significantly improves the efficiency of treatment. Follow-up of antibody concentration during pregnancy may constitute a useful variable for therapy effectiveness."

CD011053,0,19596611,0,Urgent care in gynaecology: resuscitation and management of sepsis and acute blood loss.,"Sepsis and/or acute blood loss can be encoutered as an emergency condition in gynaecology, especially in women with ectopic pregnancy/miscarriage, acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)/tuboovarian abscesses, post-puerperal sepsis/haemorrhage and even in postoperative scenarios. If underestimated or suboptimally treated, both can lead to an inadequate tissue perfusion (defined as shock) and the development of multi-organ failure. Morbidity and mortality after development of one of the shock syndromes (septic or haemorrhagic) correlates directly with the duration and severity of the malperfusion. The patient's prognosis depends on a prompt diagnosis of the presence of shock and immediate resuscitation to predefined physiological end-points, often before the cause of the shock has been identified. In septic shock, hypotension is primarily treated with fluid administration and eventually vasopressors, if required, in order to improve the circulation. Timely administration of antibiotics, control of infectious foci, appropriate use of corticoids and recombinant human activated protein C, tight glucose control, prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention complete the therapy of septic shock. In haemorrhagic shock, the treatment primarily involves controlling haemorrhage, reversal of possible coagulopathy and administration of sufficient volumes of fluids and blood products to restore normal tissue perfusion."
CD011053,0,14615562,0,Thrombotic and nonthrombotic pulmonary arterial embolism: spectrum of imaging findings.,"Along with clinical examination and laboratory tests, imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Multi-detector row helical computed tomography (CT) is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) owing to its capacity to directly show emboli as intravascular filling defects. Although parenchymal abnormalities at CT are nonspecific for acute PTE, they may contribute to a correct diagnosis of chronic PTE, the characteristic helical CT features of which are similar to its angiographic features and include webs or bands, intimal irregularities, abrupt narrowing or complete obstruction of the pulmonary arteries, and ""pouching defect."" Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism is an uncommon condition but is sometimes associated with specific imaging findings, including discrete nodules with cavitation (septic embolism), widespread homogeneous and heterogeneous areas of increased opacity or attenuation that typically appear 12-24 hours after trauma (fat embolism), and fine miliary nodules that subsequently coalesce into large areas of increased opacity or attenuation (talcosis). Knowledge of appropriate imaging methods and familiarity with the specific imaging features of pulmonary embolism should facilitate prompt, effective diagnosis."
CD011053,0,19587586,0,New observations in postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis: experience of single center.,"The diagnosis of postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis (POVT) has become more accurate since the introduction of modern imaging techniques. We performed a prospective study at a single Medical Center in order to define the incidence and risk factors for POVT. Thirteen consecutive women with POVT were enrolled during a period of 4 years. Each participant underwent a computerized tomography scan for diagnosis followed by a profile for congenital and acquired thrombophilia. A detailed history of pregnancy, labor and state after delivery was obtained within 2 days of diagnosis while the patient was still hospitalized. The incidence of POVT was four of 30,749 vaginal deliveries, nine of 9604 cesarean deliveries and six of 906 twin deliveries by cesarean section. The odds ratio for developing POVT was 21.37 for twin delivery versus singleton and 7.2 for cesarean section versus vaginal delivery. Of the 13 women with POVT, infection was found in seven women (53%) and other clinical risk factors in four (30%). Only three (23%) participants were found to have thrombophilia and one developed POVT while on enoxaparin treatment. Our results suggest that the risk for maternal POVT is increased by cesarean section delivery of twins. It appears that investigations for thrombophilia are unnecessary when POVT is the sole manifestation of thrombosis."
CD011053,0,7053592,0,Thrombectomy and arteriovenous fistula for iliofemoral venous thrombosis in fertile women.,"Thirteen women of fertile age with left-sided iliofemoral venous thrombosis were treated with thrombectomy and a temporary arteriovenous fistula in the groin. In nine patients, the appearance of thrombosis could be related to pregnancy; in three of these, obstetric complications occurred. Diagnosis was obtained by antegrade and retrograde phlebography. After three months, the arteriovenous fistula was closed. Anticoagulant treatment was given from the time of diagnosis and for a total of six months. Patency of the iliac vein was determined by phlebography or venous occlusion plethysmography, or both. Based upon these findings, a short term patency rate of 85 per cent was achieved. Analysis of the material indicates a multifactorial pathogenic mechanism in the development of iliofemoral venous thrombosis. Important factors are pregnancy, obstetric complications, mechanical factors causing flow resistance in the iliac vein, hormonal factors and defective fibrinolysis."

Computed tomography of the liver showed a right hepatic abnormality that on magnetic resonance imaging had the appearance of hemorrhage; partial thrombosis of the right hepatic vein extending to the inferior vena cava was also seen. Anticoagulation was begun and the patient completely recovered; follow-up imaging 8 months later was normal. This case suggests that nonfatal forms of Budd-Chiari syndrome may complicate pre-eclampsia; predisposition to partial venous outflow obstruction in the pre-eclamptic patient may be pathogenetically related to disseminated intravascular coagulation. This entity may be clinically confused with, or misdiagnosed as, spontaneous hepatic hemorrhage, with or without capsular rupture. In such circumstances, magnetic resonance may be diagnostically useful."

Although oral or systemic anticoagulation therapy may minimize thrombus propagation, it remains ineffective in removing thrombus burden and consequently does not prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. A novel technique, ultrasound accelerated catheter directed thrombolysis (UACDT), has been developed to rapidly and completely resolve thrombus.

Factor V Leiden is one of the most frequent thrombophilic mutations. A high prevalence of this mutation has recently been reported in a group of 21 German women with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. In this respect, we studied the prevalence of factor V Leiden in 18 women who were consecutively diagnosed at our Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology as having HELLP syndrome, between 1995 and 1999. Women were tested either at the time of diagnosis or months or years after delivery for coagulation parameters, protein C (PC), protein S (PS), antithrombin III, lupus-like anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), activated protein C (APC) resistance and detection of the G1691A mutation (factor V Leiden). In all women, the parameters studied were normal and in none of the investigated cases was the G1691A mutation found. HELLP being a severe form of preeclampsia, we think that the reported association between factor V Leiden and HELLP may reflect the well-known association with preeclampsia."
CD011053,0,10708244,0,Neonatal thrombocytopenia induced by maternal anti-HLA antibodies: a potential side effect of allogenic leukocyte immunization for unexplained recurrent aborters.,"Allogenic leukocyte immunization is one of several treatments tried for unexplained recurrent aborters, and is reported to have few maternal and neonatal side effects after the immunotherapy having been reported to date. In the present study, we report a rare case of neonatal thrombocytopenia (41000 cells/microl) observed in a female infant delivered by an unexplained habitual aborter. The mother was immunized with her husband's leukocytes once before pregnancy and twice at the 5th and 6th week of her successful pregnancy. Serological studies using mixed passive hemagglutination assays (MPHA) showed that maternal serum did not contain any antibodies which were reactive to 11 platelet-specific antigens, or to granulocyte antigens extracted from 9 persons. Lymphocyte cytotoxicity tests, however, showed that maternal serum but not infant serum had anti-HLA antibodies against both paternal and infant lymphocytes. Moreover, the maternal serum was found to have anti-HLA IgGs against platelet antigens extracted from the father and the infant. It is highly likely that this case of neonatal thrombocytopenia was caused by transplacental perfusion of maternal anti-HLA antibodies whose production was induced or enhanced by the allogenic leukocytes immunizations."
CD011053,0,22863273,0,Haemorrhagic strokes in pregnancy and puerperium.,"There is an increased risk of strokes in pregnancy and puerperium. Intracranial haemorrhage is the rarer of the two stroke subtypes but carries a greater morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the child. This review highlights the causes of pregnancy-related intracranial haemorrhage and its management. The incidence varies from region to region with the highest being reported from China and Taiwan. Majority of these haemorrhages are secondary to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with smaller proportions related to aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation rupture. A small but important contributor is cortical venous thrombosis which, although predominantly gives rise to ischaemic lesions, may lead to parenchymal haemorrhages as well. Presentation is usually with headaches or seizures, with or without focal deficits. Diagnosis requires brain imaging with computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and the necessity of investigation when this diagnosis is suspected supersedes the small risk of fetal malformation. Management follows the general management principles for intracranial haemorrhage management. Blood pressures need to be strictly monitored and medicines used for controlling them may differ slightly due to teratogenic effects. For preeclampsia, early but safe delivery is the best treatment. For cortical venous thrombosis, low-molecular-weight heparin is the preferred agent. Aneurysms and vascular malformations need to be definitively treated to prevent re-bleed and this can be achieved through surgical or endovascular procedures. The timing of surgery depends on neurosurgical considerations. However, the timing and mode of delivery are governed by obstetric factors. Risk of future haemorrhage depends on whether the underlying aetiology can be and has been definitively treated."

The aim of this study was to analyze the demographic, semiology, etiology, radiological findings, therapeutic response and outcome of EPC. This is a retrospective analysis of 76 patients (M:F: 46:30; mean age: 30.2+/-23.4 years; median age: 26 years) evaluated at our center over last 14 years. Twenty-three subjects (30.3%) had epilepsy for a mean of 25.8+/-52.3 months (range: 1-81 years; median: 14) before developing EPC and in half of them, seizures were controlled with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Rest 53 (69.3%) manifested as de novo. The mean duration of EPC was 47.02+/-188.2 days (range: 1h to 48 months; median: 3 days). One patient of generalized convulsive SE (GCSE) evolved into EPC while five patients of EPC evolved into GCSE. CT scan of brain (n-76) was abnormal in 53 (69.7%) while all the 11 MRI scans which were available were abnormal. EEG (n-21) was abnormal in all but one, however it was non-specific in 7. The diagnoses were-idiopathic: 17, ischemic stroke: 15, meningo-encephalitis: 8, Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE): 7, granuloma: 6, diabetic-non-ketotic-hyperosmolar-coma (DNKHC): 6, CNS malignancies (primary/secondary): 4, birth injury: 4, cerebral venous thrombosis: 3, CNS tuberculosis: 2, and cerebritis, HIV-related, toxemia of pregnancy, and MERRF one each. Patients of >40 years (n=21) had stroke (10), idiopathic (6), DNKHC (4) and metastasis (1) as common causes. Only 12 of them received single AED, while others required 2 or more AEDs to control the seizures. The outcome (n=72) was-controlled: 43 (59.7%); uncontrolled: 26 (36.1%) (RE: 7, idiopathic: 5, birth injury: 4, encephalitis: 3, malignancy: 2, granuloma and MERRF: 1 each) and three patients succumbed (encephalitis: 2, idiopathic: 1). Causes of EPC are varied and it depends on age. Underlying cause determined the outcome and could be refractory in RE, idiopathic, and when associated with birth injury, malignancy and encephalitis.

CD011053,0,3584865,0,[Autoimmune thrombocytopenia and pregnancy].,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an auto-immune disease that carries a risk of haemorrhage when the number of platelets drops to lower than 50 X 10(9)/l and particularly when the bleeding time is prolonged. Thrombocytopenic purpura and pregnancy can be associated with one another and the frequency of that is about 1/5000. Maternal mortality and morbidity are, however, practically nil when proper therapeutic measures are taken. Since 1981 IG IV, which is expensive but rapidly effective, is available to overcome corticotherapeutic failures and to avoid splenectomy in acute cases. Since the maternal anti-platelet factor can cross the placenta, the fetus may become thrombocytopenic like the mother and at risk of the complications of haemorrhage and particularly intra-cranial haemorrhage during delivery vaginally. Screening for fetuses that are affected (52% of the cases) is now possible, not by relying on the maternal platelet count, which is without any prognostic value for the fetus, nor on the levels of anti-platelet antibodies but on the use of examining fetal scalp capillary blood at the onset of labour. This test may make it possible to carry out a vaginal delivery safely when the fetal platelet count is higher than 50 X 10(9)l, whereas if it is lower than this figure a prophylactic caesarean operation should be carried out. There is much promise in the possibility of sampling blood in the fetal cord using ultrasound techniques. In a small number of cases that has already made it possible to diagnose the condition of thrombocytopenia in the fetus even before labour has started. It may in the future even make it possible to carry out treatment of the fetus in utero followed by a normal delivery, whether the treatment is carried out by treating the mother or directing platelets or better still IG IV directly into the fetal circulation."

However, this signal intensity pattern has different sources, and its significance depends on the clinical context. Normal variations in sellar T1 signal hyperintensity are related to vasopressin storage in the neurohypophysis, the presence of bone marrow in normal and variant anatomic structures, hyperactive hormone secretion in the anterior pituitary lobe (eg, in newborns and pregnant or lactating women), and flow artifacts and magnetic susceptibility effects. Pathologic variations in T1 signal hyperintensity may be related to clotting of blood (in hemorrhagic pituitary adenoma, pituitary apoplexy, Sheehan syndrome, or thrombosed aneurysm) or the presence of a high concentration of protein (Rathke cleft cyst, craniopharyngioma, or mucocele), fat (lipoma, dermoid cyst, lipomatous meningioma), calcification (craniopharyngioma, chondroma, chordoma), or a paramagnetic substance (manganese, melanin). After treatment, T1 signal hyperintensity may result from the presence of materials used for surgical packing (gelatin sponge, fat); from compression of the cavernous sinus and reduction of the venous flow, caused by overpacking of the operative bed; or from hormone hypersecretion by a remnant of normal tissue in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland."

CD011053,0,11899543,0,[Medical genetics in reproductive medicine].,"Reproductive genetics (RG) is another new field of medical genetics, integrated with reproductive medicine, assisted reproduction and developmental genetic. RG is closely linked to the perioconceptional prevention, perinatology, ultrasound and biochemical screening in the end of the first and beginning of the second trimesters. RG is based on the system of specialized genetic counseling, clinical cytogenetics, molecular cytogenetics and molecular genetics to provide prefertilization, preimplantation and classical prenatal diagnosis in the Ist to IIIrd trimesters. Thus, RG is part of the fetal medicine and therapy. The six years experience with RG is summarized. A system of the specialized health care, organized, if possible in one integrated center of RG and reproductive medicine (RM) is presented. Reproductive medicine provides all necessary clinical gynecological and andrological surveillance, with assisted reproduction and further obstetrical ultrasound examinations, including nuchal translucency measurements and 2D, 3D ultrasound, echocardiography examinations, if indicated, as well as the invasive method of prenatal diagnosis and perinatology care. Specialized genetic counseling and cytogenetic analysis, if indicated, should be offered to all partners with reproductive disorders as well as to oocyte donors. Chromosome anomalies are disclosed in 6% of men with abnormal sperm analysis as well as in women with severe reproductive disorders. In males with severe oligo, azoospermia, the sperm aneuploidy analysis by molecular cytogenetic methods is recommended. Advised is also the molecular genetic detection of Y chromosome microdeletions, which is detected in 9% of our azoospermic men with deletions in AZFb region. CFTR gene mutations and intron 8 and 10 polymorphism examination is provided not only in men with obstructive azoospermia (CBAVD), but also if severe oligospermy with less than 1 x 10(6) sperm/ml is detected. Molecular genetic analysis of thrombophilic mutations of factor II., V. (Leiden) and MTHFR gene in unexplained recurrent abortions and in cases with unsuccessful IVF is part of the diagnostic strategy. The population frequencies of carriers of mutations of factor II. (2.3%), factor V.-Leiden (5.7%) and MTHFR gene (38%) were determined. The laser biopsy of the first polar body and of blastomeres was introduced for FISH analysis of chromosome aneuploidies. Quantitative fluorescent PCR (QFPCR) detection is used for testing of the most frequent delta F508 CFTR gene mutation and the most frequent aneuploidies of chromosome 13, 18, 21, X and Y. QFPCR was successfully tested for male fetal sex examination from partially purified fetal cells in the maternal blood. The first trimester ultrasound and biochemical screening is recommended to all successful pregnancies after different IVF methods. If borderline levels of first trimester biochemical screening of PAPP-A protein and beta hCG are detected without pathological ultrasound findings, classical triple test of biochemical screening in 16th week of gestation is recommended. If pathological results of ultrasound and biochemical screening are disclosed, invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis is indicated as well as in pregnancies after ICSL, if there is not any obstetrical contraindication."

CD011053,0,7570137,0,Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis by Duplex Doppler ultrasound imaging at the Singapore General Hospital.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity is the major cause of pulmonary embolism and chronic venous obstruction disease of the legs. However, the clinical diagnosis of leg vein thrombosis is notoriously difficult. Venography, using iodine containing contrast materials, has been the most reliable older method for diagnosing thrombosis. It is relatively more invasive, requires exposure to radiation and is not free of risks. Doppler ultrasonography has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of obstruction of flow in veins. We present 25 patients studied at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) with Doppler for the presumptive clinical diagnosis of DVT. Thirteen were found to have complete or partial obstruction of leg veins and 12 showed normal veins. These 12 patients were thus spared the risk and expense of long term anticoagulation. In experienced hands, Duplex Doppler ultrasonograph is an excellent diagnostic modality for the diagnosis or exclusion of significant deep vein thrombosis of the legs. It can be carried out safely and reliably in the very sick, in patients with renal failure, diabetics and the pregnant."

In each case the genetic basis of the anomaly was discussed with the family at genetic counseling underlining the high risk of recurrence related to the autosomal recessive transmission. Each proband was the only child of the couple. In the first case the father and mother, each having one child from a previous marriage, decided to have no more children. In the second case, the use of fetoscopy and its limitations were discussed as another pregnancy was desired. However, the parents finally refused the procedure during pregnancy which yielded a second child with phocomelia who did not survive. In the third and most recent case the proband died. Since the young couple strongly desired another child, ultrasonic monitoring of pregnancy was cautiously suggested and its limitations clearly exposed. Echography was regularly repeated from the third month of pregnancy. The forearms were never detected on echography, nor on fetal radiography. Pregnancy was thus interrupted with prostaglandins at 21 weeks gestational age. On examination the fetus presented bilateral aplasia of the forearm. Based on these observations, the authors discuss the problems raised by prenatal diagnosis of upper limb malformations."

Twenty-four patients treated over an 8-year period were reviewed. Fifteen patients were treated with conventional full-dose intravenous heparin therapy for 5 to 10 days, followed by subcutaneous low-dose heparin until labor, and continued for 6 weeks postpartum (Group A); Eleven patients had Greenfield filters inserted, followed by the same low-dose subcutaneous heparin regimen (Group B). There were 18 femoral or iliofemoral, 5 femoropopliteal, and 1 popliteal and below-knee DVT. The indications for Greenfield filter insertion included two patients in Group A (one with pulmonary embolism, despite adequate heparin therapy, and one with significant bleeding). Nine other patients had prophylactic indications: two for free-floating iliofemoral DVT, three with iliofemoral DVT (occurring just 1-2 weeks before labor), and four with femoropopliteal DVT. There were three immediate major complications (pulmonary embolism, bleeding, or death) in Group A; two with pulmonary embolism, one of which was fatal, and one with significant bleeding (3 of 15 patients; 20%). No major complications occurred in Group B. On long-term follow-up (mean, 61 months), 4 of 12 patients (33%) in Group A had significant leg swelling, with partial resolution of DVT in 2 patients and venous occlusion in 2 patients by duplex ultrasound. This is in contrast to 3 of 11 patients (27%) in Group B with significant leg swelling. There was no fetal morbidity or mortality in either group. Conventional full-dose heparin therapy for DVT of the lower extremity in pregnancy can carry significant morbidity and mortality. Greenfield filters may be used safely in some of these patients."

Etiologically, they are thought to be due to maldevelopment of the arachnoid or secondary to trauma or infection. Postnatally, many are asymptomatic and remain quiescent for years, although others expand and cause symptoms by compressing adjacent brain and/or expanding the overlying skull. Being congenital, it should be possible to identify them in the fetus, and this has proved to be so. But are they anatomically similar and do they behave the same as those detected postnatally? Fifteen fetuses with fluid-filled cysts were identified from the database of the Fetal Management Unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester. Five were diagnosed at or before 20 weeks of gestation, 4 between 21 and 30 weeks, and 6 at 31 weeks or more. Thirteen cysts were in the supratentorial compartment, and 2 in the posterior fossa. Eleven fetuses were delivered, and 4 pregnancies were terminated. One of the born children had Pallister-Hall syndrome and died on day 19, and another had Aicardi's syndrome, is retarded and has fits, 1 with a posterior fossa cyst developed hydrocephalus in utero and was delivered early for the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, he is moderately mentally delayed. Of the remaining 8 children, 1 has been lost to follow-up, and 7 appear to be reaching their early milestones on time. The 4 terminated fetuses had a postmortem examination, 2 did not have arachnoid cysts; 1 had an expanding glioependymal cyst which had destroyed most of the cerebral hemispheres, and the other had a sagittal sinus thrombosis with extensive cavitation of one cerebral hemisphere.

CD011053,0,15859943,0,Increased uterine arterial pressure and contractility of perfused swine uterus after treatment with serum from pre-eclamptic women and endothelin-1.,"The present study was designed to examine the effects of ET-1 (endothelin-1) and serum from PE (pre-eclamptic), HP (healthy pregnant) and HNP (healthy non-pregnant) women on uterine arterial perfusion pressure and uterine contractility. Swine uteri (n = 25) were perfused for a period of up to 11 h, with the aim being to preserve a viable organ. Various concentrations of ET-1 as well as serum from PE, HP and HNP women (n = 10 per group) were administered to the perfused swine uteri and IUP (intrauterine pressure) and IAP (intra-arterial pressure) were recorded. ET-1 produced dose-dependent increases in IUP and IAP. The ET-1 concentration in serum was higher in serum from PE women than in HP and HNP women (P > 0.05). Administration of all serum samples had a contractile effect on the swine uterus, with the greatest effect being seen in HNP women (12.8 +/- 5.3 mmHg), followed by PE (9.06 +/- 4.2 mmHg) and HP (6.1 +/- 4.1 mmHg) women. Statistically significant differences were observed between HNP and PE women (P = 0.048), and PE and HP women (P = 0.021). Increases in IAP following administration of serum from PE women (48.8 +/- 20.0 mmHg) were significantly higher (P = 0.024) compared with the effect of serum from HP women (28.4 +/- 13.7 mmHg). In conclusion, the findings show that serum from PE women has significant vasoconstrictive and oxytocic effects compared with serum from HP women.

CD011053,0,3073622,0,Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. A case history and review.,"For the past two decades, significant advances have been made in the treatment of anovulation. The use of therapeutic agents for induction of ovulation, however, has given rise to several adverse reactions, the most important and serious of such complications being the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be fatal. It is characterized by gross ovarian enlargement, ascites, pleural effusion, hemoconcentration and thromboembolic disorder, which are potentially lethal conditions. The main pathogenic mechanism is considered to be increased capillary permeability, especially of the ovarian vessels, causing acute body fluid shift from the intravascular compartment to the peritoneal and pleural cavities. An experimental model of OHSS suggests that prostaglandins mediate this increased capillary permeability and transudation. Management is based on the concept of the pathogenic mechanism and includes maintenance of intravascular volume by plasma volume expanders, reduction of capillary permeability and prevention of thromboembolic complications. Surgical intervention is indicated only in cases of ovarian torsion or rupture and should be as conservative as possible."

CD011053,0,10494756,0,Risk factors associated with postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis.,"Thrombosis of the ovarian vein is a remarkable process occuring within a few days of labor in 1:500-1:2000 women. Its presentation is characterized by fever, abdominal pain and occasionally by a palpable abdominal mass that in earlier years sometimes lead to explorative laparotomy. With the advent of modern imaging techniques the diagnosis can be made relatively easily. The pathogenesis has been attributed to an infectious process expanding from the uterus to the right ovarian vein and stasis. A predisposition towards thrombosis has not been so far explored. In this study we retrospectively analysed the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of 22 patients with objective documentation of post partum ovarian vein thrombosis (POVT) and assessed potential risk factors. In 11 of the 22 patients (50%) inherited prothrombotic risk factors were detected as follows: 4 were heterozygous for factor V G1691A, 2 had protein S deficiency, one had protein S deficiency and was heterozygous for factor V G1691A, and 4 were homozygous for MTHFR C677T. Eight of the 11 patients who bore a prothrombotic predisposition underwent cesarean section. Taken together, the data suggest that POVT may result from the combined effect of an infection, cesarean section and a prothrombotic tendency."

External monitoring demonstrated a sinusoidal foetal heart rate pattern accompanied by late decelerations. A hydropic and severely anaemic infant with clinical signs of thrombocytopenia was delivered by emergency caesarean section. He failed to breath spontaneously and required positive pressure ventilation. Cranial ultrasound and computerised tomography of the brain revealed a massive intraparenchymal haemorrhage. After the infant had died, post mortem studies revealed the presence of maternal antibodies to the human platelet antigen (HPA) 1a which suggested neonatal isoimmune thrombocytopenia as cause of the intracranial haemorrhage. A sinusoidal foetal heart rate pattern is an alarm signal--it is not necessarily significant but is often associated with mortality or serious morbidity and is therefore a reason for quickly investigating the condition of the foetus."

On admission and in comparison to a previous Doppler assessment systematically performed during growth scan at 37 weeks, the umbilical resistance index (URI) demonstrated an increase of 19%, the cerebral resistance index (CRI) a reduction of 15% and the cerebral-umbilical (C/U) ratio a decrease of 29% reaching the lowest value of 1.05. Under intravenous heparin therapy, Doppler normalisation was observed within 1 week and the mother delivered a healthy, non-hypoxemic baby by caesarean section at 39 weeks and 2 days. This observation suggests that deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) may, in some cases, be responsible for transient fetal hypoxia.

The diagnostic strategy of suspected venous thromboembolism is an example of the application of Bayes' theorem. As a result, the available diagnostic tools, both noninvasive (such as ultrasonography, D-dimer, and computed tomography) and invasive (such as venography), are usually integrated in diagnostic strategies that require the evaluation of the a priori clinical probability of disease (pretest probability). These strategies also vary according to the patient characteristics that allow the definition of five different categories: symptomatic outpatients, symptomatic inpatients, high-risk asymptomatic subjects, patients with suspected recurrence, and pregnant women. Some areas are still a matter of debate, such as the clinical relevance of isolated distal DVT and the diagnosis of suspected ipsilateral recurrence."

We suggest that fetal renal vein thrombosis may be more common than previously suspected, and warrants close monitoring of fetal well-being. Delivery should be considered if there is other evidence of fetal compromise, if the amount of peritoneal fluid suggests substantial haemorrhage, or if there is propagating thrombus in the inferior vena cava."

Knowledge of the exact sequence of events which lead to the insult and the conditions surrounding it is helpful in determining the etiology and as a consequence the treatment of the lesion. In the patient described, direct pressure from the maternal pelvis was probably the contributing factor which led to venous occlusion of the extremity. Arterial thrombosis, emboli, trauma, congenital heart disease, sepsis, dehydration, coagulopathies, and venipuncture are other possible causes which should be considered.

Afterwards, clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities persisted. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency with the presence of inhibitory anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies revealed acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura bout, which was complicated with bilateral vision decrease due to bilateral retinal detachment. At the first ophthalmological examination, ultrasonography and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of the serous retinal detachment. After the diagnosis of acquired TTP bout, the patient was treated with multiple plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin with rapid improvement of the clinical and laboratory parameters.

CD011053,0,2182133,0,Brain damage in monozygous twins.,"A series of 15 monochorionic twins with a great variety of cerebral lesions is reported. Seven cases illustrate the classical situation: the recipient twin was affected and his co-twin, the donor was macerated. In 5 cases, the lesions were described in the donor twin as well and once, as early as 22 weeks. The lesions were usually hypoxic-ischemic, in 2 they were hemorrhagic. In 1 case there was a malformation. Fetal US were performed in 11 cases and the diagnosis of either IUGR, death of a fetus and/or brain lesions in the survivor could be made in 10 cases and once as early as 21 weeks. In fetuses born alive, transfontanellar US or CT scan have confirmed the diagnosis made on fetal US. The pathogenesis of the lesions is not fully understood. Lesions in the recipient twin may result from emboli or thromboplastic material originating from the macerated co-twin. We suggest that blood pressure instability or episodes of severe hypotension might as well lead to brain and/or visceral lesions in the recipient twin. In the donor, the lesions result from hypotension and/or anemia. With improvement and generalization of imaging techniques, the vitality of the fetuses as well as biometric parameters and anatomical structures will be better controlled. However, in case of a fetal death, occurrence of lesions in the survivor is unpredictable and no uniform policy has been proposed yet.

CD011053,0,21756405,0,Evaluation of 7 serum biomarkers and uterine artery Doppler ultrasound for first-trimester prediction of preeclampsia: a systematic review.,"Preeclampsia (PE) affects 1% to 2% of pregnant women and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinical syndrome of PE arises in the second half of pregnancy. However, many underlying factors including defective placentation may already be apparent in the first and early second trimester in many patients. In clinical practice, there is currently no reliable screening method in the first trimester of pregnancy with sufficient accuracy to identify women at high risk to develop PE. Early identification of high-risk pregnancy may facilitate the development of new strategies for antenatal surveillance or prevention and thus improve maternal and perinatal outcome. The aim of this systematic review was to study the literature on the predictive potential of first-trimester serum markers and of uterine artery Doppler velocity waveform assessment (Ut-A Doppler). Literature on the 7 most studied serum markers (ADAM12, fŒ≤-hCG, Inhibin A, Activin A, PP13, PlGF, and PAPP-A) and Ut-A Doppler was primarily selected. In the selected literature, a combination of these markers was analyzed, and where relevant, the value of maternal characteristics was added. Measurements of serum markers and Ut-A Doppler were performed between week 8 + 0 and 14 + 0 GA. Low levels of PP13, PlGF, and PAPP-A and elevated level of Inhibin A have been found to be significantly associated with the development of PE later in pregnancy. The detection rates of single markers, fixed at 10% false-positive rate, in the prediction of early-onset PE were relatively low, and ranged from 22% to 83%. Detection rates for combinations of multiple markers varied between 38% and 100%. Therefore, a combination of multiple markers yields high detection rates and is promising to identify patients at high risk of developing PE. However, large scale prospective studies are required to evaluate the power of this integrated approach in clinical practice."

Intracardiac thrombi have been found at autopsy in some patients with this condition and have been demonstrated in the left or right ventricles on 2-dimensional echocardiography. A 23-year-old woman presented with peripartum cardiomyopathy and biventricular thrombi on echocardiography. The thrombi were spherical, pedunculate, shaggy and irregular in configuration, and freely mobile, suggesting that they were fresh. She was treated with conventional heart failure therapy and anticoagulants. Four days later, the apical thrombi within both ventricles had disappeared and there was no evidence of embolism on physical examination. The hypercoagulable state of the peripartum period and the severe biventricular dysfunction most likely led to the formation of biventricular thrombi."

Computed tomography and color Doppler studies were compatible with complete thrombosis of the right hepatic veins, the Budd-Chiari syndrome. Anticoagulation was initiated, along with supportive measures, and the patient recovered completely. Imaging studies 6 months later were normal.

CD011053,0,16707507,0,Evidence-based guidelines for the investigation and medical treatment of recurrent miscarriage.,"Recurrent miscarriage (RM; > or =3 consecutive early pregnancy losses) affects around 1% of fertile couples. Parental chromosomal anomalies, maternal thrombophilic disorders and structural uterine anomalies have been directly associated with recurrent miscarriage; however, in the vast majority of cases the pathophysiology remains unknown. We have updated the ESHRE Special Interest Group for Early Pregnancy (SIGEP) protocol for the investigation and medical management of RM. Based on the data of recently published large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, we recommend that basic investigations of a couple presenting with recurrent miscarriage should include obstetric and family history, age, BMI and exposure to toxins, full blood count, antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies), parental karyotype, pelvic ultrasound and/or hysterosalpingogram. Other investigations should be limited to particular cases and/or used within research programmes. Tender loving care and health advice are the only interventions that do not require more RCTs. All other proposed therapies, which require more investigations, are of no proven benefit or are associated with more harm than good."
CD011053,0,8622276,0,[Chronic recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism associated with sedentary work].,"A 32-year-old woman was hospitalized with recurrent left-sided chest pain and dyspnea on exertion, which had progressed for approximately 10 years. Since age 18 she had been spending more than twelve hours per day in a predominantly seated position on a floor mat, engaged in Japanese dressmaking. A chest roentgenogram showed marked dilation of the main pulmonary arteries, bilateral oligemia in the upper lung fields and a peripheral infiltration in the middle field of the left lung. The (99m)Tc-MAA perfusion lung scan showed multiple defects in both lungs, but no abnormal findings were detected on a 133Xe ventilation scan. A pulmonary angiogram showed multiple occlusions of pulmonary arteries in both lungs. Because recurrent chest pain and dyspnea had been present for a long time, and because ultrasonic cardiography revealed pulmonary hypertension repeatedly for several years, pulmonary thromboembolism was considered to be chronic and recurrent. The patient had none of the following risk factors for pulmonary emboli: malignancy, neurological disease, heart disease, obesity, pregnancy, or a congenital coagulative abnormality such as deficiency of AT-III, protein C, protein S, or plasminogen. Because no other cause could be found, the chronic recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism most likely resulted from extensive sedentary work that caused stagnation of venous return and deep vein thrombosis."
CD011053,0,15964815,0,Mice with a disruption of the thrombospondin 3 gene differ in geometric and biomechanical properties of bone and have accelerated development of the femoral head.,"Thrombospondin 3 (TSP3) is structurally similar to cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP/TSP5), but its function is unknown. To determine the functional significance of TSP3, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of Thbs3. TSP3-null mice are viable and fertile and show normal prenatal skeletal patterning, based on Alcian blue/Alizarin red S staining. However, subtle and transient abnormalities were detected in the developing postnatal skeleton. Young adult TSP3-null mice are heavier than controls, and analyses of the geometric and biomechanical properties of long bones show increases in the moments of inertia, endocortical and periostal radii, and failure load. The bones of 9-week-old TSP3-null male mice also have a significantly greater cortical area. Most of these differences were no longer detected in 15-week-old mice. Micro-computed tomography scans showed that the trabecular bone proximal to the femoral head growth plate developed at an earlier time in TSP3-null mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, vascular invasion and ossification start in the femoral heads of TSP3-null mice at 9 weeks, whereas the wild-type femoral head is still composed of hypertrophic chondroctyes in a calcified matrix at 15 weeks. These results provide evidence for a role for TSP3 in the regulation of skeletal maturation in mice."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe a case of RCC with tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava (IVC) occurring during pregnancy. The affected 46-year-old pregnant woman with placenta previa was clinically diagnosed with cT3bN0M0 RCC at 25 weeks gestation. Therapeutic considerations included risk of sudden pulmonary embolism, risk of thrombosis or intraoperative hemorrhage, and safe delivery of the fetus. After extensive consultation with obstetricians and pediatricians, the surgical management was divided into two steps. First, the patient underwent Caesarean section and simultaneous hysterectomy at 26 weeks gestation. Then, 16 days after delivery, when hemodynamics and hemostasis had improved due to termination of gestation, the patient underwent radical nephrectomy with concomitant IVC thrombectomy."
CD011053,0,7576172,0,A non-human primate model for the in utero chronic catheterization of the umbilical vein. A preliminary report.,"Short-term ultrasound-guided fetal umbilical cord catheterization in humans has been reported. However, before chronic umbilical vein catheterization is attempted in humans the technique must be tested in the non-human primate model. If the fetus was to tolerate this procedure, chronic fetal umbilical vein catheterization could be used for drug administration, parenteral fetal nutrition or to monitor the changes of hematologic parameters during and after open or endoscopic fetal surgery. In this study, 4 pregnant baboons were used to test the feasibility of ultrasound-guided umbilical vein catheterization. Although the umbilical vein was successfully catheterized in all the animals, only 1 fetus survived the postoperative period. The 3 immediate fetal deaths were due to a fetal intra-amniotic hemorrhage, while the most likely cause of death of the 4th animal was infection. In the surviving fetus and mother, blood was sampled once a day. Neither fetomaternal hemorrhage nor thrombosis could be documented. We conclude that ultrasound-guided transplacental umbilical vein chronic catheterization is technically difficult but feasible in the baboon model. Further studies in this model are needed to improve the catheterization technique and to monitor the extent of time that the catheter may be tolerated within the umbilical vein."

CD011053,0,9222465,0,Twin-reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence: case reports and review of literature.,"The twin reversed-arterial-perfusion (TRAP) sequence found in monozygotic twins is a consequence of primary or secondary cardiac development disruption and direct arterioarterial and venovenous placental anastomoses. Associated findings include the presence of a single umbilical artery (66%) and chromosomal abnormalities in the acardiac twin (33%). Morphological abnormalities in the acardiac twin are consistent with perfusion of tissues supplied by the common iliac and lower branches of the aorta with deoxygenated blood. The pump or donor twin may develop cardiac failure because of the anomalous perfusion circuit. Polyhydramnios is significantly associated with presence of renal tissue in the acardiac twin. An acardiac pump twin weight ratio (> 50%) is associated with the development of polyhydramnios and preterm labour. Identified high-risk factors for poor obstetrical outcome include: acardiac anceps, polyhydramnios, acardiac twin with ears, and pump twin cardiac failure. Management options include elective termination, observation (serial cardiotocography (CTG), ultrasonography and echocardiography) and selective nonsurgical interventions (indomethacin, digitalis, tocolysis). Additionally, surgical interventions (hysterotomy with selective delivery of the acardiac twin or ligation of the acardiac twin's umbilical cord), and ultrasound-guided embolization of the acardiac twin's umbilical artery with absolute alcohol, platinum coils, or thrombogenic coils have been reported. The most appropriate interventions for the various clinical presentations of this disorder are as yet undetermined, and conservative nonintervention is often appropriate. Long-term follow-up data on surviving pump twins are lacking. It is anticipated that centres with active study protocols for these conditions will best serve patient care and clinical research needs."
CD011053,0,20923405,0,Molecular and vascular targets in the pathogenesis and management of the hypertension associated with preeclampsia.,"Normal pregnancy is associated with significant hemodynamic changes and vasodilation of the uterine and systemic circulation in order to meet the metabolic demands of the mother and developing fetus. Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the foremost complications of pregnancy and a major cause of maternal and fetal mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms of PE have been elusive, but some parts of the puzzle have begun to unravel. Genetic factors such as leptin gene polymorphism, environmental and dietary factors such as Ca(2+) and vitamin D deficiency, and co-morbidities such as obesity and diabetes may increase the susceptibility of pregnant women to develop PE. An altered maternal immune response may also play a role in the development of PE. Although the pathophysiology of PE is unclear, most studies have implicated inadequate invasion of cytotrophoblasts into the uterine artery, leading to reduced uteroplacental perfusion pressure (RUPP) and placental ischemia/hypoxia. Placental ischemia induces the release of biologically active factors such as growth factor inhibitors, anti-angiogenic factors, inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, hypoxia-inducible factors, and antibodies to vascular angiotensin II (AngII) receptor. These bioactive factors could cause vascular endotheliosis and consequent increase in vascular resistance and blood pressure, as well as glomerular endotheliosis with consequent proteinuria. The PE-associated vascular endotheliosis could be manifested as decreased vasodilator mediators such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin and hyperpolarizing factor and increased vasoconstrictor mediators such as endothelin-1, AngII and thromboxane A‚ÇÇ. PE could also involve enhanced mechanisms of vascular smooth muscle contraction including intracellular Ca(2+), and Ca(2+) sensitization pathways such as protein kinase C and Rho-kinase. PE-associated changes in the extracellular matrix composition and matrix metalloproteinases activity also promote vascular remodeling and further vasoconstriction in the uterine and systemic circulation. Some of these biologically active factors and vascular mediators have been proposed as biomarkers for early prediction or diagnosis of PE, and as potential targets for prevention or treatment of the disease."

We report a case of an aneurismal dilatation of an umbilical vein directly connected to the portal vein, vital for the delivery of placental blood in the fetus. A term female newborn presented with a dilated umbilical vein detected by prenatal ultrasound. CT angiography revealed an aneurismal dilatation of a vascular structure, from the umbilical ring to the main portal vein. Follow-up CT angiography showed thrombus progression up to the level of SMV inlet. A laparotomy revealed that the normal course of the umbilical vein was absent. The aneurysm was resected and no thrombus was noted in the aneurysm. Post-operative ultrasound revealed an isolated thrombus at the right main portal vein that resolved spontaneously on the follow-up ultrasound. At the 6-month post-operative follow-up, the baby was well and without complications. Although not evaluated for the presence of a ductus venosus, this anomalous umbilical-portal venous connection might have been associated with an absent ductus venosus."

Although negative for thrombus, the study presented an unusual incidental finding: the patient's peripheral bone marrow was hyperemic in a distribution consistent with peripheral red bone marrow expansion. Such a pattern has not been documented before using this technique. This report supports other literature that has demonstrated hyperemia of peripheral red bone marrow in other hemolytic anemias. This finding may ultimately define an additional role of scintigraphy in assessing the pathophysiologic status of the sickle cell patient."
CD011053,0,10785946,0,[Current management of thromboembolism in pregnancy and puerperium].,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the leading cause of maternal death. Today, various risk factors and conditions are known to increase the risk for VTE associated with pregnancy. Having identified the individual risk of a pregnant women, appropriate preventive measures can be taken. If VTE occurs during pregnancy, an appropriate immediate diagnostic work-up is essential in order to avoid further complications. For deep vein thrombosis (DVT) the diagnostic tool of choice is color-coded duplex-sonography, for pulmonary embolism (PE) perfusion/ventilation lung scan can be used. Integrating a detailed individual and family history, the presence of thrombophilia or other risk factors, a risk stratification can be undertaken. These risk categories are defined in the present paper and the appropriate treatment measures are described. As oral anticoagulants cross the placenta and may cause embryopathy in any trimester, oral anticoagulants should be avoided throughout pregnancy. Therefore, heparin is the anti-coagulant of choice for pregnant women, with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) having distinctive pharmacological advantages over unfractionated heparins. Besides a potential for bleeding, the main side effects of heparin include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia which prompts for platelet monitoring, especially in the first weeks of heparin treatment, and, secondly, heparin-induced osteoporosis, which is a potential sequel of long-term heparin administration. Even though there are abundant reports in the literature on the use of LMWH in pregnant women, that show that they are safe and effective, LMWH are not specifically licensed for the use in pregnancy."

Ultrasound venography remains the diagnostic technique of choice for deep venous thrombosis. For pulmonary thromboembolism, ventilation perfusion lung scan is usually preferred more than computerized tomography pulmonary angiography because of the lower maternal radiation dose and the lower prevalence of coexisting pulmonary problems. Low-molecular-weight heparin is the agent of choice for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy, and treatment should be provided for a minimum of 3 months and for at least 6 weeks after delivery.

Fetal/Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is caused by destruction of fetal blood platelets due to maternal antibodies. This condition, which most commonly results from incompatibility between the mother and the fetus for the Human Platelet Antigen-1a (HPA-1a), may lead to intracranial hemorrhage, damage of the central nervous system (CNS) and even death of the fetus or the newborn. It can be the cause of strokes in term newborns. FNAIT is usually attributed to the presence of anti-HPA-1a antibodies. Its incidence rate is estimated at approximately 1/1000-2000 live births. In the absence of a screening program, it is usually diagnosed after birth of a child with symptoms of thrombocytopenia or CNS hemorrhage. Monitoring of antibody production and thrombocytopenia treatment to effectively minimize the risk of stroke are therefore launched only at the next pregnancy. Testing indications are broader to include fetal ultrasound for symptoms of stroke to the CNS, ventricular enlargement or hydrocephalus, and obstetric failure. Diagnostic process is also recommended prior to the planned cordocentesis, in vitro fertilization and in sisters of mothers with children with FNAIT history. HPA-1a testing remains the best method for diagnosing pregnancies at risk. The detection frequency for FNAIT in Poland remains low. Therefore, the Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine (IHTM) will have performed such HPA-1a antigen testing in 30 000 Polish women within the framework of the PREVFNAIT program by March 2016. HPA-1a negative women (2% of the population) are a risk group for production of anti- HPA-1a antibodies responsible for FNAIT therefore all of them will be monitored for the presence and activity of anti-HPA-1a antibodies. Such testing will be performed free of charge for the women."

An ultrasound examination demonstrated cardiomegaly and a fetal blood specimen obtained by cordocentesis revealed thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neutropenia. Fetal paracentesis yielded straw-coloured fluid with electrolytes indicative of a transudate. Non-enveloped icosahedral viral particles approximately 23 mm in diameter were visualized in the ascitic fluid by electron microscopy. Immune electron microscopy confirmed human parvovirus B19. Direct fetal digitalization led to a reduction in umbilical artery resistance, a decline in the abdominal circumference from 20.3 to 17.8 cm, and resolution of the ascites within 72 h. Despite this dramatic response to therapy, fetal death occurred on day 5 of treatment. The initial maternal serum was positive for anti-B19 IgM and IgG antibodies. Electron microscopy of fetal cardiac tissue obtained post-mortem revealed intranuclear viral particles typical of B19, confirming the antenatal diagnosis of myocarditis. This case demonstrates that direct viral identification is applicable to prenatal diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the antenatal diagnosis and palliative treatment of fetal viral infection."

The study protocol consisted of achieving clinical followed by sonographic estimated fetal weight (uEFW) using Shepard formula and then its correlation with actual birth weight (BW). A total of 140 pregnant women participated in this study. The study was conducted in the department of Radiology & Imaging and in the department of Gynae & Obs., Bangladesh Medical College Hospital (BMCH) from January 2005 to December 2005.Maximum number of patients belonged to 26-30 years age group and the mean +/-SD age of the study patients was 26.8+/-4.7 years. Maximum number of women (41.4%) was primigravida and 24.3% women were second gravida. The mean+/-SD gestational age of the patient was 35.9+/-2.8 weeks. We found, clinically EFW was 3432.1+/-410.1 gm (mean+/-SD) and uEFW was 2715.4+/-509.1gm (mean+/-SD) with difference 716.7+/-278.5 gm (mean+/-SD), (P<0.001), which is highly significant. Babies who were delivered within 1st week of clinical and sonographic EFW were selected and their weights were compared with actual BW. The Pearson correlation chi square test and student 't' test were the statistical analysis used. It was found that the P value of clinical versus actual BW was <0.05, this was significant. P value of sonographic versus actual BW was >0.05, this was not significant. Percent error (PE) was found 2+/-7.33% in calculating uEFW from actual BW with minimum error -23.9% and maximum error 11.81%.

She complained about painful lumps in both axillae. During pregnancy the patient suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, lost 6 kg of weight, and had night sweats. During the last three months of her pregnancy she had a deep vein thrombosis in her right lower leg. The clinical examination showed soft axillary lumps up to 3 cm. The lab showed the following pathological findings: blood sedimentation rate 51 mm/h, CRP 44.8 mg/l, LDH 221 U/l and INR 1.3 (indicating insufficient anticoagulation with phenprocoumon). The chest x-ray showed no infiltrate or indications of a past tuberculosis. A fine needle aspiration cytology was performed on an accessible node. Gram stain, Ziehl Neelsen stain, as well as the bacteriological cultures were all negative. An ultrasound examination of the axilla showed a thickened subcutis without a mass. Cytology showed lobular epithelium, consistent wih ductal mamma epithelium without atypical cells. The diagnosis of an accessory mamma tissue in both axillae was made. During the course of the following weeks the glands decreased in size and the patient was free of symptoms."

CD011053,0,7896225,0,The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Although clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is not sufficiently reliable to determine management, it is valuable for stratifying patients into high, intermediate, and low clinical suspicion of embolism. Clinical assessment can then be combined with lung scanning to identify groups of patients with a sufficiently high or low probability of PE that a decision to anticoagulate or withhold therapy can be made. Approximately half of patients with suspected PE will fall into one of these categories. Thrombosis in the deep veins of the leg (DVT) can be detected by noninvasive tests in approximately 50%, and by bilateral venography in approximately 70% of patients with PE, and provides grounds for anticoagulation of some patients with nondiagnostic combinations of clinical and lung scan assessments. Failure to detect DVT makes it less likely but does not exclude the possibility that the patient had a PE. Preliminary evidence suggests that the majority of patients with nondiagnostic combinations of clinical assessment, lung scanning, and negative noninvasive tests for DVT can safely be managed without anticoagulation, provided serial noninvasive tests for DVT remain normal over a 2-week period. Pulmonary angiography may be advisable in patients with nondiagnostic combinations of the above tests in whom (a) the probability of PE remains high (e.g. 30-80%), (b) cardiopulmonary reserve is poor, (c) serial follow-up is not feasible, or (d) future management (e.g. subsequent pregnancy) would be influenced by the result. D-Dimer measurements are sensitive but nonspecific for PE and therefore may have a high negative predictive value, further simplifying the diagnostic approach to PE."
CD011053,0,7896223,0,Diagnostic problems with venous thromboembolic disease in pregnancy.,"In the pregnant patient with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), accurate diagnosis is required to identify patients with DVT or PE who would benefit from appropriate anticoagulant therapy, and to exclude DVT and PE in the majority of patients so they are not exposed to the risks of anticoagulants. The diagnosis of DVT and PE during pregnancy is problematic. The use of invasive diagnostic tests, such as venography and pulmonary angiography, is limited because of the potential risks to the fetus of radiation exposure. Due to hemodynamic changes associated with pregnancy, noninvasive diagnostic tests such as impedance plethysmography and venous Doppler may be falsely abnormal. Diagnostic approaches for DVT and PE will be outlined that can accurately and safely confirm or exclude suspected DVT and PE during pregnancy."
CD011053,0,15884773,0,Birth of rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) infants after in vitro fertilization and gestation in female rhesus or pigtailed (Macaca nemestrina) macaques.,"A study was conducted to assess the possibility of using pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) as recipients for rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) embryos. A total of 250 oocytes were collected from 11 rhesus monkeys during 12 follicular aspirations. We performed 15 embryo transfers with two embryos each into rhesus recipients, which resulted in eight pregnancies, of which two were lost during the second trimester. Among the remaining six pregnant rhesus macaques, two were carrying twins, resulting in the birth of eight infants. Twelve transfers of rhesus embryos into pigtailed macaques resulted in one pregnancy and the birth of one infant. Fetal growth and development were monitored by monthly ultrasound examinations, during which biparietal measurements were taken and compared with those derived from 22 pregnant control monkeys. In vitro fertilization-derived singletons tended to develop faster than did twins and naturally conceived control singletons during the initial months of pregnancy and weighed more at birth than did twins. There were pronounced morphologic changes in the placenta of the rhesus that developed in the female pigtailed macaque. These included an irregular shape, elevated placenta-to-birth-weight ratio, and an abnormal length and diameter of the umbilical cord. Histologic analyses of the rhesus-pigtailed placenta showed evidence of maternal-placental floor infarction and thrombosis of the spiral artery with resulting infarction of the villi. These results demonstrate that pigtailed macaques can carry rhesus fetuses to term, but further studies are necessary to determine the cause of the decreased pregnancy rates and observed placental abnormalities."

CD011053,0,24555256,0,Improving the management of varicose veins.,"Up to 30% of the UK population are affected by varicose veins. They are a manifestation of increased venous pressure in the lower limb caused by impaired venous return. Primary varicosities result from poor drainage from the superficial to the deep venous system. Secondary varicosities arise as a result of underlying pathology impeding venous drainage, such as deep venous thrombosis or increased intra-abdominal pressure caused by a mass, pregnancy or obesity. Patients with bleeding varicose veins should be referred to a vascular service immediately. Referral is also indicated in the following cases: symptomatic primary or recurrent varicose veins; lower limb skin changes thought to be caused by chronic venous insufficiency; superficial vein thrombosis and suspected venous incompetence; a venous leg ulcer or healed venous leg ulcer. Imaging is crucial in the assessment of the superficial and deep venous system to enable assessment of venous competence. The gold standard imaging technique is colour duplex ultrasonography. Duplex ultrasound should be used to confirm the diagnosis of varicose veins and the extent of truncal reflux, and to plan treatment for patients with suspected primary or recurrent varicose veins. Superficial vein ligation, phlebectomy and stripping have been the mainstay of treatment. In recent years, new techniques have been developed that are minimally invasive, enabling treatment of superficial venous incompetence with reduced morbidity. NICE recommends that endothermal ablation, in the form of radiofrequency or laser treatment, should be offered as treatment for patients with confirmed varicose veins and truncal reflux."

Congenital anomalies of the spine and skeletal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular systems and visceral situs inversus are significantly more frequent among infants of diabetic mothers than normal. The most specific anomaly is sacral agenesis. Renal vein thrombosis and adrenal hemorrhage are also more common and may be diagnosed by sonography. Over one-half of the cases of the small left colon are associated with maternal diabetes and may be diagnosed and treated with a contrast enema. The incidence of the respiratory distress syndrome is higher in infants of diabetic mothers than other premature infants, and the disease may occur in the presence of reliable indicators of lung maturity. Other common causes of dyspnea include cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, wet lung syndrome, hyperviscosity syndrome, and persistence of fetal circulation.

CD011053,0,10583886,0,Prenatal treatment of severe fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.,"Prenatal treatment of fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FMAIT) in previously affected families is of great clinical importance. We report here our experience in the prenatal treatment of 15 severely thrombocytopenic fetuses. Thrombocytopenia was in 13 cases due to immunization to HPA-1a, in one case to HPA-5b, and in one case to HPA-6b. Thirteen fetuses received altogether 34 intrauterine platelet transfusions, seven of them in combination with maternal-administered intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) and two in combination with IVIG and prednisone. Six of the 13 fetuses had only one transfusion just prior to delivery. In our experience, IVIG seemed to be less effective than reported; only two fetuses of eight treated initially with weekly maternal-administered IVIG responded, and these were the mildest affected cases in the study. On the other hand, owing to the short survival time, weekly platelet transfusions could only partly maintain a safe platelet count in the four fetuses treated with serial intrauterine platelet transfusions. The number of transfusions needed to be limited because of the high cumulative risk associated with repeated procedures. Three of 34 intrauterine platelet transfusions were associated with near-loss of three different fetuses due to prolonged fetal bradycardia after the transfusion. In conclusion, overall neonatal outcome was good, with no mortality; among the study group there was no intracranial haemorrhage (evaluated by postnatal ultrasonography) compared with one case in their untreated siblings. However, the problem of the optimal treatment of FMAIT remains to be solved. For the moment, the treatment of choice is a combination of maternal IVIG and platelet transfusions in severely affected cases. Serial fetal blood samplings (FBS) are needed in order to monitor the fetus with sufficient care."
CD011053,0,10565239,0,[Venous thrombectomy in pregnancy. A follow-up study].,"Deep venous thrombosis is an uncommon but feared complication in pregnancy. The treatment of choice in most centers is heparin and compression stockings, which effectively prevents pulmonary embolism, but the incidence of chronic venous insufficiency with skin change and ulcers after such treatment is reported to be up to 65%. In the period 1985-93, thirty-nine pregnant women were treated for femoroiliacal venous thrombosis (FIVT) with operative thrombectomy, arteriovenous fistula and anticoagulant therapy. The aim of this study was to examine those of the women who subsequently had been pregnant again. The pregnancy and delivery were closely monitored and the frequency of clinically detected as well as objectively measured venous insufficiency was recorded. Nineteen of the women subsequently became pregnant again, resulting in 25 deliveries. They were investigated at the Coagulation Laboratory and treated with phenendione or low molecularweight heparin. All pregnancies proceeded successfully. None showed clinical signs of rethrombosis during the subsequent pregnancy. At follow up 11 patients had dilated or varicose veins, nine had a closed iliaca at ultrasound examination, none had skin changes or ulcers. We conclude that women treated for FIVT in pregnancy with thrombectomy followed by anticoagulant therapy may undergo a new pregnancy with low risk of obstetrical complications and with a low risk of developing rethrombosis or chronic venous insufficiency."
CD011053,0,3539447,0,Thromboembolic disease in pregnancy.,"Suspicion of DVT or thromboembolism is critical to early diagnosis and treatment prior to development of severe or life-threatening pathology. Because the consequences of treatment are long-term inconvenience and risk of major complications, objective studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Radiographic procedures such as angiography and lung scanning provide valuable information with low risk to mother and fetus. However, if the clinical situation is strongly suggestive, treatment with intravenous heparin can be immediately initiated followed by definitive diagnosis. When indicated, anticoagulation can be instituted with relative safety, providing there is careful monitoring. Heparin is unquestionably the drug of choice for treatment and prophylaxis during pregnancy. Because warfarin carries a significant risk to the fetus of anomalies and hemorrhage, its use during pregnancy should be reserved for those circumstances in which the benefits of such therapy outweigh the risks. Finally, awareness of the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism, as well as expeditious treatment, remain the mainstays for prevention of maternal and attendant fetal mortality."

During both pregnancies, ultrasound showed abnormalities of the placenta. The first patient also had intra-uterine growth restriction. A postpartum pathological examination showed abnormalities of both placentae consistent with placental mesenchymal dysplasia. Placental mesenchymal dysplasia is a rare condition which is associated with intra-uterine growth restriction, intra-uterine mortality, prematurity and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Thrombocytopaenia and anaemia are less commonly described in literature and are caused by micro-angiopathic haemolysis in the placenta.

CD011053,0,12865887,0,Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and pregnancy.,"General recommendations on how to deal with pregnancy in patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) are rare.

The risk to deliver an ill child is low in women with KTS. At the end of the 1st trimester a sonographic investigation can exclude angiodysplastic alterations of the fetus. If the fetus shows changes compatible with KTS, a termination can be discussed because the risk of fatal complications after delivery is high. During pregnancy the careful monitoring of coagulopathic disorders is necessary. Prior to delivery an MR-scan may be useful to detect angiodysplastic vascular structures next to the spinal cord, pelvic structures or the lower abdominal wall, which might complicate peridural anesthesia or caesarean section."

CD011053,0,1642540,0,Late results of suprarenal Greenfield vena cava filter placement.,"Placement of the Greenfield filter above the renal veins was necessary in 71 (9%) of 821 total patients in the filter registries of two institutions. The status of 60 patients (85%) could be verified, with follow-up data ranging from 18 months to 16 years (average, 53 months). Of 24 deaths (34%), none was from recurrent embolism or renal failure; death was most commonly associated with a malignant neoplasm. The recurrent embolism rate was 4%, identical to the infrarenal experience. Duplex evaluation of the filters in 22 patients, representing the majority (61%) of living patients, showed that all the filters were patent. Sixteen patients (41%) had lower-extremity edema that predated filter insertion, and in no patient did the results of noninvasive venous studies worsen. Filter fracture (two patients) or distal migration (two patients) had no clinical sequelae, and there was no evidence of renal dysfunction. For thrombus extending to the level of the renal veins or within them and for pregnant patients or women of childbearing age, suprarenal placement of the Greenfield filter is safe and effective, with no filter obstruction seen in follow-up extending to 16 years."
CD011053,0,9255112,0,Outcome of planned pregnancies in systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective study on 62 pregnancies.,"We conducted a prospective study in order to determine planned pregnancy outcome in systemic lupus erythematosus followed in a tertiary referral centre. Pregnancy was authorized if disease was inactive on 20 mg/day prednisone or less for at least 1 yr. Upon the diagnosis of pregnancy, systematic corticosteroids consisting of 10 mg/day prednisone or more were started. In the case of antiphospholipid antibodies, 100 mg/day aspirin was added, replaced by heparin in the pre-partum period. In the case of antiphospholipid syndrome complicated by previous thrombotic events or fetal losses despite aspirin, heparin was prescribed. One woman with a history of atrioventricular block was treated with dexamethasone. Patients were monitored by medical and obstetrical examination, and laboratory tests carried out at least monthly and a quarterly echography. Among 62 pregnancies in 38 women, lupus flare was observed in 27% of the cases, 6% of which occurred in the post-partum period. Flares were moderate except in one renal involvement in a woman with prior diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. Therapy was not modified in half of the cases. Pregnancy ended in early spontaneous abortion not related to lupus flare (n = 10), stillbirth (n = 2). induced abortion (n = 2), preterm birth (n = 29) and full-term birth (n = 19). Caesarean section was performed in nine cases. A severe infection occurred in two premature neonates. Another premature neonate was growth retarded. Two children had cutaneous neonatal lupus. No child died, neither had atrioventricular block. Stillbirth and severe prematurity were more common in mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome. After exclusion of early spontaneous and induced abortions, the live birth rate was 96%, that is close to the French general population. The main problem remains a high rate of prematurity, but without maternal or neonatal death."

The objectives of this study are to describe their prenatal patterns and to focus on their possible favorable outcome. This multicenter retrospective study reported 13 cases of DSM prenatally diagnosed. The admission criterion was a dural mass posterior to the vermis. In 12 patients, MRI was performed after US. Follow-up in 10 born babies (mean: 8 months) and three neuropathological examinations were available. In all fetuses, DSM presented as a well-delimited round mass involving the torcular. The follow-up examinations (n = 10) revealed progressive thrombosis of the DSM marked by a heterogeneous pattern (US and MRI) with concentric rings. The volume of the mass decreased, with complete regression in seven patients (five before and two after birth). One child died at the age of 5 months in the context of major hydrocephalus and another developed atrophy of the frontal lobes. The eight other babies were doing well (5 days to 3 years) without any treatment (n = 6) or following treatment for hydrocephalus (n = 2). Prenatal DSM may have a typical MR pattern, and the prognosis might not be as bad as has previously been reported.

CD011053,0,9487535,0,Intra- and early postpartum ultrasonography: a review. Part I.,"The objective of this article is to review current literature pertaining to intra- and early postpartum sonography. All the manuscripts published in the English language regarding this topic were selected from a MEDLINE search from 1966 through August 1997. Additional sources were identified through cross-referencing. Currently, intra- and early postpartum sonography may be performed for either maternal or fetal indications. Maternal indications include cervical assessment in preterm labor/rupture of membranes, assessment of the lower uterine segment, size and position of uterine fibroids, guided-placement of central venous or pulmonary artery catheters, detection of intraoperative venous air embolism, deep venous thrombosis, assist management of the third-stage of labor, postpartum hemorrhage or febrile morbidity. Fetal indications include an anatomical survey in patients presenting without prenatal care, verification of fetal presentation, estimated fetal weight, assessment of the breech-presenting fetus, external cephalic version, management of delivery of the second-twin, and internal podalic version. Doppler flow velocimetry is a useful tool in depicting both maternal and fetal intrapartum physiologic changes. We conclude that intra- and early postpartum sonography is an established versatile diagnostic and interventional-guiding modality for many obstetric conditions and should be readily available on labor and delivery suites."

Because of a series of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and respiratory distress she was admitted to the Neuro ICU. Focal neurological symptoms were absent, and CSF analysis was normal. Laboratory findings indicated hemolytic anemia with fragmented erythrocytes in smear specimens, thrombocytopenia, reticulocytosis, marked elevation of liver and pancreatic enzymes, and microhematuria. T2-weighted MR scans of the brain discluded multiple ischemic lesions of the cerebral white and gray matter, caudate nucleus and pons, displaying a hemodynamic pattern. Specific treatment included administration of corticosteroids, repeated plasmapheresis with substitution by fresh frozen plasma and antithrombin III. A control MR performed on the 3rd day of treatment demonstrated the absence of nearly all abnormal findings previously obtained. During a 3-week clinical course the patient showed full recovery, including normalization of hematologic and neuroradiologic findings.

CD011053,0,18363156,0,Acardiac twin fetus with severe hydrops fetalis and bilateral talipes varus deformity.,"Twin reversed-arterial-perfusion syndrome (TRAPS) is a rare complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies. TRAPS is characterized by the hemodynamic dependence of a ""recipient"" twin from a ""pump"" twin. The ""recipient"" twin exhibits lethal abnormalities, such as acardia and acephaly. Circulatory failure of the normal twin derives from the existence of arterio-arterial and veno-venous anastomoses within the placenta that allow retrograde perfusion of the acardiac twin by blood coming from the normal twin. Acardiac twinning is the most extreme manifestation of the twin-twin transfusion syndrome. This occurs in 1 in 100 monozygotic twin pregnancies and 1 in 35,000 births. We report a case of diamnionic monochorionic female twins in which the acardiac twin demonstrated severe hydrops fetalis and bilateral talipes varus deformity. Cesarean section was performed on a 27-year-old hypertensive gravida 2, para 1 mother for fetal indications at 32 6/7 weeks gestation. The acardiac fetus had a two-vessel umbilical cord measuring 43.5 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter. The proximal end inserted into the root of the normal twin's umbilical cord in an acute angle forming a ""v"" close to the placental disc. Structures rostral to the thorax were absent except for a round mass of flesh with three small buds in place of the head and neck, and bilateral upper extremities. Only the kidneys, right adrenal, small and large intestine, and rudimentary urinary bladder were present. Both feet demonstrated talipes varus deformity. The fetus was severely hydropic. The subcutaneous fat measured 4.5 cm in maximum thickness. The normal twin had a protracted course complicated with respiratory distress syndrome, moderate secundum atrial septal defect with left to right shunt, and thrombocytopenia of prematurity.

The discovery and investigation of these angiogenic factors could characterize important pathogenetic mediators of preeclampsia or even the cause for placental dysfunctions. These anti-angiogenic proteins are dramatically elevated in maternal circulation weeks prior to the onset of the syndrome preeclampsia. Since it is known that altered maternal sFlt1, sEng and PlGF levels are detectable weeks prior to the onset of these pregnancy complications, it was the aim of the study to investigate the predictive value of these markers in high-risk second trimester pregnancies characterized by abnormal uterine perfusion. Using both factors, sFlt1 and PlGF, early-onset preeclampsia can be predicted with 83% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Combined analysis of sEng and sFlt1 is able to predict early-onset PE even with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93.3%. This shows, that the concurrent measurement of uterine perfusion and angiogenic factors allows an efficient prediction of early-onset pregnancy complications, particularly preeclampsia. The next step will be the development of therapeutic tools that have positive impact on the clinical symptoms via the inhibition of sFlt1 and or sEng."
CD011053,0,15199492,0,"Inherited thrombophilia, pregnancy, and oral contraceptive use: clinical implications.","Inherited thrombophilia has been reported to be associated with an increased risk for complications of pregnancy, including venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as preeclampsia (PEC), fetal loss (FL), fetal growth retardation (FGR), and abruptio placentae (AP), the latter probably due to inadequate placental perfusion. The estimate of risk largely depends on the kind of thrombophilia and on the criteria applied for the selection of the patients, producing in some cases contradictory results. Convincing evidence is available that deficiency of antithrombin III (AT), protein C (PC), and protein S (PS) is a risk factor for VTE and late FL. Factor V (Leiden) is associated with an increased risk for VTE, unexplained recurrent FL, late FL, and perhaps PEC; prothrombin G20210A is a weak risk factor for VTE. So far, the data available for FGR and AP are scarce. However, the absolute risk for VTE during pregnancy and puerperium is between 1 and 3%, in comparison with the baseline risk of 0.08%. Antithrombotic prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin is warranted during puerperium in all women with thrombophilia and throughout all pregnancy in women at higher risk (AT deficiency, homozygosity for factor VLeiden, and perhaps PC and PS deficiencies); treatment with subcutaneous heparin for prevention of FL among women with thombophilia is under investigation. Presence of inherited thrombophilia increases the risk for VTE due to oral contraceptives up to an absolute risk of 3 per 1000 person-years, in comparison with the baseline risk of 3 to 6 per 10000 person-years; the risk is further increased by first usage, the use of preparations containing third-generation progestins, and thrombophilia due to AT, PC, and PS deficiency as well as homozygous factor V (Leiden) and combined defects."

CD011053,0,11885029,0,Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.,"Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) makes up approximately 1-4% of all episodes of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Risk factors for UEDVT include central venous catheterization, strenuous upper extremity exercise or anatomic abnormalities causing venous compression, inherited thrombophilia, and acquired hypercoagulable states including pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, and cancer. Unexplained or recurrent UEDVT should prompt a search for inherited hypercoagulable states or underlying malignancy. Clinical presentations include arm, neck, and shoulder pain; edema; skin discoloration; tenderness; and venous distension. Because UEDVT is frequently asymptomatic until complications ensue, a high index of suspicion is required for patients with one or more risk factors for thrombosis. Pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome are the most common sequelae of UEDVT. Early detection and treatment of UEDVT decrease complications, morbidity, and mortality. Compressive ultrasonography is an effective and economical means of confirming the clinical diagnosis in most patients. Traditional anticoagulant therapy of UEDVT is giving way to a multimodal approach involving transcatheter thrombolytic therapy followed by a minimum of 3 months of warfarin sodium anticoagulant therapy, venous decompression as needed, and balloon angioplasty with stenting for treatment of residual stricture. Low-dose anticoagulant therapy can safely and effectively mitigate the increased risk of UEDVT associated with the use of central venous catheters."

CD011053,0,3155351,0,Characterization of the responses to serotonin and prostanoids in human umbilical arteries perfused in vitro.,"In order to characterize the action of some vasoactive autacoids on the umbilical artery, pressure responses of serotonin, PGE2, PGF2 alpha and U46619 (a thromboxane A2 mimetic) have been investigated during in vitro perfusion. Serotonin, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha caused biphasic responses in which both the dilator and the constrictor phases were found to be dose-dependent. Indomethacin or SQ 29.548 (a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist) did not affect the response to serotonin, whereas indomethacin reduced or abolished the vasodilator and vasoconstrictor action of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha. U46619 induced monophasic pressor responses which were abolished by SQ 29.548. The results indicate that PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, but not serotonin, interfere with the local production of vasoactive prostanoids. The altered synthetic activity modify the responses to PGE2 and PGF2 alpha in the umbilical artery."

The intervillous and the umbilical vein blood flows were measured before and after 1 hour of infusion of ritodrine, with the xenon 133 method and with a combination of real-time and Doppler ultrasonic equipment, respectively. Ritodrine decreased maternal diastolic and mean arterial pressures, as well as placental vascular resistance, but caused no significant changes in intervillous and umbilical vein blood flows. Ritodrine stimulated the synthesis of vasodilatory prostacyclin, as seen from a rise in maternal plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, but inhibited the platelets' capacity to generate the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2. Thus, apart from maternal hemodynamic changes, the intervillous and umbilical circulations are maintained during short-term administration of ritodrine in normotensive pregnancies."

The selection was based on the fact that all patients had taken or were still taking oral contraceptives (OC) for a period of 3 years or longer than 3 years. None of these patents as gathered from history, physical examination, private physician records and our records has shown any DVT during or immediately after OC intake. Physical and compression ultrasonography examinations at the time of study were all negative. The average length of oral contraceptives therapy (OCT) was 10 years (range 3-23). The average age of patients at the time of oral contraception was 30 years. The 13 women had also 17 pregnancies without any venous thrombosis. The observations casts several doubt about the prothrombotic effect of this polymorphism. Since DVT has been shown to occur occasionally even in normal women, it is likely that the same may occur in women with this polymorphism regardless of the existence or not of any pathogenetic relationship between the two phenomena. Occasional reports suggesting a link between this polymorphism and oral contraception-related venous thrombosis should be carefully evaluated in order to avoid premature and incorrect conclusions."

Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD), the major CD phenotype at pediatric age, has been previously reported as a self-limiting condition with clinical presentations resolving between 6 months and 1 year of life. We report the prenatal diagnosis of CD in a family with a fatal NICCD proband. The proband was a 10-month-old male presenting cough for 8 days and jaundiced skin 1 day. Physical examination revealed fever, dark jaundiced sclera and skin, hoarse breathing sounds, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests uncovered elevated cholestatic indices, increased ammonia, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, and reduced fibrinogen. Sonography showed the features of liver cirrhosis. Metabolome analysis uncovered large quantity of 4-hydroxyphenyllactate and dicarboxylates in urine and increased citrulline and methionine in blood. The patient passed away due to liver failure at his age of 13.5 months. Mutation analysis revealed him a homozygote of 851del4, a four-base deletion in exon 9 of SLC25A13 gene. On request of the parents who had a second fetus, prenatal diagnosis of CD was performed by PCR-electrophoresis following amniocentesis and amniocyte culture, and demonstrated the fetus a carrier of the same mutation. The fatal proband in the present report has provided clinical evidence challenging the traditional concept on NICCD prognosis. Moreover, as the first trial on CD prenatal diagnosis, this study might open a novel area for clinical management of CD."
CD011053,0,17411270,0,Analysis of cardiovascular oscillations: a new approach to the early prediction of pre-eclampsia.,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious disorder with high morbidity and mortality occurring during pregnancy; 3%-5% of all pregnant women are affected. Early prediction is still insufficient in clinical practice. Although most pre-eclamptic patients show pathological uterine perfusion in the second trimester, this parameter has a positive predictive accuracy of only 30%, which makes it unsuitable for early, reliable prediction. The study is based on the hypothesis that alterations in cardiovascular regulatory behavior can be used to predict PE. Ninety-six pregnant women in whom Doppler investigation detected perfusion disorders of the uterine arteries were included in the study. Twenty-four of these pregnant women developed PE after the 30th week of gestation. During pregnancy, additional several noninvasive continuous blood pressure recordings were made over 30 min under resting conditions by means of a finger cuff. The time series extracted of systolic as well as diastolic beat-to-beat pressures and the heart rate were studied by variability and coupling analysis to find predictive factors preceding genesis of the disease. In the period between the 18th and 26th weeks of pregnancy, three special variability and baroreflex parameters were able to predict PE several weeks before clinical manifestation. Discriminant function analysis of these parameters was able to predict PE with a sensitivity and specificity of 87.5% and a positive predictive value of 70%. The combined clinical assessment of uterine perfusion and cardiovascular variability demonstrates the best current prediction several weeks before clinical manifestation of PE."

Aneurysms can be saccular, fusiform and multiple and may develop due to atherosclerosis, vasculitis, trauma and biopsy. Dilatation of hepatic artery can be seen in portal hypertension, Osler-Weber-Rendu disease and hemangiomatosis. Hepatic artery can be occluded after trauma and transplantation. Dissection develops due to atherosclerosis, Marfan and Ehler Danlos syndromes and during pregnancy. Arteriovenous fistula can be congenital and acquired.

There were 18 elective abortions, 27 fetal and neonatal losses, and 391 surviving infants. Of the 394 fetuses and infants who were adequately evaluated, a total of 13 (3.3%) had major congenital anomalies, including four with transverse limb reduction deformities, three with cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and one each with a nasal encephalocele, large port-wine stain, craniosynostosis, omphalocele with associated defects, ambiguous genitalia, and undescended testes. The limb malformations in the four affected infants were all very similar and were comparable to those described by others in association with CVS. Three of the cases of limb malformations followed transcervical CVS; one followed a transabdominal procedure. The procedures were performed at 9.5, 9.5, 10.5, and 11 weeks' gestation. An adequate sample was obtained with a single attempt in each case. These observations, in conjunction with others in the literature, suggest that there is an increased risk of limb anomalies associated with CVS. A vascular etiology, related to either decreased fetal perfusion or thrombosis of the sampling site with subsequent embolization, is suggested."

Truths and counter-truths].,"Varicose veins are not the only symptomatology of chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs, which has other clinical manifestations: purely symptomatic problems, varicosities, edema and trophic skin lesions. The management of varicose veins is base upon thorough clinical examination. Doppler and ultrasonography are useful in cases of varicose veins in which radical treatment is envisaged. Ultrasound investigation is essential in the presence of cutaneous ulceration in order to avoid mistaking a trophic lesion due to incompetence of deep veins, most often of post-thrombotic origin, for a varicose ulcer. The treatment of varicose veins varies according to the precise nature of the preoccupations of the patient concerned. Elastic support is useful regardless of the clinical form of the disease. Vasculoprotective and venotonic drugs can be used when venous insufficiency is symptomatic. Radical treatment of varicose veins, whether by sclerosing injections or surgery, depends upon the anatomical nature of lesions, the degree of venous incompetence and the extent of signs, but also the wishes of the patient, properly informed of the advantages and limitations of each technique."

There is no consensus regarding whether they should maintain anticoagulation therapy throughout pregnancy with the risk of a thromboembolism or to undergo a reoperation with bioprosthetic heart valves, followed by a third operation when the valve deteriorates. This report presents two cases of young women who underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR) with Starr-Edwards ball valves (model 6120: 1M) during their childhood. Although they did not have any cardiac symptoms, transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac catheterization data demonstrated that both the patients had asymptomatic mild relative mitral stenosis. They both wished to bear a child. After the patients and their family provided thorough informed consent, redo MVRs were preformed safely with biological prostheses.

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, one of the well known hypercoagulable states, can be also manifested as an arterial or venous thrombosis and recurrent spontaneous abortion. Sometimes a patient with antiphospholipid antibodies might not notice a miscarriage and seek for assisted reproduction treatment, which harbors a chance of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. If this happens, the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can exacerbate the thrombotic complication of underlying antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, resulting in a catastrophic vascular event. The authors experienced a case of middle cerebral artery infarct, which developed during ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in a 33-yr-old woman with a previous history of fetal loss. An elevated titer of anticardiolipin antibodies was noticed and persisted thereafter. The authors suggest screening tests for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies before controlled ovarian hyperstimulation."

Twenty patients with PIH were submitted to the Doppler evaluation of fetal-placental perfusion at 22-24 weeks. The systo-diastolic (SID) ratio and the pulsatility index (PI) of uterine, umbilical and middle cerebral arteries and systemic blood pressure were recorded before and 7 days after nifedipine administration (10 mg/ per os 3 times/day until delivery). Statistical analysis was performed with paired and unpaired t-test and the two-tailed Fisher exact test. Nifedipine significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the mean systolic pressure in all patients (from 146 to 135 mmHg): 8 patients developed pre-eclampsia (PE) complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR) (PE group), whilst the remaining were only affected by PIH (PIH group). The gestational age at delivery, neonatal birthweight and 1- and 5-min Apgar scores were significantly (p < 0.001) lower in PE than in PIH women.

The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment."

Ninety six patients with suspected DVT/PTE were identified, of whom only two were pregnant. Forty four patients had suspected DVT and confirmatory investigations were performed in 84%. The most common risk factor for DVT was intra-venous drug (IVD) use. Unfractionated heparin was prescribed to all patients except one with acute DVT at an average daily dose of 25,000 iu. In patients receiving heparin, 68% had measurements of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and on 38% of occasions the result was subtherapeutic. Complications of heparin therapy were infrequent. Fifty two patients had suspected PTE and 50 underwent ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning. No patient underwent pulmonary angiography. The management of patients with normal, low and high probability V/Q scans was in keeping with the guidelines, but only 8% [corrected] of patients with an intermediate V/Q scan result had further investigations and 33% received heparin.

Early identification of at-risk women by reliable screening tests could alleviate this health issue; however, conventional methods such as obstetric history and clinical risk factors, uterine activity monitoring, biochemical markers, and cervical sonography for screening women at risk for PTB have proven unsuccessful in lowering the rate of PTB. Cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) might prove to be a useful, readily available biological fluid for identifying diagnostic PTB biomarkers. Human columnar epithelial endocervical-1 (End1) and vaginal (Vk2) cell secretomes were employed to generate a stable isotope labeled proteome (SILAP) standard to facilitate characterization and relative quantification of proteins present in CVF. The SILAP standard was prepared using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) of End1 and Vk2 through seven passages. The labeled secreted proteins from both cell lines were combined and characterized by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In total, 1211 proteins were identified in the End1-Vk2 SILAP standard, with 236 proteins being consistently identified in each of the replicates analyzed. Individual proteins were found to contain <0.5% of the endogenous unlabeled forms. Identified proteins were screened to provide a set of 15 candidates that have either previously been identified as potential PTB biomarkers or could be linked mechanistically to PTB. Stable isotope dilution LC-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM/MS) assays were then developed for conducting relative quantification of the 15 candidate biomarkers in human CVF samples from term and PTB cases. Three proteins were significantly elevated in PTB cases (desmoplakin isoform 1, stratifin, and thrombospondin 1 precursor), providing a foundation for further validation in larger patient cohorts."
CD011053,0,12361675,0,Carbon monoxide decreases perfusion pressure in isolated human placenta.,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the metabolites formed via heme oxidation catalysed by the enzyme heme oxygenase (HO). Endogenous formation of CO, mediated by HO, has been noted in both placental and umbilical vessels. In blood vessels from different mammalian sources, it has been proposed that the vasodilator effect of CO is mediated via stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and consequent increased cGMP formation. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of exogenous CO on placental cotyledon perfusion pressure and to determine the role of sGC in the CO-induced decrease of perfusion pressure using the in vitro human placental perfusion preparation. A thromboxane A2 mimetic (U46619) was added to the foetal perfusion medium to constrict the placental blood vessels. Carbon monoxide was added to the foetal perfusion medium in increasing concentrations to determine its effect on placental perfusion pressure. Carbon monoxide produced a concentration-dependent decrease in placental perfusion pressure. The addition of ODQ, a sGC inhibitor, attenuated the CO-induced decrease in placental perfusion pressure, while addition of YC-1, an activator of sGC, augmented the CO-induced decrease in placental perfusion pressure. The data indicate that CO causes vasorelaxation of placental resistance blood vessels, in large part, via activation of sGC."
CD011053,0,3706382,0,Acute splenic sequestration crises in adults with sickle cell disease.,"Reports of acute splenic sequestration crises in adults with sickle cell hemoglobin C disease or sickle cell thalassemia are rare, although an enlarged and distensible spleen persists in half of these patients. Seven episodes of acute splenic sequestration crises in four adults, two with sickle C disease and two with sickle thalassemia, are described. The crises were life-threatening and recurrent in all, but there were no fatalities. One patient had mild steady-state thrombocytopenia suggesting hypersplenism. Technetium 99m/sulfur colloid scanning of the spleen during the acute splenic sequestration crises in three patients showed almost total lack of splenic uptake or decreased uptake with intrasplenic filling defects thought to be splenic infarcts or hematomas on follow-up computed tomographic scanning. The scanning abnormalities resolved following recovery from the crises. Acute splenic sequestration crises probably are common in adults with sickle C disease and sickle thalassemia but may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as splenic infarctions. The hematologic and splenic findings during acute splenic sequestration crises resemble those following splenic vein ligation in animals."

CD011053,0,19062245,0,[Clinical prediction rule for diagnosing deep vein thrombosis in primary care].,"Patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are often managed on an outpatient basis by primary care physicians. International guidelines recommend anticoagulant treatment for patients with suspected DVT when diagnostic testing is delayed or when clinical probability is high. Our goal was to build a clinical prediction rule specifically for easy use in primary care to help decide about starting anticoagulant therapy while awaiting ultrasound examination. Between January and December 2006, 276 patients with clinically suspected DVT were included in this study by 189 general practitioners from Brittany, France. All patients underwent a standardized clinical assessment and were then referred for ultrasonography. The diagnosis of DVT was confirmed in 103 (37%) patients. The final clinical prediction rule comprises four risk factors for DVT (personal history of venous thromboembolism +1, immobilization in previous month +1, estrogen contraceptive +2, active malignancy +3), one clinical sign (swelling of the calf +1), and the presence of an alternative diagnosis more likely than that of DVT (-3). The proportion of confirmed DVT was 26% in patients classified as at low risk, with a score less than 2 points, and 63% in patients classified at high risk, that is, with a score of 2 points or more. This clinical prediction rule is based on simple history and clinical factors that are routinely collected by GPs from patients with suspected DVT. It could help to decide about the immediate prescription of anticoagulation pending ultrasound. This rule should be externally validated before its use in clinical practice can be recommended."

It is diagnosed in the second trimester during a structural ultrasound. Even though the reported incidence is 2.2%, it remains infrequent, because it is not searched routinely. The pathogenesis is uncertain, resulting from an increase on the circulating blood volume thus in the cardiac afterload, associated to a thinning of the vessel wall, for an inadequate intima development. Ductus arteriosus aneurysm can be classified according by their diameter as small (<7 mm.) and large (> or =8 mm). The smaller commonly closes spontaneously in 70% of the cases, unlike the larger one, they are associate in a greater number of complications, such as thrombosis, embolism, infection, compression effects of adjacent structures and spontaneous rupture. The absence of spontaneous closure, according to the symptoms and possible complications, a neonatal surgical closure should be considered.

CD011053,0,2585215,0,Maternal-fetal transport of vitamin K1 and its effects on coagulation in premature infants.,"We conducted a prospective study to determine (1) the maternal-fetal vitamin K1 transport in premature infants after vitamin K1 was given to the mothers antenatally and (2) the vitamin K1 effects on blood coagulation in the babies. Women in labor at less than or equal to 34 weeks of gestation were randomly selected to receive antenatal vitamin K1, 5 mg given intramuscularly (vitamin K1 group), or no vitamin K1 (control group). Eight infants, including one set of twins, were in the vitamin K1 group and six in the control group. Vitamin K1 concentrations were higher in the vitamin K1 group than in the control group (p = 0.06). Activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged, and factor II coagulation activity and factor II antigen were proportionately decreased in cord plasma in both groups. The average ratio of factor II coagulation activity to antigen was not decreased in either group. Protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) was not detectable in any cord plasma sample in either group. These findings support previous reports that the decreased vitamin K-dependent coagulation activity in premature infants is the result of reduced synthesis of precursor proteins, rather than the result of vitamin K deficiency, and suggest that additional vitamin K1 is not likely to improve coagulation activity. Among those infants who underwent cranial ultrasonography, all four in the vitamin K1 group and one of five in the control group had mild intraventricular hemorrhage. Studies of a larger number of patients are necessary before it can be established that maternal antenatal administration of vitamin K1 results in improvement of coagulation and the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants."

Clinically differentiating the 2 diseases on clinical grounds may be difficult. The main objective of this study was to identify predictors differentiating CVT from AIS in a large cohort of young Asian women, based on risk factors and investigations. Twelve centers in 8 Asian countries participated. Women aged 15-45 years were included if they had a diagnosis of first-ever symptomatic AIS or CVT confirmed by brain computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance venography. Patients with head trauma, cerebral contusions, intracranial hemorrhage, and subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage were excluded. Data, including demographic data, risk factor assessment, neuroimaging studies, blood tests, and cardiac studies, were collected by retrospective and then prospective chart review between January 2001 and July 2008. Outcome was based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at admission, discharge, and latest follow-up. A total of 958 patients (204 with CVT and 754 with AIS) were included in the study. Age under 36 years, anemia, pregnancy or postpartum state, and presence of hemorrhagic infarcts on computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging were significant predictors of CVT on univariate analysis. Age over 36 years, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recent myocardial infarction, electrocardiogram abnormalities, and blood glucose level >150 mg/dL were strong predictors of AIS. On multivariate analysis, postpartum state and hemorrhagic infarct were the strongest predictors of CVT (P < .001). Mortality was comparable in the 2 patient groups. Prognosis was significantly better for patients with CVT than for those with AIS (mRS score 0-2, 74% v 46%; P < .001). There was no difference in outcome between patients with obstetric and nonobstetric CVT. Our data indicate that in young Asian women, predictors of CVT differ from those for AIS. These findings could be useful in the early identification and diagnosis of patients with CVT."

CD011053,0,20433268,0,Giant dural venous sinus ectasia in neonates.,"In this report, the authors describe 4 recent cases of posterior giant dural venous sinus ectasia in neonates diagnosed during pregnancy and encountered at 3 different institutions. Posterior giant venous sinus ectasia was diagnosed in 4 patients using antenatal ultrasonography and confirmed in 2 patients using prenatal MR imaging and in 3 patients using postnatal MR angiography. In 2 children angiography was performed at the age of 6 months. The pregnancy was terminated in 1 case, and the fetus underwent an autopsy. The 3 children who were born presented with various degree of cardiac insufficiency and were admitted to the intensive care unit after birth. Signs of increased intracranial pressure were present immediately after birth, including a bulging fontanel. No endovascular treatment was used in these cases. Surgery was performed in 2 cases as an attempt to alleviate increased intracranial pressure symptoms, without any real benefit. A slow venous flow in the ectasia was shown by ultrasonography in the case in which the pregnancy was terminated. Angiography or MR angiography did not show an obvious arteriovenous malformation in any of the cases, but an arteriovenous fistula secondary or contributing to the formation of the venous ectasia is one of the physiopathological hypotheses of the cause of this condition. Interestingly, spontaneous progressive thrombosis and regression of the intravascular component of the venous sinus ectasia was observed in all cases. The clinical outcome was acceptable in 1 child (who had a moderate handicap after the surgery) and good for the other 2 children (who had normal neurological development). Stratified thrombi of different ages are found in these giant venous ectasias and develop within the leaves of the dura close to the confluence of the major posterior venous sinuses. Therefore, it appears that the formation of a progressive thrombosis represents the normal evolution of these giant dural venous sinus ectasias, which explains the favorable outcome in some cases without specific surgical treatment, except for resuscitation techniques."

Most subamniotic hematomas are found after birth and result from excessive traction on the umbilical cord at delivery. The development of these lesions has been rarely reported in utero. We report here five cases of subamniotic hematomas diagnosed by ultrasound between 18 and 30 weeks of gestation. The sonographic features were those of a poorly reflective oval-shaped cystic mass overlying the fetal plate of the placenta and covered in a thin membrane. In all the cases, a cystic structure containing a thrombotic mass arising from the amniotic membrane, which was attached to the fetal placental surface, was found after delivery. A high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level was found retrospectively in the four cases for which this information was available. Two pregnancies were complicated by slow fetal growth, one by vaginal bleeding and one by polyhydramnios. These findings demonstrated that subamniotic hematoma can be accurately diagnosed in utero by ultrasound and differentiated from other lesions of the placental chorionic plate.

LMW heparins have been shown to be safe when used during pregnancy as they do not cross the placenta. Up to now, they have been used mainly in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and rarely in the treatment of acute DVT in pregnant women. In a prospective observational study, we compared the effectiveness and safety of the LMW heparin, dalteparin, with UF heparin in the initial treatment (first week) of DVT during pregnancy. After confirmation of DVT by ultrasonography, 10 women were treated with UF heparin (25,430 IU/day, mean) and 21 women with dalteparin (16,000 IU/day, mean) for 7 days and, thereafter, all women were given treatment doses of LMW heparin for another 2 weeks. The dose was then gradually decreased and kept at a high prophylactic dose until delivery. One patient in the dalteparin group had recurrence of DVT 2 weeks after starting the treatment. No differences were observed between the groups in symptoms or bleeding complications during pregnancy and delivery. Our results indicate that LMW heparin is as effective and safe as UF heparin for the first week of treatment, but LMW heparin has the advantage of being easily administered and few laboratory controls are required."

Intra-uterine death of one of the fetuses occurred at 21 weeks amenorrhoea and a 2,550 g girl was born by vaginal delivery at 36 weeks. The Apgar score at birth was 10/10. In a review of the literature on vascular events in fertilization, programmes showed that severe syndromes of ovarian hyperstimulation, endogenous hyperestrogenism, multiple pregnancy and predominance of upper limb are the most frequently observed criteria. We emphasize the importance of preventing these thromboembolic events with subcutaneous heparin during the first trimester of pregnancy followed by low-molecular weight heparin, particularly in patients with a history of thromboembolism and/or patients with severe ovarian hyperstimulation."

The apparent cause of fetal death was a cord hematoma at the site of puncture, with umbilical vein thrombosis. The hematoma appears to have been related to injection of pancuronium before confirmation of needle placement, resulting in creation of a dead space in the cord adjacent to the puncture site. A total of 68 such procedures performed on 23 fetuses with three fetal deaths (4%) have been reported.

Female neonate (birth weight 1150 g, Apgar scores 6, 7 and 7) was born with respiratory distress syndrome, moderate anemia and grades I and II intraventricular hemorrhage. Ophthalmic examination revealed an enormous pre-retinal hemorrhage with accompanying thrombotic changes typical of retinal vein in the fundus of the left eye. Episcleritis was found in the anterior segment of the eye and later confirmed by ultrasound. Laboratory tests showed increased levels of maternal antibodies aCL IgG, antybeta2GP1 IgG and antybeta2GP1 IgM. No ANA, LA and SS-A/SS-B antibodies were detected. Increased concentrations of aCL IgG and a lengthening APTT were observed in newborn blood at first but the parameters normalized by 6 months of age. Our observations allowed us to conclude that early examination of neonates born to mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome is essential as it allows fast identification of pathological retinal changes by means of assessing the presence of aPL antibodies."
CD011053,0,11275658,0,Fetal and neonatal cerebral infarcts.,"Focal arterial infarction in the full-term newborn is an important cause of acquired cerebral lesions in the perinatal period. Clinical motor seizures, most often unifocal, are the nearly constant disclosing symptom confirmed by focal EEG abnormalities. A multifactorial physiopathology is usual, including genetic and perinatal environmental factors. In the past decade, various acquired or genetic thrombophilias have been discussed as risk factors. For several of the involved mechanisms, the excitotoxic cascade could represent a common final pathway leading to neuronal cell death. Early magnetic resonance imaging studies and EEG help to identify the newborns with strokes who are likely to develop hemiplegia and disabilities at school. Protection of the human fetal brain remains difficult, since the triggering factor initiating the excitotoxic cascade is rarely observed. Treatment of seizures is nevertheless necessary, because it seems that they accelerate anoxia-induced neuronal death in animal models of focal hypoxic ischemia."

CD011053,0,17007732,0,Evaluation and treatment of papilledema in pregnancy.,"Papilledema is defined as optic disk edema that is secondary to increased intracranial pressure. During pregnancy, papilledema poses additional diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. As in the nonpregnant patient, the primary goal is to urgently determine the cause of the papilledema followed by implementing appropriate management for life-threatening conditions in a timely fashion while safeguarding the fetus. Papilledema may occur also in conditions that are not life threatening; in either case, papilledema may cause visual failure. We describe the two most common causes of papilledema during pregnancy, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and cerebral venous thrombosis. In the former, there is no threat to life, while in the latter, depending on the extent of the cerebral venous thrombosis, life-threatening medical issues may dominate the picture. In these conditions, attention to the prevention of visual failure is of major importance; however, treatment options may need to be modified to safeguard the developing fetus. In this article, we review the current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with papilledema, emphasizing special considerations for the pregnant patient, including a chart to help the clinician differentiate between the different conditions causing papilledema. A flow chart suggests an approach as to how to monitor vision function and steps to take to prevent visual loss in these conditions causing papilledema. Drugs that may be considered in the management of papilledema are reviewed, and the FDA information regarding their safety for the fetus is provided."
CD011053,0,25387211,0,"Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.","Pregnancy and the puerperium put women at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to both baseline maternal risk factors and the development of pregnancy-related prothrombotic anatomic and physiologic changes. Pregnant women are at an approximately 5-fold increased risk of VTE compared with nonpregnant women, and the risk of VTE increases further (to ‚â• 20-fold) in puerperium; risk remains increased until approximately 12 weeks postpartum. Pregnancy-related VTE accounts for about 10% of maternal deaths in the developed world. Clinicians should promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms suspicious for VTE, generally starting with ultrasound of the lower extremities. For treatment of women with established VTE, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are preferred due to a favorable safety and efficacy profile. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and potentially fondaparinux are alternatives. Warfarin should be avoided in the antepartum period due to teratogenicity, and the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are currently not recommended due to the lack of data. Low molecular weight heparin, UFH, and warfarin are all acceptable in the postpartum period and for breast-feeding women, but the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants should be avoided. Prophylaxis (generally with LMWH or in some cases UFH) is recommended for women at highest risk of pregnancy-related VTE, such as those with inherited thrombophilias and a strong family or personal history of VTE. Prophylaxis with LMWH and aspirin is recommended for women with antiphospholipid syndrome. Clinicians should engage in multidisciplinary discussion, particularly around the time of delivery, to manage the details of anticoagulation in their pregnant patients."

CD011053,0,224197,0,Role of oral contraceptive agents in the pathogenesis of liver tumors.,"Since the introduction of oral contraceptive steroids in 1960 there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of benign liver tumors. Epidemiologic and other evidence links focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic cell adenoma to the use of these agents. The risk increases with long-term exposure. The majority of patients were less than 35 years old. Most patients were exposed to mestranol (ME) alone or alternately with ethinylestradiol, both synthetic steroidal estrogens. Inability to demethylate ME in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes may allow massive accumulation of oncogenic metabolites. This is probably a pharmacogenetic variable in a small number of women. Cholestasis, hypervascularity, induction of intracellular enzyme systems, thrombogenesis, and thickening of arterial and venous walls are other known effects of synthetic estrogens and progestogens. All may contribute to the pathogenesis of liver tumors. Many patients are asymptomatic until there is rapid expansion of the tumor. Pain occurs when Glisson's capsule stretches. Intrahepatic bleeding and liver rupture are common sequelae. Ligation of the hepatic artery may be lifesaving in the face of exsanguinating liver bleeding. Reports of regression with observation alone are encouraging. Instances of progression of unresected adenomas to rupture during subsequent pregnancy dictate avoidance of sex steroids in patients with hepatic neoplasia. Sonography, computerized axial tomography, radionuclide scans, and selective celiohepatic angiography are useful methods for the diagnosis of liver tumor in the symptomatic patient. There is a primary need to develop biochemical methods for detecting patients at risk for developing liver tumors. Epidemiologic research and central reporting of case histories are needed in the search for common factors."
CD011053,0,18845336,0,Vasoactivity to and endogenous release of vascular endothelial growth factor in the in vitro perfused human placental lobule from pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent, physiologically relevant, vasodilator of the human term fetoplacental vasculature of placental lobules from normal pregnancy. There is evidence that VEGF and its receptors are dysregulated in preeclampsia (PE). Here, we used dual perfusion of the human placental lobule to test the hypothesis that the VEGF vasodilatory effect on the fetoplacental circulation is altered in PE and examined how vascular responsiveness relates to circulating levels of free VEGF in fetal sera in this disease. Umbilical cord sera and fetal venous perfusate concentrations of free VEGF from pregnancies complicated with PE were significantly lower compared to the normal group (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). There was elevated in vitro placental release of the sequestrating soluble receptor, sVEGFR-1, into the fetal-side perfusate with PE compared to the normal group (P<0.05). The umbilical sera PlGF-1 level was higher by an order of magnitude in the fetal circulation in PE compared to normal pregnancy (P<0.0001), with the placenta appearing to contribute appreciably to these levels. Placental net contribution to maternal systemic free VEGF levels appeared to be negligible in both groups. sVEGFR-1 levels were elevated in the maternal-side venous perfusate with PE compared to the normal pregnancy (P<0.01). Perfused lobules from PE pregnancy exhibited an enhanced fetoplacental vasodilatory response to exogenous VEGF (P<0.001), with a longer recovery time (P<0.05), compared to the normal control group. Extrapolation of our combined functional and biochemical data suggests that a decrease in the in vivo circulating levels of free VEGF in PE is likely to contribute to compromised fetoplacental vascular patency in this disease."

Part II.,"Ultrasonographic assessment, although not always possible throughout the entire length of the umbilical cord, may assist in the diagnosis of congenital and functional anomalies of this structure. In such fashion, prenatal ultrasound may outline normal anatomy or alternatively depict various congenital abnormalities of the umbilical cord including: cysts; pseudocysts umbilical vein varix; persistent right umbilical vein; angiomyxomas; aneurysm (arterial or venous); single, hypoplastic or fused umbilical artery; hematomas (spontaneous or iatrogenic); velamentous insertion; vasa previa. The umbilical cord coiling index, an additional ultrasonographic morphologic feature, may identify patients at risk for adverse perinatal outcome. Conditions of potential fetal compromise due to umbilical cord compression including nuchal cords, true knots, occult prolapse, cord presentation, fetal grasping, and cord entanglement in monoamniotic twins, may be detected prenatally; and impaired umbilical flow can be confirmed with Doppler flow velocimetry. Ultrasound has been widely used to guide invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures involving access to umbilical circulation.

Fifty-four to 74¬†% of claims are based on cardiotocographic (CTG) abnormalities and their interpretation followed by inappropriate or delayed reactions. A critical analysis is performed about the nine criteria identified by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics in their task force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy: four essential criteria defining neonatal asphyxia and five other suggesting an acute intrapartum event sufficient to cause cerebral palsy in term newborns. The importance of placental histologic examination is emphasized in order to confirm sudden catastrophic events occurring before or during labor or to detect occult thrombotic processes affecting the fetal circulation, patterns of decreased placenta reserve and adaptative responses to chronic hypoxia. It may also exclude intrapartum hypoxia by revealing some histologic patterns typical of acute chorioamnionitis and fetal inflammatory response or compatible with metabolic diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the infant's damaged brain is very contributive to elucidate the mechanism and timing of asphyxia in conjunction with the clinical picture, by locating cerebral injuries predominantly in white or grey matter. Intrapartum asphyxia is sometimes preventable by delivering weak fetuses by cesarean sections before birth, by avoiding some ""sentinel"" events, and essentially by responding appropriately to CTG anomalies and performing an efficient neonatal resuscitation. During litigation procedures, it is necessary to have access to a readable CTG, a well-documented partogram, a complete analysis of umbilical cord gases, a placental pathology and an extensive clinical work-up of the newborn infant including cerebral MRI. Malpractice litigation in obstetric care can be reduced by permanent CTG education, respect of national CTG guidelines, use of adjuncts such as fetal blood sampling for pH or lactates, regular review of adverse events in Clinical Risk Management (CRM) groups and periodic audits about low arterial cord pH in newborns, admission to neonatal unit, the need for assisted ventilation and the decision-to-delivery interval for emergency operative deliveries. Considering the fast occurrence of fetal cerebral hypoxic injuries, and thus despite an adequate management, many intrapartum asphyxias will not be preventable. Conversely, well-documented hypoxic-ischemic brain insults during the antenatal period do not automatically exclude intrapartum suboptimal obstetric care."

CD011053,0,10852470,0,Expression and relationship between endothelin-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and inducible/endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA isoforms from normal and preeclamptic placentas.,"Preeclampsia is a mainly vascular disease of pregnancy, probably caused by an imbalance between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor agents that results in generalized vasospasm and poor perfusion in many organs. Among these factors, endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, is highly increased in preeclamptic women, while nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator of human utero-placental arteries, is reduced in the same patients. The present study was designed to investigate the interactions between ET-1 and the NO system in the feto-placental unit; to this purpose we also examined the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of ET-1, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS) in human cultured placental trophoblastic cells obtained from preeclamptic (PE) and normotensive (NT) pregnancies. We also studied whether exogenous ET-1 may affect the expression of iNOS and eNOS in human placental trophoblastic cells. Interestingly, by Northern blot analysis we observed an increased ET-1 mRNA expression level in PE trophoblastic cells compared to NT trophoblastic cells. Furthermore, exogenous ET-1 (10(-7) mol/L) was able to up-regulate its own mRNA expression in both NT and PE trophoblastic cells. iNOS and eNOS mRNA expression was then detected, by semiquantitative PCR, in both NT and PE trophoblastic cells. PE trophoblastic cells expressed lower iNOS mRNA levels compared with NT pregnancies. On the contrary, eNOS mRNA expression was higher in PE trophoblastic cells than in NT cells. Moreover, in the presence of ET-1 we observed a decrease in iNOS and an increase in eNOS mRNA expression levels in both NT and PE trophoblastic cells compared with the respective untreated cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ET-1 expression is increased in PE cells, whereas iNOS, which represents the main source of NO synthesis, is decreased; conversely, eNOS expression is increased. Finally, ET-1 is able to influence its own as well as NOS isoform expression in normal and PE trophoblastic cultured cells. These findings suggest the existence of a functional relationships between ET(s) and NOS isoforms that could constitute the biological mechanism leading to the reduced placental blood flow and increased resistance to flow in the feto-maternal circulation, which are characteristic of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pointed to a large hematoma in the subchorionic region. Simultaneously, the amniotic fluid was brownish colored. From these findings, it was possible to have prenatal diagnosis of massive subchorionic thrombohematoma. At 32 weeks' gestation, the fetus died in utero and was stillborn 3 days later. Pathological findings for the placenta revealed a large hematoma diffused between the villous chorion and the chorionic plate, with wide necrosis of placental tissue, likely due to formation of multiple thrombi.

Treatment of severe viral hepatitis by hemoperfusion was initially adopted in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following 10 years of development in China, a plasma exchange (PE)-centered artificial liver support system (ALSS), principally dependent on PE technology was developed. Based on the condition and symptoms of each patient, PE was given alone, or combined with hemodialysis, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration, hemoperfusion, or plasma perfusion. In the late 1990s, training courses for ALSS were developed, and ALSS began to be carried out across China. Guidelines for artificial liver therapy were formulated and published by the Artificial Liver and Liver Failure Group of the Chinese Society of Infection. In recent years, new methods have been attempted, including small pore-size plasma separators, a molecular adsorbent-based recirculating system (MARS), and a continuous albumin purification system (CAPS). According to a retrospective analysis published in 2004, ALSS therapy significantly (P < 0.001) improved the survival rate of patients with severe hepatitis compared with patients who received only medicines (43.4%, 157/362 vs. 15.4%, 55/358 in chronic patients and 78.9%, 30/38 vs. 11.9%, 5/42 in acute and subacute patients). Furthermore, ALSS has also proved valuable as a bridge to liver transplantation in the treatment of patients with end-stage severe hepatitis in China. More recently, ALSS has been used in the treatment of drug-induced liver failure, acute fatty liver during pregnancy, and other difficult-to-treat disorders in China."

CD011053,0,23850136,0,Role of inflammatory proteins S100A8 and S100A9 in pathophysiology of recurrent early pregnancy loss.,"Altered expression of inflammatory molecule at the maternal fetal interface is associated with early pregnancy loss. S100A8 and S100A9 are inflammatory proteins and they exhibit cytokine like function enhancing leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site. Reports from mouse model suggest the role of S100A8 with the vasculature of the decidual tissue and leukocyte recruitment during early pregnancy. Hence we hypothesized that maternal overexpression of S100A8 & S100A9 might increase the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes in maternal-fetal interface resulting in uteroplacental perfusion deficiency, development of thrombotic events, and placental hypoxia, eventually embryo abortion. In the present study we investigated altered expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in 25 recurrent early pregnancy loss (REPL) patients compared to 40 induced abortion subjects as controls. S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA were evaluated using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. To determine if differential expression pattern of these transcripts is translated to protein western blot analysis was performed.S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA and protein level were significantly increased in endometrial decidua tissue (p < 0.05) of REPL patients as compared to controls. This is the first report predicting the role of inflammatory molecules S100A8 & S100A9 in REPL. It opens a new perspective for understanding significance of S100A8 and S100A9 in pregnancy maintenance and outcome."
CD011053,0,19464511,0,Imitators of severe pre-eclampsia.,"There are many obstetric, medial, and surgical disorders that share many of the clinical and laboratory findings of patients with severe pre-eclampsia-eclampsia. Imitators of severe pre-eclampsia-eclampsia are life-threatening emergencies that can develop during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. These conditions are associated with high maternal and perinatal mortalities and morbidities, and survivors may face long-term sequelae. The pathophysiologic abnormalities in many of these disorders include vasospasm, platelet activation or destruction, microvascular thrombosis, endothelial cell dysfunction, and reduced tissue perfusion. Some of these disorders include acute fatty liver of pregnancy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, acute exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and disseminated herpes simplex and sepsis syndromes. Differential diagnosis may be difficult due to the overlap of several clinical and laboratory findings of these syndrome. It is important that the clinician make the accurate diagnosis when possible because the management and complications from these syndromes may be different. Because of the rarity of these conditions during pregnancy and postpartum, the available literature includes only case reports and case series describing these syndromes. This review focuses on diagnosis, management, and counseling of women who develop these syndromes based on results of recent studies and my own clinical experience."

Despite the active treatment with steroids and IVIG the platelet count dropped to extremely low levels in the third trimester--8 x 10(9)/l. Labor was induced in 34 w.g. because of the ineffective treatment of AIT, clinical and sonographic evidence of IUGR and favorable pelvic score. Before and during labor induction platelets were transfused and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was applied. After delivery antifibrinolytics as well as low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] were applied also. Laboratory tests demonstrated transient fibrinolysis activation after delivery. Mild transient thrombocytopenia of the newborn was found that was successfully treated with steroids. Review of contemporary literature is made with analysis of the therapeutic approaches in cases of AIT during pregnancy. The impact of thrombocytopenia on pregnancy, labor and delivery, the fetus and the newborn and the route of delivery are discussed. The clinical course and the therapeutic strategies in the particular case are analyzed. A nouvelle approach during labor and after delivery was the application of rFVIIa (because of the tendency for elevation of the titers of allogenic antibodies due to platelet transfusions) and of antifibrinolytics (preserving platelet functions)."

Patients are prone to bouts of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, disease manifestation needs a second trigger event. Pregnancy is a known risk factor for TTP. Patients with USS may manifest during pregnancy and the postpartum period or relapse with a TTP bout. Before plasma therapy mortality for both the mother and the fetus was high, but even nowadays when plasma is delivered, therapy is challenging, still bearing a high risk for miscarriage or long term sequelae for the mother. In this report on pregnancies in three mothers with USS, plasma therapy was increased in frequency and amount given with regard to platelet count or ADAMTS13 activity, thus leading to a successful outcome."

To investigate if this drug, even in a low dose, could expose the newborn to hemorrhagic complications, we studied ten neonates whose mothers had been taking 50 mg/day of Aspirin from the 12th week of pregnancy until delivery and compared them with eight newborns whose mothers didn't take the drug. No hemorrhagic complications (emathemesis, ecchymoses or petechiae, subconjunctival hemorrhage, cephaloematomas etc.) were observed in the fetuses exposed to Aspirin or in the control group. No hemorrhagic lesions were found by ultrasound brain scan on the fourth day of life. Newborns exposed to Aspirin showed a significantly lower thromboxane concentration on the first day of life (median 73 ng/ml versus 217 ng/ml); however on the fourth day the level of serum thromboxane in the cases exposed reached the values of the unexposed ones (median 146 ng/ml versus 143 ng/ml). In conclusion low dose Aspirin in pregnancy can be considered a safe drug without and adverse effect on the newborn."

CD011053,0,1945260,0,Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy.,"Early diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate prophylaxis may prevent serious maternal sequelae of thromboembolism. Objective techniques for diagnosis should be used aggressively, using noninvasive methods such as Doppler or IPG when possible for DVT. 125I-fibrinogen should be avoided. The possible consequences of failure to treat or unnecessary use of anticoagulant therapy outweigh risks to the fetus of the appropriate radiologic procedures. Because of its low fetal risk, heparin is the anticoagulant of choice. Measurement of heparin levels by antifactor Xa activity appears to be more sensitive than the current standard, the aPTT, and it is hoped that this will become widely available. Although the risks and benefits of prophylaxis during pregnancy are currently debated, it appears most prudent to use subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis in doses larger than for nonpregnant patients in women at high risk for recurrence."

CD011053,0,10215477,0,MRI appearance of the pelvis in the post cesarean-section patient.,"Fever in the post-cesarean section patient may indicate the presence of a potentially life-threatening complication, including abscess, ovarian vein thrombosis, and uterine dehiscence. Imaging findings are often utilized to ascertain the presence or absence of such complications. Familiarity with the normal findings in the post-operative period is essential in making this determination. The purpose of this investigation is to describe the MRI appearance of the post-cesarean section pelvis. Over a 67-month period, 50 patients with persistent low-grade fevers following c-section were referred for MR imaging. Imaging was performed 3-10 days post-operatively. Axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted images were acquired in addition to sagittal T2-weighted images. Coronal images were obtained in some cases. Clinical correlation was obtained through the patients charts, confirming discharge of the patients in stable condition. The uterine incision site usually demonstrated findings consistent with subacute hematoma. The anterior uterine myometrium demonstrated enlargement relative to the posterior uterine wall. Bladder flap hematomas were seen in 64% of cases. Three cases (6%) demonstrated parametrial edema and none of these patients demonstrated ovarian vein thrombosis. Two cases of pelvic hematoma were noted. The normal post-c-section incision site may demonstrate increased or decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images and intact endometrial and serosal layers mitigate against the diagnosis of incisional dehiscence. Bladder flap hematomas occurred in slightly more than half the cases. Parametrial edema and pelvic hematoma can be seen as post-surgical changes."

Sonography with color Doppler imaging is the key imaging modality for prenatal diagnosis of torcular herophili thrombosis. Typical prenatal sonographic findings include a well-defined triangular anechoic collection in the occipital region and an echogenic structure within the collection, which represents the thrombus. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging is usually used as an adjunctive modality for prenatal diagnosis, as it confirms the diagnosis by providing more precise anatomic information and better characterization of the lesion. We present 2 cases of thrombosis of an ectatic torcular herophili with serial sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging examinations, as well as a review of the literature regarding the prenatal diagnosis of torcular herophili thrombosis."

Other etiologies include coagulopathies, infection and head injury. We have present two DST cases following head injury. The first case was a 35-year-old man hospitalized because of one-week history of headache and repeated vomiting after a mild head injury. Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, right transverse and sigmoid sinuses and right jugular vein was determined on angiography. The second case was a 25- year-old man operated on for epidural hematoma at the posterior fossa. Meningitis developed and an abducens palsy was determined. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated thrombosis of the right transverse and sigmoid sinus. Low molecular weight heparin was administrated for three months. Both cases had good recovery, but one had recanalisation of the thrombosis. Intracranial hematomas, depressed skull fracture or skull fracture that cross the sinus can obstruct the blood flow in the sinus. Moreover, closed head injury may cause to DST.

CD011053,0,16189171,0,Acute adrenal failure as the heralding symptom of primary antiphospholipid syndrome: report of a case and review of the literature.,"Acute adrenal failure is a potentially fatal condition if overlooked. Occasionally, acute adrenal insufficiency may ensue from bilateral adrenal haemorrhage in patients with known antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is characterized by recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis, pregnancy complications and detection of autoantibodies to phospholipids. This syndrome may be associated with non-organ specific diseases (e.g. connective tissue disorders) or with malignancies, but it may also appear in isolated form (primary APS). In a very few cases the heralding manifestation is given by adrenal failure. We report here a 63-year-old man presenting with acute adrenal insufficiency as the opening clinical manifestation of an APS. We also carried out a computer-aided search of the literature to identify all cases of primary adrenal failure as the first-recognized expression of a primary APS, a condition that not so infrequently may be tackled by endocrinologists. 20 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The great majority of them were males (75%) with a mean age of 42 years. Abdominal pain was present in 14 patients, followed by fever (13 patients) and hypotension (12 patients). The main morphological findings by computed tomography or magnetic resonance were consistent with bilateral adrenal haemorrhage in 11 patients. Lupus anticoagulant was present in all of the 19 tested patients. Our observations emphasize the importance in the assessment of clotting times, and possibly of antiphospholipid antibodies, in all patients with diagnosis of rapidly progressive adrenal failure and concurrent abdominal pain."

CD011053,0,19853925,0,"Dysregulation of anti-angiogenic agents (sFlt-1, PLGF, and sEndoglin) in preeclampsia--a step forward but not the definitive answer.","Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific syndrome characterized by hypertension, proteinuria and edema, which resolves on placental delivery. It is thought to be the consequence of impaired placentation due to inadequate trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral arteries. In PE the maternal plasma concentration of free vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) is decreased whereas the concentration of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and of soluble endoglin (sEng) is increased. These soluble receptors may bind VEGF, PLGF and TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta3 in the maternal circulation, causing endothelial dysfunction in many maternal tissues. Hence there is a view that the pathogenesis is more or less clarified. According to the vascular theory, poor placentation leads to poor uteroplacental perfusion and hypoxia, which stimulates sFlt-1 and sEng production causing the maternal syndrome. This assumption has been recently challenged. The role of hypoxia as the main stimulus for release of sFlt-1 has been questioned and the role of inflammatory mechanisms has been emphasized. According to this inflammatory theory, poor placentation may predispose more to placental oxidative stress than hypoxia and endothelial dysfunction may be part of a broader disorder of systemic inflammation. Finally, the recent demonstration of activating auto-antibodies to the angiotensin 1 receptor that experimentally play a major pathogenic role in PE further suggests a pleiotropism of aetiologies for this condition. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the recent hypotheses and their possible insights on early diagnosis, prevention and treatment."

We reviewed the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of 126 patients treated for RSH at Mayo Clinic from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2002. Most patients (64%) were women and the mean +/- SD age was 67.9 +/- 16.5 years. Most patients (69%) were on some form of anticoagulation therapy. The mean international normalized ratio was 2.6 +/- 2.4, and mean activated partial thromboplastin time was 64.2 +/- 42.7 seconds. No patients were pregnant or had a peritoneal dialysis catheter at the time of diagnosis. Approximately half of the patients (48%) had nonsurgical abdominal trauma around the time of diagnosis, with 37 patients (29%) having a cough. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were abdominal pain (84%) and an abdominal wall mass (63%). CT of the abdomen and pelvis was the most commonly used method to establish the diagnosis (83%). Most patients (86%) were successfully treated with symptom management and blood transfusion. Ten patients (7.9%) underwent surgery or endovascular embolization of bleeding vessels, and 2 patients (1.6%) died as a result of RSH bleeding. Although RSH is rarely fatal, the clinician should be aware of important risk factors that lead to RSH including female sex, older age, anticoagulation therapy, and cough or other abdominal trauma. Rapid diagnosis with directed history, physical examination, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis may help decrease unnecessary laparotomy and lead to better triage of patients who present with RSH."

CD011053,0,23332362,0,Diagnosis of acute neurological emergencies in pregnant and post-partum women.,"Acute neurological symptoms in pregnant and post-partum women could be caused by exacerbation of a pre-existing neurological condition, the initial presentation of a non-pregnancy-related problem, or a new acute-onset neurological problem that is either unique to or occurs with increased frequency during or just after pregnancy. Pregnant and postpartum patients with headache and neurological symptoms are often diagnosed with pre-eclampsia; however, a range of other causes must also be considered, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Precise diagnosis is essential to guide subsequent management. Our ability to differentiate between the specific causes of acute neurological symptoms in pregnant and post-partum patients is likely to improve as we learn more about the pathogenesis of these disorders."

The pregnant patient presenting with neurological problems poses both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, often forcing the clinician to rely on neuroimaging as part of the workup. This review discusses potential risks to the embryo and fetus posed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the imaging studies most often used to study the central nervous system. Imaging features of a variety of neurological conditions associated with pregnancy are discussed, including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, Wernicke's encephalopathy, cerebral venous thrombosis, ischemic stroke, postpartum angiopathy, and lymphocytic hypophysitis."

Fetal body and organ weights, and measurements of linear growth were recorded. The placentas were weighed and analyzed for prostaglandins (PGs), NO oxidation products (NOx), and total cellular protein levels. Placental prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and NOx levels increased (P < or = 0.05), while thromboxane B2 levels were suppressed (P < or = 0.01) in Cel-B group. Tail length and brain weight were greater, while lung weights were lower in the Cel-B group (P < or = 0.05). Maternal administration of celecoxib appears to preferentially increase placental vasodilators and decrease placental TxA2, suggesting that the drug may increase uteroplacental perfusion without adverse fetal outcome."

CD011053,0,15518286,0,[Sucessful pregnancy outcome following three severe placental abruptions and intrauterine fetal death in the patient--heterozygous carrier of R506Q mutation of factor V (Leiden)].,"A case of successful pregnancy outcome is reported in a patient with 3 preceding severe placental abruptions with intrauterine fetal death and caesarean deliveries. In the course of the current pregnancy heterozygosity for R506Q mutation of factor V (Leiden) was diagnosed in 26 weeks of gestation [w.g.] and low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] therapy initiated. Maternal condition was stable until delivery and all laboratory findings were within normal range. The fetus was followed up by ultrasound biometry and Doppler blood flow studies. From 28 w.g. on NST and biophysical profile were included. An emergency caesarean section was performed in 34 w.g. because of contractions not responding to tocolysis. The newborn was in good condition with weight and length corresponding to the 10th centile for gestational age [g.a]. Histologic study of the placenta showed anemic infarctions and recent haemorrhages in the basal and the chorionic plate. The initiation of LMWH therapy in the case reported was late (26 w.g.). By that moment there was already evidence of impaired fetal growth with fetal biometry corresponding to the 10th centile for g.a. After LMWH therapy was started no further slow down of fetal growth was registered. Successful pregnancy outcome may be related not only to LMWH therapy but also to other factors like active fetal monitoring after 28 w.g. and the emergency caesarian delivery immediately after the onset of uterine contractions. Patients with past obstetric history of severe preeclampsia, placental abruption or fetal growth restriction have to be screened for hereditary or acquired thrombophilia. If a thrombophillic state is present early LMWH therapy has to be considered. It is aimed to prevent anaemic placental infarctions and thrombotic complications."

CD011053,0,7886025,0,Reduced thromboxane receptor affinity and vasoconstrictor responses in placentae from diabetic pregnancies.,"Thromboxane has been implicated in the pathogenesis of maternal hypertension in high-risk pregnancies, but potential abnormalities in thromboxane-mediated constriction of fetoplacental vessels has not been examined. Using the isolated perfused fetoplacental cotyledon, we compared the vasoconstrictor responses to a thromboxane mimetic, U46619, in placentae from normal women and women with diabetes mellitus (classes C, D and R). Increases in perfusion pressure in response to bolus injections of U46619 were used to construct dose-response curves. The threshold dose of U46619 to cause a pressor response was similar in placentae from normal and diabetic pregnancies, but the slope of the dose-response curve was decreased by 39 per cent in placentae from diabetic pregnancies compared with normal controls (P < 0.01). To examine the potential contribution of altered thromboxane receptors, equilibrium binding studies were performed using the thromboxane antagonist [3H]-SQ29548 to a 44,000 g fraction of placental homogenate. The affinity of thromboxane receptors was significantly decreased in placentae from diabetic pregnancies compared with normal controls [Kd = 41.9 +/- 7.9, (n = 6) versus control, 21.4 +/- 1.3 nM (n = 26), P < 0.001]. In contrast, the density of thromboxane receptor sites was not significantly changed (diabetes, 176.0 +/- 6.2 versus control, 150.3 +/- 6.5 fmol/mg, P = not significant). Placental production of thromboxane and prostacyclin were measured by the incorporation of [14C]-arachidonic acid into [14C]-thromboxane B2 and [14C]-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, respectively. Incorporation of [14C]-arachidonic acid into both thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was similar in placentae from diabetic and normal pregnancies. We conclude that vascular responsiveness to thromboxane is reduced in placentae from mothers with diabetes by a receptor-mediated mechanism. These changes may contribute to abnormalities in the regulation of fetoplacental haemodynamics, growth and development in pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus."
CD011053,0,3407699,0,Septic shock during pregnancy.,"A multiinstitutional review of 10 pregnancies complicated by septic shock was undertaken to identify the clinical characteristics and hemodynamic alterations associated with this condition. Prolonged rupture of membranes with the subsequent development of chorioamnionitis or postpartum endometritis were risk factors that commonly preceded the diagnosis of septic shock. The majority of septic shock cases occurred during the puerperium. There were two maternal deaths in this selected series. Associated complications included pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary emboli, and cardiac arrest. The primary hemodynamic derangements were reduced systemic vascular resistance with depressed myocardial function. The mean initial systemic vascular resistance index in eight surviving women was 885 +/- 253 dyne.sec/cm5.m2. Despite an overall presenting cardiac index of 4.20 +/- 2.01 L/min/m2, five patients (50%) had evidence of myocardial depression based on analysis of their left ventricular function curves. Mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular stroke work index all showed significant improvement after therapy. A hemodynamic algorithm based on volume therapy, inotropic agents, and peripheral vasoconstrictors is offered. This therapeutic approach is designed to optimize cardiac performance and maintenance of organ perfusion in the critically ill patient with septic hypotension during pregnancy."

CD011053,0,22264931,0,Paradigm shift of childhood thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening generalized disease with pathological conditions termed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TTP is thought to predominantly affect adults and to rarely occur in children. Currently, TTP is defined by a severe deficiency in the activity of ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that specifically cleaves unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers under high shear stress. Genetic mutations in and acquired autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 cause congenital TTP (termed Upshaw-Schulman syndrome [USS]) and acquired TTP, respectively. Because of very few overt clinical signs for TTP, USS is often misdiagnosed as chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or overlooked during childhood. However, in women with USS, pregnancy can induce thrombocytopenia followed by the development of TTP. Furthermore, early childhood cases of acquired idiopathic TTP have not been characterized. From 1998 to 2008, our institution at Nara Medical University functioned as a TMA referral center in Japan and collected a large dataset on 919 TMA patients (Intern Med 2010;49:7-15). This registry contains 324 patients with a severe deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity, including 41 patients with USS and 283 patients with acquired TTP. Of note, the latter population contains 17 patients who were enrolled as children (‚â§ 15years old), including 14 children with idiopathic TTP and three with connective tissue disease-associated TTP. Of the 14 patients with idiopathic TTP, five were very young children (under 2 years old). This study focused on these 58 patients (41 USS and 17 acquired TTP) who were diagnosed with a severe deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity during childhood, causing a paradigm shift in our concept of TTP."
CD011053,0,2282745,0,Accidental hyperstimulation during ovulation induction.,"Clinical hyperstimulation is the most serious complication of ovulation induction, occurring in approximately 3% of cases (0.8% in the severe form). Paradoxically, it seems to be rare following in vitro fertilization, probably because all the follicles are aspirated. High-risk patients are those with polycystic ovarian disease, hyperprolactinaemia and hypothyroidism. All forms of ovulation induction have been implicated. Use of LHRH agonists have not reduced the incidence of hyperstimulation and they may even have increased it. An ongoing pregnancy seems to predispose to the occurrence of hyperstimulation, due to the secretion of hCG. Clinically, three stages of hyperstimulation have been described by the WHO (mild, moderate and severe). The pathophysiology is not completely understood, although prostaglandins, histamines and, especially, the ovarian renin-angiotensin system may be involved. Local ovarian complications and thromboembolic complications have also occurred. The treatment of severe hyperstimulation is both symptomatic (fluid replacement, aspiration of effusions, moderate sodium and water restriction, small doses of diuretics) and specific (corticosteroids, aspiration of ovarian cysts, even voluntary interruption of pregnancy in the most serious forms). If the hyperstimulation occurs in the absence of pregnancy, antihistamines or antiprostaglandins can be given. Prevention is exceedingly important. This can be helped by recognition of polycystic ovarian disease and stimulation of these cases by clomiphene citrate or pure FSH associated, for use in in vitro fertilization, with prolonged desensitization using LHRH agonists. Daily ultrasound and hormonal monitoring of ovulation induction is required. When there is excessive response to stimulation, it is prudent not to induce ovulation with hCG or, alternatively, to aspirate all the follicles and freeze the embryos obtained without giving further injections of hCG in the luteal phase. Clinical ovarian hyperstimulation is the classic form of iatrogenic disorder and is the most important complication of ovulation induction treatments, since it can be life-threatening in its most severe form. In this chapter we review current knowledge concerning the frequency, factors associated with its occurrence, clinical aspects, physiopathological mechanisms and, finally, the possibilities for treatment and prevention."

It is one of the main causes of pregnancy-related disorders, which may also result in harm for the conceptus. Successful pregnancies require an even balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis, in order to secure stabilization of the basal plate as well as adequate placental perfusion. Broad spectrum assays which measure a range of thrombin/fibrin formation in serum have become an established means of identifying activation of blood coagulation and/or fibrinolysis. There is considerable interest in the application of these assays to the diagnosis of other hypercoagulable states, such as thrombophilia during pregnancy. We investigated coagulation/fibrinolysis parameters for significant differences between pregnant women during their gestation (first, second and third trimester) with or without pregnancy loss and healthy nonpregnant women."

CD011053,0,22706239,0,Candidate biochemical markers for screening of pre-eclampsia in early pregnancy.,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of adverse outcomes. Their pathophysiology remains elusive, hampering the development of efficient prevention. The onset of HDP and PE and the severity of their clinical manifestations are heterogeneous. The advent of preventive measures, such as low-dose aspirin that targets high-risk women, emphasizes the need of better prediction. Until recently, only environmental information and maternal risk factors were considered, with equivocal predictive value. No validated screening procedures were available to identify at-risk women despite the emergence of Doppler ultrasonography parameters for the uterine artery (e.g., pulsatility index and bilateral notching) and pathophysiological biochemical markers (e.g., angiogenesis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction). Owing to its heterogeneity and lack of specific, sensitive markers among those studied so far (>200), PE is unlikely to be detected early by a single predictive parameter. Systematic reviews have concluded that no single test fulfilling World Health Organization criteria for biomarker selection can diagnose/predict a disease. However, by combining antenatal risk factors, clinical parameters, as well as biophysical and biochemical markers into multivariate algorithms, the risk of PE can be estimated with performance levels that could reach clinical utility. Performance characteristics of selected algorithms will be presented and discussed with respect to transferability to different geographic and healthcare environments."

After a cesarean section, generalized epileptic seizure occurred and intubation was necessary due to sustained unconsciousness. Despite magnesium therapy, bilateral hemodynamic ischemic infarctions and narrowing of the circle of Willis were visible on MRI, and vasospasm of all large basal cerebral arteries was confirmed by cerebral angiography and transcranial Doppler sonography. During the following 2 weeks, the cerebral vasospasm resolved with application of high-dose methyl prednisolone and nimodipine. After extubation, the patient initially suffered from mild psychosyndrome and ataxia but recovered completely after 3 months.

The previous experiences on patients with diseases of the lungs reveal that the regional function diagnostics of the lungs may be extended and improved by functional scintigraphic radiospirometry. Because of the determination of regional lung volumes restrictive lung diseases can be differentiated and analysed more exactly than it has been possible before by the examinations of perfusion and ventilation alone. A further advance of the determination of lung volume is that the question of functional operability can be cleared up exactly. In our opinion the routine use of the functional scintigraphic radiospirometry is justified. A contraindication for this kind of examination should only be pregnancy.

In the setting of a life-threatening illness, CT may be indicated to assess for potentially fatal complications such as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. After delivery, patients rarely develop serious problems requiring radiologic evaluation. When indicated, however, CT may be invaluable in making the diagnosis or determining the severity of peri- and post-partum complications, including uterine perforation, hemorrhage, endometritis, thrombophlebitis, and abscess formation. At times, CT may be the first to uncover conditions, such as post-partum cardiomyopathy, and heart failure, which are usually diagnosed by other modalities but may explain the symptoms for which the study was ordered. In some centers, CT pulmonary angiography represents the standard of care to diagnose pulmonary thromboembolism.

The association of congenital blindness with neonatal thrombocytopenia has not previously been reported. All children had clinical purpura in the neonatal period; in three cases, thrombocytopenia was confirmed, while in one case, the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia was presumptive; in two cases, there was evidence of circulating maternal serum platelet isoantibodies. Extensive investigation for intrauterine infection was negative in the three cases with confirmed thrombocytopenia. The thrombocytopenia resolved spontaneously after the neonatal period. It is postulated that the porencephalies were the consequence of prenatal cerebrovascular episodes. The etiology of the optic atrophy is unclear. Serial cranial ultrasound investigation is recommended for all neonates with thrombocytopenia, even if neurologically asymptomatic in the neonatal period, and serial prenatal cranial ultrasound investigation is recommended for infants of mothers with a history of having previously had infants with neonatal isoimmune thrombocytopenia."
CD011053,0,8743139,0,Regulation of human placental fetal vessel tone: role of nitric oxide.,"Factors affecting fetal vessel resistance have been studied in vitro in bilaterally perfused lobules of human placentae. Potent and efficacious constrictors in this preparation (in order of potency) include endothelin-1 > the thromboxane mimetic U46619 > endothelin-3 > prostaglandin F2 alpha. Inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis did not affect fetal vessel basal perfusion pressure, nor did they potentiate the effects of the vasoconstrictor U46619. In contrast, the nitric oxide inhibitors N omega-nitro-L-arginine (NOLA), haemoglobin and methylene blue all increased fetal vessel basal perfusion pressure and also increased U46619-induced constriction. Similarly, NOLA markedly potentiated the constrictor effects of endothelin-1, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine and bradykinin. These studies therefore provide evidence that NO is important in the maintenance of low basal fetal vessel impedance and also reduces the effects of a number of vasoconstrictor autacoids. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity of human placental homogenates has been measured and shown to be mainly calcium-dependent. Human placental NOS activity was not affected by labour state but was reduced in pre-eclampsia. No evidence was found that in pre-eclampsia raised concentrations of the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine were responsible for the reduced placental NOS activity. Hence, these studies provide evidence that NO is an important endogenous dilator of the fetal vessels of the human placenta and that reduced NOS activity could contribute to the pathogenesis and/or effects of pre-eclampsia."

Neonatal consequences include severe microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and hydrops. The associated high perinatal death rate (30-40%) has led to a number of prenatal therapeutic interventions with limited success in most cases. The authors present a case of non-immune fetal hydrops caused by a giant chorioangioma, diagnosed at 27 weeks of gestational age. Despite tocolytic therapy, the baby was born prematurely (28 weeks of gestational age) and required transfusion of blood derivatives, intensive phototherapy and exchange transfusion.

Recent studies implicate increased circulating endoglin as a contributor to the pathogenesis of PE. The objective of this study was to determine whether placental and circulating endoglin concentrations are altered in pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) infants and to address the role of hypoxia on the regulation of placental endoglin. We analyzed 10 placentas each from normal pregnant (NP), PE, and IUGR subjects. Endoglin levels were 2.5-fold higher in preeclamptic placentas compared to NP (15.4+/-2.6 versus 5.7+/-1.0, p<0.01). In contrast, endoglin levels were similar in NP and IUGR placentas (5.7+/-1.0 vs 5.9+/-1.1, p=NS). Placentas from pregnancies with both PE and IUGR exhibited endoglin levels comparable to the PE group and significantly different from normotensive pregnancies with and without IUGR pregnancies (mean 14.9+/-4.0, n=9, p=0.013). Soluble endoglin concentrations in maternal plasma were comparable in NP and IUGR, but higher in women with PE (n=10 per group, p<0.05). Despite a 2-fold increase in hypoxia inducible factor, HIF-1alpha, we did not observe endoglin upregulation in NP, PE, or IUGR placental villous explants exposed to hypoxia (2% oxygen). In contrast to PE, placental or circulating endoglin is not increased in normotensive women delivering small, asymmetrically grown (IUGR) infants at term. The placentas of women with IUGR appear to be fundamentally different from PE women with respect to endoglin, despite the proposed common pathology of deficient trophoblast invasion/spiral artery remodeling and poor placental perfusion."

Pregnancy should be planned following a preconceptional visit for counselling. Women with severe active disease or a high degree of irreversible damage, such as those with symptomatic pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, severe restrictive pulmonary disease or severe chronic renal failure should best avoid pregnancy. Treatment is based on hydroxychloroquine, low-dose steroids and azathioprine. Patients with antiphospholipid antibodies/syndrome should receive low-dose aspirin +/- low molecular weight heparin. The addition and the dose of heparin depend on the clinical profile of the patient, i.e. a previous history of miscarriage, foetal loss, placental insufficiency or thrombosis.

CD011053,0,10907452,0,[Pulmonary embolism and pregnancy].,"Pulmonary emboli are frequent during pregnancy and the post partum period and represent one of the major causes of maternal mortality during this period. It is estimated that there is an increased risk of thromboembolic venous disease during pregnancy at 1:1000 to 1:2000 pregnancies. This is explained by changes in the physiology and biology of coagulation factors and fibrinolysis. The risk is increased in those aged more than 35, the presence of a past history of thromboembolic venous disease; hereditary or acquired thrombophilia or delivery by caesarean section. The diagnosis should be confirmed with the same rigor as outside pregnancy. No diagnostic examination is contraindicated in those pregnant but the diagnostic strategy should be in favor of non-invasive examinations with ultrasonic venography of the lower limbs and/or pulmonary scintigraphy being the investigations of choice. The treatment of pulmonary emboli during pregnancy rests on heparin, coumarin being strictly contraindicated due to the risk of fetal malformation.

A significant number of these events appear to be caused by thromboembolic disease and, as with other childhood thrombotic problems, the incidence of central nervous system events appears highest during the neonatal period. In contrast to peripheral arterial and venous thrombotic problems, it is likely that a proportion of cerebral thromboembolic events occur either in utero or perinatally and reflect different risk factors from those occurring in older infants and children. The pathophysiology of perinatal stroke is complex and in many cases is likely to be multifactorial. It is now recognised that risk factors may relate to both maternal and placental problems as well as fetal and neonatal disorders. Large prospective studies of perinatal stroke are currently lacking and efforts to define the relative contribution from each of these areas are at an early stage. The complex nature of these disorders requires collaboration between a number of different disciplines including obstetrics, fetal medicine, pathology, neonatology and neurology. Of particular interest to haematologists is the possible impact of prothrombotic abnormalities in the pathophysiology of these events and also the potential for the use of antithrombotic agents in both management and prevention."

The end-point variables were low Apgar scores and adverse neonatal outcomes (respiratory distress syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, seizures, jaundice, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, thrombocytopenia, polycythemia, and neonatal mortality). Stepwise logistic regression was used to control for gestational age, oligohydramnios, and fetal growth restriction. Infants with AREDF had an increased frequency of hypoglycemia (odds ratio=1.7) and polycythemia (odds ratio=1.7), whereas the remaining neonatal outcomes were explained by gestational age and growth restriction. Therefore, live-born infants of preeclamptic patients with AREDF velocities, independent of prematurity and growth restriction, are prone to hypoglycemia and polycythemia."

CD011053,0,18824817,0,Maternal obesity and pregnancy.,"Obesity is a global health problem that is increasing in prevalence. The World Health Organization characterizes obesity as a pandemic issue, with a higher prevalence in females than males. Thus, many pregnant patients are seen with high body mass index (BMI). Obesity during pregnancy is considered a high-risk state because it is associated with many complications. Compared with normal-weight patients, obese patients have a higher prevalence of infertility. Once they conceive, they have higher rate of early miscarriage and congenital anomalies, including neural tube defects. Besides the coexistence of preexisting diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension, obese women are more likely to have pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, thromboembolism, macrosomia, and spontaneous intrauterine demises in the latter half of pregnancy. Obese women also require instrument or Cesarean section delivery more often than average-weight women. Following Cesarean section delivery, obese women have a higher incidence of wound infection and disruption. Irrespective of the delivery mode, children born to obese mothers have a higher incidence of macrosomia and associated shoulder dystocia, which can be highly unpredictable. In addition to being large at birth, children born to obese mothers are also more susceptible to obesity in adolescence and adulthood. Prevention is the best way to prevent this problem. As pregnancy is the worst time to lose weight, women with a high BMI should be encouraged to lose weight prior to conceiving. During preconception counseling, they should be educated about the complications associated with high a BMI. Obese women should also be screened for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In early pregnancy, besides being watchful about the higher association of miscarriage, obese women should be screened with ultrasound for congenital anomalies around 18 to 22 weeks. The ultrasound should be repeated close to term to check on the estimated fetal weight to rule out macrosomia. Obese pregnant women are screened for gestational diabetes around 24 to 28 weeks. During the second half of pregnancy, one needs to closely watch for signs and symptoms of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Once in labor, an early anesthesia consultation is highly recommended irrespective of delivery mode. When Cesarean section is performed, many obstetricians prefer an incision above the pannus to avoid skin infection. However, the incision should be decided upon the discretion of the surgeon. Peripartum, special attention is given to avoid thromboembolism by using compression stockings and early ambulation."

CD011053,0,18651147,0,Does pregnancy affect vascular enhancement in patients undergoing CT pulmonary angiography?,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pregnancy affects contrast enhancement within the pulmonary arteries during computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). This was a retrospective analysis of the CTPA examinations of 16 pregnant and 16 non-pregnant female patients, suspected of having an acute pulmonary embolus (PE), during the same time period. Pulmonary vascular enhancement was evaluated by measuring the CT density within the pulmonary arteries. In a blinded evaluation, subjective grading of contrast enhancement within the pulmonary arteries was also performed. There was a significant difference in arterial enhancement between the two groups, with pregnant patients having a mean pulmonary arterial density 112 HU less than patients in the control group [mean attenuation of 259.79 +/- 59.31 HU in pregnant patients versus 371.88 +/- 60.63 HU in non-pregnant patients (p < 0.001)]. The mean subjective pulmonary arterial enhancement score in the pregnant group was 8.19 +/- 2.51 versus 13.69 +/- 3.07 in the control group (p < 0.001). Pregnant women undergoing CTPA have significantly decreased pulmonary arterial enhancement compared to non-pregnant patients, probably due to the increase in cardiac output in pregnancy. We may need to reconsider how we perform CTPA in this group in order to ensure adequate opacification for diagnosis."
CD011053,0,18195162,0,Uterine vascular function in a transgenic preeclampsia rat model.,"We investigated intrauterine growth restriction, endothelial function, and uterine artery blood flow characteristics in a transgenic preeclampsia rat model with an activated renin-angiotensin system. We compared preeclamptic Sprague-Dawley (SD-PE) rats with normal pregnant Sprague-Dawley and nonpregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. We used transabdominal ultrasound and found that SD-PE rat embryos developed intrauterine growth restriction. Isolated uterine arteries from SD-PE rats incubated with phenylephrine exhibited an increased contractile response, whereas a single high dose of acetylcholine resulted in an impaired vasorelaxation compared with controls. Incremental acetylcholine doses increased relaxation of SD-PE vessels at low acetylcholine doses but caused a paradoxical contraction at higher acetylcholine doses. Indomethacin and a thromboxane-receptor antagonist (SQ 29,548) blocked this effect, suggesting maternal prostanoid-dependent endothelial dysfunction. SD-PE rats had a decreased prostacyclin (6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha):thromboxane ratio in the serum compared with normal pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats or nonpregnant Sprague-Dawley. Surprisingly, the Doppler resistance index decreased during pregnancy in SD-PE compared with normal pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats, suggesting unimpaired uteroplacental flow in the uterine artery. Umbilical flow was unchanged with absent end-diastolic flow in all of the groups. Renin-angiotensin system activation-induced preeclampsia is associated with altered placentation, modified resistance index, and endothelial dysfunction. A disturbed prostacyclin:thromboxane ratio could be an important mediator."

CD011053,0,21648352,0,Coexistance of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis and Dandy Walker malformation in newborn.,"Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis in neonatal period may cause neurological impairment, epilepsy, and lead to stroke. It is caused primarily by coagulopathy of numerous reasons, occasionally perinatal asphyxia, traumatic delivery and hyperhomocysteinemia. Dandy-Walker malformation is characterized by agenesis or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. Dandy-Walker malformation, variant, and mega cisterna magna represent a spectrum of developmental anomalies. Insults to developing cerebellar hemispheres and the fourth ventricle are believed to be the cause of malformation. Our patient was born from noncomplicated pregnancy, noncomplicated nontraumatic vaginal delivery at term, excellent Apgar scores, without peculiarities in clinical status. She was brest-fed by the 42nd hour of life when she had rightsided seizures during sleep that repeated for five times in next 24 hours. Brain Ultrasound (US) revealed clot in left lateral ventricle, slight dilatation of left ventricle, both sided periventricular echodensity, ischemia, slight enlargement of forth ventricle and a bit smaller cerebellum. There was no visible flow through left transverse, superior sagittal and straight sinus. Magnetic Resonance (MRI) confirmed the finding and showed thrombosis of left and right transverse venous sinuses and confluence of sinuses. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed leftsided focal changes. The newborn was treated with phenobarbiton for 8 days and had no convulsions during that period. All coagulation parameters, homocistein, lipoproteins (a) and D-dimers were normal. There were no mutations on FV R506Q, PT 20210A, MTHFR 677C/T. No antiphospholipides were found. Heart US showed no structural anomalies. No other patology or risk factors were present at the time. Before discharge, US showed hydrocephalus. Flow in affected sinuses was visible with color Doppler. MRI showed recanalization of affected sinuses, also hydrocephalus and presentation of Dandy Walker On EEG there was borderline finding. Due to progression of hydrocephalus ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed. In age of 1 year EEG was slower for age but without focus. Neurological development was normal for age. The question is whether this child had intrauterine insult and inception of Dandy Walker with further postnatal progress of thrombosis and evolution to full picture of Dandy Walker with hydrocephalus OR thrombosis that led to development of hydrocephalus and Dandy Walker malformation in this child were accidental coexistance."

CD011053,0,24101113,0,[Venous thromboembolism in pregnancy: current state of the art].,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality during pregnancy or early after delivery and it remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The latest Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (2006-2008) showed that VTE is now the third leading cause of direct maternal mortality, beside sepsis and hypertension. In particular the prevalence of VTE has been estimated to be 1 per 1000-2000 pregnancies. The risk of VTE is five times higher in a pregnant woman than in non-pregnant woman of similar age and postpartum VTE is more common than antepartum VTE. A literature search was carried out on Pubmed using the following key words: ""venous thromboembolism"", ""pregnancy"", ""risk factors"", ""prophylaxis"", ""anticoagulants"". Studies from 1999 onwards were analyzed. This review aimed to provide an update of whole current literature on VTE in pregnancy highlighting the most recent findings in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, considering in detail risks and benefits of various techniques and drug classes, for both mother and fetus. Large trials of anticoagulants administration in pregnancy are lacking and recommendations are mainly based on case series and on expert opinions.

CD011053,0,21116739,0,Hemodynamic and neurohumoral profile in patients with different types of hypertension in pregnancy.,"Hypertension in pregnancy is a frequent disorder that includes a spectrum of conditions. We aimed at comparatively evaluating the hemodynamic, echocardiographic and biohumoral profile of a sample of pregnant Caucasian women with different form of pregnancy-related hypertension. We enrolled 39 non-hypertensive pregnant women (NP), 26 with Chronic HBP in pregnancy (CH), 24 with gestational hypertension (G-PIH), and 33 with pre-eclampsia. We recorded and compared blood pressure (BP), echocardiographic parameters, resting plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PA), Plasma levels of atrial (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). PE patients had a significantly higher BP than either G-PIH or NP patients. PE patients had also significantly lower cardiac output than NP, G-PIH and CH. In comparison to NP patients, the total peripheral vascular resistance was 61% higher in PE women and 38% higher in CH patients. All echographic parameters were significantly more altered in PE patients when compared with NP, in respect to any other form of hypertension. Either ANP (+35%) and BNP (+40%) were significantly higher in PE patients than in controls. The PRA was reduced in PE and CH patients when compared either with NP (-38 and -35%, respectively) or G-PIH (-47 and -43%, respectively). On the basis of our data, we can conclude that PE is the gestation associated hypertension with the largest anatomical, functional and biohumoral involvement, and so it has to be involved in a more intensive monitoring and evaluation."

There was considerable reluctance on the part of the obstetricians to permit this study. Standard MIRD dose estimates to the fetus were performed, which showed a maximum fetal exposure of about 50 mrem. It was concluded that the risk to mother and fetus from undiagnosed and untreated PE is much greater than the negligible risk to the fetus from the radiation exposure; fear of fetal radiation damage should not be a deterrent to performing these scans."

The authors diagnosed IVH in full-term newborns by using computerized tomography (CT) or cranial ultrasonography (US). The results of CT or US were reviewed and the grade of haemorrhage was determined by an independent radiologist using Papile's criteria. All the infants were examined on the first day of their life by a paediatrician and judged to be full term. Survivors were examined between age 2 and 10 years at the Child Development Clinic by a Developmental Paediatrician using the Gesell scales and a standard neurologic examination. The results showed that three of 36 infants (8 per cent) died; complications of pregnancy were present in 17 mothers (47 per cent); nine women tested negative for platelet antigen 1 and their infants exhibited alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Age at diagnosis ranged from in utero to 28 days. Clinical presentation included feeding intolerance, irritability, jaundice, fever, and restlessness. Of the nine children with grade IV IVH, three died and six survivors were severely handicapped. Overall, 22 (67 per cent) of 33 survivors had no or mild handicap. The results of this study suggest that severity of haemorrhage was of prognostic value. Perinatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia turned out to be the single most important cause of severe haemorrhage and poor outcome. Identification and treatment of these infants must begin in utero if we are to prevent IVH and its complications in this group of patients."
CD011053,0,2760457,0,Effect of endogenous vasoconstrictors on maternal intramyometrial and fetal stem villous arteries in pre-eclampsia.,"The contractile responses to various endogenous vasoactive agents were investigated in isolated human uteroplacental arteries from normotensive (NT) patients and patients with pre-eclampsia (PE) undergoing caesarian section. Tissue samples were obtained from the uterine incision and from macroscopically normal cotyledons. Vascular ring preparations of intramyometrial and stem villous arteries (length 1.0-1.3 mm, outer diameter 400-600 microns) were dissected and mounted in organ baths and isometric tension was recorded. Concentration-response relationships for vasopressin (VP), oxytocin (OX), angiotensin II (Ang II), noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were assessed. For each compound, the mean maximum contractile effect (Emax) and the drug concentration producing half-maximal response (EC50) were determined. In intramyometrial arteries from NT and PE patients, VP, Ang II, NA, 5-HT and PGF2 alpha induced contraction while OX and PGE2 produced weak or no responses. Preparations from PE patients showed higher Emax values, while no differences in EC50 were found between the two groups. In fetal stem villous arteries, Ang II, 5-HT, PGF2 alpha and PGE2 induced contractions, while VP, NA and OX produced weak responses. No differences in Emax or EC50 values were found between the fetal vessels of PE and NT patients. No qualitative differences were demonstrated in response to the agents tested between the vessels (fetal and maternal) from NT women at term and PE patients. However, the results may reflect quantitative differences, suggesting increased contractility of maternal uteroplacental arteries from women with PE."

She had no discoloration of her arm nor a loss of radial pulse. Duplex scanning demonstrated a thrombosis in the axillary vein. She was found to have a positive circulating lupus anticoagulant. Intravenous heparin was administered and resulted in resolution of discomfort and swelling on day four of therapy. The patient was maintained on therapeutic doses of subcutaneous heparin until vaginal delivery at 39 weeks. Prenatal course was complicated by a resolving infection believed to be due to cat-scratch disease which produced a five centimeter cystic lesion in the left axillae which was removed in the first trimester. Titers for cat-scratch disease were positive for mother and infant at delivery but infant titers were negative at six weeks. Axillary vein thrombosis in pregnancy can be complicated by pulmonary embolism and should be treated by heparin.
CD011053,0,8536452,0,Decline in cerebral thromboembolism among young women after introduction of low-dose oral contraceptives: an incidence study for the period 1980-1993.,"The aim of this study was to analyze age-specific incidence rates (IRs) of cerebral thromboembolic attacks (CTA) among women and men 15-44 years of age in Denmark from 1980 through 1993 and to quantify possible influences from oral contraceptives (OC) on the incidence figures. The discharge diagnoses ICD 432-436 from all Danish neurological, neurosurgical and medical departments during the period 1980-1993 were identified in a central diagnosis register. The use of OC was achieved from complete sale statistics during the study period and cross-sectional studies assessing the type-specific use of OC at different ages. During the 14-year study period, 2,100 female and 2,552 male attacks were registered. Men had an exponentially increasing IR with increasing age. Compared with men in the period 1980-86, women had more attacks in the 20-35-year age group and fewer attacks above the age of 35. After 1987 the sex differences below the age of 35 were not significant. From the first half (1980-86) to the last half (1987-1993) of the study period, women below 30 years had a significantly falling CTA IR of -20.4%, compared with a non-significant fall of -9.5% among men below 30 years. In the age group above 30 years, women experienced a not significant increase of 4.2%, men a significant increase of 11.4%. Assuming that use of OC implied an average relative risk of CTA 111115 and pregnancy a relative risk of 4, a correction was made for the contribution of incident cases among women.

The diagnostic performance of clinical decision rules and D-dimer testing is influenced by physiological changes during pregnancy and is understudied. Recent studies have addressed these issues by developing a new clinical decision rule and raising the D-dimer level cut-off points. With imaging of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) the radiation exposure remains a concern. Recent studies have adjusted CT settings and scan length to minimize this exposure without loss of image quality. Furthermore the first choice imaging modality of suspected PE in pregnant women remains a matter of debate in view of studies showing high inadequacy rates for both CT scanning and VQ scanning. Issues concerning the diagnostic management of VTE in pregnant women and advancements made in recent years will be discussed.

One of the major obstacles of safely treating a child with ECMO is balancing the risk of hemorrhage with the potential for thrombus development. Managing thrombosis in the setting of ECMO is challenging and has no defined algorithm. The use of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) for thrombolysis has been previously described in cases where thrombi have developed despite adequate anticoagulation. In such situations, the risk of hemorrhage must be carefully balanced with the benefit of dissolving the clot and reestablishing flow. We present a case of an infant who required ECMO because of severe primary pulmonary hypertension and subsequently developed a right atrial thrombus adjacent to the ECMO cannula. The patient was treated with tPA with immediate improvement but had fatal intracranial hemorrhage almost 3 days after the tPA was administered. In this report, we review the current literature on tPA use during ECMO support and suggest a rational approach."
CD011053,0,7690387,0,[Limit of antenatal management of intrauterine growth retarded fetus].,"Recent advances in perinatal medicine contributed to the survival of extremely premature infants. Nonetheless, prognosis of the fetus with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) especially of preterm IUGR is not satisfactory with respect to both neonatal and long term neurodevelopmental outcome. As in utero pathophysiology of the IUGR has been revealed by noninvasive fetal monitoring technique along with invasive cordocentesis to determine fetal blood gas parameters, most of the neonatal morbidity of IUGR is thought to be originated prior to birth. Excluding the IUGR due to chromosomal abnormalities, fetal anomalies and multiple gestation, severe preeclampsia contributes nearly 60 to 80% of the etiology of IUGR in our series. In IUGR with severe preeclampsia, it is noteworthy that the incidence of symmetrical IUGR is approximately 50%, suggesting disturbance in head growth is responsible for symmetrical growth. We have shown that the disturbance in head growth is particularly important not only for neurodevelopmental but also for short term neonatal mortality and morbidity. It is suggested that the reasonable timing of delivery of preterm IUGR should be before onset of fetal acidosis and/or cessation of fetal head growth for the following reasons. 1. There is a relationship between fetal acidemia at cordocentesis and subsequent neurodevelopment. 2. The incidence of neonatal morbidity including hypoglycemia, hemoconcentration and thrombocytopenia increased with the degree of disturbance in head circumference at birth. We propose that the IUGR fetus should be monitored weekly for its growth by ultrasound fetometry and noninvasive fetal monitoring methods including nonstress test, Biophysical profile scoring and Doppler velocimetry.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011053,0,18521777,0,Perinatal cerebral arterial infarction associated with a placental chorioangioma.,"Placental chorioangiomas are benign vascular tumors. Large chorioangiomas cause several obstetric complications, including premature labor, placental abruption, polyhydramnios, fetal hydrops, fetal growth restriction, fetal hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, and fetal death. The neonatal complications are hydrops fetalis, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The cause of perinatal cerebral arterial infarction remains unclear in the majority of cases. Investigators have reported a number of obstetric and neonatal complications in the setting of perinatal stroke, including birth asphyxia, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, cardiac anomalies, polycythemia, systemic infection, and genetic thrombophilias. We present a rare case of perinatal cerebral infarction associated with placental chorioangioma."

CD011053,0,12910999,0,[A case of deep cerebral venous thrombosis with sudden convulsion after delivery].,"A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of convulsions after delivering a baby. Her neurological examination revealed a disturbance of consciousness and weakness in both arms. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) showed thrombosis of the left transverse sinus and many patchy high signals at bilateral basal ganglia and subcortical areas. A digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) of the brain revealed a defect at the left transverse sinus, congestion of the cerebral venous flow at the vein of Galen and vasospastic changes at both posterior cerebral arteries. After treating the patient with a venous infusion of heparin, nicardipine and phenytoin, her neurological deficits improved within a day. When MRI and DSA were repeated 2 weeks later, the abnormal lesions had disappeared. These findings suggest that venous thrombosis and vasospasm had the pathogenesis of eclampsia in this case."

There were few clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) but ED ultrasound (US) showed a left external iliac vein thrombus. This is a new technique in the ED. Not only does this case show the importance of using this technique in the ED, but it also shows the importance of correct training in how to examine for thrombus in the external iliac vein in the pregnant patient. The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on low-molecular-weight heparin. A formal radiology department US performed the next week confirmed the diagnosis of DVT."

Control of convulsions was achieved by diazepam, diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital. In 11 comatose patients brain monitoring was carried out by frequent neurological examination and use of computerized x-ray tomography; aspiration of gastric contents was prevented by nasotracheal intubation. Brain oedema therapy included controlled hyperventilation, steroids and mannitol (7 patients). 10 patients with respiratory failure (due to pulmonary oedema, ""shock lung"" or aspiration pneumonitis) were treated by mechanical ventilation. Diastolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg was reduced by hydralazine. Diuresis was induced by normalization of hypovolaemia with albumin and plasma expanders. Six patients died (27%); main causes of death included intracerebral haemorrhage, brain oedema, heart failure, acute pulmonary thromboembolism and bleeding from DIC."
CD011053,0,3302629,0,Theory of the etiology of human toxemia of pregnancy: fetal hyperinsulinemia as a compensatory response to decreased uterine blood flow.,"Toxemia of pregnancy is a perplexing clinical problem that has defied accurate elucidation of its etiology because the disorder does not occur in undisturbed lower mammalian species that are currently used as animal models of reproductive physiology. We propose that toxemia of pregnancy occurs as the end stage human fetal-placental unit response to decreased maternal uterine blood flow, and that this fetal-placental unit response may be unique to the human species. The human fetus increases insulin secretion in response to progressive intrauterine asphyxia, which may result in decreased fetal-placental prostacyclin production (a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation) and increased fetal-placental thromboxane A2 production (a vasoconstrictor). This could result in increased uteroplacental perfusion pressure, maternal hypertension, and increased maternal platelet aggregation. We also suggest that women who develop idiopathic toxemia of pregnancy are at increased risk for adult onset diabetes later on in life because they have a mild derangement in glucose-insulin homeostasis during their reproductive years that results in increased uterine vascular damage, that leads to decreased uterine blood flow, and ultimately the fetal hyperinsulinemia-prostaglandin pressor release mechanism. Therefore, prevention of toxemia may be possible by correction of mild derangements in glucose-insulin receptor homeostasis before conception occurs."
CD011053,0,17523163,0,Antenatal sonographic features of aneurysmal dilatation of a vitelline vein.,"We report a case of aneurysmal dilatation of a vitelline vein observed antenatally. Intra-abdominal vascular dilatation was diagnosed on ultrasound examination at 24 weeks' gestation. The relationship with the umbilicus and portal vein suggested the diagnosis of umbilical vein varix. Fetal tolerance remained excellent in spite of a gradual increase in the size of the dilated vein. Postnatal ultrasound examination revealed thrombosis of the aneurysm with gradual extension to the portal vein and the onset of serious coagulation problems. Operative findings on postnatal day 9 included the absence of intra-abdominal umbilical vein, and the presence of an abnormal, dilated and thrombosed vein connecting the umbilicus to the portal vein and following the trajectory of the right vitelline vein. Corrective surgery was attempted by resection of the aneurysm and portal thrombectomy, but this did not prevent the development of portal obstruction syndrome with cavernous hemangioma. This anomaly, in which the fetal venous return uses the vitelline vein in the absence of the umbilical vein, does not appear to have been described before. The mechanism in question could be anastomosis between the right vitelline vein and umbilical vein. Antenatal diagnosis should enable early surgical management before the formation of a portal thrombosis."
CD011053,0,24303655,0,[Management of acute iliac thrombosis in a pregnancy at term: case discussion and review of literature].,"Venous thromboembolic disease during pregnancy is an important cause of obstetric morbidity and mortality. Suggestive clinical signs lead systematically physicians to evocate this diagnosis. Unfortunately, the incidence of events remains low, reducing the ability to perform well-designed research and to give adequate recommendations. The discovery in term pregnancy of an iliofemoral venous thrombosis raises the question of obstetrical care, mainly considering potentially embolic risk. Through a case report and based on a thinking about the few medical publications in this field, we suggest that the placing of temporary inferior vena cava filter in presence of an extensive deep venous thrombosis at term pregnancy could be debatable."
CD011053,0,2264283,0,Vascular injury associated with naturally occurring strangulating obstructions of the equine large colon.,"Ten horses were euthanatized before, during, or after surgery to correct severe volvulus of the large colon. At surgery, the colonic serosa changed from blue-gray, blue or purple toward a more normal pink in seven horses after the volvulus was corrected. The mucosa consistently remained black or dark red. Results of postmortem colonic microangiography revealed perfusion of the serosa and the circular and longitudinal muscle layers, but mucosal perfusion was limited by thrombosis in the muscularis mucosae and submucosa. There was evidence of thrombosis of the mesenteric colic vessels in six horses. Damage to the colonic vascular system, especially thromboembolism in the submucosa, may be an important limitation to colonic viability after surgical correction of volvulus of the large colon."

During admission for acute lower abdominal pain, a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen showed thrombosis of the left ovarian vein. She was treated with increased immunosuppressant and oral anticoagulant. Although she was not compliant to oral anticoagulant with her international normalized ratio frequently subtherapeutic, her symptoms abated and the thrombosis resolved. There has been only 1 reported case of a patient with Beh√ßet disease presenting with postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and no reported case of Beh√ßet disease with ovarian vein thrombosis occurring outside pregnancy and the puerperium. Ovarian vein thrombosis is a rare cause of abdominal pain that should be considered in patients with Beh√ßet disease."
CD011053,0,21316548,0,[Pulmonary thromboembolism].,"Pulmonary thromboembolism is a frequent disease in emergency departments and often poses a diagnostic challenge that requires appropriate strategies. Clinical information, laboratory tests such as a D-dimer and imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) angiography, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy or echocardiography help to establish clinical probability and the severity of the disease. With all this information, risk scores can be constructed, such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score, which has high sensitivity in predicting mortality. Treatment should be started immediately with heparin, usually low molecular weight heparin. If the patient is at high risk, thrombolytic therapy is indicated, although possible contraindications should be thoroughly assessed. Supportive treatment may be considered in a few patients."
CD011053,0,9244713,0,[Massive pulmonary embolism during the third trimester of pregnancy: effectiveness of thrombolytic treatment with alteplase].,"The authors report on a 33-year old woman with massive, life-threatening pulmonary embolism at the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis was rapidly accomplished in the Emergency Department by two dimensional-Doppler echocardiography that showed signs of pulmonary hypertension as well as a large, floating thromboembolus in the right atrium. As the hemodynamic deterioration persisted after treatment with iv heparin, the patient received alteplase 50 mg as a bolus over 5 minutes. About 30 minutes later, a further 50 mg infusion of alteplase was given over 60 minutes because clinical conditions were progressively worsening. After an alteplase dose of 75 mg, the woman showed a definite improvement in clinical-hemodynamic status and echocardiography documented a reduction of right ventricular overload and atrial clot disappearance. Two hours later the patient was submitted to cesarean section, because of the onset of uterine contractions, and delivered a vital baby. The occurrence of uterine bleeding was antagonized by the infusion of fresh-frozen plasma and a moderate anemia was subsequently treated with iron preparations. The mother and her baby were discharged on 16th day in fairly good general conditions. The authors emphasize the leading role of early echocardiography in the clinical decision making and the lifesaving potential of full dose thrombolytic therapy without serious adverse effects."
CD011053,0,2511258,0,[Relation between umbilical artery flow velocity and prostanoid production in the feto-placental vascular bed].,"The maintenance of adequate maternal-fetal circulation is essential for fetal growth. The circulation appears to be controlled by local prostanoid synthesis which may affect the vascular tone. With a view to examining this possibility, the present study was designed to evaluate the umbilical circulation serially in vivo by means of pulse doppler flowmetry. After delivery, the cord vasculature and the placenta were studied in vitro for the synthesis and release of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2). The resistance index (RI) showed a significant negative correlation to the birth weight (n = 15, r = - 0.70, p less than 0.01) and a positive correlation to the maternal arterial pressure (r = 0.56, p less than 0.05). PGI2 synthesis was highest in the umbilical artery, then in the umbilical vein, and lowest in the placenta. TxA2 tended to be higher in the umbilical artery of light-for-date neonates, showing a negative correlation with the birth weight (r = - 0.56, p less than 0.05). RI showed a significant correlation with the PGI2/TxA2 ratio. These results indicate that the balance between PGI2 and TxA2 influences cord circulation and in turn fetal growth."

The findings, however, were atypical, and of uncertain clinical significance. Venous sinus thrombosis typically does not occur during the first and second trimesters (less than 10 percent of reported cases). Thus, these two cases are doubly unusual.

CD011053,0,10725989,0,Acquired APC resistance in neurosurgical patients may not be a risk factor for postoperative deep vein thrombosis.,"Acquired resistance to activated protein C has been reported during oral contraception and pregnancy. Its thrombogenic potential was studied in 41 neurosurgical patients who were enrolled in the placebo group of a thromboprophylaxis trial. Normalized activated protein C sensitivity ratio (nAPC-SR), clotting activity of factors V and VIII, and levels of protein C antigen were measured prior to and at days 3 and 7 after surgery. Bilateral venography was done in all patients at days 8-10 to demonstrate deep vein thrombosis. A lowered nAPC-SR was found in 76% (baseline), 80% (day 3), and 88% (day 7) of patients. It was inversely related to factor VIII clotting activity (p = .0003) and protein C antigen, (p = .02). Deep vein thrombosis was demonstrated in 30% of patients with a normal nAPC-SR and in 23% of patients with a lowered nAPC-SR. Pulmonary embolism was not observed. Multivariate analysis did not identify a lowered nAPC-SR as a thrombotic risk factor, in contrast with gender (women, p = .02) and Quetelet index (> or = 25 kg/m2, p = .006). Our data provide no evidence that acquired activated protein C resistance, frequently found in neurosurgical patients, contributes to their high risk of postoperative deep vein thrombosis."

Ultrasound and Doppler investigations of the surviving twin were normal. Three weeks later, endovaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed massive bilateral cerebral ischemic necrosis in the surviving twin. In utero fetal blood sampling carried out before the termination did not reveal either anemia or thrombopenia. Current data suggest that cerebral or renal ischemic complications could set in immediately after the death of the first twin as a result of a period of acute hypotension. At least 2 weeks are necessary for them to be identifiable by ultrasound. It seems that they cannot be prevented by prompt delivery of the second twin."

The clinical hallmarks of this syndrome are thrombosis and poor obstetric outcomes, including miscarriages, fetal loss and severe pre-eclampsia. The main antiphospholipid antibodies include lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-Œ≤2-glycoprotein I. The combination of aspirin and heparin is considered the standard of care for women with antiphospholipid syndrome and embryo-fetal losses; however, aspirin in monotherapy may have a place in women with recurrent early miscarriage. A good benefit-risk ratio of low-molecular-weight heparin in pregnancy thrombosis treatment has been reported. Warfarin must be avoided if possible throughout the first trimester of pregnancy. Adequate pregnancy management of women with antiphospholipid syndrome should include co-ordinated medical-obstetrical care, a close follow-up protocol and a good neonatal unit. Close blood pressure control and early detection of proteinuria, together with Doppler studies of the utero-placental circulation should be included in the management protocol."

Two case studies seem to prove the point: Case 1 A 24-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital with the chief complaint of abdominal pain radiating to the right thigh, vomit, diarrhea, and a slight pyrexia (37.6 ¬∞C rectal). Five days earlier, she had a spontaneous vaginal delivery after labor induction. The woman appeared slightly distressed because of pain; vital signs were found to be normal and the CRP elevated (129.9 mg/L). Abdominal examination was remarkable for tenderness by palpation in the right lower quadrant with no rebound tenderness or guarding. Pelvic examination was remarkable for mild right adnexal tenderness. Abdominal-pelvic computer tomography with contrast medium revealed a 2.5-cm OVT having extended into the inferior vena cava for 14 cm with a slight peripheral edema. The patient was treated with nadroparin 0.6 cc (5700 IU) bid and warfarin 5 mg since the attainment of the therapeutic INR range. Case 2 A 31-year-old twin-pregnant woman had an emergency cesarean section at 35 gestational weeks because of hypertension complicated by increased liver enzymes, diuresis contraction, and continuous lower back pain bilaterally radiating to the groins. One day after delivery, CT scan that was performed because of onward anemia showed a pelvic, perihepatic, and perisplenic blood effusion, and a 1-cm right OVT extended to the inferior vena cava below renal veins for 28 mm. She underwent exploratory laparotomy and blood transfusion, and because of respiratory insufficiency she was transferred to a second level center with ICU facility, where she was placed under a suprarenal inferior vena cava filter, and AngioJet Rheolytic Thrombectomy for acute pulmonary embolism was performed."

We present a rare case of persistent rectal bleeding due to a rectal arterio-portal venous fistula in the setting of portal hypertension secondary to portal vein thrombosis. The portal hypertension was initially surgically treated with splenectomy and a proximal splenorenal shunt. However, rectal bleeding persisted even after surgery, presenting us with a diagnostic dilemma. The patient was re-evaluated with a computed tomography mesenteric angiogram which revealed a rectal arterio-portal fistula. Arterio-portal fistulas are a known but rare cause of portal hypertension, and possibly the underlying cause of continued rectal bleeding in this case. This was successfully treated using angiographic localization and super-selective embolization of the rectal arterio-portal venous fistula via the right internal iliac artery.The patient subsequently went on to have a full term pregnancy. Through this case report, we hope to highlight awareness of this unusual condition, discuss the diagnostic workup and our management approach."

CD011053,0,17969310,0,[Preeclampsia as a maternal vascular disease].,"Preeclampsia, one of the main complications in pregnancy, affects 5-7% of all pregnancies, and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality. The placenta plays a pivotal role in the etiology of preeclampsia, and particularly, the trophoblast cells of the placenta. It is now believed that preeclampsia is a two stage disease. In the first stage, a defective implantation and placentation, causes a reduction in uteroplacental perfusion and placental ischemia/hypoxia. Placental ischemia may promote the release of a variety of factors to the maternal circulation. In the second stage, these factors initiate a cascade of cellular and molecular events leading to endothelial and vascular dysfunction. The endothelial dysfunction leads to the clinically recognized symptoms of the syndrome, which include hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia and impaired liver function. Hypertension is mediated by various endothelial and non-endothelial regulatory factors that are altered in preeclampsia. This review aims to summarize the recent knowledge on the implication of the placenta and various angiogenic factors in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia."

CD011053,0,2216588,0,Foetal hepatic calcification.,"Thirty-three cases of 1,500 spontaneously-aborted foetuses showed hepatic calcifications. The exact location of these calcifications were confirmed by contrast studies, anatomic dissection, and further histology when necessary. Of them, 18 were calcified hepatic vein thrombi (CHVT), 12 were calcified portal vein thrombi (CPVT), 2 were parenchymal calcifications, and one was mixed. Associated anomalies were high (85% of cases). No significant difference was found between the type and percentage of anomalies of those with CHVT and those with CPVT. The most common anomalies encountered in all cases were meconium intraluminal calcification (27%), cystic hygroma (18%), and metaphyseal defect (18%). In view of this, it is suggested that a variety of severe foetal illnesses predispose to CHVT and CPVT. At correlation with maternal factors, it was found that the highest incidence was in the third decade. A significant high percentage of mothers (33%) had been on contraceptive pills, and there was interesting inverse relationship of hepatic calcification with gravidity. Practically, it is also hoped that the awareness of the presence of various types of hepatic calcifications will help in their detection prenatally by ultrasound."

The physical examination was unremarkable. Echocardiography revealed an intracardiac mass protruding through the tricuspid orifice into the right ventricle during diastole. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with the suspicion of vena cava thrombosis with intracardiac expansion. An abdominal sonography showed a mass in the uterus, presumed to be a benign tumour, with extension into the vena cava inferior. Owing to the extent of the mass in the right atrium and the risk for pulmonary embolism, after interdisciplinary discussion, a decision to remove the atrial mass was made. The case was managed by a two-stage procedure. Pathological examination of the intracardiac portions of the tumour revealed a benign tumour that consisted of proliferating smooth muscle fibres without abnormal mitotic activity."
CD011053,0,23370575,0,Fatal postpartum air embolism due to uterine inversion and atonic hemorrhage.,"We report a case of a 19-year-old woman who developed a persistent uterine hemorrhage after spontaneous delivery of a healthy child. Emergency laparotomy was indicated and then begun under stable circulatory conditions. Cardiac arrest occurred during the course of massive manual compression and packing of the uterus. After successful resuscitation, a supracervical hysterectomy was performed. During the suturing of the remaining cervix, a second cardiac arrest followed. The procedure was completed under constant external heart massage. Resuscitation was terminated due to the persistence of widened pupils. An autopsy was ordered by the public prosecutor as the manner of death was declared to be unascertained. An X-ray and a CT scan prior to the autopsy showed extensive gas embolism in both arterial and venous vessels extending from the pelvic region to the head. During the autopsy, gas was collected by aspirometer from the right ventricle of the heart. The autopsy showed no additional relevant findings, and gas analysis confirmed the suspicion of air embolism. The histological examination of the excised uterus especially in the corpus/fundus revealed an edema of the local smooth muscle cells and dilated vessels showing no sign of thrombogenesis. Upon evaluation of the clinical records, it became evident that, in addition to uterine atony, there had been a complete uterine inversion. This inversion was manually repositioned. After this maneuver, manual compression was performed. The air embolism, thus, was a complication of the manual repositioning of the uterine inversion. There is no evidence for other possible entries of the detected gas. In order to perform an effective exploration, the availability of all clinical records should be mandatory for medico-legal investigations of unexpected postpartum deaths."

National guidelines recommend prophylactic placement of internal iliac artery balloon occlusion catheters for women with abnormal placentation. We describe an elective caesarean delivery in a patient with placenta percreta who underwent this technique. She developed bilateral pseudoaneurysms, unilateral arterial rupture and compromised vascular supply to her right leg secondary to thrombus formation, and suffered massive haemorrhage, both despite and as a result of intervention. This is the first case report of multiple complications in an obstetric patient after temporary internal iliac balloon occlusion in an elective setting."
CD011053,0,24559159,0,Umbilical artery thrombosis is a rare but clinically important finding: a series of 7 cases with clinical outcomes.,"Umbilical artery thrombosis is a rare occurrence and is associated with poor neonatal outcomes. We present a series of 7 cases occurring over a 13-year period. The National Maternity Hospital is a tertiary referral center with approximately 10,000 births per annum. Cases were identified by a keyword search on the laboratory computer system. Seven cases were retrieved over a 13-year period (from an estimated 116,000 births): 5 cases from 7306 placentas and 2 cases from 1174 autopsies performed. Only cases with isolated umbilical artery thrombosis were included in the study. Placental histology from all cases was examined, placental gross findings were recorded, and clinical information and Doppler findings were obtained. Two infants were stillborn, and an additional 3 of the 7 cases were small for dates. All liveborn infants had a complicated neonatal course: 1 infant had a caudate infarction, 1 was born with partial acrania and schizencephaly, and 1 had a prolonged intensive care unit admission for low birth weight and jaundice. One case had absent end diastolic flow on Doppler ultrasound. Three cases had a cord diameter narrower than that expected for gestational age. All cases showed evidence of placental hypoperfusion. Umbilical artery thrombosis is a rare occurrence and carries a poor prognosis."
CD011053,0,1294977,0,[Cushing syndrome during pregnancy. New diagnostic methods used in 3 cases of adrenal cortex carcinoma].,"Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy is most often caused by an adrenal cortical tumour; it is a rare event which bears poor foetal and maternal prognoses. We report 3 cases of adrenal cortex carcinoma diagnosed during pregnancy (after 24, 27 and 28 weeks respectively of amenorrhea) and revealed by local tumoral signs in 2 cases and by pulmonary embolism in the third. Because hair growth was moderate and weight gain as well as high blood pressure had mistakenly been attributed to the pregnant state, these clinical features of hypercortisolism has only lately been related to tumoral secretion. The hypercortisolic state was firmly established by comparing the patients' urinary cortisol levels (677, 941 and 2,167 micrograms/day) and 20-hour salivary cortisol levels (9.9, 15 and 25.3 micrograms/ml) with values obtained in women at the same stage (88 +/- 11.4 micrograms/day and 2.31 +/- 0.25 micrograms/ml). The aetiological diagnosis was made by the finding of a highly increased salivary testosterone levels (50, 34 and 95 pg/ml; normal = 8.6 +/- 4 pg/ml), and by magnetic resonance imaging which showed unilateral adrenal masses of 3, 8 and 20 cm in diameter respectively. These 3 cases illustrate the difficulty of the clinical diagnosis of hypercortisolism during pregnancy. Assessment of the unbound steroids and magnetic resonance imaging are the most useful methods for an early diagnosis, thus preventing the severe complications which may otherwise reveal this rare pathological condition."
CD011053,0,21074265,0,Protein composition of microparticles shed from human placenta during placental perfusion: Potential role in angiogenesis and fibrinolysis in preeclampsia.,"Shedding of syncytiotrophoblast microparticles (MPs) from placenta to maternal blood occurs in normal pregnancy and is enhanced during preeclampsia (PE). The syncytiotrophoblast synthesizes plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) which regulate fibrinolysis, as well as soluble forms of the fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt-1) and endoglin, which exert anti-angiogenic actions. An increase in the ratio of PAI-1/PAI-2 and elevated levels of sFlt-1 and sEng in maternal serum are linked to placental damage and maternal endothelial cell dysfunction in PE. The goal of the current study was to determine whether MPs released to maternal perfusate during dual perfusion contain these factors associated with placental pathophysiology in PE. Initially, high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and Annexin V binding were found in MPs isolated by sequential centrifugation of maternal perfusates at 10,000 and 150,000√óg(10¬†K and 150¬†K MPs), indicating their plasma membrane origin. ELISA revealed the presence of these factors at the following relative levels: Eng>PAI-2‚ãôPAI-1>sFlt-1. Based on comparisons of their concentration in perfusates, MPs, and MP-free 150¬†K supernatants, we determined that MPs constitute a significant portion of Eng released by placenta. Flow cytometric analysis of 10¬†K MPs supported the levels of expression found by ELISA and indicated that Eng and PAI-2 were almost exclusively localized to the surface of MPs, a site with biological potential. These results indicate that MPs shed from the syncytial surface express factors which may alter the fibrinolytic and angiogenic balance at the maternal-fetal interface and play a role in the pathophysiology of PE."
CD011053,0,6087460,0,Hepatic tumors induced by sex steroids.,"Our study of more than 250 women with hepatic tumors, accessioned in our tumor registry at the University of Louisville, disclosed three types of tumor: FNH , HCA, and HCC. The ingestion of sundry kinds of sex steroids by the majority of these women, chiefly for purposes of preventing conception, warrants the suspicion that such hormones induced these different types of hepatic tumors. Publications by others reporting similar hepatic tumors in men using male sex steroids lends support to this hypothesis. Rupture of the hepatic tumor and consequent hemorrhage, producing hemoperitoneum, is a major risk factor. Other presenting symptoms are pain and palpable mass. Symptomatic women using OCs should be subjected to a CT or technetium hepatic scan as an initial screening assessment. Because of the imminent possibility of rupture, large turgid vascular tumors should be resected without biopsy. Biopsy-proved HCC should also be removed surgically. All other tumors, including small multiple tumors, will usually regress when exogenous sex steroids are withdrawn and pregnancy avoided. Other significant hepatic changes observed in this study are peliosis hepatis, periportal sinusoidal dilation, and vascular lesions. The branches of the hepatic artery and the tributaries of the portal vein show combinations of intimal and smooth muscle proliferation, vascular thickening, occlusive intimal thickening, and, at times, obstructing thrombosis. Similar smooth muscle proliferation in the afferent vessels of the livers of animals treated with sex steroids suggests that there is a cause and effect relationship in women using OCs."

CD011053,0,9147744,0,[Lateral sinus thrombosis in the first three months of pregnancy].,"Thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinuses is characterized by clinical pleomorphism and variable pathogenesis. Although there is a relationship with pregnancy and especially with the puerperium, occurrence during the first trimester of pregnancy is unusual and this may effect the diagnosis and treatment. We describe the case of a 33 years-old patient with lateral sinus thrombosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. This was diagnosed and followed-up by magnetic resonance. Investigations as to its aetiology were inconclusive and it followed a benign course without anticoagulation. Thrombosis of the venous sinuses has been found empirically to be related to states of deficiency of S protein, hypercoagulability, anaemia and deshydration during pregnancy, to having previously taken contraceptive pills. Beh√ßet's disease, other coagulopathies, central or systemic vasculitis, collagen disorders, septic and neoplastic disorders and a large number of cases of unknown aetiology. In our patient neurological deterioration secondary to a venous infarct or intraparenchymatous haemorrhage was not seen. There was full recovery and complete spontaneous canalization of the sinus, as shown on posterior cranial angiography. The controversial decision to use heparin in thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinuses should probably depend on the possible risks and benefits in each individual case, taking into account the clinical findings, aetiology and topography of the thrombosed sinus."

In both cases, an unusual presence of subendocardial calcifications was noted. The ultrasonographic findings are discussed."
CD011053,0,6856590,0,Fibrinous vasculosis in the human placenta.,"Approximately 6 per cent of placentae of babies admitted to a special care paediatric unit show evidence of peripheral villous stem branch oedema. In more than half of these cases there is evidence of fibrinous vasculosis (FV) in truncal veins. The affected placentae are generally thick and of small diameter, often of extrachorialis type, very congested and often cyanosed. The aetiology of the lesions is discussed with reference to abnormal fetal vascular patterns, poor perfusion, anoxia, oedema and spasm and the effect such factors may have on vessels with an irregularly distributed muscle coat and tendency to a spiral course. A small heterogeneous group with FV lesions unassociated with stem branch oedema was also identified. Chorionic vessels were more commonly involved in this group, and it would seem that, in addition to the other factors mentioned above, pressure variations may have some aetiological significance. Lesions of FV occurred mainly in mature placentae. The mothers showed a high incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and other complications. Fetal distress and asphyxia at birth were common. Where chorionic vessels were involved there was a high risk of intrauterine death (40 per cent) and coagulopathy among survivors (46.7 per cent). FV lesions affecting truncal vessels carried no greater risk than truncal arterial thrombotic lesions, which have been assessed in the past. In both these groups the hypoxia and intrauterine growth retardation which the babies showed are probably the most important factors, though one could postulate that their clotting mechanism was already triggered."

CD011053,0,9436689,0,Colour Doppler changes and thromboxane production after ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the Doppler flow variations which occur following the use of different protocols of ovarian stimulation in an IVF programme, and to investigate the thromboxane production by cultured endometrial cells and its influence on embryo implantation. A total of 60 patients underwent three different ovarian stimulation protocols: long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), short GnRH-a and no GnRH-a. Transvaginal ultrasonography and colour Doppler analysis were performed before and during the treatment. On the day that the Doppler examination took place, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, plasma oestradiol and thromboxane concentrations were assayed. On the day of oocyte retrieval, endometrial cells were collected and cultured, and their thromboxane production evaluated. No significant differences in hormonal, ultrasonographic or Doppler parameters were observed between the three groups. Ten out of 56 patients who had a successful embryo transfer became pregnant. In the group of pregnant women the pulsatility index values of both uterine and spiral arteries was lower than in non-pregnant patients, and was associated with significantly lower thromboxane concentrations from cultured endometrial cells. It is concluded that thromboxane plays a role in embryo implantation, and that Doppler flow analysis of uterine and spiral arteries in infertile patients may be important in the management of ovarian stimulation."

CD011053,0,9290155,0,Vascular effects of PTHrP (1-34) and PTH (1-34) in the human fetal-placental circulation.,"The aim of this study was to examine the vasodilatory effects of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (1-34) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (1-34) on the human fetal-placental circulation utilising an in vitro placental perfusion model. In all experiments, the vasculature of an isolated human placental cotyledon was pre-constricted with the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619. A simple dose of PTHrP (1-34) or PTH (1-34) (1.7-300 nM) was then infused into the fetal-placental circulation of the cotyledon. In other experiments, cotyledons were repeatedly infused with PTHrP (1-34) or PTH (1-34) (51.3 nM). Vasodilatory responses were significantly reduced in response to repeated exposure to PTHrP (1-34) (P < 0.001), indicating that this peptide desensitizes the fetal-placental vasculature. PTHrP (1-34) and PTH (1-34) equipotently stimulated a significant vasodilation of the fetal-placental circulation (P < 0.0001). The PTHrP receptor antagonist [Asn10, Leu 11]PTHrP (7-34) (102 nM) was infused in U46619-constricted placentae in the presence and absence of PTHrP (1-34) (10.2 nM). The PTHrP antagonist alone had no significant effect in the fetal-placental circulation. The antagonist significantly attenuated the response to PTHrP (1-34) (P < 0.015). Based on the data obtained in this study it is suggested that locally produced PTHrP (1-34) may be involved in the regulation of normal human fetal-placental vascular tone in autocrine and/or paracrine fashion."

CD011053,0,12709922,0,Inherited thrombophilia and gestational vascular complications.,"Severe obstetric complications, including preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, abruptio placentae, and stillbirth, constitute a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death. The etiology of these severe obstetric complications is still unknown. However, the frequent finding of structural and thrombotic changes in placental capillaries, which lead to inadequate fetomaternal circulation and decreased placental perfusion, and the high prevalence of heritable or acquired risk factors for thrombosis found in women with these complications strongly suggest a cause-and-effect relationship. This review describes the recent findings on the association between these obstetric complications and the various thrombophilias, and recent therapeutic approaches. Aspirin, which was regarded as the drug of choice for the prevention of such obstetric complications, has proved to be ineffective in a large clinical trial. The encouraging observations on the efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparins, which are also included in the recently published guidelines of The American College of Chest Physicians, are summarized in this review. However, controlled clinical trials are still necessary to allow the development of better clinical standards."

Although the cause of this anomaly remains unknown, it would appear to include both a genetic and an immunological origin possibly favourised by special underlying conditions and certain obstetric circumstances. Prostaglandin imbalance (in particular prostacyclins and Thromboxane A2) appears to be one of the chief factors governing these anomalies. One of the consequences of these mechanisms is the onset of hypertension but other disturbances are essential features. In particular, disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur leading to the release of numerous microthrombi which cause placental (leading to chronic fetal distress), renal, hepatic and cerebral lesions."
CD011053,0,10381779,0,"AA-2414, an antioxidant and thromboxane receptor blocker, completely inhibits peroxide-induced vasoconstriction in the human placenta.","We hypothesized that AA-2414, a novel thromboxane receptor blocker with antioxidant properties, would inhibit peroxide-induced vasoconstriction in the isolated perfused human placental cotyledon. In study 1, placental cotyledons (n = 5) were perfused serially for 20- min intervals with control KrebsRinger-bicarbonate (KRB) buffer, t-butyl hydroperoxide (Px; 100 microM), KRB buffer, and KRB buffer containing Px to which progressively increasing concentrations of AA-2414 were added (1 x 10(-8) to 1 x 10(-4) mol/l). In study 2, placental cotyledons (n = 6) were perfused with control KRB buffer, Px alone, KRB buffer, 1 x 10(-5) mol/l AA-2414 alone, Px plus AA-2414, and Px alone. Compared with control, perfusion with Px significantly increased perfusion pressure, vascular resistance, and the maternal and fetal secretion rates of lipid peroxides, thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha. In study 1, AA-2414 + Px produced a dose-response inhibition of Px-induced increases in perfusion pressure, vascular resistance, and maternal secretion of lipid peroxides and TXB2. In study 2, perfusing AA-2414 at a dose of 1 x 10(-5) mol/l completely inhibited Px-induced vasoconstriction and increases in lipid peroxide and TXB2 secretion rates, but only partially inhibited the increase in 6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha secretion. We conclude that AA-2414 inhibited peroxide-induced vasoconstriction in the human placenta, as well as peroxide- induced increases in the placental secretion rates of lipid peroxides and thromboxane, but only partially inhibited peroxide-induced increases in the placental secretion rate of prostacyclin."
CD011053,0,23140618,0,[Management of post-abortum infections].,"In countries where induced abortions are legal and medically supervised, the frequency of post-abortion infections is low and maternal death is infrequent. Nevertheless, short and long term consequences of post-abortion infections must be addressed. Sexually transmitted pathogens are frequently in cause here. Risk factors include in particular young age (less than 24 years), low socioeconomic level, late pregnancy, nulliparity, and history of previous untreated pelvic inflammatory disease. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and an inflammatory syndrome occurring within 2 to 3 weeks after spontaneous or induced abortion. A pelvic ultrasound is recommended in order to ensure the uterus vacuity and to look for a possible pelvic abscess, and bacteriological samples must be performed. Management consists in a regimen combining two antibiotics intravenously, with the possible addition of intravenous heparin in case of pelvic thrombophlebitis. Antibiotics can be discontinued 48 h of a clinical improvement and further treatment by oral route brings no benefit. Intrauterine retention associated with post-abortion endometritis must be addressed either by medical or surgical method."

Since her childhood, the patient had experienced a tendency to develop purpura following minor trauma. But she had not had major bleeding even during pregnancy and delivery. On April 4, 1987, she presented generalized convulsion. A high density mass in the right temporal lobe was demonstrated with CT scan. Carotid angiogram was normal except that the right anterior choroidal artery was stretched. Inhomogeneous signal intensities in T1- and T2-weighted MRI images were seen in the tumor locus. The clinical diagnosis was cavernous angioma which was complicated with intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient had a disorder of platelet function without thrombocytopenia. Her bleeding time was markedly prolonged. Because of this, we did not try surgical excision at first. During the 13-month observation period, however, intracerebral bleeding occurred 5 times. We decided to operate on the patient using fresh blood and platelet transfusion. The postoperative course was uneventful and pathological diagnosis confirmed cavernous angioma. We would like to emphasize possible pitfalls in treating cases of intracerebral angioma with thrombasthenia."
CD011053,0,567403,0,The choice of test for diagnosis of venous thrombosis.,"Doppler ultrasound is the preferred screening test in asymptomatic patients with high risk for venous thrombosis. Radiographic phlebography leads to definitive diagnosis in most instances. Radionuclide angiography using 99mTc MAA with delayed images to detect particle entrapment in venous blood clots can be used when radiographic phlebography is contraindicated or impractical. To detect active thrombosis in patients with past venous disease, the serial fibrinogen uptake test is the method of choice. This method is also used to monitor the efficacy of anticoagulation therapy and to detect propagating thrombosis in patients failing to respond to anticoagulation, hopefully before massive lethal pulmonary embolism occurs. Radionuclide methods are contraindicated in pregnant women and children where non invasive methods are preferred. No completely satisfactory test exists for detection of hypogastric vein thrombosis. Among the methods currently being evaluated in the laboratory the ultrasound B-scan imaging, 99mTc MAA uptake test and 99mTc mAA venous scan offer the best possibilities for successful clinical application."

However, vascular episodes were absent in up to 40% of the 67 homozygotes for the G20210A described so far, which indicates that the clinical expression depends on additional risk/trigger factors. We describe six homozygotes for the G20210A variant, among which the first pair of siblings (cases n. 3 and 4) reported so far that displayed a strongly heterogeneous clinical outcome. Case 1, a female of 27 years, developed a full thrombosis of common femoral, superficial and popliteal veins. She assumed oral contraceptives in the last two years. Case n. 2, 34 years old, suffered of recurrent pregnancy loss in absence of any causative alteration. Cases n. 3 and n. 5 experienced arterial thrombotic disease, i.e., juvenile myocardial infarction (40 years old) and stroke (48 years old), respectively, in absence of other risk factors. Finally, cases n. 4 and 6 identified as homozygotes for the FII G20210A variant being consanguineous of symptomatic subjects bearing the variant, did not experience any episode of venous nor arterial disease. Both of them have chronic liver disease with an impairement of the prothrombin time INR. Thus, homozygotes for the G20210A are at risk for arterial (in addition to venous) thromobotic events; chronic liver disease might modulate this risk."

CD011053,0,17569300,0,[Endothelin 1 and angiotensin II in preeeclampsia].,"It is generally thought that development of hypertension in preeclampsia (PE) is due to generalized endothelial dysfunction and/or results from an imbalance in the production and/or action of vasoactive factors, resulting in higher cytosolic Ca2+ concentration which in turn leads to vasoconstriction and decreased blood pressure perfusion in organs, including the fetoplacental unit. Among vasoactive factors involved in blood pressure regulation, endothelin 1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II) regulate cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and therefore are considered in this review. PE is associated with higher circulating and placental ET-1 levels, observation that explains, at least in part, vasoconstriction and oxidative stress. Higher and lower Ang II sensitivity seen in PE and normal pregnancy, respectively, could not be explained by changes in renin-angiotensin system components, including Ang II receptors (AT1). During normal pregnancy, AT1 receptors are found as monomers and are inactivated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to lower Ang II sensitivity. In contrast, PE is associated with increased AT1/bradykinin receptors (B2) heterodimers which are resistant to inactivation by ROS, maintaining increased AT1-receptor stimulated signaling in PE. In addition, AT-1 agonistic antibodies (AT1-AA) obtained from PE women increases intracellular Ca2+, NADPH oxidase components and ROS, effects not observed with normal pregnancy AT1-AA."

The objective was to nucleate the best evidence regarding the disorder in order to facilitate early detection and treatment recommendations and document adverse outcomes. Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Databases, DARE, and OVID databases were searched using the following keywords: 'arterial' AND 'thrombus' OR 'thrombosis' OR 'thromboembolism' OR 'embolism' AND 'spontaneous' AND 'at birth' OR 'newborn' OR 'neonatal' OR 'fetal' AND 'umbilical cord' OR 'umbilical wall necrosis' AND 'coagulation abnormality' OR 'placenta bits' OR 'ischemic limbs'.

CD011053,0,10907449,0,[What investigations should be done following the first episode of pulmonary embolism?].,"Thromboembolic venous disease is both common and potentially serious, thus the first episode of pulmonary embolus calls for careful assessment. This involves two stages: a search for a venous localization of the pulmonary embolus and a search for risk factors contributing to thromboembolic venous disease. The emergence of non-invasive echographic-Doppler techniques and echocardiography make possible the localization of any residual venous thrombus. The risk of post thrombotic disease is raised in symptomatic thrombotic venous disease which requires wearing elastic stockings for a least two years. On the other hand this risk has not been assessed in asymptomatic cases of venous thrombosis. A search for risk factors requires a detailed history, a rigorous clinical examination and a routine list of laboratory investigations. Some complex investigations for detecting the early stages of a neoplasm would not appear justified unless there is objective evidence to support his. At the same time thrombophilia studies are not currently performed routinely for a first episode but may be suggested in the following cases: family history of thromboembolic venous disease, age less than 45, including those in whom the episode occurs at the same time as pregnancy, or whilst taking hormone therapy, idiopathic thromboembolism, the association of arterial and venous thrombi and finally venous thromboses occurring in an unusual anatomical site. Prospective studies have shown the value of long term anticoagulation in patients suffering from constitutional hemostatic anomalies. Finally, if there is an after thought of occult cancer or constitutional thrombocytopenia a careful follow up should be performed particularly during the first year."

During 3 stages of observation--1974-1979, 1980-1985 and 1986-6/1990--we registered 123 cases. The division into time intervals was based on the introduction of sensitive ultrasonic methods in 1980 and the vaginal scan in 1986.

CD011053,0,23342903,0,[Clinical practice guidelines of the Team of Experts of the Polish Gynecological Society: management of the intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy].,"Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) constitutes the most common, reversible liver disease closely connected with pregnancy and spontaneously resolving in puerperium. ICP usually reoccurs in consecutive pregnancies (45-90%), often in a more intensified form. Many compounds (hormones, cytokines, medicines, endotoxins) can impair transport in the hepatocyte, disturb the intracellular transport and increase the permeability of the intercellular connections. As a result, the elements of bile may appear in the peripheral blood. Gestational cholestasis constitutes a classic example of intrahepatic cholestasis. The etiology of ICP is multifactorial with hormonal, genetic and environmental factors participating in the process. The diagnosis is based on the presence of pruritus, elevated values of bile acids in the blood serum and of aminotransferases (aspartic, aminopropionic and gamma-glutamylotranspeptydase (AspAt, AlAt, GGTP)), as well as spontaneous remission in the second or third week after childbirth, of lack of other illnesses causing pruritus and icterus. Clinical and biochemical symptoms of ICP include: pruritus without skin rash (usually after 30 weeks of gestation), mild icterus, steatorrhea etc. Abnormalities in the laboratory tests of the LFT (liver function tests) encompass: an increase in the serum concentration of fatty acids (BA) which can be the first and only laboratory abnormality. Concentrations surpassing 10 micromol/l are considered to be abnormal. Concentration of BA higher than 40 micromol/l allows to recognize a case of severe ICP, connected with the risk of premature delivery presence of the meconium liquor, surgical means of delivery and low APGAR score of the newborn (< 7 pt). In about 80% of pregnant women with ICP, the BA concentration ranges between 10-40 micromol/l, but perinatal results are comparable with uncomplicated pregnancies. Some authors are of the opinion that abnormal AlAt value is the most sensitive test, other authors consider the abnormal values of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin to be the most pathognomonic factors. Other abnormal tests include: higher activity of alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase correlated with an increase of the alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin; mild metabolic acidosis; dyslipidemia with elevated concentrations of the total lipids, total cholesterol and free LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein; abnormal glucose tolerance test. ICP constitutes a medical problem that carries a considerable risk for the fetus, resulting from an increased flow of bile acids to the fetal blood circulation (elevated level in the amniotic fluid, in the umbilical blood serum and meconium). The risk of adverse effects for the fetus correlates with the rise of BA concentration in maternal blood serum. Cholestasis increases the risk of premature labor, presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid, fetal bradycardia, intrauterine asphyxia and stillbirth, particularly when the concentration of serum bile acids on an empty stomach is above 40 micromol/l. However, maternal clinical signs and symptoms do not correlate with the fetal outcome. Aspiration of bile acids or their accumulation in the fetal blood circulation are responsible for the increased frequency of RDS appearing in ICP. The aim of the obstetric management of ICP is to reduce maternal symptoms and biochemical disorders and to minimize the risk of premature delivery fetal distress and sudden death. ICP management should include: bed regime, light, low-fat diet, no stress, upper abdomen ultrasound examination, LFT tests and thrombotic tests once a week, monitoring of the fetal well-being with the available biophysical methods, pharmacotherapy and therapeutic termination of pregnancy in case of serious illness and/or the fetal distress. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the basis of the pharmacological treatment of pregnant women and currently constitutes the most promising treatment option of ICP. UDCA is administered orally in the dosage of 10-16 mg/kg/24, what in practice means 250-300 mg/2-3 times a day."
CD011053,0,20041838,0,Risk factors and mediators of the vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension in pregnancy.,"Normal pregnancy is associated with significant hemodynamic changes and vasodilation in the uterine and systemic circulation in order to meet the metabolic demands of the mother and developing fetus. Hypertension in pregnancy (HTN-Preg) and preeclampsia (PE) are major complications and life-threatening conditions to both the mother and fetus. PE is precipitated by various genetic, dietary and environmental factors. Although the initiating events of PE are unclear, inadequate invasion of cytotrophoblasts into the uterine artery is thought to reduce uteroplacental perfusion pressure and lead to placental ischemia/hypoxia. Placental hypoxia induces the release of biologically active factors such as growth factor inhibitors, anti-angiogenic proteins, inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, hypoxia-inducible factors, and antibodies to vascular angiotensin II receptor. These bioactive factors affect the production/activity of various vascular mediators in the endothelium, smooth muscle and extracellular matrix, leading to severe vasoconstriction and HTN. As an endothelial cell disorder, PE is associated with decreased vasodilator mediators such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin and hyperpolarizing factor and increased vasoconstrictor mediators such as endothelin, angiotensin II and thromboxane A(2). PE also involves enhanced mechanisms of vascular smooth muscle contraction including intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), and [Ca(2+)](i) sensitization pathways such as protein kinase C, Rho-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Changes in extracellular matrix composition and matrix metalloproteases activity also promote vascular remodeling and further vasoconstriction in the uterine and systemic circulation. Characterization of the predisposing risk factors, the biologically active factors, and the vascular mediators associated with PE holds the promise for early detection, and should help design specific genetic and pharmacological tools for the management of the vascular dysfunction associated with HTN-Preg."

We retrospectively identified 40 consecutive pregnant patients who underwent CTPA from January 2005 to December 2006. Forty consecutive age-matched non-pregnant women were used as a control group. Studies were subjectively graded according to overall image quality by two readers in consensus, in randomised and blinded manner. Moreover, contrast enhancement of pulmonary arteries was subjectively and objectively evaluated. The proportion of sub-optimal studies was more than three times higher in the pregnant group (27.5%, n = 11) compared with the non-pregnant group (7.5%, n = 3; p = 0.015). Mean contrast enhancement was consistently higher in the non-pregnant group compared with pregnant group, both subjectively and objectively. The percentage of inadequately opacified vascular segments was more than two times higher in the pregnant group (28.7%, n = 264) than in the non-pregnant group (13.3%, n = 122; p = 0.0001). The incidence of sub-optimal CTPA studies is higher in pregnancy when compared with an age-matched non-pregnant control group.

The other twin died in utero at 32 weeks gestational age. Because there was no evidence of fetal distress the pregnancy was allowed to continue until 36 weeks gestational age. Injuries to the surviving twin due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC) and vascular thrombosis or to anoxia and ischemia may occur when there are anastomoses between the circulatory systems of the two twins, i.e., in monochorionic pregnancies. The classically recommended strategy is to wait for adequate maturity of the surviving fetus (36 weeks). It is suggested that this attitude may be overly expectant and may deserve reappraisal."
CD011053,0,4032034,0,Gold-195m: a steady-state imaging agent for venography that gives blood velocity measurement.,"Gold-195m has found applications in first-pass studies for investigating both right and left ventricular activity as well as lung transit. Owing to its reasonably short half-life of 30 sec we have found it particularly useful for imaging leg veins up to and including the inferior vena cava. Its short half-life prevents recirculation activity from appearing, so continuous perfusion into a superficial foot vein and application of ankle tourniquets yield a steady-state image of the deep veins, with particularly good resolution. Its decay pattern along a vessel is very sensitive to blood velocity, so measurement of activity at various points on a vein in a computer static image can give velocity values that reveal abnormalities due to partial or complete thrombosis. The radiation dosimetry of 195mAu used in this way is lower than contrast and technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin [( 99mTc]MAA) venography, making it particularly useful for investigating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in pregnancy."

Few studies have documented thrombotic lesions observed on the pathologic examination of the placenta in women with severe pregnancy complications. Moreover, a significantly higher rate of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations have been found in placentas with thrombotic events compared with normal placentas. In addition, clinical studies have been performed, using Doppler ultrasonography, to assess the uterine placental circulation in women with thrombophilia. Doppler studies of the umbilical artery in cases of intrauterine growth retardation have shown a high systolic to diastolic ratio (S/D) ratio, suggesting an increase in the resistance of the placental small vessels. When these placental vessels were examined after delivery, significant differences were found in comparison with placental vessels of normal pregnancies. Most of the Doppler studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries in pregnancies with thrombophilia were performed in women with antiphospholipid antibodies. The other pathologic conditions associated with thrombophilia and complications of pregnancy were published only recently. These few studies have demonstrated abnormal umbilical and uterine arteries blood flow in complicated pregnancies. Finally, few Doppler studies also suggest improved uterine placental circulation when women with thrombophilia received thromboprophylaxis."

This 29-year-old woman had been given a diagnosis of MCTD when she was 19 years old. She was admitted to our department two days after delivery of a child, because of dyspnea on exertion. Acute thromboembolism was suspected because of: (1) chest roentgenogram showing cardiomegaly and enlargement of the left main pulmonary artery, (2) a lung perfusion scan showing a segmental defect in the left S6 and S8 areas, (3) laboratory studies showing abnormally high WBC, LDH, FDP, and D-D dimer, and (4) arterial blood gas analyses showing mild hypoxemia and hypocapnia. Thrombolytic therapy with heparin and urokinase was begun, and was followed by a loop diurtic and anticoagulation with warfarin. One month after admission, cardiac enlargement and the A-aDO2 were found to have decreased. At that time, cardiac catheterization was done and revealed pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure: 45 mmHg) and low cardiac output with no detectable thrombosis in the left pulmonary artery. The patient was subsequently treated with a calcium antagonist and a prostacyclin derivative, and her condition was stable for 5 months. Then her exercise tolerance gradually decreased due to shortness of breath, and cardiomegaly gradually increased over the next 3 months. Eight months after delivery of the child, the patient died of right heart failure. In clinically stable patients with MCTD, delivery of a child may lead to pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension."
CD011053,0,2916630,0,Factors influencing hemostasis after umbilical vein puncture in vitro.,"Bleeding from the site of cordocentesis can be detected by ultrasound examination, but significant hemorrhage into the amniotic fluid rarely occurs. To evaluate the relative contribution of amniotic fluid thromboplastins and the quantity of Wharton's jelly in facilitating coagulation at the puncture site, amniotic fluid samples and umbilical cord segments were obtained at cesarean section from 20 patients. After puncture of the umbilical vein, bleeding times were measured in amniotic fluid and 0.9% sodium chloride. The quantity of Wharton's jelly was assessed by measuring umbilical cord circumference. Mean bleeding times were significantly shorter in amniotic fluid compared with saline solution, but there was no consistent relationship between bleeding times and umbilical cord circumference. We conclude that properties of amniotic fluid facilitate coagulation at the site of umbilical vein puncture."

Cardiac manifestations of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) also have been documented but involve structural and valvular heart disease. Diastolic dysfunction in PAPS has not been well described. Therefore, 10 patients with PAPS (nine women and one man) of mean age 30 +/- 7 years (range 20 to 46 years) and 10 healthy age-, sex-, weight-, and height-matched control subjects were studied by echocardiography. Anticardiolipin antibody concentrations of patients with PAPS were > 80 immunoglobulin G phospholipid units as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Doppler-derived parameters of left ventricular filling showed a significant association between PAPS and diastolic dysfunction compared with control, as evidenced by a decrease in peak early filling velocity (52 +/- 10 cm/sec vs 67 +/- 12 cm/sec; p < 0.01), a decrease in the ratio of peak early to peak atrial filling velocities (1.03 +/- 0.40 vs 1.52 +/- 0.28; p < 0.005), a decrease in the mean deceleration rate of early filling (338 +/- 75 cm/sec2 vs 590 +/- 227 cm/sec2; p < 0.005), and an increase in the percentage of atrial contribution to filling and deceleration time. Left ventricular mass, diastolic filling time, and heart rate did not differ between groups. Left ventricular systolic function was normal and ejection fraction did not differ between patients with PAPS and control subjects (63% +/- 2% vs 65% +/- 7%; p not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011053,0,1791292,0,"[Late postpartum eclampsia, myth or reality?].","It has never been formally established whether eclampsia can come on more than 48 hours after delivery. We report a case of a patient who had convulsions together with transitory raised blood pressure coming on 14 days after her delivery. MRI was carried out 24 hours after the attack and showed pathological sub-cortical images and there was a hyper signal at T2. This is now a well known feature and has been described in the course of typical eclampsia fits. On the other hand MRI is able to eliminate a certain number of differential diagnoses such as cerebral thrombophlebitis, cerebral vascular accidents and tumours. A cerebral blood flow study and a trans-cranial Doppler flow study showed (as far as we know for the first time) a lessening in perfusion and in speed of flow giving rise to lowered blood circulation in that part of the brain and suggestive of vascular spasm. This observation makes it very likely that eclamptic crises can occur two weeks after delivery and favours a vascular spasm being the origin of these crises."

In humans, acute PPD poisoning is known to cause rhabdomyolisis and particularly myocardial lysis. However, its toxicity for the fetus has never been reported in the literature. We report a case of myocardial lysis in a fetus expelled by a 22-year-old mother after apparent ingestion of an unknown amount of PPD. The patient was admitted to our intensive care unit with acute onset of respiratory distress and rhabdomyolysis. The pelvic ultrasonography on admission showed a normally progressing pregnancy of 23-24 weeks. On day 9 post-ingestion, the patient spontaneously expelled a non-viable fetus. The fetal examination did not show any external or macroscopic abnormalities. However, the histopathological exam showed an important heart and lung congestion. There was also some interstitial edema and inflammation at the base of the lingua, in addition to a chorionic villus thrombosis and abruptio placentae. The histopathology of the myocardium showed lysis of the cardiac muscle. This observation suggests that the PPD was most likely responsible for the myocardial injury in the fetus."
CD011053,0,7573802,0,"Effect of ethanol on prostacyclin, thromboxane, and prostaglandin E production in human umbilical veins.","The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ethanol on prostacyclin (PGI2), prostaglandin E (PGE), and thromboxane (TXA2) production in perfused human umbilical veins. PGI2, PGE, and TXA2 levels were measured from human umbilical veins perfused with either 25, 50, or 100 mM ethanol by radioimmunoassay of their stable metabolites. Alcohol content was measured by an enzymatic spectrophotometric assay. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference Test. Ethanol decreased PGI2 production in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.05). In a concentration of 25 mM, ethanol did not affect PGI2 production, whereas 50 mM decreased levels after 60 min of perfusion (p < 0.01). With 100 mM ethanol, PGI2 production was decreased after 15, 30, and 60 min of perfusion (ps < 0.05), and the TXA2/PGI2 ratio was significantly elevated at all time points (p < 0.01). Ethanol (100 mM) did not affect TXA2 or PGE production. Reduction of PGI2 levels and the increase in the TXA2/PGI2 ratio seen after ethanol perfusion in umbilical veins may cause vascular disruption in the umbilical-placental circulation. This may, in part, be a contributing mechanism to the teratogenic effects of ethanol."

Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the effects of PE may persist long after pregnancy, in both the mother and the offspring, as increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. The last decade has produced new insights into the pathogenesis of PE. The initiating event in PE appears to be impaired placental perfusion and subsequent placental ischemia, which results in the elaboration of numerous factors. Factors such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, soluble endoglin and the angiotensin II type-1 receptor autoantibodies contribute to maternal endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunction, marked by increased reactive oxygen species and decreased bioavailable VEGF, nitric oxide and prostacyclin. However, the importance of the various endothelial and humoral factors that mediate these changes during PE remain to be elucidated."

In 72 cases, an intravascular transfusion was also attempted at the same site. In 91.1% of the samplings, more than 1 mL of pure fetal blood was obtained, and in 89.9% of transfusions, fetal hematocrit or platelet concentration was raised to a satisfactory level. Fetal bradycardia and intraperitoneal bleeding occurred in 2.3% of the cases. Among fetuses at low risk, there was only one intrauterine death, which occurred 3 weeks after the procedure, and one spontaneous abortion in a patient with twin pregnancy. In fetuses with Rh/Kell alloimmunization or perinatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, the survival rate was 86%. Four liver enzymes were assayed in the blood of 13 fetuses that underwent transfusions at the intrahepatic vein and 13 controls in whom the site of sampling was the umbilical vein at the placental cord insertion. No differences were found between the groups at the subsequent transfusion 2-5 weeks later. The intrahepatic vein is an alternate site of sampling/transfusion when access is difficult or failure occurs at the placental cord insertion. This approach minimizes the risks of fetal blood loss, fetomaternal hemorrhage, arterial vasospasm, and cord tamponade."

At a regional obstetric hospital we identified 13 cases of hemorrhagic endovasculitis among 1938 placentas from singleton pregnancies of greater than or equal to 20 weeks' gestation over a 3-month period, an incidence of 0.67% of unselected pregnancies. All cases were live-births without intrauterine growth retardation. Associated clinical features were pregnancy-induced hypertension, nuchal cord at delivery, and postterm gestation. One infant had severe perinatal asphyxia with long-term psychomotor retardation. In the placenta, hemorrhagic endovasculitis was associated with infarction, fetal vessel thrombosis, and villitis of unknown cause.

CD011053,0,19277402,0,"Venous thromboembolism in pregnancy: diagnosis, management and prevention.","A pregnant woman has a two- to five-fold higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than a non-pregnant woman of the same age and, in developed countries, she is more likely to die from fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) than from obstetric haemorrhage. The increased VTE risk is mediated through normal physiological changes of pregnancy including alterations in haemostasis that favour coagulation, reduced fibrinolysis and pooling and stasis of blood in the lower limbs. Thrombophilia, smoking, obesity, immobility and postpartum factors such as infection, bleeding and emergency surgery (including emergency caesarian section) also increase the risk of pregnancy-related VTE. The diagnosis of VTE can be safely established with acceptable radiation exposure to the fetus using readily available imaging modalities such as ultrasound, ventilation perfusion lung scanning and computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. However, the optimal diagnostic strategies still remain to be determined. If there is no contraindication to anticoagulation, commencing treatment prior to objective confirmation should be strongly considered. For the mother and fetus, effective and safe treatment is readily available with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), but optimal dosing of these agents in pregnancy remains controversial. Emerging data support antepartum LMWH prophylaxis for women with previous VTE if the event was unprovoked or in the presence of thrombophilia. On the other hand, women with prior provoked VTE and no thrombophilia or women with asymptomatic thrombophilia (but a family history of VTE) can safely be managed with antepartum surveillance. Postpartum prophylaxis is recommended for women with prior VTE or thrombophilia (and a family history of VTE)."
CD011053,0,15783117,0,Intraparenchymal renal artery aneurysms. Case report with review and update of the literature.,"Increased interest in aneurysms involving the renal artery and its branches has occurred during the past 3 decades. The prevalence of renal artery aneurysms is approximately 0.01%-1% in the general population as well as 2.5% in hypertensive patients undergoing angiography. Intraparenchymal renal artery aneurysms (IPRAAs) are rare since being detected in less than 10% of patients with renal artery aneurysms. The Authors report an unusual case of multiple small intrarenal artery aneurysms associated with a large IPRAA located in the mid portion of the right kidney. Usually, IPRAAs are secondary to diseases or injuries of the kidney vascular network. They are classified as true, false, saccular, fusiform, dissecting, and microaneurysms. Potential complications of IPRAAs include peripheral dissection, thrombosis, hypertension, renal infarction and rupture. IRAAs may be detected incidentally as well as present with urologic symptoms and signs related to complications. Actually, IRAAs are investigated by non invasive modalities including duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, spiral three-dimensional computed tomography angiography, and three-dimensional reconstructed rotational digital substraction angiography of the segmental and distant branches of the renal artery. Angiography with intrarterial injection of contrast material is the gold standard in diagnosing IPRAAs. Treatment options for IPRAAs include observation, aneurysmectomy with surgical repair, endovascular procedures, nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy. Observation is indicated for asymptomatic intraparenchymal renal artery aneurysms measuring less than 2 cm in diameter. Surgical repair of IPRAAs includes aneurysmectomy and reconstruction of the renal artery by in vivo or ex vivo technique. The procedure is indicated for IPRAAs causing renovascular hypertension, dissection, urologic symptoms, embolization, local expansion and women of childbearing age with a potential for pregnancy. In recent years, transcatheter arterial embolization has emerged as a simple, useful and effective technique in managing IRAAs. The procedure is performed by transfemoral catheterization as well as by superselective catheterization and embolization of interlobar arteries with 3F microcatheters. Endovascular occlusion is obtained by using gelatin sponge, steel coils, detachable baloons, and conventional non-detachable microcoils delivered through a microcatheter. Nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy are reserved for conditions precluding renal revascularization which include overt RAA rupture, covert RAA rupture, artery-to-vein fistula, renal cell carcinoma, end stage nephropaty, renal infarction, severe ischemic renal atrophy or complex intrarenal aneurysms. Recently, partial nephrectomy by the laparoscopic approach has been proposed for managing IPRAAs and the procedure is considered feasible and safe."

CD011053,0,6226949,0,[Phlebographic diagnosis of lower limb venous thrombosis].,"Thrombosis of the veins of the lower limbs and of the inferior vena cava can be diagnosed by free flow phlebography completed by a technical device preventing puncture of the femoral veins. The thrombus shows as a lacuna or a cupshaped arrest of the contrast medium. This method can be used in most modern radiological centres and carries little risk in trained hands. Its field of application is limited in that the pelvic veins (iliac veins excepted) and the deep femoral vein are imperfectly explored or unexplored, but it is superior to other methods - such as labelled fibrinogen, D√∂ppler ultrasonography or rheography - which are less sensitive, less specific and unable to localize precisely the site and extension of the thrombosis. However, these methods can be used at the patient's bedside and can be repeated at will, being painless. Whenever pulmonary thrombo-embolism is suspected on clinical grounds or on the results of other exploratory methods, phlebography should be systematically performed (except in pregnant women) as it helps to decide on the treatment. In contrast, it has no place in the routine detection and surveillance of the disease which are better carried out using non-invasive techniques."

The two reported cases are about fetal prenatal diagnosis of vein of Galen aneurysm, confirmed by ultrasonography, which evolved for caesarian delivery at term gestation. Magnetic resonance was carried out after birth, confirming prenatal diagnosis. The first patient had spontaneous thrombosis of the aneurysm while the second was submitted to embolization.

CD011053,0,8972414,0,Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis or refractory postpartum fever of undetermined etiology.,"The objective of this study was to review and characterize the presentation, diagnostic dilemmas, management, and prognosis of postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. Medical records of postpartum women with the diagnosis of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis were reviewed for the 8-year period 1986-1994. Cases of documented ovarian vein thrombosis or those with other pelvic pathology on imaging study were excluded. Thirty-one women, four following vaginal delivery and 27 following cesarean delivery, with a final diagnosis of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis were identified. All patients demonstrated refractory febrile morbidity (mean 5.5 +/- 1.9 days prior to instituting heparin therapy) despite multiagent antimicrobial therapy with ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin. Imaging studies (CT and/or ultrasound) were performed in 20 women and revealed no pelvic pathology. The patients required an average of 4.7 +/- 2.1 days (median 5, range 1-9 days) of heparin therapy before defervescence. Heparin levels were therapeutic at a mean of less than 24 h (range 6-24 h). The average dose of heparin required was 16.0 +/- 3.0 U/kg/h. Nine women had 13 subsequent pregnancies without recurrent thromboembolic complications. Currently available imaging studies cannot diagnose the entity we now define as septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (once cases of ovarian vein thrombosis are excluded). Our findings do not support the time-honored rule that septic pelvic thrombophlebitis responds within 24-48 h to therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin. Therefore, criteria other than imaging studies or immediate defervescence following heparin therapy are necessary for diagnosis of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. A more appropriate terminology for septic pelvic thrombophlebitis should be refractory postpartum fever of undetermined etiology."

CD011053,0,1672969,0,Thromboxane dominance and prostacyclin deficiency in habitual abortion.,"To evaluate the significance of vasoactive prostanoids in habitual abortion, we measured urinary excretion of prostacyclin metabolites (6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and of thromboxane A2 metabolites (TxB2 and 2,3-dinor-TxB2) during 25 pregnancies in 22 women with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). The control group were 16 pregnant women with no history of abortion. Ultrasound examination at first follow-up appointment showed a living fetus in 23 pregnancies of women with RSA. 9 of these pregnancies ended in abortion; 14 continued to term as did all the pregnancies in the control group. Compared with controls, women with RSA had a lower (p less than 0.05) ratio of prostacyclin to thromboxane between weeks 4 and 7 of gestation and a lower (p less than 0.01) output of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha between weeks 8 and 11. Women whose pregnancies ended in abortion had higher (p less than 0.05) output of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 between weeks 4 and 7 of gestation and lower (p less than 0.01) excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha between weeks 8 and 11 compared with women whose pregnancies proceeded to term. We conclude that deficiency of vasodilatory prostacyclin may be a factor in habitual abortion."
CD011053,0,16147727,0,Umbilical artery Doppler waveform indices from normal pregnant women are related to vasodilatation of placental chorionic plate small arteries.,Blood flow control within the fetoplacental circulation is poorly understood despite the essential role of the placenta in pregnancy. Our study compared an in vitro assessment of placental chorionic plate small artery function with in vivo measures of umbilical artery blood flow. Umbilical artery Doppler waveform analysis was performed on women (N=8) with uncomplicated pregnancies within 24 hours of delivery. Small arteries (n=25) were dissected from the placental chorionic plate from biopsies at term and studied using parallel wire myography. Chorionic plate arteries developed maintained constrictions to the thromboxane-mimetic U46619. Nitric oxide (NO) donation with the endothelial-independent agent sodium nitroprusside elicited significant relaxation compared to paired control vessels. This vasodilatation correlated significantly with both pulsatility and resistance indices measured in the umbilical artery. We conclude that Doppler indices in the umbilical artery are inversely proportional to the maximal relaxation achieved by chorionic plate small arteries in response to a NO donor.

Our perfusion team has invested time lecturing to non-cardiac specialties about perfusion-led technology. This resulted in working closely with the obstetrics team to treat a pregnant patient with the bleeding disorder Gray Platelet Syndrome. In the first instance, we used our Thromboelastograph (TEG) platelet mapping programme to assess the patient. These results agreed with the platelet aggregation tests, showing a degree of platelet inhibition, but it was the overall clotting profile (basic thrombelastograph), showing a borderline hyper-coagulable state, that was of most interest and commonly seen in pregnancy. We believe a TEG result within acceptable limits could help re-adjust the risk of spinal haematomas following regional anaesthesia, thereby, reducing the risks of difficult intubation and general anaesthetic exposure to the baby. The case study describes both basic and platelet mapping thrombelastographs and their potential role in not only this patient with Gray Platelet Syndrome, but any obstetric patient where there are bleeding concerns."

This may be due in part to low concentrations of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Women in labor between 24-34 weeks' gestation were selected, according to their hospital registration number, to receive 10 mg vitamin K1 intramuscularly at least four hours before delivery. Control women received no vitamin K. The study included only infants born of mothers who were in hospital more than four hours before delivery, who weighed 1500 g or less at birth, and were less than 34 weeks' gestation. Twenty vitamin K1 and 33 control infants qualified for the study. Infants in both groups received routine postnatal vitamin K1. On admission, the infant's prothrombin activity and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were measured. A head ultrasound was done between days 2 and 4 of life. Results demonstrated significantly improved prothrombin activity, a nonsignificant trend toward improved PTT, and a significantly decreased frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage in infants whose mothers had received vitamin K1. The effect of antenatal vitamin K1 on prothrombin activity and PTT appeared to be more pronounced in female infants."
CD011053,0,8944239,0,[Cerebrovascular diseases in pregnancy and puerperium].,"The incidence, prognosis and causes of strokes associated with pregnancy or puerperium are poorly known, and we do not know whether and to what extent they differ from those of the general female population of childbearing age. Based on early and mostly hospital-based studies, it has been claimed that pregnancy increases the likelihood of cerebral infarction to about 13 times the rate expected outside of pregnancy. However, because of methodological weaknesses, these estimates must be regarded with caution. In a recent study in Ile de France, the incidence of arterial ischemic strokes associated with pregnancy or early puerperium was 4.3 per 100,000 deliveries (95% confidence interval, 2.4 to 7.1), a rate not much different from that for all women of childbearing age. Ischemic strokes related to various etiologies have been reported in pregnancy and the puerperium. Their relative frequency is poorly known because there are no recent large series of pregnancy-related ischemic strokes benefiting from detailed investigation with modern imaging techniques. Most of the known causes of ischemic stroke in the young been reported during pregnancy. In most of these conditions, it is uncertain whether pregnancy is coincidental or plays a role in the occurrence of stroke. Among pregnancy-specific causes, eclampsia may be associated with focal neurological deficits of sudden onset, consistent with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. However, the precise pathogenesis of these stroke-like focal deficits remains poorly understood. Except for some women who have persisting neurological deficits and neuroradiological abnormalities suggesting brain infarction, the reversibility of the neurological clinical signs and neuroradiological lesions within a few days or weeks in most cases argues against the existence of true cerebral ischemic necrosis. The two other pregnancy-specific causes-choriocarcinoma and amniotic fluid embolism-are rarely responsible for focal cerebral ischemia. Other diseases such as peripartum cardiomyopathy and postpartum cerebral angiopathy were initially considered as pregnancy-specific causes but subsequently reported outside of pregnancy. In a significant number of patients, the cause of the stroke remains undetermined, despite an extensive etiological workup. Whether hypercoagulable state and vessel wall changes associated with pregnancy may play a role in the occurrence of these otherwise unexplained ischemic strokes remains unknown. Too frequently, the stroke is considered at the first attempt as a complication of pregnancy and another underlying etiology may be missed. Therefore, evaluation of arterial ischemic stroke in pregnancy should proceed as in the non-pregnant state. There are no follow-up studies that consider the risk of recurrent stroke in future pregnancies. No data are available on the risk associated with use of oral contraception in a woman who had ischemic stroke during pregnancy. The frequency of cerebral venous thrombosis associated with pregnancy and the puerperium is not precisely known. Indeed, epidemiologic studies have been difficult to perform because cerebral venous thrombosis may have a misleading presentation and a definite diagnosis requires angiography, MRI or autopsy. The incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis has been estimated at 10 to 20 per 100000 deliveries in occidental countries, whereas rates of 200 to 500 per 100,000 deliveries have been reported in India. The pregnant and puerperal state accounts for 5 to 20% of all cerebral venous thrombosis in occidental countries; this proportion may reach 60% in developing countries. Labor and delivery are characteristically normal in occidental countries. The occurrence of cerebral venous thrombosis is clearly linked to the puerperial state, suggesting a direct role of the puerperial state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

CD011053,0,12768897,0,[Ultrasonography in acute pelvic pain].,"Acute pelvic pain may be the manifestation of various gynecologic and non-gynecologic disorders from less alarming rupture of the follicular cyst to life threatening conditions such as rupture of ectopic pregnancy or perforation of inflamed appendix. In order to construct an algorithm for differential diagnosis we divide acute pelvic pain into gynecologic and non-gynecologic etiology, which is than subdivided into gastrointestinal and urinary causes. Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency and should always be considered in differential diagnosis if appendix has not been removed. Apart of clinical examination and laboratory tests, an ultrasound examination is sensitive up to 90% and specific up to 95% if graded compression technique is used. Still it is user-depended and requires considerable experience in order to perform it reliably. Meckel's diverticulitis, acute terminal ileitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis and functional bowel disease are conditions that should be differentiated from other causes of low abdominal pain by clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging tests. Dilatation of renal pelvis and ureter are typical signs of obstructive uropathy and may be efficiently detected by ultrasound. Additional thinning of renal parenchyma suggests long-term obstructive uropathy. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, salpingitis and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts are three most commonly diagnosed gynecologic conditions presenting as an acute abdomen. Degenerating leiomyomas and adnexal torsion occur less frequently. For better systematization, gynecologic causes of acute pelvic pain could be divided into conditions with negative pregnancy test and conditions with positive pregnancy test. Pelvic inflammatory disease may be ultrasonically presented with numerous signs such as thickening of the tubal wall, incomplete septa within the dilated tube, demonstration of hyperechoic mural nodules, free fluid in the ""cul-de-sac"" etc. Color Doppler ultrasound contributes to more accurate diagnosis of this entity since it enables differentiation between acute and chronic stages based on analysis of the vascular resistance. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts may be presented by variety of ultrasound findings since intracystic echoes depend upon the quality and quantity of the blood clots. Color Doppler investigation demonstrates moderate to low vascular resistance typical of luteal flow. Leiomyomas undergoing degenerative changes are another cause of acute pelvic pain commonly present in patients of reproductive age. Color flow detects regularly separated vessels at the periphery of the leiomyoma, which exhibit moderate vascular resistance. Although the classic symptom of endometriosis is chronic pelvic pain, in some patients acute pelvic pain does occur. Most of these patients demonstrate an endometrioma or ""chocolate"" cyst containing diffuse carpet-like echoes. Sometimes, solid components may indicate even ovarian malignancy, but if color Doppler ultrasound is applied it is less likely to obtain false positive results. One should be aware that pericystic and/or hillar type of ovarian endometrioma vascularization facilitate correct recognition of this entity. Pelvic congestion syndrome is another condition that can cause an attack of acute pelvic pain. It is usually consequence of dilatation of venous plexuses, arteries or both systems. By switching color Doppler gynecologist can differentiate pelvic congestion syndrome from multilocular cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease or adenomyosis. Ovarian vein thrombosis is a potentially fatal disorder occurring most often in the early postpartal period. Hypercoagulability, infection and stasis are main etiologic factors, and transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound is an excellent diagnostic tool to diagnose it. Acute pelvic pain may occur even in normal intrauterine pregnancy. This may be explained by hormonal changes, rapid growth of the uterus and increased blood flow. Ultrasound is mandatory for distinguishing normal intrauterine pregnancy from threatened or spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy and other complications that may occur in patients with positive pregnancy test. Incomplete abortion is visualized as thickened and irregular endometrial echo with certain amount of intracavitary fluid. If applied, color Doppler ultrasound reveals low vascular resistance signals in richly perfused intracavitary area. Transvaginal sonography has high sensitivity and specificity in visualization of uterine and adnexal signs of ectopic pregnancy. Color Doppler examination may aid in detection of the peritrophoblastic flow. Furthermore, it facilitates detection of ectopic living embryo, tubal ring or unspecific adnexal tumor. Corpus luteum cysts and leiomyomas are another cause of pelvic pain during pregnancy, which can be correctly diagnosed by ultrasound. Detection of uterine dehiscence and rupture in patients with history of prior surgical intervention on uterine wall relies exclusively on correct ultrasound diagnosis. In patients with placental abruption sonographer detects hypoechoic complex representing either retroplacental hematoma, subchorionic hematoma or subamniotic hemorrhage. In closing, ultrasound has already become important and easily available tool which can efficiently recognize patients with possibly threatening conditions of different origins."

Nearly half of all maternal mortality can be attributed to thromboembolic disease. Recurrent embolism from venous thrombosis in pregnancy constitutes a major diagnostic and management problem. Treatment of deep venous thrombosis by anticoagulation alone may not be sufficient to prevent fatal pulmonary embolism. Because pulmonary embolism is a potential preventable and treatable condition, early and accurate diagnosis and treatment are mandatory. Prevention can be obtained by the implantation of clips, umbrellas or vena cava filters. There are only a few reports of the use of permanent inferior vena cava filters in the prevention of pulmonary embolisation in pregnancy mostly using the Greenfield-Filter. We present the indication and efficacy of a new retrievable vena-cava filter (FCP 2002) inserted through the internal jugular veins in pregnancy in two patients, which enables them to continue pregnancy, resulting in a vaginal delivery of healthy infants near term. The safety and effectiveness of this filter-system suggests that the indication for its use might be liberalized to include prophylactic insertion of this device in patients at risk known for thromboembolic disorders."

Accurate diagnosis is important but, even though CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the recommended imaging modality for PE in the general population, there is limited guidance for pregnant patients. Knowledge of the radiation doses to both the mother and the fetus is therefore important in the justification of CTPA in this situation. Dose measurements were made on three helical CT scanners, with an anthropomorphic phantom representing the chest and abdomen in late gestation. Estimated fetal doses from CT scans of the maternal chest were in the range of 60-230 microGy. Fetal dose reduction strategies (mA modulation, shielding with a lead coat, and a 5 cm shorter scan length) were investigated. These reduced the fetal dose by 10%, 35% and 56%, respectively. Fetal doses from a scan projection radiograph (SPR) of the maternal chest were insignificant when compared with the dose from a CT scan. However, if the SPR was not stopped before the ""fetus"" was directly irradiated, the dose measured on one scanner was 20 microGy."
CD011053,0,11566964,0,Pathophysiology of hypertension during preeclampsia linking placental ischemia with endothelial dysfunction.,"Studies over the past decade have provided a better understanding of the potential mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The initiating event in preeclampsia has been postulated to be reduced uteroplacental perfusion as a result of abnormal cytotrophoblast invasion of spiral arterioles. Placental ischemia is thought to lead to widespread activation/dysfunction of the maternal vascular endothelium that results in enhanced formation of endothelin and thromboxane, increased vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II, and decreased formation of vasodilators such as NO and prostacyclin. These endothelial abnormalities, in turn, cause hypertension by impairing renal-pressure natriuresis and increasing total peripheral resistance. The quantitative importance of the various endothelial and humoral factors in mediating the reduction in renal hemodynamic and excretory function and elevation in arterial pressure during preeclampsia are still unclear. Results from ongoing basic and clinical studies, however, should provide new and important information regarding the physiological mechanisms responsible for the elevation in arterial pressure in women with preeclampsia."

A case-control study was performed using a logistic regression model. Adverse outcome was defined as neonatal death before hospital discharge or a diagnosis of cerebral palsy in surviving neonates. Stillbirth (group 1) occurred in eight of 50 cases of abruptio placentae (16%). Adverse outcome was seen in 11 survivors (11 of 42; 26.2%). The obstetrical disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score in group 1 (11.8 +/- 7.1) was higher than that in the adverse (5.7 +/- 1.3) and satisfactory (5.3 +/- 2.4) outcome groups. A low Apgar score (< 7) at 5 minutes (odds ratio, 19.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 197.8) was associated with increased risk of adverse outcome in the logistic regression model.

Full-term placentas from uncomplicated pregnancies were studied within 30 min of delivery. The umbilical artery and vein to a single placental cotyledon were cannulated and the artery perfused with RPMI media (0.82 ml/min). Endothelin 1 caused a sustained dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure. Infused endothelin 1 (50 nM) stimulated thromboxane release 2.3-fold compared with basal values. Thromboxane release persisted for 15 min after discontinuation of endothelin. Properties of human placental endothelin 1 receptors were defined in binding studies performed on a crude membrane fraction of placental cotyledons. Binding was saturable, reached steady state by 3 h at 25 degrees C, and was linear with protein concentration. Scatchard analysis of binding data indicated a single class of high-affinity binding sites with a Kd of 36.1 +/- 9.7 pM and a density of 185.4 +/- 9.6 fmol/mg protein (n = 5). The potency order for competitive inhibition of the binding of 125I-labeled endothelin 1 was endothelin 1 greater than endothelin 2 = endothelin 3 = sarafotoxin S6b greater than big endothelin (human) = big endothelin (porcine). Phenylephrine, bradykinin, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic factor, diltiazem, U46619, and angiotensin II did not displace 125I-endothelin 1 from its receptors. These experiments demonstrate that endothelin 1 is a potent pressor substance in the human fetoplacental cotyledon. Pressor effects of endothelin may be mediated by a combination of direct effects and stimulation of vasoconstrictor prostanoids."

A thorough clinical evaluation, along with a work-up including an echocardiogram and a magnetic resonance imaging revealed the diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly malformation with tricuspid stenosis. A right ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to thrombus formation was thought to exacerbate her symptoms and lead to the diagnosis. Surgery in the form of right ventricular thrombectomy, right atrial reduction, porcine tricuspid valve replacement and bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis ""bidirectional Glenn"", was successfully performed. The patient has been stable clinically more than one year after surgery. Discussion about this rare condition and operative details are provided."

Eighty-one patients (61%) had objective evidence (ascending venography), while in 39% the diagnosis was based on clinical findings only. The overall annual incidence rate for definite DVT was 11 per 100,000 person years; there was a steep increase with age in both sexes. Proximal DVT was present in 69% of patients. Swelling (92%), pain on palpation (89%) and tenderness (87%) were the most frequent symptoms, while immobilization (43%) and varicosities (42%) were the most frequent risk factors; DVT was rare during pregnancy (1 in 15,000 deliveries). Seventeen patients (21%) developed pulmonary embolism and five patients (6.2%) died during the hospital stay (four of fatal pulmonary embolism, one due to toxic epidermolysis after venography). We conclude, that symptomatic DVT of the lower extremities has a low incidence in this black Caribbean population, but is nonetheless associated with considerable morbidity and mortality due to pulmonary embolism."

After treatment with magnesium sulfate and qingxintong there was a marked improvement in placental blood flow. TAV and Q of uterine and umbilical arteries was also increased (P < 0.05). In PIH cases the E3 and hPL levels were much lower, while the ratio of TXB2/6-KP was significantly higher than that in normal pregnancy.

PE transgenic rats and non-PE reversely mated (RM) transgenic rats were compared to normal SD rats (C). Sections were stained to visualize trophoblast, fibrinoid, vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and endothelium. SA were evaluated in three depth levels in the mesometrial triangle (MT) using the KS-400 image analysis system. In separate transgenic rats, Doppler ultrasound was performed in uterine arteries, and the resistance indices (RI) were calculated. Although for the whole MT differences in ET invasion were no longer significant between the PE and C, indicating a partial catching up in C rats, there was still significantly more ET in the deepest level in the PE group as compared to the C and RM groups. At the same time the SA walls in PE rats contained significantly more fibrinoid (versus RM and C) and VSM (versus C). In all SA cross-sections, re-endothelialisation was prominent, but significantly different between PE and C group. The Doppler results showed a significantly lower RI in the arcuate uterine artery of the PE group compared to the C group. There was no evidence of elimination of deeply invaded ET at term, previously considered as a possible mechanism for restriction of vascular remodelling in human PE. The differences in vascular remodelling, previously described on day 18 by histology and Doppler data, were maintained on day 21, but there was extensive endothelial repair in the three groups. Atherosis-like lesions were observed in the three groups, most frequently in the RM group, but were never associated with placental infarcts."

The artery to a single placental cotyledon was perfused with RPMI medium (0.764 ml/min). Bradykinin caused a dose-related increase in vascular resistance. Because bradykinin is generally a vasodilator, we investigated the possibility that bradykinin-induced vasoconstriction was due to interactions with other pressor systems. Bradykinin and 9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2 alpha (a stable thromboxane agonist) caused a dose-related increase in perfusion pressure. The bradykinin response was not mediated by angiotensin II, because bradykinin-induced vasoconstriction was not inhibited by saralasin, a competitive angiotensin antagonist. Bradykinin increased thromboxane B2 production by 62.0%. Prostaglandin E2 levels were increased by 86.7%, but prostaglandin E2 did not affect fetoplacental vascular resistance. Angiotensin II did not stimulate thromboxane B2 production and caused only a slight increase in prostaglandin E2. Indomethacin decreased the pressor response to angiotensin II. SQ29548, a specific thromboxane antagonist, caused a 61.6% inhibition of the bradykinin pressor response but did not change angiotensin II responsiveness. The data demonstrate that thromboxane is an important mediator of bradykinin-induced vasoconstriction in the isolated perfused human placenta."

Seventy-five percent of the ewes (12 of 16) developed clinical signs of ovine pregnancy-induced hypertension, including maternal hypertension and fetal depression. In three untreated hypertensive ewes, pregnancy was terminated by spontaneous premature delivery, and one maternal death occurred after an eclamptic seizure. All nine ewes treated with one of the two thromboxane synthetase inhibitors responded to therapy with decreases in blood pressure and resolution of fetal depression. These nine ewes completed gestation, and were delivered at term. These data indicate that therapy with thromboxane synthetase inhibitors in this animal model of preeclampsia results in profoundly beneficial effects and suggest that further studies of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors are warranted in preeclampsia."

HELLP syndrome usually resolves with delivery of the fetus without sequelae and is often managed successfully with conservative care. To our knowledge, there has been no prior report of an association between HELLP syndrome and elevated titers of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). We describe 2 patients who each presented with HELLP syndrome that was refractory despite delivery of the fetus, corticosteroids, and anticoagulation. Both patients had elevated levels of anticardiolipin antibodies. Examination of skin and placental pathology revealed diffuse deposition of fibrin with small vessel thrombi, without evidence of vasculitis. Coincident with plasmapheresis, HELLP resolved in both patients. We conclude that there may be an association between the presence of aPL and a protracted HELLP syndrome in pregnancy; this may be a new manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a robust diagnostic test in non-pregnant patients with suspected PE. The potential latent carcinogenic effects of CTPA-related breast irradiation mandates careful use of this technique in young women. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of perfusion scintigraphy as the first line investigation in pregnant women with suspected PE. All pregnant women referred for radiological investigation of suspected PE in a 5-year period from January 2001 to December 2005 were included. Demographic data and imaging studies were reviewed. Subsequent pregnancy outcome was determined by case note review. One hundred and five consecutive patients had either perfusion scintigraphy (Q scan) (n = 94), CTPA (n = 9) or both (n = 2), one patient presented twice. Q scans were the first line investigation in 96 (91%) patients. Eighty-nine (92%) scans were normal, seven (7%) were non-diagnostic and one (1%) was high probability. One patient had a thromboembolic event 3 weeks post partum. No adverse events were reported during the follow-up period. Pulmonary embolic disease is uncommon in pregnancy. Perfusion scintigraphy in pregnant patients has an excellent diagnostic yield. The percentage of non-diagnostic scans is much lower than in other patient groups.

CD011053,0,20922353,0,[Management of complex thrombocytopenia with thrombelastometry : a case of simultaneous posttransfusion purpura and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia].,"The case presented describes the combined onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia II (HIT) and post-transfusion purpura (PTP) 5-10 days following exposure to heparin and blood transfusion during aortic dissection repair. On day 4 the platelet count decreased by 40% and D-dimers started to increase again. Despite a low clinical probability for HIT-II at this time (4T score of 3) serological testing was done the next day and yielded a negative test result. Following a transient rise after platelet transfusion another 40% decrease in platelet count occurred on day 8. To increase precision of the 4T score, screening ultrasonography was performed and identified a clinically unapparent jugular vein thrombosis. As this increased the 4T score to 6 points, serological testing was repeated and now showed the presence of HIT-II antibodies. Despite switching from heparin to argatroban the platelet count continued to decrease to <5√ó10(3)/¬µl. Conventional clotting tests showed a prolonged prothrombin time and severe hypofibrinogenemia. Because of the female sex, age >50 years, history of pregnancy and transfusion 8 days before, PTP was suspected. The alteration of the plasmatic coagulation, however, could not be explained by PTP. Therefore, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and interference of argatroban with conventional clotting tests were considered as alternative diagnoses. In order to differentiate between the two alternatives rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM¬Æ) was performed and revealed an increased functional fibrinogen level without signs of hyperfibrinolysis. This argued for an interference of argatroban with the Clauss method of fibrinogen measurement and rendered DIC unlikely. Under suspicion of PTP, treatment with immunoglobulin was initiated and blood transfusions were avoided. Detection of PTP antibodies 1 day later confirmed the combined presence of PTP and HIT-II. As hyperfibrinogenemia compensated for the effects of thrombocytopenia on clot firmness in ROTEM¬Æ, anticoagulation with lepirudin was started at 9√ó10(3) platelets/¬µl only. The next day the platelet count increased to 32√ó10(3)/¬µl and clot firmness returned to normal. No thromboembolic complications and no relevant bleeding were observed. In summary, this case shows for the first time that HIT-II and PTP can occur in parallel in patients with simultaneous exposure to heparin and blood transfusions. Confounding effects of argatroban on conventional clotting tests may mimic DIC under these circumstances and make diagnosis difficult. Careful evaluation of the time-related magnitude in platelet decrease, patient history, course of D-dimers, screening ultrasonography and ROTEM¬Æ seem to be helpful to initiate early appropriate therapy before serological test results become available. In contrast to the Clauss method of fibrinogen measurement, assessment of clot firmness in ROTEM¬Æ is not influenced by argatroban. Moreover, ROTEM¬Æ reveals the compensatory effects of increased functional fibrinogen on clot firmness during severe thrombocytopenia as an important variable for anticoagulation therapy during thrombocytopenia with increased thromboembolic risk."

It has been shown that reduced glomerular diphosphatase (ADPase) activity in the rat kidney greatly increases the intraglomerular thrombotic tendency. We now studied experimental intraglomerular thrombosis ex vivo in association with glomerular ADPase activity in pregnant and nonpregnant control rats after infusion of either endotoxin or saline solution. Each animal (Wistar rat) was equipped with a permanent vena jugularis catheter and received either endotoxin (1.0 micrograms/kg body weight) (n = 6) or saline solution (n = 5) 7 days before being killed; nonpregnant rats were also treated with endotoxin (n = 5) or saline solution (n = 4). On day 21, before the animals were to be killed, they were anesthetized and their left kidneys were perfused with adenosine diphosphate solution (10 micrograms/ml) and platelet-rich plasma (1 x 10(9) cells/ml). Perfused kidneys were processed for light microscopy, electron microscopy, enzyme cytochemistry at the ultrastructural level, and immunohistology. The results showed decreased ADPase activity exclusively in the glomerular basement membrane of kidneys of pregnant rats treated with endotoxin in contrast to the findings in control rats. In addition, exclusively in the group of endotoxin-treated pregnant rats, significantly increased intraglomerular platelet aggregation could be detected after alternate perfusion ex vivo. We suggest that, in the present model, enhanced susceptibility of glomerular ADPase for endotoxin is due to pregnancy-associated factors that have yet to be identified. This increased susceptibility may promote in situ formation of intraglomerular microthrombi."
CD011053,0,1951559,0,Transfer of aspirin across the perfused human placental cotyledon.,"Pregnancy-induced hypertension is associated with a reduction in prostacyclin synthesis that is relative to normotensive pregnancy, whereas thromboxane A2 synthesis is unchanged or increased. The net effect is a decreased prostacyclin/thromboxane ratio that may result in the reduced fetal-placental blood flow seen in pregnancy-induced hypertension because thromboxane is known to constrict this circulation. Low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which is used to treat pregnancy-induced hypertension, selectively inhibits thromboxane synthesis and therefore may alter fetal-placental blood flow. We have investigated the transfer of acetylsalicylic acid in the perfused human placental cotyledon and its effects on fetal-placental perfusion pressure. Human placental cotyledons were perfused with tissue culture medium 199 plus 5% polyvinylpyrrolidone that was gassed with 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide at flow rates of 10 ml/min (maternal) and 4 ml/min (fetal). Acetylsalicylic acid (10(-5) mol/L) was added to the maternal circuit, and cotyledons were perfused for 1 hour with aliquots taken from a closed fetal circuit every 5 minutes. Acetylsalicylic acid was assayed by spectrofluorometry at 306/412 nm. Our data indicate an initial rapid transfer of acetylsalicylic acid during the first 5 minutes into the fetal-placental circulation, the concentration then decreased to a steady state at 0.4 x 10(-5) mol/L. Resting perfusion pressure of both maternal and fetal circulation did not change after the addition of acetylsalicylic acid to maternal perfusate and transfer to the fetal circulation."
CD011053,0,11440539,0,Hypoxia attenuates PGE(2)but increases prostacyclin and thromboxane production in human term villous trophoblast.,"Prostanoids have been proposed to play a major role in the regulation of uteroplacental blood flow. We examined the effect of hypoxia on the production of prostaglandin E(2)(PGE(2)) thromboxane B(2)(TXB(2)), and prostacyclin (measured as 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)) by human term trophoblast cells and villous placental explants. Explants (n=8) and purified trophoblast cells (n=5) were incubated for 24-72 h under either normoxic (21 per cent O(2)) or hypoxic (2 per cent O(2)) conditions. In trophoblast monolayer cultures, hypoxia attentuated PGE(2)production rates to 52+/-9.4 per cent (mean+/-sem, P< 0.05) but recovered to control rates within 48 h. In villous explants, PGE(2)production was significantly decreased after 48 and 72 h of hypoxia versus the normoxic control, accompanied by increased production of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)to 173.9+/-26.7 per cent after 48 h. TXB(2)production was increased to 172.3+/-25.9 per cent and 653.2+/-135.7 per cent (P< 0.05) control after 48 and 72 h of hypoxia, respectively. These results were confirmed in villous explants (n=3) cultured in the presence of exogenous 10 microm arachidonic acid. Hypoxia had no significant effect on TXB(2)and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)in trophoblast cells. In summary, our findings suggest that hypoxia could be responsible for abnormal profiles of prostanoid production commonly observed in women with pre-eclampsia. These results indicate a putative link between hypoxia and compromised placental perfusion."
CD011053,0,681960,0,Intracranial venous thrombosis in the first trimester of pregnancy.,We describe a fatal case of intracranial venous thrombosis occurring in early pregnancy. Such thrombosis usually occurs in late pregnancy or the puerperium but rarely during the first trimester of pregnancy. Computerized axial tomography suggested massive cerebral venous infarction. Necropsy findings showed not only cerebral venous thrombosis but also extensive pelvic and iliac vein thromboses. The relationship of cerebral venous thrombosis and pregnancy is discussed and the literature reviewed.
CD011053,0,17206425,0,Imaging of Budd-Chiari syndrome.,"Budd-Chiari syndrome occurs when venous outflow from the liver is obstructed. The obstruction may occur at any point from the hepatic venules to the left atrium. The syndrome most often occurs in patients with underlying thrombotic disorders such as polycythemia rubra vera, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and pregnancy. It may also occur secondary to a variety of tumours, chronic inflammatory diseases and infections. Imaging plays an important role both in establishing the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome as well as evaluating for underlying causes and complications such as portal hypertension. In this review article, we discuss the role of modern imaging in the evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome."
CD011053,0,2656056,0,Abdominal mass lesions in the newborn: diagnosis and treatment.,"Most neonatal abdominal masses will be due to benign retroperitoneal lesions such as hydronephrosis and multicystic dysplastic kidney. Although history and physical examination, plain radiographs and ultrasonography will confirm most diagnoses, severe unilateral hydronephrosis, hemorrhagic neuroblastoma, and intraperitoneal cysts may provide diagnostic difficulties. Masses identified by prenatal ultrasound need careful evaluation as they may represent normal structures, nonsignificant variants, or physiologically significant anomalies. Many lesions will require operative intervention, which can be safely performed in small infants by trained personnel at facilities with appropriate support services. Genuine controversy exists in the management of some of these lesions including MDK, renal vein thrombosis, and acalculous cholecystitis."

CD011053,0,22977032,0,Multidetector CT features of mesenteric vein thrombosis.,"Mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) accounts for 5%-15% of all mesenteric ischemic events and is classified as either primary or secondary. Primary MVT is idiopathic, whereas secondary MVT can result from a variety of underlying diseases and risk factors, including primary hypercoagulable states or prothrombotic disorders, myeloproliferative neoplasms, cancer (most frequently of the pancreas or liver), diverse inflammatory conditions, recent surgery, portal hypertension, and miscellaneous causes such as oral contraceptives or pregnancy. Clinical symptoms of MVT are rather nonspecific and are mainly characterized by abdominal pain. The mortality rate for MVT remains high, since even now the diagnosis is often delayed. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) is the modality of choice in this context. Although venous bowel ischemia occurs only infrequently with MVT, radiologists should be familiar with its multidetector CT features. Familiarity with the possible causes of MVT, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms associated with MVT, and the correlation between multidetector CT features and these pathogenic mechanisms is necessary to optimize medical management and improve patient care."

CD011053,0,8336287,0,Myasthenia gravis and pregnancy.,"Pregnancy is certainly an option open to patients with myasthenia gravis. Preconceptional counseling is the ideal, with the goal of discontinuing or reducing corticosteroid medications in patients requiring those agents. Alterations in physiology will require ongoing and careful assessment of the pregnant myasthenic or cholinergic crises. Antenatal testing for fetal well-being may be difficult to interpret. A small number of fetuses with fetal myasthenia gravis will be diagnosed by ultrasound. Attempts may be made to decrease the amount of circulating antibody crossing to the fetus. Interventions may include starting or increasing corticosteroid therapy, therapy with azathioprine, or plasmapheresis. Thymectomy is usually not performed during pregnancy. The intrapartum period will increase fatigue in the mother and may precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Epidural anesthesia is currently the agent of choice for decreasing pain and fatigue. An outlet forceps or vacuum delivery will shorten the second stage of labor in those patients who are unable to push repetitively. Cesarean delivery is preferably avoided in those patients at risk for pulmonary and thrombo-embolic complications. Narcotic and sedative medications may be used in the presence of careful and continuous assessment; they may increase respiratory and muscular symptoms. The postpartum period may be associated with an increase in exacerbations. Support services may help to eliminate or to reduce potent stressors during this time. Medication dosages may need to be adjusted as the mother's body returns to her prepregnant state. Transient, neonatal myasthenia is seen in up to 21% of maternal myasthenic cases, even in those patients with no detectable circulating antibody."
CD011053,0,21336530,0,A spontaneous intercostal artery hemorrhage in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease that can lead to damage to several vital organs. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), manifesting as vascular thromboembolic events and morbidities of pregnancy in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), has been described in patients with SLE. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS), in contradistinction to APS, is defined as three or more organs affected by thrombotic microangiopathy in patients demonstrating aPL and can result in mortality up to 50%. We describe a unique SLE patient who was diagnosed with recurrent APS presented with axillary venous thrombosis and subsequent superficial edema and compartment syndrome. The CAPS followed and revealed thromboses over liver, spleen, and acute pancreatitis. The spontaneous hemorrhage of left fourth intercostal artery (ICA) and left axillary artery occured at the same time without vasculitis or severe trauma. Though emergency transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the left fourth ICA was successfully accomplished by the radiologist. The repeated computed tomography angiogram of chest demonstrated remission of ruptured ICA. Nevertheless, the patient died of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and respiratory failure and shock. Both disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and CAPS share similar characteristics encompassing thrombotic microangiopathy, bleeding, thromboembolism, and multiple organ dysfunction. It is difficult to distinguish between them, especially in cases such as our uremic SLE patient with a calamitous disease progression. The emphasis of treatment for DIC is on platelet and fresh plasma transfusion, in contrast with anti-coagulant for CAPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing ICA hemorrhage in an SLE patient without vasculitis or aneurysm. The lupus flare initiated a pathological immunological cascade and resulted in the CAPS and the vascular damage."
CD011053,0,17581413,0,A fetal cyclooxygenase-2 gene polymorphism is associated with placental malperfusion.,"Prostaglandin levels vary during pregnancy, mostly under the control of the inducible enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The expression of COX-2 has been associated with ischemic events in the heart and brain, but its direct effect on human placental perfusion has not been previously examined. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a functional polymorphism in the COX-2 gene that controls enzyme expression levels is associated with placental histopathologic lesions. Maternal and neonatal DNA from twin gestations were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction-based assay for a single G to C nucleotide polymorphism at position -765 in the COX-2 gene promoter. Placental histopathology was evaluated in 6 major categories: meconium, malperfusion, inflammation, umbilical cord problems, villitis, and thrombosis. There was no significant association between placental histopathologic findings and polymorphisms of the COX-2 gene in the mother. In the fetus, carriage of the COX-2 C allele, which is correlated with decreased COX-2 gene expression, was negatively associated with lesions of placental ischemia/malperfusion (P = 0.02). Placental ischemic lesions were positively associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR; P < 0.001). No other group of histopathologic lesions was associated with fetal polymorphisms in the COX-2 gene or with IUGR. Thus, a fetal polymorphism in the COX-2 gene influences the occurrence of placental malperfusion and ischemia, which may be of sufficient severity to promote or allow the development of IUGR."
CD011053,0,16582539,0,The timing of neonatal brain damage.,"Although neonatal morbidity and mortality are less than in the past, the risk of pre-natal and neonatal brain damage has not been eliminated. In order to optimize pre-natal, perinatal and neonatal care, it is necessary to detect factors responsible for brain damage and obtain information about their timing. Knowledge of the timing of asphyxia, infections and circulatory abnormalities would enable obstetricians and neonatologists to improve prevention in pre-term and full-term neonates. Cardiotocography has been criticized as being too indirect a sign of fetal condition and as having various technical pitfalls, though its reliability seems to be improved by association with pulse oximetry, fetal blood pH and electrocardiography. Neuroimaging is particularly useful to determine the timing of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. Cranial ultrasound has been used to determine the type and evolution of brain damage. Magnetic resonance has also been used to detect antenatal, perinatal and neonatal abnormalities and timing on the basis of standardized assessment of brain maturation. Advances in the interpretation of neonatal electroencephalograms have also made this technique useful for determining the timing of brain lesions. Nucleated red blood cell count in cord blood has been recognized as an important indication of the timing of pre-natal hypoxia, and even abnormal lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts may be used to establish pre-natal asphyxia. Cord blood pH and base excess are well-known markers of fetal hypoxia, but are best combined with heart rate and blood pressure. Other markers of fetal and neonatal hypoxia useful for determining the timing of brain damage are assays of lactate and markers of oxidative stress in cord blood and neonatal blood. Cytokines in blood and amniotic fluid may indicate chorioamnionitis or post-natal infections. The determination of activin and protein S100 has also been proposed. Obstetricians and neonatologists can therefore now rely on various methods for monitoring the risk of brain damage in the antenatal and post-natal periods."

CD011053,0,10447021,0,Fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism.,"Fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism are usually produced by transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins. Most commonly, the thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins are a component of active maternal Graves' disease. However, such antibodies may continue to be produced after ablation of the thyroid by surgery, radioiodine, or by the immune mechanisms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Other mechanisms that have produced fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism include activating mutations of the stimulatory G protein in McCune-Albright syndrome and activating mutations of the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor. Fetal hyperthyroidism may be associated with intrauterine growth retardation, nonimmune fetal hydrops, craniosynostosis, and intrauterine death. Features of this condition in the neonate include hyperkinesis, diarrhea, poor weight gain, vomiting, ophthalmopathy, cardiac failure and arrhythmias, systemic and pulmonary hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, hyperviscosity syndrome, thrombocytopenia, and craniosynostosis. The time course of thyrotoxicosis depends on etiology. Remission by 20 weeks is most common in neonatal Graves' disease; remission by 48 weeks is nearly always seen. A subset of these patients may have persistent disease when there is a strong family history of Graves' diseases. Disease persistence is characteristic of patients with activating mutations of the TSH receptor. Treatment of fetal hyperthyroidism comprises administration of antithyroid drugs to the mother. Fetal heart rate and fetal growth should be monitored. Ultrasonography may reveal changes in thyroid size. At times, cordocentesis may be useful for monitoring fetal thyroid function. Hyperthyroid neonates may be treated with antithyroid drugs, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, iodine, or iodinated contrast agents, and at times, with glucocorticoids and digoxin. Nonremitting causes of neonatal hyperthyroidism require ablative treatments such as thyroidectomy."

The diagnosis was given when faced to a febrile syndrome and pains of the right flank and confirmed in both cases by an abdominal tomodensimetric examination. In both cases, an enlargement of the lower vena cava thrombosis was observed with a floating clot that reached the renal veins. Both patients underwent a surgery. The latter consisted in both cases in a thrombectomy of the lower vena cava as well as a ligature of the right ovarian vein. In both cases, the evolution was positive, thanks to a remote-control of the lower vena cava via tomodensimetry. This therapeutic procedure and other potential therapies were discussed."
CD011053,0,1415444,0,Recent advances in understanding clotting and evaluating patients with recurrent thrombosis.,"Significant advances have been made in defining the regulatory mechanisms that control blood clotting. These are reviewed, with special attention to the functions of the natural inhibitors antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S. Congenital deficiencies of these inhibitors as well as acquired abnormalities, such as defective fibrinolysis, and their role in promoting thrombosis are also discussed, as are thrombotic complications of pregnancy. Pregnancy decreases levels of protein S to 40% to 50% of normal levels. The decrease occurs early in pregnancy and persists into the postpartum period; it appears to be a hormonal rather than a dilutional effect. It is not known whether the thrombotic risk associated with pregnancy is increased in women who are congenitally deficient in protein S. Oral contraceptives decrease levels of protein S by about 20%. Women with a personal or family history of thrombosis should be evaluated for predisposing conditions before they start an oral contraceptive, as should women taking oral contraceptives who develop deep venous thrombosis."

The pathogenic mechanisms in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome that lead to in vivo injury are incompletely understood. Like other autoimmune diseases, a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman suffering from an antero-lateral non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. After few days, coronary angiography showed a severe occlusive arterial disease, involving anterior descending, circumflex e right coronary arteries. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with the implantation of a drug-eluting stent in the proximal segment of the anterior descending coronary artery. One day after discharge (10 days after the first hospitalization) the patient experienced dizziness, nausea, vomiting, swelling in absence of any electrocardiographic abnormalities or myocardial enzyme elevation; then she was hospitalized in the neurology department. Because of a similar episode, urgent cerebral computed tomography scan was performed 5 days later; it revealed two different acute ischemic areas, parietal in the right hemisphere and cerebellar in the left hemisphere.

CD011053,0,8822430,0,Laparoscopic oophoropexy for recurrent adnexal torsion.,"Torsion of the adnexa has traditionally been treated by adnexectomy because of the fear of emboli departing from thrombosed ovarian veins. Several recent reports have described successful conservative management with unwinding of the twisted adnexa. As the trend toward conservative management progresses, the incidence of recurrent adnexal torsion may increase. We present a case of a 33 year old gravida 3, para 2 Caucasian female who presented at 7 weeks gestation complaining of symptoms similar to those experienced during an episode of right ovarian torsion treated by laparoscopic unwinding 6 years earlier. Colour Doppler sonography revealed absent flow in the right adnexa. The twisted right adnexa containing the presumed corpus luteum of pregnancy was laparoscopically unwound. Using an extracorporeal suturing technique, a laparoscopic oophoropexy was performed to prevent any further rotatory movement. This appears to be the first reported case of laparoscopic oophoropexy for a recurrent ovarian torsion; we encourage the use of this simple, minimally invasive procedure in cases of recurrent adnexal torsion."

In normal term placentas, vasodilatory responses to human CRH (24-7000 pmol/L) were examined during submaximal vasoconstriction (100-120 mm Hg) of the fetal-placental vasculature induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha (0.7-2 mumol/L), KCl (50-100 mmol/L), or the thromboxane A2 mimetic, U46619 (0.05-0.5 mumol/L). Infusion of CRH caused a concentration-dependent vasodilatation that was similar in the presence of each constrictor agent (P > 0.05). The CRH antagonist, alpha-helical CRH-(9-41) (200 pmol/L), and a polyclonal CRH antiserum significantly inhibited CRH-induced vasodilatation during constriction with prostaglandin F2 alpha (P < 0.05). Vasodilatory responses to CRH were attenuated by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L-arginine (100 mumol/L; P < 0.05), and the guanylate cyclase inhibitor, LY 83583 (1 mumol/L; P < 0.05), but not by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (3 mumol/L; P > 0.05). In placentas of women with increased fetal vascular resistance, as demonstrated by Doppler ultrasound waveforms in vivo, CRH-induced vasodilatation was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). These results indicate that in the human fetal-placental circulation, CRH causes a vasodilatory response via a nitric oxide-/cGMP-dependent pathway. CRH may play a role in the control of vascular resistance to blood flow in the normal human placenta, and there may be a deficiency in the CRH signaling pathway of placentas with increased fetal vascular resistance."

CD011053,0,18211260,0,Circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin at 23-25 weeks of pregnancy in women with impaired placentation and in those with established fetal growth restriction.,"Adiponectin and leptin, two adipose-tissue-derived proteins, have been reported to be elevated in women with established PE (pre-eclampsia). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether alterations in adiponectin and leptin levels predate the development of PE and FGR (fetal growth restriction) in women at increased risk of these complications, as assessed by Doppler examination of the uterine arteries during the second trimester of pregnancy. We also sought to investigate the circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin in women with established severe early-onset FGR. The study included three groups of pregnant women at 23-25 weeks: Group A (n=44) with normal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, Group B (n=49) with abnormal Doppler waveforms and normal fetal growth at the time of the examination, and Group C (n=15) with established severe FGR and abnormal Doppler waveforms. All women had plasma adiponectin and leptin measured by sensitive immunoassays. In Group B, 19 women had a normal outcome, 17 delivered infants with FGR and 13 developed PE. The women who developed PE delivered smaller babies earlier than women with a normal outcome (P<0.001). There were no significant differences in adiponectin levels between any of the groups (overall P=0.3). Leptin concentrations, expressed as MoM (multiples of the median) of Group A, were higher in women in Group C, i.e. established severe FGR at 2.5 (1.2-2.7) MoMs (overall P<0.001), compared with all of the other groups and subgroups. In conclusion, we found that, in pregnancies complicated by severe early-onset FGR, the maternal plasma concentration of leptin is twice as high as in normal pregnancies. However, the second trimester levels of maternal plasma adiponectin and leptin in pregnancies that subsequently develop PE and/or FGR are not significantly different from normal and, consequently, it is unlikely that these markers will be useful as predictors of these pregnancy complications."

Using high frequency transducers (7. 0-10 MHz), we identified new features during the course of the disease. The apex of the renal papilla became hypo-echoic and there was a ring of reduced echogenicity around the affected pyramids 1-2 weeks after the acute phase. These features correlate with the known pathophysiological course of RVT, but have not been previously described using ultrasound. The features are illustrated and the mechanism is discussed."
CD011053,0,23383569,0,[Recommendations of Polish Gynecological Society concerning perinatal care in obese pregnant women].,"Maternal obesity (defined as prepregnancy maternal BMI> or = 30 kg/m2) is a risk factor strongly associated with serious perinatal complications and its prevalence has increased rapidly in a general population during the last decades. Therefore, following international approach to regulate perinatal care in this population, Group of Experts of Polish Gynecological Society developed these new guidelines concerning perinatal care in obese pregnant women, including women after bariatric surgery. The recommendations cover detailed information on specific needs and risks associated with obesity in women of reproductive age, pregnancy planning, antenatal care, screening, prophylaxis and treatment for other pregnancy complications characteristic for maternal obesity fetal surveillance, intrapartum care and post-partum follow-up. Pregnancy planning in these patients should involve dietary recommendations aiming at well balanced diet and daily caloric uptake below 2000 kcal and modest but regular physical activity with sessions every two days starting from 15 min and increased gradually to 40 min. Laboratory work-up should include tests recommended in general population plus fasting glycemia and oral glucose tolerance if necessary thyroid function, lipidprofile, blood pressure and ECG. Patients after bariatric surgery should allow at least one year before they conceive and have their diet fortified with iron, folic acid, calcium and vit. B12. Antenatal care should include monitoring body weight gain with a target increase in body weight less than 7 kg, thromboprophylaxis, strict monitoring of blood pressure and diagnostic for gestational diabetes in early pregnancy. Fetal ultrasonic scans should be arranged following protocols recommended by US section of Polish Gynaecological Society with additional scan assessing fetal growth performed within 7 days before delivery and aiming at assessing a risk for shoulder dystocia in a patient. Intrapartum care should be delivered in referral centers where fetal and maternal intrapartum complications can be addressed, preferably equipped with a proper medical equipment necessary to deal safely with extremely heavy individuals. Medical staff taking intrapartum care for obese parturient should be also aware of reduced reliability of methods used for intrapartum fetal surveillance, increased risk for intrapartum fetal death, maternal injuries, postpartum haemorrhage, shoulder dystocia, thrombophlebitis and infection. Pediatrician should be also available due to increased neonatal morbidity mainly due to meconium aspiration syndrome, hypoglycemia, and respiratory distress syndrome. In puerperium, medical staff should be prepared to deal with breastfeeding disturbances and increased maternal mortality."

CD011053,0,9873232,0,Prostaglandin E2 in human placenta: its vascular effects and activation of prostaglandin E2 formation by nicotine and cotinine.,"Tobacco smoking by pregnant women increases the frequency of spontaneous abortions and preterm births. Human labor is associated with enhanced intrauterine phospholipid metabolism and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which induces labor, initiates uterine contractions and maintains the homeostasis of placental blood flow. Therefore, we studied: (a) the influence of nicotine and cotinine on the effects of PGE2 on placental vasculature in perfused human placental cotyledon, and (b) the activation of placental phospholipase A2 (PLA2) by nicotine and cotinine using 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 2.2 nmol) as substrate. These studies revealed that: (1) increasing concentrations of PGE2 (10- 150 ng/ml) increased umbilical perfusion pressure by 170 +/- 10% (n = 6) of control (100%). Cotinine (2 microg/ml) enhanced this effect at all concentrations of PGE2. Nicotine (2 microg/ml) prevented the effect of PGE2; (2) both cotinine (EC50 470-500 fmol/l) and nicotine (EC50 18-32 pmol/l) activated PLA2 in human placental tissues. These observations indicated that cotinine was more potent than in nicotine activating PLA2 and potentiating the vasoconstrictive effects of PGE2 on fetal placental circulation. Nicotine activates nicotinic receptors and releases placental acetylcholine, a vasodilator of placental arteries. Acetylcholine stimulates muscarinic receptors of endothelial cells resulting in the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), and possibly nitric oxide. Therefore, nicotine prevents or abolishes the vasoconstrictive effects of PGE2 through the release of EDRF. Cotinine is inactive at nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. Therefore, accumulation of cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, in fetal circulation may contribute to production of PGE2 and induction of preterm labor and spontaneous abortions."
CD011053,0,7857435,0,Risk of thrombocytopenia in the infants of mothers with idiopathic thrombocytopenia.,"Twenty-nine of 27,662 pregnant women had autoimmune thrombocytopenia at the time of delivery at King Khalid University Hospital over 6 years starting June 1986. Twenty-six had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), gave birth to 33 infants, of which 22 were by spontaneous vaginal delivery, eight by lower segment cesarean section, and two by forceps. Fourteen (44%) of the 32 living infants had platelets less than 150 x 10(9)/L and four (12.5%) had severe thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 50 x 10(9)/L). The mothers' platelets of less than 50 x 10(9)/L at delivery were found to be predictive of thrombocytopenia in their infants (P < 0.027), compared with mothers' platelet of more than 50 x 10(9)/L. Maternal treatment with prednisone did not seem to have significant effect on infants' platelets (P < 0.89). All infants with severe thrombocytopenia (less than 50 x 10(9)/L) at birth had ultrasound done and were found to be normal. We conclude that: (1) steroid given to pregnant women with ITP does not increase infants' platelet counts, (2) severe thrombocytopenia in the mothers (platelet counts less than 50 x 10(9)/L) is highly predictive of thrombocytopenia in their infants; (3) cesarean section should be limited to the mother with severe thrombocytopenia if fetal scalp platelets are less than 50 x 10(9)/L."

Structural studies show that the regression of decidual endometrium to a endothelium-like lining is a hormone-dependent process such as stromagland dissociation. Mechanical factors due to expansion of the fetus certainly play no major role. Degenerative phenomena, such as focal necrosis, sclerosing edema, thrombosis, and inflammatory infiltrates probably appear more frequently in the accessory horn. They may be explained by more pronounced regional disturbances concerning perfusion and the inferior sealing of the uterine cavity."

On the basis of a review of the literature, three syndromes were individualized. First embolic arteries are infrequent and serious with an important morbidity; low doses of gonadotrophines is sufficient for causing this pathology. Second, thrombosis of the superior vena cava is late, during in vitro fertilization regimens with GnRH analogs complicated with serious hyperstimulation (degree III). Third, pregnancy is always present; pulmonary complications are very uncommon. Thrombosis of inferior vena cava is late, pregnancy is often present but women are frequently at risk of thromboembolic accident. Prevention of hyperstimulation is important. When present, HBPM is recommended for prevention of thromboembolism. Diagnostic of thrombosis is made with clinical examination and morphologic complementary exams such colour-vascular Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging.

A 27-year-old woman complained of chest pain on her first postpartum day. Symptoms were initially suggestive of pulmonary embolism, but within 3 h she developed severe acute abdominal pain, abdominal distension and haemodynamic instability. Ultrasound demonstrated a non-echogenic mass in the abdomen suggestive of a fluid collection and a computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of a lesion at the pancreatic tail. Urgent laparotomy revealed splenic vein rupture near the pancreatic tail. Partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. The patient subsequently made an uneventful recovery. Histological examination revealed a splenic vein aneurysm and chronic inflammatory changes in the pancreatic tissue. Rupture of a splenic vein aneurysm is a rare event and the diagnosis may present difficulty because its presentation is similar to several other more common conditions. However, rupture of a splenic vein aneurysm should be suspected in any pregnant woman with unexplained abdominal pain or with clear signs of haemorrhage, as delay in diagnosis can have devastating consequences."

CD011053,0,21239796,0,Duration of anticoagulation: applying the guidelines and beyond.,"Despite an improved understanding of the risk factors underlying venous thromboembolism (VTE), extensive clinical investigation, and detailed clinical guidelines, the decision to extend anticoagulation indefinitely for an individual patient with VTE is often problematic. Patients with VTE in association with major surgery, trauma, immobilization, or pregnancy are at relatively low risk of recurrence and generally do not require more than 3 to 6 months of anticoagulant therapy. For patients with a first unprovoked, or idiopathic, episode of VTE, an individualized approach should be taken in deciding on the duration of anticoagulation based on the patient's recurrence and bleeding risk, as well as their personal preference. Although the presence of genetic thrombophilic disorders (factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations; deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S) predispose patients to a first episode of VTE, there is inconsistent data on whether testing for these defects changes patient outcomes or should alter their management. In patients with a single unprovoked VTE, measurement of D-dimer several weeks following the completion of anticoagulant therapy appears useful in stratifying patients with a first unprovoked episode of VTE with regard to recurrence risk. Through a series of clinical vignettes, the utility of the laboratory in risk-stratifying patients with respect to recurrence risk will be discussed, along with decision making regarding the duration of anticoagulation.

Recent advances have identified newer markers for pregnancy hypertension: several potential candidate genes may explain the apparent family inheritance of preeclampsia, and some thrombophilic markers have been associated with the condition. Management options for mild to moderate hypertension include a short hospital stay to exclude ongoing severe hypertension and to ascertain fetal well-being. Outpatient care with appropriate maternal and fetal surveillance, including umbilical artery doppler velocimetry, is recommended for better perinatal outcomes. Acute care for severe hypertension includes the use of magnesium sulfate to prevent eclampsia and antihypertensive medication.

Q(UA) was lower in early-onset (‚â§34 wk) PE or GH than in NORM, but was normal in late-onset (>34 wk) illness. Left Q(UA) was consistently greater than right in NORM, but the pattern reversed in PE. Although Q(CI) and Q(EI) were higher in PE and GH than NORM, the fraction of Q(CI) distributed to the UA was reduced 2- to 3-fold. Women with early-onset PE delivered preterm, and 43% had stillborn small for gestational age (SGA) babies. Those with GH and late-onset PE delivered at term but had higher frequencies of SGA babies (GH=50%, PE=46% vs. NORM=15%, both P < 0.01). Birth weight was strongly associated with reduced Q(UA) (R(2) = 0.80, P < 0.01), as were disease severity and adverse fetal outcomes. We concluded that high end-arteriolar resistance, not smaller UA diameter, limited Q(UA) and restricted fetal growth in PE and GH. These are, to our knowledge, the first quantitative measurements of Q(UA) and pelvic blood flow in early- vs. late-onset PE in high-altitude residents."
CD011053,0,3992408,0,Deep-vein thrombosis in pregnancy. A case report.,"The incidence of thrombo-embolic complications in pregnancy varies between 2 and 5 per 1000 deliveries. Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is classically associated with pulmonary embolism and chronic venous insufficiency, which are leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. An accurate diagnosis of iliofemoral or calf vein thrombosis should be confirmed by either Doppler ultrasonography, impedance plethysmography or ascending phlebography. Full-dose continuous intravenous heparin for 5-10 days is the established method of therapy for acute DVT and pulmonary embolism occurring during pregnancy or in the puerperium. Thereafter, long-term treatment with self-administered subcutaneous injections of heparin in low doses is feasible and effective. During pregnancy, coumarin administration results in embryopathy as it readily crosses the placenta; it should be avoided until after delivery. In view of its safety and effectiveness, low-dosage intravenous heparin or heparin by subcutaneous injection seems to be the anticoagulant of choice for the expectant mother."

CD011053,0,3529790,0,Outcome of the surviving cotwin of a fetus papyraceus or of a dead fetus.,"Serial ultrasound examinations have demonstrated that one of two gestational sacs in a twin pregnancy may often disappear. When it disappears at an early stage of gestation, the pregnancy may advance without any disturbance and the cotwin can be delivered well developed and lively. When the intrauterine death occurs in the second trimester, the dead fetus usually results in a fetus papyraceus and the cotwin continues to be alive near term. However, when death occurs in the last trimester, the viable twin may be spontaneously delivered soon and be premature. In some cases of late fetal death, the dead fetus may induce intravascular thromboses in many organs of the surviving cotwin, so that the living infant may develop cerebral palsy later after birth."

CD011053,0,23488310,0,"[Definition, classification and diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency - part II].","Venous insufficiency can be defined as a fixed venous outflow disturbance of the limbs. It is caused by the malfunction of the venous system, that may or may not be associated with venous valvular insufficiency and may involve the superficial or deep venous system of the lower limbs, or both. The CEAP scale includes clinical, etiologic, anatomic and pathophysiologic aspects and has been used in the assessment of venous insufficiency Clinical classification comprises of 7 groups. It takes into account the appearance of the skin of the lower limbs, presence of edema, teleangiectasis and varicose ulcers. CLINICAL GRADING: Group C0 - no visible changes in the clinical examination; Group C1 - telangiectasis, reticular veins, redness of the skin around the ankles; Group C2 - varicose veins, Group C3 - the presence of edema without skin changes; Group C4 - lesions dependent of venous diseases (discoloration, blemishes, lipodermatosclerosis); C5 Group - skin changes described above with signs of healed venous ulcers; Group C6 - skin lesions such as in groups C1 to C4 plus active venous ulcers. ETIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION INCLUDES: Ec - congenital defects of the venous system, Ep - primary pathological changes of the venous system, without identification of their causes; Es - secondary causes of venous insufficiency of known etiology (post-thrombotic, post-traumatic, etc.). There are many methods of assessing the venous system. One of the most accurate methods is an ascending phlebography which is especially useful in determining detailed anatomy of the venous system, venous patency and identification of perforans veins. The second method may be a descending phlebography useful in determining the venous reflux and morphology of venous valves. Another radiological method is varicography in which the injection of the contrast medium directly into the veins is performed. It is especially useful in the ,,mapping"" of venous connections. Trans-uterine phlebography when contrast medium is injected into the bottom of the uterus and its flow is observed, is a very rare test. A similar method is used in a selective phlebography of the ovarian vein and internal iliac vein. This examination is performed when there is a suspicion of connections between varicose veins of the inferior extremities and the pelvis, in case of the occluded iliac and femoral veins. However these tests are highly invasive, causing a lot of discomfort and are connected with numerous complications, particularly the development of venous thromboembolism. An invasive study but not exposing to the emission of ionizing radiation, is a measurement of the marching pressure (known also as ambulatory venous pressure - AVP). Ultrasound Doppler is the ""gold standard"" in the diagnosis of venous system. Color Doppler technique is irreplaceable due to its non-invasiveness, availability constantly improving of the ultrasound machines and is the method of choice in pregnancy Unfortunately clinical correlation of Doppler ultrasound and thrombosis is bad. Invasive methods, which include various types of phlebographies, have been reserved only for cases of very high diagnostic doubt."
CD011053,0,15771357,0,[Diagnosis of suspected deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during pregnancy].,"Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is a frequent clinical problem during pregnancy and post-partum. Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains the most common cause of mortality during pregnancy and post-partum in western countries. In the majority of cases, DVT may be diagnosed by non-invasive tests such as clinical probability, D-dimer measurement and venous compression ultrasonography. In contrast, at least one irradiating invasive exam is necessary in suspected PE. The lung scan, the most validated diagnostic test for PE during pregnancy and fetal irradiation is quite low, in particular if only perfusion lung scan is used. Helical computed tomography (hCT) has widely replaced lung scan in the diagnostic approach of suspected pulmonary embolism. However, it has never been validated in pregnant women."
CD011053,0,21501137,0,How I manage venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.,"In pregnancy, the combination of altered coagulation factors, stasis and vascular damage heightens the thrombotic risk and venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. In women presenting with pregnancy-related VTE, the wellbeing of both mother and fetus must be considered, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach. The risk of VTE is present throughout the pregnancy and is maximal during the postpartum period. Diagnosis may be difficult because the symptoms might mimic those of pregnancy and prospectively validated diagnostic protocols are lacking. Compression ultrasound is the test of choice for deep vein thrombosis and perfusion scan and computerized tomography pulmonary angiography are the imaging options for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Low molecular weight heparin does not cross the placenta and is a safe and effective treatment for the majority of cases of pregnancy-related VTE. This review provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of VTE in pregnancy."

We report the case of a 27-year-old woman with placenta percreta with preemptive bilateral internal iliac artery balloons who had iliac artery thrombosis and acute limb ischemia develop 7 hours after cesarean hysterectomy. This is the first report of iliac artery thrombosis in this setting.

PATHOMORPHOLOGICAL EXAMPLES: include the modification in the morphology of hyaline membrane disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia as a consequence of modern neonatal therapy. Hemorrhagic and ischemic/ hypoxic lesions of the central nervous system may occur in age- and agent-related distributional patterns, with subependymal hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia representing the most important examples. The most common intestinal finding, namely, necrotizing enterocolitis, typically shows segmental alterations, the morphology of which largely depends on the dominating causative agent. Hepatic cholestasis and fatty change are mostly consequences of parenteral nutrition or hypoxic/ischemic stress. Hepatic necrosis can be associated with the latter, but may also indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation. Vascular pathomorphology is represented by thromboembolic lesions, in most instances corresponding to sequelae of neonatal management."

In experiment B, the effect of this dose of endotoxin on the thrombotic tendency of the glomeruli in pregnant (Pr) and pseudopregnant (PSP) rats was studied by means of ex vivo alternate perfusion of the kidneys with human platelets and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). In experiment A, cyclic (C), ovariectomized (OVX), Pr, and PSP rats were infused with endotoxin or saline. Three days later (for Pr and PSP rats, Day 8), animals were killed. In intact rats (C, Pr, PSP), the activity of glomerular ADPase was the same; however, the activity decreased after OVX. Endotoxin decreased the activity of glomerular ADPase in Pr rats only. In endotoxin-treated Pr rats, spontaneously formed platelet microaggregates were present in a few glomeruli; in glomeruli of the other groups, microaggregates were not observed. Platelet microaggregates were also present in the venous microvasculature of endotoxin-treated Pr rats and, to a lesser extent, in that of other groups, while saline-treated OVX rats were negative in this respect. In experiment B, Pr and PSP rats were treated as in experiment A; ex vivo kidney perfusion was performed on Day 8. Immediately after perfusion, rats were killed.

CD011053,0,12431472,0,Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Because unrecognized and untreated pulmonary embolism (PE) can result in maternal mortality, physician vigilance for this disease should remain high. The diagnosis of both PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the pregnant patient, as in the nonpregnant patient, requires the use of accurate objective imaging. However, unlike the nonpregnant population, there is a paucity of trials evaluating the safety and accuracy of objective testing for PE or DVT diagnosis in pregnant patients--likely because of concerns surrounding the use of ionizing radiation associated with diagnostic tests during pregnancy. Regardless of extrapolating results from studies in the nonpregnant population, the use of compression leg ultrasound and ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scanning during pregnancy is central to the diagnosis of DVT and PE, respectively. Data on the utility of structured clinical models or D-dimer testing for the diagnosis of DVT or PE during pregnancy is currently unavailable. Future research is urgently needed to validate the use of current approaches and perhaps define safer and more accurate strategies to reduce maternal morbidity from this disease."

Relevant articles in English published between 1966 and 2003 were retrieved by a Medline search and cross-referencing. The normal umbilical cord coiling index (UCI) is 0.17 (+/- 0.009) spirals completed per cm. Abnormal cord coiling, i.e. UCI <10th centile (<0.07) or >90th centile (>0.30) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Hypocoiling of the cord is associated with increased incidence of fetal demise, intrapartum fetal heart rate decelerations, operative delivery for fetal distress, anatomic-karyotypic abnormalities and chorio-amnionitis. Hypercoiling of the cord is associated with increased incidence of fetal growth restriction, intrapartum fetal heart rate decelerations, vascular thrombosis and cord stenosis. It is not clear whether abnormal coiling is actually a cause of pathology, or merely one of the sequelae, or both. We discuss the theories involving the cause of cord coiling, and the consequences of the degree of cord coiling on blood flow through the umbilical vessels.

The majority (86%) of these underwent objective diagnostic methods such as ascending venogram (AV) and color Doppler imaging (CDI) of the venous system for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Pulmonary scintigraphy was performed when available and echocardiography was included towards the end of the study. Fifty-nine patients with suspicion of pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism (PAVTE) were studied. The diagnosis was confirmed in 50 patients, who received anticoagulation therapy.

The risk of pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism is low and a resulting death rare. Proximal or whole-limb DVT occurs more frequently and there is a predilection for the left leg. The majority of events occur in the postpartum period. A hypercoagulable state probably exists and needs further evaluation."

After a 9-month period of longterm anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, she experienced recurrent DVT 2 weeks following discontinuation of anticoagulation. She was then maintained with warfarin for the following 6 years. Elevated antibodies to cardiolipin (IgG aCL) were first detected in 1988. In 1990, warfarin was switched to aspirin and low molecular weight heparin as she wished to become pregnant. At 24 weeks she developed eclampsia and labor was induced. During the first postpartum week she experienced loin pain, associated with rapidly rising creatinine levels and features of a nephrotic syndrome. An abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral renal vein thrombosis with enlarged kidneys. She was treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 4 months and her renal function is now recovering. Our patient is another example of the primary antiphospholipid syndrome."

CD011053,0,1446420,0,Alloimmune conditions and pregnancy.,"Transfer of fetal red blood cells and platelets to the maternal circulation can stimulate an immune response with production of immunoglobulin that can cross the placenta. Similarly, passage of maternal stem cells to an immunologically incompetent fetus can theoretically produce graft-versus-host disease. disease. Maternal sensitization to red blood cell antigens such as D and Kell can result in anaemia, hydrops, and death in an incompatible fetus. Current assessment of these pregnancies involves serial analysis of amniotic fluid bilirubin concentration, with umbilical cord blood sampling reserved for special circumstances; neither ultrasound or Doppler blood flow analysis are accurate in the prediction of fetal haematocrit. Intravascular transfusion is the treatment of choice for hydropic fetuses. Perinatal survival in non-hydropic fetuses is similar with either intravascular or intraperitoneal transfusion, and the choice of procedures is individualized. Isoimmune fetal thrombocytopenia is usually the result of maternal sensitization to the PlA1 antigen. There is significant risk of intracranial haemorrhage, both antepartum and during labour and delivery. Umbilical cord blood sampling at term can determine fetal platelet count and the need for platelet transfusion, and can aid in deciding the appropriate route of delivery."

CD011053,0,18598116,0,The role of antioxidant vitamins in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is an important and a leading cause of both maternal morbidity and adverse perinatal outcomes. Despite progress in perinatal medicine for patients with an established diagnosis of PE, a therapeutic approach other than termination of pregnancy was unsuccessful. Women predisposed to PE begin pregnancy with a certain degree of endothelial dysfunction, a lesion that precedes shallow placentation. The proposed sequence of events comprises endothelial dysfunction, defective trophoblast invasion, and consequential impaired placental perfusion, immune maladaptation and inflammation. The possible link between these could be oxidative stress by excessive production of reactive oxygen species coupled with inadequate or overwhelmed antioxidant defense mechanisms. These defense mechanisms, involving antioxidant vitamins and enzyme systems, may restrain the extent of damage caused by oxidative stress. Markers of oxidative stress in women with established PE were confirmed. Accordingly, these findings support an expected beneficial effect of antioxidant therapy in the prevention of PE and other pregnancy-related disorders. Numerous studies have been carried out in order to investigate this possible and simple prophylactic and/or therapeutic approach in prevention of oxidative stress and eventual reduction of PE and its perinatal complications. In this review the role of vitamin antioxidants in prevention and treatment of PE is discussed. Despite the logic behind using antioxidant vitamins, the data, thus far, are at best conflicting."

CD011053,0,23934129,0,Reversal of gene dysregulation in cultured cytotrophoblasts reveals possible causes of preeclampsia.,"During human pregnancy, a subset of placental cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) differentiates into cells that aggressively invade the uterus and its vasculature, anchoring the progeny and rerouting maternal blood to the placenta. In preeclampsia (PE), CTB invasion is limited, reducing placental perfusion and/or creating intermittent flow. This syndrome, affecting 4%-8% of pregnancies, entails maternal vascular alterations (e.g., high blood pressure, proteinuria, and edema) and, in some patients, fetal growth restriction. The only cure is removal of the faulty placenta, i.e., delivery. Previously, we showed that defective CTB differentiation contributes to the placental component of PE, but the causes were unknown. Here, we cultured CTBs isolated from PE and control placentas for 48 hours, enabling differentiation and invasion. In various severe forms of PE, transcriptomics revealed common aberrations in CTB gene expression immediately after isolation, including upregulation of SEMA3B, which resolved in culture. The addition of SEMA3B to normal CTBs inhibited invasion and recreated aspects of the PE phenotype. Additionally, SEMA3B downregulated VEGF signaling through the PI3K/AKT and GSK3 pathways, effects that were observed in PE CTBs. We propose that, in severe PE, the in vivo environment dysregulates CTB gene expression; the autocrine actions of the upregulated molecules (including SEMA3B) impair CTB differentiation, invasion and signaling; and patient-specific factors determine the signs."

This has now been confirmed by pharmacological in vitro techniques, particularly utilizing perfusion of the isolated umbilical cord and placental lobule. 4. The fetal umbilical-placental vessels are sensitive to a wide range of vasoconstrictor autacoids, some of which can cause intense vasospasm. 5. Thromboxane A2 receptors have been identified in both umbilical vein and placental villous vessels. 6. Prostacyclin and endothelial cell-derived relaxing factor (or nitric oxide) may be largely responsible for the low vascular resistance normally found in the fetal extracorporeal circulation. 7.

CD011053,0,23410520,0,Reduced cystathionine Œ≥-lyase and increased miR-21 expression are associated with increased vascular resistance in growth-restricted pregnancies: hydrogen sulfide as a placental vasodilator.,"Increased vascular impedance in the fetoplacental circulation is associated with fetal hypoxia and growth restriction. We sought to investigate the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating vasomotor tone in the fetoplacental vasculature. H2S is produced endogenously by catalytic activity of cystathionine Œ≤-synthase and cystathionine Œ≥-lyase (CSE). Immunohistochemical analysis localized CSE to smooth muscle cells encircling arteries in stem villi. Immunoreactivity was reduced in placentas from pregnancies with severe early-onset growth-restriction and preeclampsia displaying abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms compared with preeclamptic placentas with normal waveforms and controls. These findings were confirmed at the protein and mRNA levels. MicroRNA-21, which negatively regulates CSE expression, was increased in placentas with abnormal Doppler waveforms. Exposure of villus explants to hypoxia-reoxygenation significantly reduced CSE protein and mRNA and increased microRNA-21 expression. No changes were observed in cystathionine Œ≤-synthase expression, immunolocalized principally to the trophoblast, in pathologic placentas or in¬†vitro. Finally, perfusion of normal placentas with an H2S donor, after preconstriction with a thromboxane mimetic, resulted in dose-dependent vasorelaxation. Glibenclamide and N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester partially blocked the effect, indicating that H2S acts through ATP-sensitive K(+) channels and nitric oxide synthesis. These results demonstrate that H2S is a powerful vasodilator of the placental vasculature and that expression of CSE is reduced in placentas associated with¬†increased vascular resistance."

Increases in fetal arterial perfusion pressure (FAP) produced by endothelin-1 (ET-1, human), the thromboxane A2-mimetic U46619, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), angiotensin II (A II) and bradykinin (BK) were examined under conditions of high ( >or= 450 mmHg) and low <or= 50 mmHg) O2 tension. Similarly, decreases in pressure produced by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and arachidonic acid (AA) were examined. The effects of these autacoids on the fetoplacental vasculature during low oxygen perfusion was compared to that obtained following nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N omega-nitro-L-arginine, (L-NOARG, 100 microns). Increases in FAP caused by ET-1, U46619, and 5-HT on fetoplacental blood vessels were not altered significantly at low oxygen tension, although that in response to BK was enhanced. Increases in FAP caused by A II were unchanged at low oxygen tension. ATP-induced decreases in FAP were reduced whereas AA-mediated changes were unchanged. Both low oxygen tension and L-NOARG produced an elevation in basal perfusion pressure. Perfusion of the human placenta with Krebs' solution of low oxygen tension may compromise placental vascular function. Impaired placental oxygenation may contribute to the development and severity of vasoconstriction in the placenta associated with pre-eclampsia/pregnancy induced hypertension."

This study included placental tissue from nine women with PE, seven with uncomplicated pregnancies and five with bilateral uterine artery notching in Doppler velocimetry tracings. Human cDNA microarrays with 6500 transcripts/genes were used and the results verified with real-time PCR and in-situ hybridization. Multidimensional scaling method and random permutation technique demonstrated significant differences among the three groups examined. Within the 6.5K arrays, 6198 elements were unique cDNA clones representing 5952 unique UniGenes and 5695 unique LocusLinks. Multidimensional scaling plots showed 5000 genes that met our quality criteria; among these, 366 genes were significantly different in at least one comparison. Differences in three genes of interest were confirmed with real-time PCR and in-situ hybridization; acid phosphatase 5 was shown to be overexpressed in PE samples and calmodulin 2 and v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA) were downregulated in PE and uterine artery notch placentas.

This review includes published and textbook reports of in utero therapy for bladder obstruction, pleural effusion, and macrocystic adenomatoid malformation from 1985 through 2002. For fetuses affected by lower urinary tract obstruction, the key component is identifying those fetuses that have retained renal function and are most likely to benefit from in utero shunting. This good prognosis group has been shown to have improved survival rate and a lower incidence of renal failure. Complications of fetal loss are estimated at 5% owing to the shunt procedure, and the risk of shunt displacement varies from 30% to 50%. Hydrops secondary to primary PE has been shown to be associated with low fetal and neonatal survival at 21% to 23%. Treatment by thoracoamniotic shunting increases survival rate to 75%. The fetus with a macrocystic CCAM and secondary hydrops should be considered a candidate for thoracoamniotic shunt to decrease CCAM volume, reverse hydrops, and improve survival rate.

We present a 20-year-old woman suffering from secondary antiphospholipid syndrome with a unique combination of multifocal venous thromboses, pulmonary embolism, spontaneous abortion, and splenic infarction. Diversity of clinical symptoms and diagnostic imaging modalities are discussed with emphasis on cross-sectional imaging. The syndrome should be suspected in patients with thromboses and organ infarctions of otherwise undetermined etiology."
CD011053,0,3604367,0,[Dissecting aneurysm--a rare but severe complication of pregnancy].,"A case of aortic dissection at 37 weeks of gestation is presented with demonstration of angiographic and pathological findings. A review of clinical and pathological literature suggests, that rupture of aortic dissecting aneurysms occurs more frequently in women being pregnant than in non-pregnant women of the same age. Women with cardial malformations, coarctatio aortae, Marfan's syndrome and hypertension are at increased risk. Ultrasound scans of heart and thoracic aorta may lead to an early diagnosis in pregnancy. Intrauterine fetal asphyxia and death may be an early symptom due to partial obliteration of Aa. iliacae internae and ovaricae."
