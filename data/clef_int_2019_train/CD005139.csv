CD005139,0,22972355,0,[Inflammatory choroidal neovascularisations].,"Inflammation plays a key role in the induction of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV). This explains why each form of posterior uveitis may lead to CNV formation. Diseases like presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), multifocal choroiditis (MFC) or punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) carry a high risk of CNV creation. Inflammatory processes mostly cause classical membranes. Because of the classical membrane form, smaller membrane size and the younger age of the patients' inflammatory membranes are often better treatable than membranes in AMD patients. In the times before VEGF inhibition inflammatory membranes were treated with argon laser coagulation and later with PDT. Nowadays better visual acuity results are achievable through VEGF inhibitor injections with or without PDT. This is proven by a few publications with greater numbers of patients because of the rarity of the diseases and several case reports in the literature. In addition to CNV treatment the control of intraocular inflammation should never be forgotten because it forms the leading CNV trigger."
CD005139,0,17644433,0,Anti-angiogenic therapy of exudative age-related macular degeneration: current progress and emerging concepts.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in elderly patients. The more aggressive exudative form is characterized by abnormal blood-vessel development that occurs beneath the retina as a result of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has emerged as the key mediator of CNV formation; this has led to intensive research on VEGF and the recent approval of anti-VEGF compounds by the US Food and Drug Administration. Despite this successful introduction of anti-angiogenic therapies into the clinical setting, there is still a lack of treatments that definitively reverse damaged vision. Here, we consider the importance of putative molecular targets other than VEGF that might have been underestimated. Emerging cellular mechanisms offer additional opportunities for innovative therapeutic approaches."

CD005139,0,22581206,0,Corticosteroid use for diabetic macular edema: old fad or new trend?,"Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working age individuals in developed countries. Most cases of diabetes related vision loss result from breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier with resultant diabetic macular edema (DME). For over 30 years, laser photocoagulation has been the standard therapy for DME, but most eyes do not experience significant improvements in visual acuity. Intravitreal injections of drugs that inhibit the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) lead to gains in vision, but can be expensive and need to be repeated frequently. In addition to VEGF-mediated breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, recent evidence suggests that inflammation plays an important role in the development of DME. Recognizing this, physicians have injected steroids into the vitreous and developers have created sustained release implants. Intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide lead to rapid resolution of macular edema and significant short-term improvements in visual acuity, but unfortunately, visual acuities diminish when treatment is continued through 2 years. However, intravitreal triamcinolone remains an attractive treatment option for eyes that are pseudophakic, scheduled to undergo cataract surgery, resistant to laser photocoagulation, or require urgent panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative retinopathy. In controlled trials, intraocular implants that slowly release dexamethasone and fluocinolone show promise in reducing macular edema and improving visual acuity. The high incidences of drug related cataracts and glaucoma, however, require that corticosteroids be used cautiously and that patients be selected carefully. The increasing number of patients with DME, the burgeoning cost of medical care and the continuing development of intravitreal steroids suggest that the use of these agents will likely increase in coming years."

CD005139,0,28427072,0,Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Injections: The New Standard of Care in Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy?,"For decades, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) has been the standard of care for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The relatively recent advent of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) formulations for intravitreal injection has provided a fresh perspective on PDR treatment, especially in eyes with concurrent diabetic macular edema (DME). The anti-VEGF agent ranibizumab has demonstrated a potentially protective effect on eyes with DME in terms of progression to PDR in the RIDE/RISE trials, as has aflibercept in the VIVID/VISTA trials. In 2015, these 2 agents were approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PDR with DME, though PRP still remains the standard of care for eyes without baseline DME. Published results from Protocol S illustrate the non-inferiority of ranibizumab versus PRP in the treatment of PDR, the first prospective study to do so in eyes with and without baseline DME. These results also reveal that treatment with ranibizumab, when compared to standard treatment with PRP, may also lead to less peripheral visual field loss, reduced need for vitrectomy, and reduced chance for developing DME. Both PRP and intravitreal ranibizumab have very low rates of adverse events. However, treatment with anti-VEGF agents generally is associated with higher costs, increased need for follow-up, and the risk of potentially catastrophic ocular complications (e.g., endophthalmitis) and systemic side effects. Anti-VEGF agents should be considered in cases of media opacity preventing completion of PRP in compliant patients without recent cerebrovascular accident or myocardial infarction, though the long-term efficacy of these agents remains to be studied, especially after the discontinuation of injections."

Among 29 patients with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME), of whom 14 (48%) patients did not have any previous treatments and 22 (76%) any previous antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections, significant visual acuity (VA) improvement was observed with a mean gain of 13.8 letters at month 6 (p < 0.0001), 12.7 letters at month 12 (p = 0.0032) and 16.5 letters at month 18 (p = 0.0313). During the follow-up, a total of 17 (59%) patients had a VA improvement of ≥15 letters. Significant central macular thickness decrease was observed with a mean reduction of 159.07 μm at month 6 (p < 0.0001), 181.8 μm at month 12 (p < 0.0001) and 236.17 μm at month 18 (p = 0.0313). No serious adverse events were reported. With a good efficacy and safety, manageable adverse events and an injection rate much lower compared to that of anti-VEGF, this study confirms the use of Ozurdex® for the treatment of persistent DME."

Twenty-four hour, nighttime, and daytime ABMP values for systolic and diastolic BP were recorded in study groups before and after the third intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or bevacizumab.ResultsRanibizumab injection had no impact on ABPM recordings and dipping status. In the bevacizumab group, increased daytime (129.0(6.6) vs 127.7(6.6) mm Hg, P=0.002) and nighttime systolic (116.9(7.5) vs 112.6(7.1) mmHg, p<0.001) BP and decreased daytime diastolic (80.1(6.5) vs 82.4(6.1)mm Hg, P=0.001) BP were noted in the post-injection period. Also, percentage of non-dippers was significantly increased from 5.3% at pre-injection to 28.9% (P=0.004) at the post-injection period.ConclusionIn conclusion, given that it has no significant impact on ABPM recordings and dipping status, in our study, intravitreal ranibizumab injection may be the better choice in the management of AMD."

However, studies of its effect on retinal neovascularization are limited so far. In the present study, we established a vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) secretion model of human acute retinal pigment epithelial-19 (ARPE-19) cells by exposure of 150 μM CoCl₂ to the cells and determined the VEGFA concentrations, the mRNA expressions of VEGFA, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) &amp; prolyl hydroxylases 2 (PHD-2), and the protein expressions of HIF-1α and PHD-2 after treatment of 3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1, 1.0 μg/mL) or SPN (0.2, 1.0 and 5.0 μg/mL). Furthermore, rat pups with retinopathy were treated with SPN (5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) in an 80% oxygen atmosphere and the retinal avascular areas were assessed through visualization using infusion of ADPase and H&amp;E stains. The results showed that SPN inhibited VEGFA secretion by ARPE-19 cells under hypoxia condition, down-regulated the mRNA expressions of VEGFA and PHD-2 slightly, and the protein expressions of VEGFA, HIF-1α and PHD-2 significantly in vitro. SPN also prevented hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization in a rat model of oxygen-induced retinopathy in vivo. These results indicate that SPN ameliorates retinal neovascularization through inhibition of HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, SPN has the potential to be developed as an agent for the prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy."
CD005139,0,26449197,0,The design and implementation of a study to investigate the effectiveness of community vs hospital eye service follow-up for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration with quiescent disease.,"IntroductionStandard treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF drugs. Following multiple injections, nAMD lesions often become quiescent but there is a high risk of reactivation, and regular review by hospital ophthalmologists is the norm. The present trial examines the feasibility of community optometrists making lesion reactivation decisions.MethodsThe Effectiveness of Community vs Hospital Eye Service (ECHoES) trial is a virtual trial; lesion reactivation decisions were made about vignettes that comprised clinical data, colour fundus photographs, and optical coherence tomograms displayed on a web-based platform. Participants were either hospital ophthalmologists or community optometrists. All participants were provided with webinar training on the disease, its management, and assessment of the retinal imaging outputs. In a balanced design, 96 participants each assessed 42 vignettes; a total of 288 vignettes were assessed seven times by each professional group.The primary outcome is a participant's judgement of lesion reactivation compared with a reference standard. Secondary outcomes are the frequency of sight threatening errors; judgements about specific lesion components; participant-rated confidence in their decisions about the primary outcome; cost effectiveness of follow-up by optometrists rather than ophthalmologists.DiscussionThis trial addresses an important question for the NHS, namely whether, with appropriate training, community optometrists can make retreatment decisions for patients with nAMD to the same standard as hospital ophthalmologists. The trial employed a novel approach as participation was entirely through a web-based application; the trial required very few resources compared with those that would have been needed for a conventional randomised controlled clinical trial."

CD005139,0,17145936,0,Anti-VEGF aptamer (pegaptanib) therapy for ocular vascular diseases.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a central regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Pegaptanib, a 28-nucleotide RNA aptamer specific for the VEGF(165) isoform, binds to it in the extracellular space, leaving other isoforms unaffected, and inhibits such key VEGF actions as promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and survival, and vascular permeability. Pegaptanib already has been examined as a treatment for two diseases associated with ocular neovascularization, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Preclinical studies have shown that VEGF(165) alone mediates pathological ocular neovascularization and that its inactivation by pegaptanib inhibits the choroidal neovascularization observed in patients with neovascular AMD. In contrast, physiological vascularization, which is supported by the VEGF(121) isoform, is unaffected by this inactivation of VEGF(165). In addition, animal model studies have shown that intravitreous injection of pegaptanib can inhibit the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier characteristic of diabetes and even can reverse this damage to some degree. These preclinical findings formed the basis for randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of pegaptanib as a therapy for AMD and DME. The VEGF Inhibition Study in Ocular Neovascularization (VISION) trial comprising two replicate, pivotal phase 3 studies, demonstrated that intravitreous injection of pegaptanib resulted in significant clinical benefit, compared with sham injection, for all prespecified clinical end points, irrespective of patient demographics or angiographic subtype, and led to pegaptanib's approval as a treatment for AMD. A phase 2 trial has provided support for the efficacy of intravitreous pegaptanib in the treatment of DME."

CD005139,0,20398784,0,Protein delivery for retinal diseases: from basic considerations to clinical applications.,"Because the eye is protected by ocular barriers but is also easily accessible, direct intravitreous injections of therapeutic proteins allow for specific and targeted treatment of retinal diseases. Low doses of proteins are required in this confined environment and a long time of residency in the vitreous is expected, making the eye the ideal organ for local proteic therapies. Monthly intravitreous injection of Ranibizumab, an anti-VEGF Fab has become the standard of care for patients presenting wet AMD. It has brought the proof of concept that administering proteins into the physiologically low proteic concentration vitreous can be performed safely. Other antibodies, Fab, peptides and growth factors have been shown to exert beneficial effects on animal models when administered within the therapeutic and safe window. To extend the use of such biomolecules in the ophthalmology practice, optimization of treatment regimens and efficacy is required. Basic knowledge remains to be increased on how different proteins/peptides penetrate into the eye and the ocular tissues, distribute in the vitreous, penetrate into the retinal layers and/or cells, are eliminated from the eye or metabolized. This should serve as a basis for designing novel drug delivery systems. The later should be non-or minimally invasive and should allow for a controlled, scalable and sustained release of the therapeutic proteins in the ocular media. This paper reviews the actual knowledge regarding protein delivery for eye diseases and describes novel non-viral gene therapy technologies particularly adapted for this purpose."

CD005139,0,17628122,0,Emerging therapies for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are the leading causes of vision loss in the industrialized world. The mainstay of treatment for both conditions has been thermal laser photocoagulation, while there have been recent advances in the treatment of CNV using photodynamic therapy with verteporfin. While both of these treatments have prevented further vision loss in a subset of patients, vision improvement is rare. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A therapy has revolutionized the treatment of both conditions. Pegaptanib, an anti-VEGF aptamer, prevents vision loss in CNV, although the performance is similar to that of photodynamic therapy. Ranibizumab, an antibody fragment, and bevacizumab, a full-length humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, have both shown promising results, with improvements in visual acuity in the treatment of both diseases. VEGF trap, a modified soluble VEGF receptor analog, binds VEGF more tightly than all other anti-VEGF therapies, and has also shown promising results in early trials. Other treatment strategies to decrease the effect of VEGF have used small interfering RNA to inhibit VEGF production and VEGF receptor production. Corticosteroids have shown efficacy in controlled trials, including anacortave acetate in the treatment and prevention of CNV, and intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide and the fluocinolone acetonide implant in the treatment of DME. Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as vatalanib, inhibit downstream effects of VEGF, and have been effective in the treatment of CNV in early studies. Squalamine lactate inhibits plasma membrane ion channels with downstream effects on VEGF, and has shown promising results with systemic administration. Initial results are also encouraging for other growth factors, including pigment epithelium-derived factor administered via an adenoviral vector. Ruboxistaurin, which decreases protein kinase C activity, has shown positive results in the prevention of diabetic retinopathy progression, and the resolution of DME. Combination therapy has been investigated, and may prove to be quite effective in the management of both DME and AMD-associated CNV, although ongoing and future studies will be crucial to treatment optimization for each condition."

Recently several anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs like pegaptanib sodium (Macugen), ranibizumab (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin) are available for use in the management of wet ARMD. A major limitation of these drugs is that they require multiple intravitreal injections, every 4 to 6 weeks interval for a period of 2 years. Moreover, most of these drugs are too expensive for the general masses to afford in developing nations. Avastin, though used ""off-label"", offers a comparable result at affordable cost, however, long term results are awaited. The drug industry should review the entire pricing policy of these drugs in developing countries like India, and develop affordable alternative compounds. The article reviews the economic burden and affordability issues of these Anti-VEGF drugs in ARMD."

Furthermore, it is clear that when dry AMD progresses to CNV in one eye, there is a substantial risk that it will progress in the other eye. Sight-preservation at early stages of the disease should be a key goal of research, yet there are no approved therapies for halting the progression of early stages of AMD. Patients may be encouraged to use vitamin supplements, cease smoking, and eat a healthy diet; however, these recommendations are not appropriate for all patients, nor are they embraced by everyone. A pharmacologic agent capable of targeting the early stages of AMD would be a welcome addition to the armamentarium of options for managing AMD. Trials are ongoing to evaluate the role of anecortave acetate as a prophylactic treatment to slow the progression of the early stages of AMD. Completed clinical studies have demonstrated that anecortave acetate possesses a mechanism of action that decreases CNV growth irrespective of the inciting angiogenic stimulus, has a dosing-interval that allows its use as prophylactic therapy, and is safe. The economic benefits associated with prevention and progression to advanced AMD, in even a small proportion of cases, is significant and could result in substantial cost savings to society as a whole while providing countless benefits to individual patients in terms of continued independent function, self-sufficiency, and improved quality of life."

Since 2012, four pharmacotherapies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of DME. First-line treatment of DME with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] agents has become the gold standard; however, an appreciable percentage of patients do not respond to anti-VEGF therapies. In patients who inadequately respond to anti-VEGF therapies, the underlying disease pathology may be mediated by a multitude of growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. For these patients, corticosteroids are an attractive treatment option because they not only downregulate VEGF, but also an array of cytokines. The phase 3 MEAD and FAME trials demonstrated significant visual acuity improvements associated with dexamethasone and fluocinolone acetonide, respectively, in patients with DME; however, class-specific adverse events, including increased intraocular pressure and cataract development, must be considered before use. A panel of experts gathered during the 2015 annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology for a roundtable discussion focused on patient selection and adverse event management associated with the use of the 0.19 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant."

CD005139,0,24525867,0,A review of anti-VEGF agents for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.,"Previous research has implicated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Although many studies reviewed the use of anti-VEGF for diabetic macular oedema, little has been written about the use of anti-VEGF for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). This study is a review of relevant publications dealing with the use of anti-VEGF for the treatment of PDR. The articles were identified through systematic searches of PUBMED and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. At the end of each section, we summarized the level of evidence of the scientific literature. Off-label use of anti-VEGF agents was found to be beneficial in PDR, especially in cases with neovascular glaucoma, persistent vitreous haemorrhage, and before vitrectomy. The disadvantages of the use of anti-VEGF are its short-effect duration, causing tractional retinal detachment in cases with pre-existing pre-retinal fibrosis and endophthalmitis in rare cases. There is no conclusive evidence from large randomized trials regarding the efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment in PDR. However, numerous case series, sound biochemical mechanism of action, and increasing experience with using anti-VEGF drugs can be used to support the ongoing use of this treatment modality in selected patients."

We describe choroidal ruptures that were documented at 10 weeks after this combined treatment in a preterm infant born at 28 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 1190 g. Aggressive posterior ROP was diagnosed at the age of 6 weeks. Initial treatment included bilateral laser ablation, followed immediately by intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB, 0.75 mg) in the right eye. On day 5, a remarkable regression of plus sign and fibrovascular proliferation was noted only in the right eye. At this point, additional laser treatment combined with IVB was given in the left eye, which dramatically resolved plus disease and neovascularization. At 10 weeks after IVB in the left eye, two sites of choroidal ruptures were revealed along the posterior edges of laser scars. There was no evidence of choroidal neovascularization associated with the choroidal ruptures. Choroidal rupture may occur shortly after laser ablation plus IVB treatment for aggressive posterior ROP. This occurrence requires recognition to determine whether it is actually related to the treatment. Long-term follow-up is important for understanding the nature and progression of this potentially serious complication."

CD005139,0,27011031,0,[About the Effects of VEGF-A Antagonists on Molecular and Cellular Level].,"Anti-VEGF-A therapy is successfully established as a routine therapy to treat wet age-related macular degeneration. Indications have been extended to other retinal diseases. Three different substances have been demonstrated to be active. However, the efficacy of these substances is highly variable in heterogeneous groups of patients and may include non-responders and relapses, so that there may be very individual treatment effects. It is speculated that differences in the molecular properties or structures of the three substances might explain these observations. This article therefore summarises the recent publications on this topic and discusses their relevance. Apart from common features such as VEGF-A affinity, the substances exhibit differences, including the stability of the VEGF-A/molecule complexes and the ability to neutralise angiogenic molecules other than only VEGF-A. At the cellular level, a variety of different methods have been used and the results are often inconsistent. It is therefore not yet possible to predict the clinical properties of VEGF-A neutralising substances on the basis of their known molecular properties or cellular effects."

We sought to determine if the absence of SOD1 contributes to the pro-angiogenic environment in the subretinal space or whether it is completely secondary to other changes in Bruch's membrane and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) that precede the development of choroidal NV. In an ischemic retinopathy model or a transgenic model in which the rhodopsin promoter drives expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in photoreceptor there was significantly more NV in Sod1(-/-) compared to Sod1(+/+) mice. The compromised antioxidant defense system in Sod1(-/-) mice contributes to the pro-angiogenic environment, because treatment of Sod1(-/-) mice with a mixture of antioxidants caused a significant reduction in ischemia-induced retinal NV. Wild-type mice treated with the same antioxidants also showed reduced ischemia-induced retinal NV, reduced VEGF-induced subretinal NV, and reduced choroidal NV at Bruch's membrane rupture sites. These data suggest that reactive oxygen species contribute to several types of ocular NV. This could explain why in the Age-Related Eye Disease Trial, antioxidant treatment reduced conversion from non-neovascular to neovascular AMD and severe vision loss, and suggest that potent antioxidants should be considered for other diseases complicated by ocular NV.

It potently inhibited VEGFR1 phosphorylation in vivo, determining a strong inhibition of the recruitment of monocyte-macrophages and of mural cells as confirmed, in vitro, by the ability to inhibit macrophages migration. iVR1 was able to synergize with irinotecan determining a shrinkage of tumors that became undetectable after three weeks of combined treatment. Such treatment induced a significant prolongation of survival similar to that observed with bevacizumab and irinotecan combination. iVR1 also fully prevented lung invasion by HCT-116 cells injected in mouse tail vein.

CD005139,0,23440840,0,Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for macular oedema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion.,"Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is one of the most common occurring retinal vascular abnormalities. The pathogenesis of BRVO is thought to involve both retinal vein compression and damage to the vessel wall, possibly leading to thrombus formation at sites where retinal arterioles cross retinal veins. The most common cause of visual loss in patients with BRVO is macular oedema (MO). Grid or focal laser photocoagulation has been shown to reduce the risk of visual loss and improve visual acuity (VA) in up to two thirds of individuals with MO secondary to BRVO, however, limitations to this treatment exist and newer modalities have suggested equal or improved efficacy. Recently, antiangiogenic therapy with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) has been used successfully to treat MO resulting from a variety of causes. As elevated intraocular levels of VEGF have been demonstrated in patients with retinal vein occlusions there is a strong basis for the hypothesis that anti-VEGF agents may be beneficial in the treatment of vascular leakage and MO."

To sustain a therapeutic drug level in the retina, VEGF inhibitors have to be delivered frequently, every 4-8weeks, causing inconvenience for the patients and expenses for the healthcare system. The aim of this study was to investigate cell encapsulation as a delivery system for prolonged anti-angiogenic treatment of retinal neovascularization. Genetically engineered ARPE-19 cells secreting soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR1) were encapsulated in a hydrogel of cross-linked collagen and interpenetrating hyaluronic acid (HA). The system was optimized in terms of matrix composition and cell density, and long-term cell viability and protein secretion measurements were performed. sVEGFR1 ARPE-19 cells in the optimized hydrogel remained viable and secreted sVEGFR1 at a constant rate for at least 50days. Based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, delivery of sVEGFR1 from this cell encapsulation system is expected to lead only to modest VEGF inhibition, but improvements of the protein structure and/or secretion rate should result in strong and prolonged therapeutic effect. In conclusion, the hydrogel matrix herein supported the survival and protein secretion from the encapsulated cells. The PK/PD simulation is a convenient approach to predict the efficiency of the cell encapsulation system before in vivo experiments."

However, the treatment efficacies of IVR monotherapy in real-world clinical settings are not well known.The medical records of 56 eyes from 38 patients who received their first IVR for DME between April 2014 and March 2015, and were retreated with IVR monotherapy as needed with no rescue treatment, such as laser photocoagulation, were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical course, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and fundus findings at baseline, before the initial IVR injection, and at 12 months, were evaluated.Twenty-five eyes from 25 patients (16 men; mean age 68.7 ± 9.8 years) who received IVR in the first eye, or unilaterally, without any other treatments during follow-up were included. After 12 months, mean central retinal thickness (CRT), which includes edema, was reduced (P = .003), although mean BCVA remained unchanged. There was a negative correlation between individual changes in BCVA (r = -0.57; P = .003) and CRT (r = -0.60; P = .002) at 12 months compared with baseline values. BCVA changes were greater in individuals with a history of pan-retinal photocoagulation at baseline (P = .026). After adjusting for age and sex, CRT improvement >100 μm at 12 months was associated with a greater CRT at baseline (OR 0.87 per 10 μm [95% CI 0.72-0.97]; P = .018) according to logistic regression analyses; however, better BCVA and CRT at 12 months were associated with a better BCVA (r = 0.77; P < .001) and lower CRT (r = 0.41; P = .039) at baseline, respectively, according to linear regression analyses.IVR monotherapy suppressed DME, and the effects varied according to baseline conditions. Eyes that had poorer BCVA or greater CRT, or a history of pan-retinal photocoagulation at baseline, demonstrated greater improvement with IVR monotherapy. In contrast, to achieve better outcome values, DME eyes should be treated before the BCVA and CRT deteriorate. These findings advance our understanding of the optimal use of IVR for DME in daily clinical practice, although further study is warranted."

CD005139,0,25793308,0,4-Hydroxy-7-oxo-5-heptenoic Acid (HOHA) Lactone is a Biologically Active Precursor for the Generation of 2-(ω-Carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP) Derivatives of Proteins and Ethanolamine Phospholipids.,"2-(ω-Carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP) derivatives of proteins were previously shown to have significant pathological and physiological relevance to age-related macular degeneration, cancer and wound healing. Previously, we showed that CEPs are generated in the reaction of ε-amino groups of protein lysyl residues with 1-palmityl-2-(4-hydroxy-7-oxo-5-heptenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (HOHA-PC), a lipid oxidation product uniquely generated by oxidative truncation of docosahexanenate-containing phosphatidylcholine. More recently, we found that HOHA-PC rapidly releases HOHA-lactone and 2-lyso-PC (t1/2 = 30 min at 37 °C) by nonenzymatic transesterification/deacylation. Now we report that HOHA-lactone reacts with Ac-Gly-Lys-OMe or human serum albumin to form CEP derivatives in vitro. Incubation of human red blood cell ghosts with HOHA-lactone generates CEP derivatives of membrane proteins and ethanolamine phospholipids. Quantitative analysis of the products generated in the reaction HOHA-PC with Ac-Gly-Lys-OMe showed that HOHA-PC mainly forms CEP-dipeptide that is not esterified to 2-lysophosphatidycholine. Thus, the HOHA-lactone pathway predominates over the direct reaction of HOHA-PC to produce the CEP-PC-dipeptide derivative. Myleoperoxidase/H2O2/NO2(-) promoted in vitro oxidation of either 1-palmityl-2-docosahexaneoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) generates HOHA-lactone in yields of 0.45% and 0.78%, respectively. Lipid oxidation in human red blood cell ghosts also releases HOHA-lactone. Oxidative injury of ARPE-19 human retinal pigmented epithelial cells by exposure to H2O2 generated CEP derivatives. Treatment of ARPE-19 cells with HOHA-lactone generated CEP-modified proteins. Low (submicromolar), but not high, concentrations of HOHA-lactone promote increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by ARPE-19 cells. Therefore, HOHA-lactone not only serves as an intermediate for the generation of CEPs but also is a biologically active oxidative truncation product from docosahexaenoate lipids."

Neovascular AMD, a subtype characterized by the growth of new, pathologic blood vessels, results in most of the cases of severe and rapid vision loss associated with AMD.

CD005139,0,26039997,0,Angiopoietin-like 4 is a potent angiogenic factor and a novel therapeutic target for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic eye disease is the most common cause of severe vision loss in the working-age population in the developed world, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is its most vision-threatening sequela. In PDR, retinal ischemia leads to the up-regulation of angiogenic factors that promote neovascularization. Therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) delay the development of neovascularization in some, but not all, diabetic patients, implicating additional factor(s) in PDR pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate that the angiogenic potential of aqueous fluid from PDR patients is independent of VEGF concentration, providing an opportunity to evaluate the contribution of other angiogenic factor(s) to PDR development. We identify angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as a potent angiogenic factor whose expression is up-regulated in hypoxic retinal Müller cells in vitro and the ischemic retina in vivo. Expression of ANGPTL4 was increased in the aqueous and vitreous of PDR patients, independent of VEGF levels, correlated with the presence of diabetic eye disease, and localized to areas of retinal neovascularization. Inhibition of ANGPTL4 expression reduced the angiogenic potential of hypoxic Müller cells; this effect was additive with inhibition of VEGF expression. An ANGPTL4 neutralizing antibody inhibited the angiogenic effect of aqueous fluid from PDR patients, including samples from patients with low VEGF levels or receiving anti-VEGF therapy. Collectively, our results suggest that targeting both ANGPTL4 and VEGF may be necessary for effective treatment or prevention of PDR and provide the foundation for studies evaluating aqueous ANGPTL4 as a biomarker to help guide individualized therapy for diabetic eye disease."

This prospective, randomized, but unblinded trial revealed a significant improvement in vision with both treatments in terms of visual acuity; importantly, patients with juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and retinal pigment epithelial detachments were not excluded from the study. Monthly treatment with the drugs resulted in similar increases in visual acuity, although angiograms indicated that ranibizumab was superior in terms of reducing retinal fluid and leakage. As the study also differentiated between a fixed regimen and an as-needed (pro re nata [PRN]) dosing regimen, a larger sample size and Bonferroni statistical correction were necessary. The equivalence of the PRN dosing of bevacizumab to the monthly treatment could not be confirmed. Almost all of the frequent deviations from the protocol (referring to retreatment criteria: 25.7-28.5%) resulted in under-treatment. Since this applied to both drugs equally, under-treatment alone could not explain the larger loss of visual acuity observed in the bevacizumab PRN arm. The PRN regimen was generally associated with a larger lesion size after 12 months compared with the fixed treatment regimens. The investigators accepted the drawbacks of an incomplete masking to allow co-payment by Medicare. As assessments of drug trials are often politically motivated, the higher demands of a non-inferiority trial compared with a superiority design must be emphasized. A comparison of the per-protocol and last-observation-carried-forward analysis has not yet been published; ongoing subgroup analysis might highlight the impact of different lesion characteristics. While CATT provided further evidence for the efficacy of bevacizumab treatment, differences in adverse events between the two treatments (e.g. a higher rate of serious adverse events with bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab) were reported; however, these still have to be analysed, with the larger sample sizes of previous ranibizumab studies needing to be taken into account. Preclinical studies imply some differences between the drugs in terms of their adverse event profiles. A possible increased risk of adverse events could not be ruled out by previous clinical case series and CATT because the sample sizes and the follow-up intervals were not adequate. The large discrepancy in the price of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab in the US means a cost-benefit analysis is warranted. A lack of quality-of-life data has prevented calculation of an appropriate bevacizumab price in the context of its performance in the ophthalmological setting. Thus, CATT suggests that a favourable visual acuity might be achieved by very frequent administration of bevacizumab in patients with neovascular AMD. Although there are certain safety caveats, increased focus on subgroup analyses and obtaining longer follow-up data are expected to yield additional information of clinical relevance."

A total of 71 eyes (71 cases) with cystoid macular edema (CME) were included in the study. Macular pigment (MP) was evaluated using HRA2 (infrared) IF and FA models. The density of MP was graded into three categories: without, partial, and normal amount of MP. A comparison was made between the baseline (before the first administration) level and at the fourth month, following three consecutive intravitreal lucentis injections every month. The morphology and distribution of MAF, and the density and distribution of MP were regarded as the main outcome measures. At the baseline visit, all eyes with CME had petaloid/irregular-shaped MAF in the macular area (100%). No MAF was detected in the control eyes (0). There was significant difference in MAF between the CME and normal groups (P=0.000). At the fourth monthly visit, normal levels of MP density without MAF was detected in 68 eyes (95.8%) with the best corrected spectacular visual acuity increasing to at least 1 line accordingly. We conclude that macular MAF can be used as a follow-up parameter for patients with CME. MP and MAF can indirectly reflect the fovea cone function."

Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of edaravone, a free radical scavenger on laser-induced CNV. CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation to the subretinal choroidal area of mice and common marmosets. Edaravone was administered either intraperitoneally twice a day for 2 weeks or intravenously just once after laser photocoagulation. The effects of edaravone on laser-induced CNV were evaluated by fundus fluorescein angiography, CNV area measurements, and the expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) modified proteins, a marker of oxidative stress. Furthermore, the effects of edaravone on the production of H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell proliferation were evaluated using human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells, respectively. CNV areas in the edaravone-treated group were significantly smaller in mice and common marmosets. The expression of 4-HNE modified proteins was upregulated 3 h after laser photocoagulation, and intravenously administered edaravone decreased it. In in vitro studies, edaravone inhibited H2O2-induced ROS production and VEGF-induced cell proliferation.

If they extend into it, photodynamic therapy may halt the natural progression to a central scotoma. Occult CNVs, when subfoveal, may benefit from photodynamic therapy when isolated (not associated with classic CNV or with a pigment epithelium detachment). A number of therapeutic approaches are being evaluated in order to diversify the therapeutic choices available for treatment of CNVs. Transpupillary thermotherapy, which causes a limited increase in retinal temperature, could produce a sclerosis of occult isolated CNV. This approach has shown interesting results in pilot studies but also carries a risk for iatrogenic effects. The American randomized clinical trial currently under way will provide an evaluation of this treatment. An antiangiogenic therapy currently in progress is studying anecortave acetate and another is investigating anti-VEGF compounds. Anecortave acetate, which demonstrated its angiostatic activity in experimental models as well as in a phase II study, is now in a worldwide randomized clinical trial. The anti-VEGF molecules (antibodies and oligonucleotides) have shown very interesting preliminary results and are being evaluated in a large number of patients.

CD005139,0,9323726,0,Vascular endothelial growth factor and the eye: biochemical mechanisms of action and implications for novel therapies.,"Ophthalmic complications arising from pathologic intraocular neovascularization are responsible for the majority of visual loss in most developed countries. Among the many disorders associated with intraocular neovascularization are retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. These conditions are the leading causes of blindness among infants, those of working age and the elderly, respectively. For nearly half a century the clinical findings associated with these conditions have suggested that the action of growth factors may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, the exact molecules involved and their mechanisms of action have remained incompletely understood. Recently, studies have begun to elucidate the major molecules and intracellular pathways involved in regulating neovascular eye disorders.

Fifty-six eyes of 45 recruited patients were classified into two groups: group 1 had medically controlled CACG (IOP <or= 21 mmHg) comprising 35 eyes and group 2 medically uncontrolled CACG (IOP > 21 mmHg with maximum tolerated medications) including 21 eyes. All of the patients had at least one quadrant without peripheral anterior synechia in gonioscopy. After phacoemulsification, a viscoelastic agent was used for viscogoniasynecialysis. Success was defined as IOP <or= 21 mmHg with (relative success) or without (absolute success) medications. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding age and gender. In group 1, the mean IOP and number of medications declined from 16.7 +/- 2.9 to 14.4 +/- 2.9 (P < 0.0001) and 2.6 +/- 0.8 to 0.82 +/- 0.82 (P < 0.0001), respectively.

ARMD has two major forms: the dry type and the wet type. Although wet type comprises only 15% of ARMD, it is responsible for 90% of severe visual impairment in all ARMD cases. The problem is effective treatment of ARMD, above all its wet type. Laser therapy, retina surgery, TTT and local radiotherapy did not give expected results. The aim of this article is to present modern trends of wet type ARMD therapy, including pharmacotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in relation to pathobiology of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The goals of pharmacotherapy were discussed in support, that choroidal neovascularization is a dynamic evolution, which includes initiation, active inflammation and non active involution. Cellular mechanisms of photodynamic therapy were presented. It is necessary to accentuate that in the future it can be a combination between PDT and pharmacotherapy, which inhibits early stage mediators of all types CNV and limits inflammation attendant CNV. These therapeutic approaches ere more likely succeed and included wide spectrum of wet ARMD pathogenesis. The clinical studies show that may be soon we will treat wet form of ARMD using angiostatic steroids, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies and anti-VEGF aptamers."

CD005139,0,26654441,0,Coagulation Factor XIIIA (F13A1): Novel Perspectives in Treatment and Pharmacogenetics.,"Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases."

From 2008 to 2012, 420 patients (448 eyes) with exudative AMD were prospectively registered at Seoul National University Hospital. From this group of patients, 125 eyes were included in this study. All patients were treated with 3 consecutive IVR injections. The visual acuity (VA) was evaluated at baseline and 1 month after the third ranibizumab injection. To evaluate the risk factors associated with VA improvement after IVR, patient demographic data and systemic risk factors were analyzed. Patients were divided into a poor VA improvement group and a good VA improvement group, with reference to the median visual improvement in all eyes. Among 125 eyes, 66 eyes (52.8%) were included in the responder group and 59 eyes (47.2%) in the non-responder group. The median VA improvement after 3 monthly ranibizumab injections was -0.05 logMAR. Multivariate analyses revealed that current smoking (adjusted OR, 7.540; 95% CI, 1.732-32.823) was independently associated with poor VA improvement after IVR treatment for exudative AMD.

CD005139,0,25446322,0,Therapeutic efficacy of a novel non-peptide αvβ3 integrin antagonist for pathological retinal angiogenesis in mice.,"αvβ3 integrin has been reported as a promising therapeutic target for angiogenesis. In the present study, we tested the antiangiogenic activity of 3-[3-(6-guanidino-1-oxoisoindolin-2-yl) propanamido]-3-(pyridin-3-yl) propanoic acid dihydrochloride (GOPPP), a novel non-peptide αvβ3 antagonist. Both human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) were investigated separately. HUVEC adhesion, proliferation, migration, ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation were assessed. C57BL/6 mice were used for the studies in the OIR model. After exposure to 75% oxygen from postnatal day (PD) 7 to PD12, the mice were returned to room air, and GOPPP was intravitreally administered on PD12. Retinal neovascularization was evaluated on PD17. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein levels and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were determined by Western blot analysis of retina proteins. GOPPP significantly inhibited the pro-angiogenic effects of vitronectin on HUVECs, including adhesion, proliferation, and migration, and inhibited ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. Retinal neovascularization in the OIR model was significantly suppressed by intravitreal administration of 50 ng GOPPP. The pro-angiogenic factors HIF-1α and VEGF induced by hypoxia were significantly inhibited by GOPPP in OIR mice. GOPPP administration also inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the OIR model. These results indicate that GOPPP, a novel αvβ3 integrin antagonist, may have potential for the treatment of pathological retinal angiogenesis."

CD005139,0,26220834,0,Idiopathic preretinal glia in aging and age-related macular degeneration.,"During analysis of glia in wholemount aged human retinas, frequent projections onto the vitreal surface of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) were noted. The present study characterized these preretinal glial structures. The amount of glial cells on the vitreal side of the ILM was compared between eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and age-matched control eyes. Retinal wholemounts were stained for markers of retinal astrocytes and activated Müller cells (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), Müller cells (vimentin, glutamine synthetase) and microglia/hyalocytes (IBA-1). Retinal vessels were labeled with UEA lectin. Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Retinas were then cryopreserved. Laminin labeling of cryosections determined the location of glial structures in relation to the ILM. All retinas investigated herein had varied amounts of preretinal glia. These glial structures were classified into three groups based on size: sprouts, blooms, and membranes. The simplest of the glial structures observed were focal sprouts of singular GFAP-positive cells or processes on the vitreal surface of the ILM. The intermediate structures observed, glial blooms, were created by multiple cells/processes exiting from a single point and extending along the vitreoretinal surface. The most extensive structures, glial membranes, consisted of compact networks of cells and processes. Preretinal glia were observed in all areas of the retina but they were most prominent over large vessels. While all glial blooms and membranes contained vimentin and GFAP-positive cells, these proteins did not always co-localize. Many areas had no preretinal GFAP but had numerous vimentin only glial sprouts. In double labeled glial sprouts, vimentin staining extended beyond that of GFAP. Hyalocytes and microglia were detected along with glial sprouts, blooms, and membranes. They did not, however, concentrate in the retina below these structures. Cross sectional analysis identified small breaks in the ILM above large retinal vessels through which glial cells exited the retina. Preretinal glial structures of varied sizes are a common occurrence in aged retinas and, in most cases, are subclinical. While all retinal glia are found in blooms, vimentin labeling suggests that Müller cells form the leading edge. All retinas investigated from eyes with active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) had extensive glial membranes on the vitreal surface of the ILM. Although these structures may be benign, they may exert traction on the retina as they spread along the vitreoretinal interface. In cases with CNV, glial cells in the vitreous could bind intravitreally injected anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. These preretinal glial structures indicate the remodeling of both astrocytes and Müller cells in aged retinas, in particular those with advanced AMD."

AMD has two forms, dry and wet; both can lead to visual loss. However, occurrence of subfoveal choroidal neovascular (CNV) membrane in the wet form results in severe visual impairment. Treatment options for choroidal neovascularization are available in order to maintain and in some cases improve vision. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used to treat both classic and occult membranes. It has known to cause choroidal hypoperfusion and production of vascular endothelial growth factor. Intravitreal steroid can possibly reduce the damage caused due to these undesirable effects. In the recent past, intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) has been used extensively as an adjunct to PDT in AMD in order to reduce the number of PDT sessions and evaluate possible beneficial effects on vision.

CD005139,0,16341677,0,[Modern pharmacotherapy of age-related macular degeneration].,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is now the most common cause for blind registration in all developed countries. Epidemiologic data indicate that there are 4.5 millions affected in Germany with constant increase in incidence and prevalence with subsequent considerable health economic implications. Late manifestations of the disease result in the inability to read and to perform daily tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent need for efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic measures to prevent irreversible loss of central vision. Based on a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms new therapeutic approaches have been brought forward and expand previous approaches such as thermal laser surgery or photodynamic therapy. Repeated intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents as well as corticosteroids have a beneficial effect on growth and permeability of neovascular membranes. The risk for progression from early to late stages of AMD can be reduced with certain antioxidative preparations (AREDS medication) in presence of defined funduscopic signs. Early diagnosis is key for all currently available interventions since a beneficial effect can only be achieved in early stages of the disease process."

CD005139,0,24770536,0,[Avastin-Lucentis: off-label and surroundings].,"In Italy, the debate on the off-label use of intravitreal bevacizumab in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has attracted a very wide coverage by the media. Our national regulation on the off-label uses of pharmacological agents was initially issued in 1999 to handle the case of the so-called ""Di Bella therapy"" in patients with cancer. Some changes to this regulation have been made thereafter, and the most recent law currently prohibits the use of off-label agents in cases where approved medicines are available. Bevacizumab and ranibizumab are thought to be equi-effective, and also their safety profiles are similar. Since the cost per intravitreal injection is much lower for off-label bevacizumab than for ranibizumab, in our National Health System the criterion of economic savings, that favours bevacizumab, conflicts with the criterion set by the current regulation that instead favours ranibizumab. Therefore, a lively debate has been started and is still ongoing to establish how the present regulation in this area can be revised. In devising the new regulation on this issue, one point deserving consideration is that the case of bevacizumab vs ranibizumab in patients with AMD is very atypical in the current scenario of in-hospital drug treatments. Hence, the new regulation should be tailored to the therapeutic needs of all patients likely to receive an off-label treatment for any clinical indication rather than to the specific case of intravitreal treatments for patients with AMD."

CD005139,0,17585951,0,Retinal and choroidal microangiopathies: therapeutic opportunities.,"Pathological angiogenesis in the retina and underlying choroid is a major cause of visual impairment in all age groups. The last decade has seen an explosion in the clinical availability of antiangiogenic compounds. Emphasis has been placed on inhibitors of the VEGF signaling pathway and considerable success has been achieved with aptamers and antibodies that bind VEGF. However, regression of neovascularization is rarely permanent and the regrowth of new vessels, often within a few months, requires multiple applications of drug. A number of antiangiogenic factors such as IGFBP3, SDF-1 blockers, PEDF, gamma-secretase, Delta-like ligand 4, and integrin antagonists have been identified, which act either indirectly on the VEGF system or independent of it. The importance of other candidates such as HIF-1alpha and protein kinase CK2, which act as ""master"" regulators of angiogenesis, offer realistic alternative targets for pharmacological intervention. The concept of combination therapy is rapidly gaining interest in the eye field and co-administration of two angiogenic agents (e.g., a CK2 inhibitor with a somatostatin analog, octreotide) are often significantly more effective at inhibiting retinal angiogenesis than either drug alone. The following review will discuss the current therapies available for aberrant ocular angiogenesis, consider new candidate targets for development of antiangiogenic compounds and emphasize the importance of combinatorial pharmacological agents in the treatment of such a dynamic cellular event as angiogenesis."

Although the term may suggest just a vascular pathological condition, CNV is more properly definable as an aberrant tissue invasion of endothelial and inflammatory cells, in which both angiogenesis and inflammation are involved. Experimental and clinical evidences show that vascular endothelial growth factor is a key signal in promoting angiogenesis. However, many other molecules, distinctive of the inflammatory response, act as neovascular activators in CNV. These include fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, and complement. This paper reviews the role of inflammatory mediators and angiogenic factors in the development of CNV, proposing pathogenetic assumptions of mutual interaction. As an extension of this concept, new therapeutic approaches geared to have an effect on both the vascular and the extravascular components of CNV are discussed."
CD005139,0,25892935,0,A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing intravitreal ranibizumab with bevacizumab for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularisation.,"Intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (IVR) and bevacizumab (IVB) have both been used as treatments for myopic choroidal neovascularisation. We aimed to produce a meta-analysis of published literature comparing IVR with IVB for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularisation, by searching electronic databases from January 1950 to March 2013. Our search produced three suitable studies that reported on 117 patients in total. The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that the mean number of lines improvement after IVR appeared better compared with IVB [fixed effects model: SMD = 0.46, 95% CI (0.09, 0.83), z = 2.44, p = 0.01]. The number of patients who had a greater than 3 line improvement was similar between groups [fixed effects model: RR = 0.95, 95% CI (0.67, 1.32), z = 0.33, p = 0.74]. At follow up there was no difference in number of those who had an absence of leakage [fixed effects model: RR = 1.04, 95% CI (0.93, 1.16), z = 0.64, p = 0.52]. There was no statistical significance between the two groups in relation to the number of injections [random effects model: SMD = -0.25, 95% CI (-1.12, 0.61), z = 0.57, p = 0.57]. Early evidence therefore suggests that intravitreal injections of ranibizumab are comparable to intravitreal injections of bevacizumab in the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularisation. Both treatments result in a statistically significant increase in visual acuity with high numbers of patients maintaining stable vision. Further studies are still needed to strengthen results."

CD005139,0,22797809,0,Pathological neoangiogenesis depends on oxidative stress regulation by ATM.,"The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, a master regulator of the DNA damage response (DDR), acts as a barrier to cellular senescence and tumorigenesis. Aside from DDR signaling, ATM also functions in oxidative defense. Here we show that Atm in mice is activated specifically in immature vessels in response to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Global or endothelial-specific Atm deficiency in mice blocked pathological neoangiogenesis in the retina. This block resulted from increased amounts of ROS and excessive activation of the mitogen activated kinase p38α rather than from defects in the canonical DDR pathway. Atm deficiency also lowered tumor angiogenesis and enhanced the antiangiogenic action of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) blockade. These data suggest that pathological neoangiogenesis requires ATM-mediated oxidative defense and that agents that promote excessive ROS generation may have beneficial effects in the treatment of neovascular disease."

PKC412 showed a broad antiproliferative activity against various tumor and normal cell lines in vitro, and was able to reverse the Pgp-mediated multidrug resistance of tumor cells in vitro. Exposure of cells to PKC412 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle concomitant with increased polyploidy, apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation. PKC412 displayed a potent antitumor activity as single agent and was able to potentiate the antitumor activity of some of the clinically used cytotoxins (Taxol and doxorubicin) in vivo. The combined treatment of PKC412 with loco-regional ionizing irradiation showed significant antitumor activity against tumors which are resistant to both ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents (dysfunctional p53). The finding that PKC412 is an inhibitor of the VEGF-mediated cellular signaling via inhibition of KDR and PKC in vitro is consistent with the in vivo inhibition of VEGF-dependent angiogenesis in a growth factor implant model. Orally administered PKC412 also strongly inhibited retinal neovascularization as well as laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in murine models. In summary, PKC412 may suppress tumor growth by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis in addition to directly-inhibiting tumor cell proliferation via its effects on PKC and/or other protein kinases. PKC412 is currently in Phase I clinical trials for treatment of advanced cancer as well as for the treatment of ischemic retinopathy."

FR-sema3C is a point mutated form of semaphorin-3C that is resistant to cleavage by furin like pro-protein convertases (FPPC). We have found in previous work that FR-sema3C functions as an anti-angiogenic factor. In this study we investigated the possible use of FR-sema3C as an inhibitor of CNV. FR-sema3C inhibits VEGF as well as PDGF-BB signal transduction in endothelial cells and to less extent bFGF induced signal transduction using a mechanism that does not depend upon the binding of VEGF like the drugs that are currently the mainstay treatment for AMD. CNV was induced in eyes of C57 black mice by laser photocoagulation. Intravitreal injection of FR-Sema3C or aflibercept (VEGF-trap) was then used to inhibit CNV formation. Invading choroidal vessels were visualized a week later by injection of FITC-dextran into the circulation, followed by the measurement of the area of the invading blood vessels. Injection of 0.1 μg FR-Sema3C inhibited CNV by 55% (P<0.01) and was as effective as 5 μg aflibercept. FR-sema3C did not display any adverse effects on retinal function following its injection into eyes of healthy mice as assessed by optokinetic reflex (OKR) and Electro-retinogram (ERG) criteria. Furthermore, FR-sema3C did not induce apoptosis in the retina as determined by TUNEL nor was there any discernable structural damage to the retina as assessed by several immuno-histochemical criteria. Our results suggest that FR-sema3C could perhaps be used for the treatment of AMD, and that it may perhaps be of benefit to patients that do not respond well to current treatments relying on VEGF sequestering agents."

CD005139,0,16334627,0,Does hypertension play a role in diabetic retinopathy?,"Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes. It represents one of the frequent causes of visual disability among diabetic subjects during the period of active life. The risk factors for diabetic retinopathy are poor glycemic control, hypertension, duration of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and proteinuria. It has been observed that prevalence of hypertension is higher in diabetic subjects than in the general population and as it also plays a major role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy, so tight control of hypertension is mandatory. The possible mechanisms by which hypertension affects diabetic retinopathy are haemodynamic (impaired autoregulation and hyperperfusion) and secondly through VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), as it has been observed that hypertension independent of hyperglycaemia upregulates the VEGF expression in retinal endothelial cells and ocular fluids. The level of control of blood pressure are debatable but nearer the blood pressure to the normal levels, better the chances of preventing the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy. The lowering of blood pressure to a normal range is more important than the type of antihypertensive medication used. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the important causes of visual disability in diabetic subjects during the period of active life. It is characterized by gradually progressive alterations in the retinal microvasculature, leading to increased vasopermeability, areas of retinal occlusion and retinal neovascularization. The complications associated with increased vasopermeability and uncontrolled neovascularization can result in severe and permanent visual loss."

CD005139,0,22428185,0,Ranibizumab and diabetic macular oedema: after laser therapy.,"Diabetic retinopathy is sometimes accompanied by macular oedema, leading to a marked decline in visual acuity. The standard treatment, in addition to glycaemic and blood pressure control, is laser photocoagulation, despite its modest efficacy. Ranibizumab (Lucentis, Novartis), a VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitor, was initially authorised for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the European Union. It is now also approved for the treatment of visual loss due to macular oedema in diabetic patients. In this setting, clinical evaluation of ranibizumab is mainly based on two double-blind randomised trials comparing ranibizumab + laser photocoagulation versus placebo + laser photo-coagulation in a total of about 1000 patients. Compared with placebo, addition of ranibizumab to laser therapy led to a marked improvement in visual acuity in approximately 15% of patients after 12 months of treatment. The improvement appeared to persist after 24 months of treatment. In a trial that included a group treated with ranibizumab alone, efficacy did not differ from that of the ranibizumab + laser combination. Uncertainties remain concerning the long-term efficacy of ranibizumab and its benefits in patients with poorly controlled diabetes or proliferative retinopathy. The adverse effect profile of ranibizumab in patients with diabetic macular oedema is similar to that reported in patients with AMD, and mainly includes ocular adverse effects such as pain, bleeding and increased intraocular pressure. A risk of systemic adverse effects, particularly cardiovascular disorders, should be kept in mind in case of long-term treatment. Ranibizumab can cause birth defects, even after intravitreal injection during pregnancy. Monthly treatment with ranibizumab is inconvenient, difficult and expensive. In practice, laser therapy remains the standard treatment for diabetic patients with significantly reduced visual acuity due to macular oedema. Ranibizumab, which requires intravitreal injections, should be restricted to second-line use."

We show here the generation of a set of highly potent VEGF-A antagonistic DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins) delivering these properties. DARPins with single-digit picomolar affinity to human VEGF-A were generated using ribosome display selections. Specific and potent human VEGF-A binding was confirmed by ELISA and endothelial cell sprouting assays. Cross-reactivity with VEGF-A of several species was confirmed by ELISA. Intravitreally injected DARPin penetrated into the retina and reduced fluorescein extravasation in a rabbit model of vascular leakage. In addition, topical DARPin application was found to diminish corneal neovascularization in a rabbit suture model, and to suppress laser-induced neovascularization in a rat model. Even at elevated doses, DARPins were safe to use. The fact that several DARPins are highly active in various assays illustrates the favorable class behavior of the selected binders. Anti-VEGF-A DARPins thus represent a novel class of highly potent and specific drug candidates for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases in both the posterior and the anterior eye chamber."

CD005139,0,24624338,0,Inhibition of APE1/Ref-1 redox activity rescues human retinal pigment epithelial cells from oxidative stress and reduces choroidal neovascularization.,"The effectiveness of current treatment for age related macular degeneration (AMD) by targeting one molecule is limited due to its multifactorial nature and heterogeneous pathologies. Treatment strategy to target multiple signaling pathways or pathological components in AMD pathogenesis is under investigation for better clinical outcome. Inhibition of the redox function of apurinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (APE1) was found to suppress endothelial angiogenesis and promote neuronal cell recovery, thereby may serve as a potential treatment for AMD. In the current study, we for the first time have found that a specific inhibitor of APE1 redox function by a small molecule compound E3330 regulates retinal pigment epithelium (RPEs) cell response to oxidative stress. E3330 significantly blocked sub-lethal doses of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induced proliferation decline and senescence advancement of RPEs. At the same time, E3330 remarkably decreased the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and down-regulated the productions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as attenuated the level of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 in RPEs. A panel of stress and toxicity responsive transcription factors that were significantly upregulated by oxLDL was restored by E3330, including Nrf2/Nrf1, p53, NF-κB, HIF1, CBF/NF-Y/YY1, and MTF-1. Further, a single intravitreal injection of E3330 effectively reduced the progression of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mouse eyes. These data revealed that E3330 effectively rescued RPEs from oxidative stress induced senescence and dysfunctions in multiple aspects in vitro, and attenuated laser-induced damages to RPE-Bruch׳s membrane complex in vivo. Together with its previously established anti-angiogenic and neuroprotection benefits, E3330 is implicated for potential use for AMD treatment."

CD005139,0,15533634,0,The putative therapeutic value of high-dose selenium in proliferative retinopathies may reflect down-regulation of VEGF production by the hypoxic retina.,"Two decades ago, Crary reported his anecdotal observation that a supplemental antioxidant regimen including high-dose selenium (500 mcg daily) appeared to slow the progression of visual loss in diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Recently, selenium has been shown to down-regulate VEGF production by rodent cancer cells, both in vivo and in vitro; this effect is dose-dependent and, like the anticarcinogenic activity of selenium, is mediated by methyselenol. If increased selenium exposure can likewise suppress VEGF production in the hypoxic retina, a straightforward explanation for Crary's observation may be at hand. Since selenium is inexpensive and non-toxic in the dose employed by Crary, an effort to replicate his findings is warranted."

Bevacizumab (Avastin®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®) are targeted biological drugs (a monoclonal antibody) that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor, an angiogenic cytokine that promotes vascular leakage and growth, thereby preventing its pathological angiogenesis. Ranibizumab is approved for intravitreal use to treat neovascular AMD, while bevacizumab is approved for intravenous use as a cancer therapy. However, due to the biological similarity of the two drugs, bevacizumab is widely used off-label to treat neovascular AMD."

Two of the most popular anti-VEGF agents, ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech/Roche) and bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech/Roche), effectively treat neovascular AMD but have a substantial difference in price. Multiple level 1 trials have demonstrated that bevacizumab is noninferior to ranibizumab in the treatment of neovascular AMD and that both have similar safety profiles. The decision to use one drug over the other is multifactorial with influences from industry as well as individual physician biases. However, the additional billions spent on ranibizumab result in a large economic disparity that is not rationalized by cost effectiveness models."

Systemic VEGF-A and the interplay between membrane-bound VEGF receptors and VEGF-R1 (soluble form) are key to angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Furthermore, patients with diabetes have a higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, two surrogate markers of systemic VEGF inhibition. Pegaptanib, ranibizumab, bevacizumab and roboxistaurin are the currently available anti-VEGF agents. Agents with activity occurring later down the angiogenic pathway and those drugs with potential to synergize with anti-VEGF-A technologies are being developed. In recent years, inhibition of ocular VEGF has emerged as a promising treatment modality for diabetes and is currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. A potential role for these anti-VEGF agents in the prevention of PDR and DME are also emerging."

It remains the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of retinal neovascularization and vessel leakage leading to central vision loss, has emerged as a potential target in the treatment of wet AMD. Importantly, large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that intravitreal VEGF antagonism prevents vision loss and may even improve visual acuity in patients with neovascular AMD. Because VEGF and its downstream mediator nitric oxide have a well-established cardioprotective role, however, it can be argued that the beneficial effects of VEGF antagonism in the eye may come at the cost of adverse systemic effects, particularly myocardial infarction and stroke."

CD005139,0,28475181,0,A systematic review to assess the 'treat-and-extend' dosing regimen for neovascular age-related macular degeneration using ranibizumab.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the developed world. Monthly or as-needed (PRN) dosing strategies of intravitreal ranibizumab have been established as efficacious treatment options for neovascular AMD. More recently, the 'treat-and-extend' dosing regimen (TREX) is being adopted in clinical practice as it represents a patient-centric and economical option, reducing treatment burden by extending injection intervals when possible. However, the efficacy of TREX using ranibizumab monotherapy remains to be defined. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to assess the current evidence for TREX using ranibizumab by searching MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed. Of the 1733 articles identified, nine TREX studies were included in our analysis (n=748 eyes). Average patient age was 79.25 (range: 77.34-82.00; SD: 7.27). Baseline BCVA ranged from 48.5-68.9 ETDRS letters. BCVA improvement was 8.92 letters at 1 year (range: 6.5-11.5; SD: 7.54), as a weighted mean accounting for numbers of study eyes. The weighted mean number of injections at one year was 8.60 (range: 7.3-12.0; SD: 1.73). Previously, the landmark ANCHOR and MARINA trials reported gains of 11.3 and 7.2 letters, respectively, using monthly ranibizumab. Chin-Yee et al reported a gain of 3.5 ETDRS letters with 5.3 (S.D. 0.66) PRN ranibizumab injections as weighted means at 1 year in their recent systematic review. Our analysis suggests that TREX delivers visual outcomes superior to PRN and approaches similar efficacy to monthly injections. Further RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy and economy of TREX in the long-term."

CD005139,0,26984473,0,Trends in the Design and Development of Specific Aptamers Against Peptides and Proteins.,"Aptamers are single stranded oligonucleotides, comparable to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in selectivity and affinity and have significant strategic properties in design, development and applications more than mAbs. Ease of design and development, simple chemical modification and the attachment of functional groups, easily handling and more adaptability with analytical methods, small size and adaptation with nanostructures are the valuable characteristics of aptamers in comparison to large protein based ligands. Among a broad range of targets that their specific aptamers developed, proteins and peptides have significant position according to the number of related studies performed so far. Since proteins control many of important physiological and pathological incidents in the living organisms, particularly human beings and because of the benefits of aptamers in clinical and analytical applications, aptamer related technologies in the field of proteins and peptides are under progress, exclusively. Currently, there is only one FDA approved therapeutic aptamer in the pharmaceutical market, which is specific to vascular endothelial growth factor and is prescribed for age related macular degenerative disease. Additionally, there are several aptamers in the different phases of clinical trials. Almost all of these aptamers are specific to clinically important peptide or protein targets. In addition, the application of protein specific aptamers in the design and development of targeted drug delivery systems and diagnostic biosensors is another interesting field of aptamer technology. In this review, significant efforts related to development and applications of aptamer technologies in proteins and peptides sciences were considered to emphasis on the importance of aptamers in medicinal and clinical applications."

From the comparison of the design and the findings of these meta-analysis, we tried to identify the potential explanations to account for these discrepancies. We separately evaluated the incidence of ocular inflammation with the two agents between randomized studies and non-randomized studies. While no increase in risk was found in randomized studies, non-randomized studies showed an increase in risk for bevacizumab versus ranibizumab. One interpretation of these findings is that bevacizumab itself does not represent any increase in risk of ocular inflammation and/or cardiovascular events under the rigorous conditions of a randomized study, but this agent can be at the origin of an increase in risk when administered in the ""real world""; this setting could in fact leave space for less strictly controlled preparation of aliquots for intravitreal injection."

We found that the NP with mean size of 208 ± 1.0 nm showed uniform size distribution and exhibited sustained release of the drug. We also demonstrated that the polymer can be injected as a solution and transition to a gel phase based on the biological temperature of the eye. Additionally, the proposed DDS was non-cytotoxic to ARPE-19 cells and significantly reduced VEGF expression by 43.5 ± 3.9% as compared to a 1.53 ± 11.1% reduction with triamcinolone. These results suggest the proposed DDS will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for AMD."

CD005139,0,16784022,0,Current development status of small-molecule vascular disrupting agents.,"There is increasing interest in small-molecule drugs that can selectively disrupt the abnormal vasculature associated with disease processes such as cancer and macular degeneration. These agents are distinct from anti-angiogenic strategies, which do not target existing vessels but prevent additional vessel growth, althouglh they may potentially be complimentary with these antiangiogenic strategies. Several vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) are now undergoing clinical evaluation. The main focus of research has been on two drug classes: the first is comprised of agents that bind reversibly with tubulin and prevent microtubule assembly; the second are the flavanoids, which can induce intratumor cytokine release. Data from phase I studies have established that these agents can selectively reduce tumor blood flow at well-tolerated doses. Preclinical data indicate that VDAs can improve the tumor response to cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation and antiangiogenic treatments. This activity has been attributed to the ability of these agents to selectively destroy the central regions of tumors, areas widely believed to contain cell populations resistant to cytotoxic therapies. The VDA compounds combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) and 5,6-dimethylxantlenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) are being evaluated in phase II clinical trials in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapies for the potential treatment of cancer. This review discusses the small-molecule VDAs in clinical development. In addition, the potential for combination therapy with VDAs and traditional anticancer therapies, such as radiation, chemotherapy and anti-angiogenics is described."

CD005139,0,17702534,0,Targeting vascular endothelial growth factor: a promising strategy for treating age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible visual loss in the industrialised world. While treatment options for advanced AMD have been rather limited until recently, the introduction of intravitreal injections of anti-angiogenic agents appears to be a promising and revolutionary mode of treatment for this blinding disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appears to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of choroidal neovascularisation, one of the cornerstones of advanced AMD. Pegaptanib, the first anti-VEGF treatment approved for AMD patients, is a VEGF-neutralising aptamer that specifically inhibits one isoform of VEGF (VEGF-165). Although evidence suggested that pegaptanib was superior to previous treatment options, results with this agent were still unsatisfactory. Ranibizumab is a humanised anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody fragment that inhibits all isotypes of VEGF. This new drug has demonstrated a high efficacy profile in terms of inhibiting disease progression and even improving visual acuity. Bevacizumab is a full-length anti-VEGF antibody that was originally approved for use in metastatic colon cancer and is under investigation as a low-cost off-label alternative for patients with AMD. There is growing evidence that this drug may be an effective and safe alternative to the more expensive ranibizumab, although prospective multicentre trials are required to fully investigate this issue. Undoubtedly, the concept of directly injecting anti-VEGF drugs into the vitreal cavity brings new hope to many AMD patients."

CD005139,0,26196302,0,Significance of the antiangiogenic mechanisms of thalidomide in the therapy of diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy is an ocular complication associated with the chronic endocrine disorder of diabetes mellitus. Angiogenesis is adjudged as a prime modulatory event in this complication. The formation of new blood vessels on the pre-existing vasculature gives rise to an abundance of anatomical and physiological alterations which ultimately results in vision loss. The drastic consequences of this complication prompt the obligation of developing effective therapies for its cure. The existing therapy mainly includes destructive techniques such as laser photocoagulation. Owing to the various drawbacks associated with this technique, there is a need to develop alternative therapies which could halt the progression of diabetic retinopathy without causing considerable damage to the retinal cells. One such possible alternative treatment being researched upon is the antiangiogenic therapy. Since angiogenesis is a critical event during the progression of this disorder, targeting this event may perhaps prove effective in its treatment. Amongst several antiangiogenic agents, thalidomide holds a reputable position due to its effectiveness in terminating angiogenesis during various pathological conditions. This review focuses on the diverse molecular mechanisms proposed to explain the antiangiogenic properties of thalidomide and their applicability in diabetic retinopathy."

The present study was undertaken to determine mechanisms through which pazopanib, a drug that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases such as VEGF receptors, inhibits angiogenesis and experimental choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Pazopanib inhibited VEGF expression by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and choroidal endothelial cells (CEC), decreased VEGF-induced cellular migration in a dose-dependent manner and suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/-2 phosphorylation. To assess the impact of pazopanib in vivo, CNV was induced in rats by rupturing the Bruch's membrane by laser coagulation. These experiments demonstrated that twice-daily topical eye drop treatment significantly (P<0.001) decreased leakage from photocoagulated lesions by 89.5%. Furthermore, the thickness of the developed CNV lesions was significantly inhibited by 71.7% (P<0.001) in pazopanib-treated eyes, and immunoreactivity of VEGF was lower than in control eyes. Our data suggest that pazopanib is a promising inhibitor of angiogenesis leading to an effective inhibition of CNV development in vivo. This activity can be largely ascribed to the down-regulation of VEGF release in the retina as well as to impaired VEGF-induced signaling and chemotaxis. Using a convenient topical dosing regimen, pazopanib may prove useful for treating a variety of ocular neovascular diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration."

This form of AMD is characterized by the growth of unwanted new blood vessels into the macula (angiogenesis). The aqueous solution containing pegaptanib is injected into the vitreous of the eye, where it binds to the 165 amino acid isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a secreted protein that is thought to play a major role in the pathologic angiogenesis that occurs in wet AMD. Neovascular AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over age 60 in the United States and other industrialized countries (1). Pegaptanib acts as a selective VEGF antagonist through its molecular structure as an aptamer, a pegylated modified oligonucleotide that adopts a three-dimensional configuration, enabling it to bind to extracellular VEGF (Fig. 1). Aptamers are macromolecules composed of chemically synthesized single-stranded nucleic acids (either RNA or DNA) that bind with a high degree of selectivity and affinity when exposed to target proteins. Pegaptanib binds VEGF165, and bound VEGF165 is not able to bind to the VEGF receptor, thereby negating its ability to cause angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Other aptamers exist, as do other forms of treatment for AMD. To date, however, no treatment for AMD has allowed for better vision after treatment, with most surgical treatments leading to almost immediate loss of some vision in the expectation of preventing more severe loss. Research in the field of macular degeneration is advancing rapidly, and treatment with an aptamer such as pegaptanib is a viable option despite the possibility of adverse events."

CD005139,0,22515701,0,Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drug treatment of diabetic macular edema: the evolution continues.,"Diabetic mellitus is the leading cause of blindness in working aged patients in developing nations. Due to the buildup of abnormal metabolites from several overactive biochemical pathways, chronic hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress in the retina which upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Together with other growth factors and metabolites, VEGF causes endothelial cell proliferation, vasodilation, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and increased vascular permeability, leading to breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. This allows trans-cellular exudation into the interstitial space resulting in diabetic macular edema (DME). For over 3 decades the standard treatment for DME has been laser photocoagulation. Though laser reduces the incidence of vision loss by 50%, few eyes with diffuse edema experience improved vision. This has led physicians to use the VEGF-binding drugs pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and aflibercept, each of which has been approved for the treatment of exudative macular degeneration, and bevacizumab which is commonly used off-label for a variety of chorioretinal disorders. Intravitreal administration of each drug frequently causes rapid improvement of DME with sustained improvement in vision through 2 years. Though these drugs significantly outperform laser photocoagulation over treatment periods of 1 year of less, the advantages appear to lessen when trials approach 2 years. Further studies to better determine relative efficacies of anti-VEGF drugs and laser photocoagulation are continuing."

CD005139,0,20868767,0,"Dietary hyperglycemia, glycemic index and metabolic retinal diseases.","The glycemic index (GI) indicates how fast blood glucose is raised after consuming a carbohydrate-containing food. Human metabolic studies indicate that GI is related to patho-physiological responses after meals. Compared with a low-GI meal, a high-GI meal is characterized with hyperglycemia during the early postprandial stage (0-2h) and a compensatory hyperlipidemia associated with counter-regulatory hormone responses during late postprandial stage (4-6h). Over the past three decades, several human health disorders have been related to GI. The strongest relationship suggests that consuming low-GI foods prevents diabetic complications. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes. In this aspect, GI appears to be useful as a practical guideline to help diabetic people choose foods. Abundant epidemiological evidence also indicates positive associations between GI and risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and more recently, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in people without diabetes. Although data from randomized controlled intervention trials are scanty, these observations are strongly supported by evolving molecular mechanisms which explain the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia. This wide range of evidence implies that dietary hyperglycemia is etiologically related to human aging and diseases, including DR and AMD. In this context, these diseases can be considered as metabolic retinal diseases. Molecular theories that explain hyperglycemic pathogenesis involve a mitochondria-associated pathway and four glycolysis-associated pathways, including advanced glycation end products formation, protein kinase C activation, polyol pathway, and hexosamine pathway. While the four glycolysis-associated pathways appear to be universal for both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, the mitochondria-associated mechanism appears to be most relevant to the hyperglycemic, normoxic pathogenesis. For diseases that affect tissues with highly active metabolism and that frequently face challenge from low oxygen tension, such as retina in which metabolism is determined by both glucose and oxygen homeostases, these theories appear to be insufficient. Several lines of evidence indicate that the retina is particularly vulnerable when hypoxia coincides with hyperglycemia. We propose a novel hyperglycemic, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, to complement the current theories regarding hyperglycemic pathogenesis. HIF is a transcription complex that responds to decrease oxygen in the cellular environment. In addition to playing a significant role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, under hyperglycemia HIF has been shown to increase the expression of HIF-inducible genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leading to angiogenesis. To this extent, we suggest that HIF can also be described as a hyperglycemia-inducible factor. In summary, while management of dietary GI appears to be an effective intervention for the prevention of metabolic diseases, specifically AMD and DR, more interventional data is needed to evaluate the efficacy of GI management. There is an urgent need to develop reliable biomarkers of exposure, surrogate endpoints, as well as susceptibility for GI. These insights would also be helpful in deciphering the detailed hyperglycemia-related biochemical mechanisms for the development of new therapeutic agents."

At baseline each patient underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including best-corrected visual acuity assessment (BCVA ETDRS chart), fluorescein, and indocyanine green angiography and OCT.ResultsEach group included 36 eyes. After 1 year the PRN group showed BCVA stabilization (63 vs 60 letters, P=0.33), whereas fixed regimen group showed significant BCVA improvement (68 vs 71, P=0.008). The median central retinal thickness decreased by 94 μm in the PRN (P=0.002) and by 148 μm in the fixed regimen group (P≤0.001). Complete IRF/SRF reabsorption was found in 58% of eyes in the PRN and in 42% of eyes in the fixed regimen group. At 1-year visit, the percentage of eyes with pigment epithelium detachment did not significantly decrease, but a height reduction was recorded in both groups. The median number of IVA was 3.5 in the PRN and 7 in the fixed regimen group.ConclusionThe switch to aflibercept with both treatment strategies enabled improvement in morphological parameters and stabilization of visual acuity.

There have been a variety of approaches to the treatment of macular edema; within the past few years, however, intravitreal corticosteroid treatments have emerged as an increasingly used treatment option for patients with macular edema. Intravitreal delivery allows the steroid to bypass the blood-retinal barrier, leading to a more concentrated dose of steroid for a prolonged period of time. Corticosteroids have likely been successful in the treatment of various forms of macular edema, due to their known anti-angiogenic, anti-edematous, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative effects. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide has been repeatedly successful in reducing macular edema and improving visual acuity, although the duration of action is typically short-term. Due to the recurrent and chronic nature of macular edema, biodegradable implants may be the future of intravitreal steroids. Intravitreal corticosteroids are not without risks.

Following treatment with 1.25 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab, reduction in macular leakage was shown by fluorescein angiography and resolution of edema was shown by optical coherence tomography (OCT); however, visual acuity deteriorated and fluorescein angiograms demonstrated progressive enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), which had shown no abnormalities before the injection. Despite normalisation of macular thickness on OCT and cessation of leakage on angiography, visual acuity remained at the same level until 6 months of follow-up. Intravitreal bevacizumab must be used with caution in patients with chronic, persistent diabetic macular edema. Disruption of the fragile fine foveal network of capillaries with induction of macular ischemia may result following treatment even if there are no pre-existing defects in the FAZ and may be responsible for non-improvement or decrease in visual acuity."

Bevacizumab for neovascular age related macular degeneration (ABC trial): multicentre randomised double masked study. BMJ 340, c2459 (2010). The ABC trial is the first multicenter, randomized clinical trial that addresses the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab (Avastin(®), Genentech, Inc., CA, USA) in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The trial showed that an initial loading dose of three intravitreal injections of Avastin 1.25 mg at 6-week intervals, followed by a 6-weekly variable retreatment regimen, according to strict functional and anatomic criteria for up to 1 year, is safe and effective. The results are in line with those reported previously in the pivotal ranibizumab (Lucentis(®), Genentech, Inc.) trials following monthly intravitreal injections. The trial also exemplifies the paradigm shift in primary end point selection and patient expectation that the arrival of anti-VEGF agents, such as Lucentis and Avastin, has allowed for. Instead of visual stabilization and retardation of visual loss, patients and physicians now expect visual improvement following treatment. Such expectation was almost unrealistic prior to the availability of these agents."

Anti-VEGF treatment such as ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept improved vision by 13.9-16.2 letters (best-corrected visual acuity) after 12 months versus baseline in patients with macular edema secondary to CRVO. A long-term study showed that reduced follow-up and fewer retreatments resulted in worsening visual acuity. Intravitreal therapy with anti-inflammatory agents stabilized visual acuity in CRVO. However, increased intraocular pressure and cataract progression were frequently observed. Anti-VEGF agents such as ranibizumab or bevacizumab improved visual acuity by 15.5-18.3 letters in patients with macular edema secondary to BRVO after 12 months. The improved vision remained during the long-term follow-up. There was no significant difference between standard care and intravitreal triamcinolone groups in BRVO, and increased intraocular pressure and cataract progression occurred frequently in the triamcinolone group. Anti-VEGF intravitreal administration resulted in good vision in CRVO and BRVO patients and is employed as a primary therapy. Anti-VEGF therapy requires frequent observations and intravitreal injections to maintain good vision."
CD005139,0,21305729,0,Intravitreal bevacizumab with or without triamcinolone for refractory diabetic macular oedema.,"We evaluate the effect of intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab (IVB) alone or combined with triamcinolone (IVT) in the first injection for treatment of refractory diabetic macular oedema (DME). Sixty eyes of sixty patients with refractory DME were included. Half of the receive injections of IVB (1.25 mg/0.05 mL) or combined IVB and IVT (1.25 mg/0.05 mL and 2 mg/0.05 mL respectively). The primary outcome measure was change in central macular thickness (CMT). Secondary outcome measures were change in best-corrected logMAR visual acuity (BCVA) and incidence of potential adverse events. Central macular thickness was reduced significantly in both the IVB and IVB/IVT groups. At week 24, CMT change compared to the baseline was -95.7 microm (95% CI, -172.2 to -19.26) in the IVB group and -92.1 pm (95% CI, -154.4 to -29.7) in the IVB/IVT group. There was not a significant difference between the IVB and the IVB/IVT groups (p = 0.022). Improvement of BCVA was initiated at weeks 6 and 12 in the IVB/IVT and IVB groups respectively. In terms of BCVA change compared to the baseline at 24 weeks, the differences between the IVB and the IVB/IVT groups (p = 0.006) were significant. Anterior Chamber reaction was noticed in six (20%) and six (20%) eyes respectively in the IVB and IVB/IVT groups the day after injection, and it resolved with no sequel. Elevation of IOP occurred in two eyes (6%) in the IVB/ IVT group. Intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab had a beneficial effect on refractory DME in terms of CMT reduction and BCVA improvement. Addition of triamcinolone in the injection seemed to induce earlier visual improvement; however, it did not show any significant additive effect later during follow-up."
CD005139,0,27928964,0,Hot Topics in Pharmacogenetics of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible visual loss and is primarily treated with nutritional supplementation as well as with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for certain patients with neovascular disease. AMD is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors. In addition, treatment outcomes from nutritional supplementation and anti-VEGF agents vary considerably. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that there may be pharmacogenetic influences on these treatments. Many series have reported individual associations with variants in complement factor H (CFH), age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2), and other loci. However, at this time there are no validated associations. With respect to AMD, pharmacogenetics remains an intriguing area of research but is not helpful for routine clinical management."

Vision improves spontaneously within 3 to 6 months in about 50% of cases. There are no drugs with proven benefits in this setting. In addition to its indications in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular oedema, ranibizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, has now been approved in the European Union for the treatment of visual impairment associated with macular oedema due to retinal vein occlusion. In this setting, clinical evaluation of ranibizumab (Lucentis, Novartis) is based on two double-blind randomised trials comparing ranibizumab (0.3 mg or 0.5 mg) versus placebo in a total of 795 patients. Compared with placebo, about 30% more patients receiving ranibizumab (0.3 mg or 0.5 mg) experienced a tangible improvement in their visual acuity (gain of at least 15 letters on the ETDRS scale) after 6 months of treatment. Efficacy was similar in patients with central retinal vein occlusion and those with occlusion of a peripheral branch. All patients received ranibizumab after the initial 6-month period; the lack of a placebo group means that the long-term effects of ranibizumab cannot be distinguished from spontaneous improvement. There were too few cases of ischaemic occlusion to assess the efficacy of ranibizumab in this subgroup of patients, who are most in need of treatment. The adverse effects of ranibizumab were the same as those observed in other clinical situations. They mainly consisted of ocular adverse reactions, such as haemorrhage, pain, and elevated intraocular pressure. Uncertainties persist as to the long-term risk of recurrent occlusion or progression to retinal ischaemia. The frequency of systemic adverse events was similar in the ranibizumab and placebo groups. The incidence of heart failure and transient ischaemic attacks was higher during the second year of ranibizumab therapy than during the first year of treatment. The packaging (bottles) available in early 2012 creates a risk of handling errors, and improvements are needed to prevent these errors. Monthly ranibizumab administration is expensive. In practice, the decision to grant marketing authorisation for ranibizumab in macular oedema due to retinal vein occlusion was premature. Ranibizumab is one option that should be assessed in clinical trials. Patients should be informed of the potential adverse effects and uncertainties and be reminded that this condition improves spontaneously in about 50% of cases."

OIR was induced by exposing mice to 75±2% O2 for five days, followed by exposure to room air for a further five days. Animals in groups 3-6 (the OIR + vehicle control group and OIR + rhEPO 10 IU, 50 IU, and 100 IU groups) received an intraperitoneal injection of saline, or rhEPO 10 IU, 50 IU and 100 IU, respectively, which were administered daily from P7-P12.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). RNV occurred in the OIR groups and was accompanied by dilated, twisted and occluded blood vessels. rhEPO treatment resulted in an increase in the number of newly formed and severely dilated vessels. rhEPO increased RNV in a dose-dependent manner, which was accompanied by an increase in the messenger RNA and protein expression of VEGF, eNOS and nNOS.

CD005139,0,26113211,0,Molecular pathogenesis of retinal and choroidal vascular diseases.,"There are two major types of ocular neovascularization that affect the retina, retinal neovascularization (NV) and subretinal or choroidal NV. Retinal NV occurs in a group of diseases referred to as ischemic retinopathies in which damage to retinal vessels results in retinal ischemia. Most prevalent of these are diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusions. Subretinal and choroidal NV occur in diseases of the outer retina and Bruch's membrane, the most prevalent of which is age-related macular degeneration. Numerous studies in mouse models have helped to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis underlying retinal, subretinal, and choroidal NV. There is considerable overlap because the precipitating event in each is stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) which leads to upregulation of several hypoxia-regulated gene products, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin 2, vascular endothelial-protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP), and several others. Stimulation of VEGF signaling and suppression of Tie2 by angiopoietin 2 and VE-PTP are critical for sprouting of retinal, subretinal, and choroidal NV, with perturbation of Bruch's membrane also needed for the latter. Additional HIF-1-regulated gene products cause further stimulation of the NV. It is difficult to model macular edema in animals and therefore proof-of-concept clinical trials were done and demonstrated that VEGF plays a central role and that suppression of Tie2 is also important. Neutralization of VEGF is currently the first line therapy for all of the above disease processes, but new treatments directed at some of the other molecular targets, particularly stabilization of Tie2, are likely to provide additional benefit for subretinal/choroidal NV and macular edema. In addition, the chronicity of these diseases as well as the implication of VEGF as a cause of retinal nonperfusion and progression of background diabetic retinopathy make sustained delivery approaches for VEGF antagonists a priority."

While there are no treatments for early-stage AMD, there are multiple modalities of treatment for advanced disease. Given the increasing prevalence of the disease, there are dozens of analyses of cost effectiveness of AMD treatments, but methods and approaches vary broadly. The goal of this review was to identify, characterize, and critique published models in AMD and provide guidance for their interpretation. After a literature review was performed to identify studies, and exclusion criteria applied to limit the review to studies comparing treatments for AMD, we compared methods across the 36 studies meeting the review criteria. To some extent, variation was related to targeting different audiences or acknowledging the most appropriate population for a given treatment. However, the review identified potential areas of uncertainty and difficulty in interpretation, particularly regarding duration of observation periods and the importance of visual acuity as an endpoint or a proxy for patient-reported utilities. We urge thoughtful consideration of these study characteristics when comparing results."

CD005139,0,21052933,0,How to overcome retinal neuropathy: the fight against angiogenesis-related blindness.,"The retina consists of neuronal cells of high metabolic activity that are supplied by an abundant vasculature. It is a main theme of ophthalmologic research, because retinopathies are common causes of blindness in all age groups: age-related macular degeneration in the elderly, diabetic retinopathy in the middle aged, and retinopathy of prematurity and retinoblastoma in children. Interestingly, angiogenesis underlies the pathogenesis of all these diseases, and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier is also thought to play an important role before and throughout the process of new vessel formation. However, so far, most treatments have targeted angiogenesis only, especially vascular endothelial growth factor. Consideration of the restoration of the blood-retinal barrier should be required. In this review, we discuss the clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, and current treatment options for angiogenesis-related blindness. In addition, because of the recent introduction of novel strategies, we describe pathogenesis-based treatment options to treat angiogenesis-related blindness."

CD005139,0,25468789,0,Bruch's membrane diffusivity for vascular endothelial growth factors may explain variable response to wet age-related macular degeneration treatment: clinical implications.,"The hypothesis presented is that diffusivity of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) across Bruch's membrane is an important parameter that distinguishes prompt and slow responders to anti-VEGF treatment in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Accordingly, slow-responders have a high diffusivity and will attain peak VEGF levels on the choroidal side of Bruch's membrane rapidly, probably before or around the time of the next monthly anti-VEGF injection. If a fixed dose of anti-VEGF is used at each monthly treatment (as is the current practice), depending on the initial level of VEGF at that time of injection, VEGF with each treatment will vary. Therefore, diffusion will occur at a different concentration gradient in each treatment cycle subsequent to the injection. Hence, by Fick's Second Law of Diffusion, the slope of the concentration versus time curve for each treatment cycle will be different from the preceding cycle. This leads to a different peak concentration just prior to the next monthly injection. So, when a fixed dose of the anti-VEGF is used at each monthly treatment peak VEGF level fluctuates instead of going down continuously which prolongs the treatment. Thus, doses of anti-VEGF may have to be tapered to decrease the concentration gradient and to slow down the rate of diffusion of VEGF. Diffusivity of Bruch's membrane with regards to VEGF is a simple concept that can explain the variable response to anti-VEGF treatment in wet AMD. If validated through clinical trial the treatment protocol for wet AMD can be more precise and tailored to individual patients."

Diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) are considered the most sight-threatening ocular complications in these patients. Pivotal studies, such as the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) and the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS), have established macular and pan-retinal laser as the gold-standard of treatment for these complications. The recent discovery of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its role in the development of proliferative disease, has led to a movement towards treating PDR and DME with anti-angiogenic medications alone or in conjunction with the gold-standard of care. Due to the severity of the diabetic ocular complications and the rising incidence of diabetes worldwide, it is important for the non-ophthalmologist care provider to be informed of the new treatments available for these conditions in an effort to better guide their patients.

CD005139,0,20703031,0,Antivascular endothelial growth factor in diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) represent the most common causes of vision loss in patients affected by diabetes mellitus. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) needs special attention because of its high public health impact and impact on quality of life of patients. Actually, laser retinal photocoagulation is the standard of care for the treatment of DR. However, laser treatment reduces the risk of moderate visual loss by approximately 50%, without a remarkable vision recovery. Thus, new approaches in the treatment of DR have been taken into account and, more specifically, the therapy employing antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs could play a meaningful role. VEGF is a pluripotent growth factor that functions as an endothelial cell-specific mitogen and vasopermeability factor. Through these mechanisms VEGF plays a critical role in promoting angiogenesis and vascular leakage. A high level of VEGF has been detected in eyes presenting DME and PDR, and thereby VEGF is an attractive candidate as therapeutic target of pharmacological treatment in the management of DR. In the current chapter, the concepts and results of anti-VEGF therapy in the treatment of the DME and PDR are presented."

CD005139,0,21470108,0,Systemic adverse drug reactions secondary to anti-VEGF intravitreal injection in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"The wet form of age related macular degeneration (AMD), known also as exudative or neovascular, is characterized by the formation of a pathological choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) responsible for most cases of severe blindness. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a homodimeric glycoprotein acting as a growth factor selective for endothelial cells; it regulates angiogenesis and enhances vascular permeability and plays a leading role in this disorder. The consistent association between CNV and increased VEGF-A expression provides a strong reason for exploring the therapeutic potential of anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of neovascular AMD. The importance of VEGF for the development of AMD-related CNV has led to the development of a strategy able to block its pathologic effects. The rationale is that a blockade of VEGF actions could be effective in arresting choroidal angiogenesis and also reducing the vascular permeability, which is frequently the main cause of visual acuity deterioration. However, VEGF has also important functions in vascular physiology. The effects of anti-VEGF therapy may inhibit these functions. Herein we report the systemic adverse events secondary to intravitreal administration of these compounds i.e. the main cardiovascular effects (thrombosis, hemorrhage, hypertension, proteinuria), as well as the less frequent cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis."

CD005139,0,19173161,0,[Macular translocation - a therapeutic approach for neovascular macular degeneration in the era of anti-VEGF therapy?].,"Since anti-VEGF treatment has been proven to achieve a significant improvement of visual acuity in a cohort of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular surgery and particularly the macular translocation with 360 degrees retinotomy (FMT: full macular translocation) have lost their former popularity. However, the approach of macular surgery still remains a promising therapy in selected cases. A prospective randomised study, comparing FMT and photodynamic therapy in subfoveal classic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), recently showed the superiority of FMT in terms of visual gain. In spite of the postoperative complications and the disturbed binocular vision, the reading acuity and the life quality of many patients improved. Therefore, it is justified to discuss the chances and advantages of the FMT at least in selected cases. After all, case selection was an important determinant also in the phase III studies of ranibizumab; many patients seen during the routine consulting hours were excluded as a consequence of the study criteria. Most of them were suspected to achieve a less favourable outcome of the anti-VEGF regimen. Thus, patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria of recent studies or showed no response to the anti-VEGF therapy, as well as patients with extensive submacular bleeding or ruptures of the pigment epithelium can also be considered as candidates of FMT. Generally, in the presence of highly effective anti-VEGF drugs, FMT can be discussed for second-line treatment, if the fellow eye has poor function and no additional risk factors of the affected eye are known (e. g., hyperopia, large lesion size, etc). Detailed information relating to the potential adverse events have to be mentioned. Although the indication is restricted, surgeons should have the continuing ability to perform the challenging surgical procedure."
CD005139,0,28366840,0,Role of altered coagulation-fibrinolytic system in the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy.,"The implications of altered coagulation-fibrinolytic system in the pathophysiology of several vascular disorders, such as stroke and myocardial infarction, have been well researched upon and established. However, its role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy has not been explored much. Since a decade, it is known that hyperglycemia is associated with a hypercoagulated state and the various impairments it causes are well acknowledged as independent risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases. But recent studies suggest that the hypercoagulative state and diminished fibrinolytic responses might also alter retinal homeostasis and induce several deleterious molecular changes in retinal cells which aggravate the already existing hyperglycemia-induced pathological conditions and thereby lead to the progression of diabetic retinopathy. The major mediators of coagulation-fibrinolytic system whose concentration or activity get altered during hyperglycemia include fibrinogen, antithrombin-III (AT-III), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Inhibiting the pathways by which these altered mediators get involved in the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy can serve as potential targets for the development of an adjuvant novel alternative therapy for diabetic retinopathy."

Patients with DME followed at least 6 months were reviewed. Baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT) and final BCVA, CRT in eyes with and without VMIA were compared. Multiple logistic regression was also used to investigate the risk factors of VMIA formation in patients with DME treated by anti-VEGF.ResultsA total of 201 eyes in 142 patients met the inclusion criteria of the study. VMIA developed in 44 eyes (21.89%) of patients during a mean follow-up period of 40.84 months. The estimated mean incidence of VMIA formation was 6.43% per year. Poor baseline BCVA was found to be a risk factor for VMIA development (P=0.001, odds ratio=5.299, 95% confidence interval: 1.972 to 14.238). There was no difference between eyes with and without VMIA formation in improving BCVA (P=0.557) and lowering the macular edema (eyes without VMIA formation: -107.72±171.91 μm; eyes with VMIA formation: -155.02±212.27 μm, P=0.133).ConclusionsThis study revealed the incidence of VMIA formation in IVI anti-VEGF treated DME eyes was 6.43%.

CD005139,0,18594512,0,Blocking VEGFR-3 suppresses angiogenic sprouting and vascular network formation.,"Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is a key process in several pathological conditions, including tumour growth and age-related macular degeneration. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) stimulate angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by activating VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinases in endothelial cells. VEGFR-3 (also known as FLT-4) is present in all endothelia during development, and in the adult it becomes restricted to the lymphatic endothelium. However, VEGFR-3 is upregulated in the microvasculature of tumours and wounds. Here we demonstrate that VEGFR-3 is highly expressed in angiogenic sprouts, and genetic targeting of VEGFR-3 or blocking of VEGFR-3 signalling with monoclonal antibodies results in decreased sprouting, vascular density, vessel branching and endothelial cell proliferation in mouse angiogenesis models. Stimulation of VEGFR-3 augmented VEGF-induced angiogenesis and sustained angiogenesis even in the presence of VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR or FLK-1) inhibitors, whereas antibodies against VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 in combination resulted in additive inhibition of angiogenesis and tumour growth. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological disruption of the Notch signalling pathway led to widespread endothelial VEGFR-3 expression and excessive sprouting, which was inhibited by blocking VEGFR-3 signals. Our results implicate VEGFR-3 as a regulator of vascular network formation. Targeting VEGFR-3 may provide additional efficacy for anti-angiogenic therapies, especially towards vessels that are resistant to VEGF or VEGFR-2 inhibitors."

Pegaptanib, which binds to VEGF165 and longer isoforms, ranibizumab and bevacizumab, which bind all VEGF-A isoforms, and aflibercept, which binds VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factor, all bind VEGF165 with high affinity. The drugs have relatively long half-lives (7 to 10 days) after intravitreal depot injections and clinical durations of action that usually exceed 4 weeks. Plasma VEGF concentrations decrease after intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and aflibercept because their systemic half-lives are extended by their Fc fragments. Extensive in vitro and in vivo testing shows that the drugs prevent VEGF-mediated activation of endothelial cells while exhibiting little evidence of toxicity. Further anti-VEGF drug development is on-going."

CD005139,0,26088137,0,Deep Sequencing-guided Design of a High Affinity Dual Specificity Antibody to Target Two Angiogenic Factors in Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration.,"The development of dual targeting antibodies promises therapies with improved efficacy over mono-specific antibodies. Here, we engineered a Two-in-One VEGF/angiopoietin 2 antibody with dual action Fab (DAF) as a potential therapeutic for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Crystal structures of the VEGF/angiopoietin 2 DAF in complex with its two antigens showed highly overlapping binding sites. To achieve sufficient affinity of the DAF to block both angiogenic factors, we turned to deep mutational scanning in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). By mutating all three CDRs of each antibody chain simultaneously, we were able not only to identify affinity improving single mutations but also mutation pairs from different CDRs that synergistically improve both binding functions. Furthermore, insights into the cooperativity between mutations allowed us to identify fold-stabilizing mutations in the CDRs. The data obtained from deep mutational scanning reveal that the majority of the 52 CDR residues are utilized differently for the two antigen binding function and permit, for the first time, the engineering of several DAF variants with sub-nanomolar affinity against two structurally unrelated antigens. The improved variants show similar blocking activity of receptor binding as the high affinity mono-specific antibodies against these two proteins, demonstrating the feasibility of generating a dual specificity binding surface with comparable properties to individual high affinity mono-specific antibodies."

In four well designed, phase II or III trials (RESOLVE, RESTORE, RIDE and RISE), 1-2 years' treatment with ranibizumab was more effective than sham or focal/grid laser therapy in improving best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and reducing central retinal thickness (CRT) in patients with visual impairment associated with DME. Additionally, in two well designed phase III trials (RESTORE and DRCR.net-1), 1 year of treatment with ranibizumab as an adjunct to laser therapy was more effective than laser monotherapy in improving BCVA and CRT in patients with visual impairment associated with DME. Improvements in BCVA with ranibizumab alone or as an adjunct to laser therapy were observed at the first follow-up visits in these studies (i.e. 1-4 weeks after the start of treatment), and were associated with gains in vision-related quality of life, as assessed using the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25. The ocular and non-ocular adverse event profile of ranibizumab in patients with DME is similar to that observed in patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration or retinal vein occlusion. Based on tolerability data from clinical trials, there is no indication that ranibizumab alone or combined with laser is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events potentially related to systemic VEGF inhibition."

However, the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of retinal neovascular diseases has been limited due to the short half-life and frequent injections. In this research, novel amphiphilic hydrophilic-hydrophobic block copolymers of methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) were synthesized with ring-opening polymerization, and cross-linked with 2,2-bis (2-oxazoline) (BOX). The aqueous solution of the block copolymers can reverse the sol-gel-sol phase transition. After 1 month of intravitreal injection, the histomorphology of a rabbit's retina was preserved, which indicated the mPEG-PLGA-BOX hydrogel had no cytotoxicity in vivo. Released bevacizumab from the mPEG-PLGA-BOX hydrogel inhibited the RF/6A (Maraca mulatta retina epithelial cell) and HUVEC cell growth, and anti-angiogenesis in 3-D cultures, which showed the bioactivity of the anti-VEGF agent, were maintained in the hydrogel within the release process.

Recent advances have highlighted the essential role of inflammation in the development of the disease. In addition to local retinal chronic inflammatory response, systemic immune alterations have also been observed in AMD patients. In this study we investigated the association between the frequency of circulating leukocyte populations and the prevalence as well as clinical presentations of nAMD. Leukocyte subsets of 103 nAMD patients (most of them were receiving anti-VEGF therapy prior to enrolment) and 26 controls were analysed by flow cytometry by relative cell size, granularity and surface markers. Circulating CD11b(+) cells and CD16(hi)HLA-DR(-) neutrophils were significantly increased (P = 0.015 and 0.009 respectively) in nAMD when compared to controls. The percentage of circulating CD4(+) T-cells was reduced in nAMD patients without subretinal fibrosis (P = 0.026) compared to patients with subretinal fibrosis. There was no correlation between the percentage of circulating leukocytes and the responsiveness to anti-VEGF therapy in nAMD patients. Our results suggest that higher levels of circulating CD11b(+) cells and neutrophils are associated with nAMD and that reduced levels of CD4(+) T-cells are associated with the absence of subretinal fibrosis in nAMD."

We recorded logMAR visual acuities and central foveal thickness (CFT) at baseline and final review. Improvement in visual acuity was significantly improved (p = 0.049) by a mean of 0.24 logMAR (range 0 to 0.74). Every patient achieved at least visual stability. Mean CFT reduction was also significantly improved (p = 0.02) by a mean of 109 microns (range -8 to 198). Our series and current literature seem to support as primary treatment a standard dose of an anti-VEGF agent. Further, larger studies are required to clarify whether any particular injection strategy is clearly superior."

CD005139,0,15293867,0,AE 941.,"AE 941 [Arthrovas, Neoretna, Psovascar] is shark cartilage extract that inhibits angiogenesis. AE 941 acts by blocking the two main pathways that contribute to the process of angiogenesis, matrix metalloproteases and the vascular endothelial growth factor signalling pathway. When initial development of AE 941 was being conducted, AEterna assigned the various indications different trademarks. Neovastat was used for oncology, Psovascar was used for dermatology, Neoretna was used for ophthalmology and Arthrovas was used for rheumatology. However, it is unclear if these trademarks will be used in the future and AEterna appears to only be using the Neovastat trademark in its current publications regardless of the indication. AEterna Laboratories signed commercialisation agreements with Grupo Ferrer Internacional SA of Spain and Medac GmbH of Germany in February 2001. Under the terms of the agreement, AEterna has granted exclusive commercialisation and distribution rights to AE 941 in oncology to Grupo Ferrer Internacional for the Southern European countries of France, Belgium, Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy. It also has rights in Central and South America. Medac GmbH will have marketing rights in Germany, the UK, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands and Eastern Europe. In October 2002, AEterna Laboratories announced that it had signed an agreement with Australian healthcare products and services company Mayne Group for marketing AE 941 (as Neovastat) in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Mexico. In March 2003, AEterna Laboratories announced it has signed an agreement with Korean based LG Life Sciences Ltd for marketing AE 941 (as Neovastat) in South Korea. The agreement provides AEterna with upfront and milestone payments, as well as a return on manufacturing and sales of AE 941. AEterna Laboratories had granted Alcon Laboratories an exclusive worldwide licence for AE 941 for ophthalmic products. However, this licence has been terminated. In 1999, AEterna secured funding for AE 941, part of which is from Technology Partnerships Canada (TPC), a research support programme run by Canada's federal government. Industry Canada will contribute $Can 1 for every $Can3 spent by AEterna on the development of AE 941, up to a total figure of $Can29.4 million. AEterna will reimburse TPC upon commercialisation of AE 941-derived products as a royalty on income generated. In January 2004 AEterna announced that development of AE 941 would be focusing on non-small cell lung cancer and that development for renal cell carcinoma would be discontinued. AEterna had previously announced in January 2003, following its acquisition of Zentaris, that development of AE 941 would be ""strictly focused"" on renal and non-small cell lung cancer, suggesting that development for all other indications has been discontinued, at least for the foreseeable future."

CD005139,0,16083310,0,Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-induced retinal neovascularization by retinoic acid in experimental retinopathy of prematurity.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has an important role in the pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and inhibition of VEGF expression in the neovascular phase might prevent destructive neovascularization in ROP. It is suggested that retinoids exert a highly potent antiangiogenic activity by inhibiting VEGF expression. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the preventive effect of retinoic acid (RA) on the VEGF-induced retinal neovascularization in a rat model of ROP. Wistar albino rats were placed into incubators at birth and exposed to an atmosphere alternating between 50 % and 10 % O(2) every 24 hours. After 14 days, the animals were removed to room air and received either an intraperitoneal injection of RA (5 mg/kg/day) (n=9) or saline (n=4) daily for six days, and sacrificed at 21 days. Other rats (n=4) were raised in room air and served as age-matched controls. The globe of each eye was cut through the cornea and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for quantification of neovascular nuclei. The avidin-biotin peroxidase method was performed for evaluation of VEGF expression. The average number of neovascular nuclei was significantly lower in the control group compared to that in the ROP groups. In addition, it significantly decreased in the RA-treated ROP group compared to that of the saline-administrated ROP group. VEGF immunostaining was overall negative in room air-exposed rats. The VEGF immunostaining score significantly decreased in the RA-treated ROP group compared to that in the saline-administered ROP group. RA treatment might be beneficial in preventing neovascularization resulting from oxygen-induced retinopathy by downregulation of VEGF expression."

To prospectively evaluate the effect of intravitreal bevacizumab on aqueous levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and correlate clinical outcomes with cytokine levels. Methods. 30 eyes of 30 patients with exudative AMD underwent intravitreal injection of bevacizumab three times at monthly intervals. The aqueous samples prior to the 1st injection (baseline) and 3rd injection were analyzed for VEGF and IL-6 levels. Subjects were subgrouped based upon change in the central subfield (CSF) macular thickness on SD-OCT at 8 weeks. Group 1 included patients (n = 14) with a decrease in CSF thickness greater than 10% from the baseline (improved group). Group 2 included patients (n = 16) who had a decrease in CSF thickness 10% or less (treatment-resistant). Results. In subgroup analysis, in both groups 1 and 2 patients, compared to aqueous VEGF, aqueous IL-6 levels showed a better correlation with CSF thickness on SD-OCT (r = 0.72 and 0.71, resp.). Conclusions. Aqueous IL-6 may be an important marker of treatment response or resistance in wet macular degeneration. Future therapeutic strategies may include targeted treatment against both VEGF and IL-6, in patients who do not respond to anti-VEGF treatment alone."

CD005139,0,18220620,0,Intravitreal triamcinolone for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic macular edema is one of the leading causes of visual loss in first world countries and the first cause in diabetic retinopathy. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study showed a significant benefit in using focal laser photocoagulation for the treatment of macular edema, more specifically defined as clinically significant macular edema. Nevertheless, progressive visual loss is found in the 26% of patients with diabetic macular edema treated with photocoagulation. The failure of laser treatment and the destructive nature of the therapy has forced researchers to pursue new alternatives including vitrectomy with or without internal limiting membrane peels, the use of proteinkinase C inhibitors, intravitreal injections of antibodies that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor, somatostatin analog, or the intravitreal injection with corticosteroids. Triamcinolone acetonide is glucocoticosteroid with antiangiogenic and antiedematous properties. Publications evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravitreal injection of triamcinolone in the treatment of diabetic macular edema show varying outcomes with respect to the increases of visual acuity and decreases in foveal thickness. Despite this, intravitreal triamcinolone is a treatment that has evolved quickly and is considered increasingly useful."

CD005139,0,25935789,0,Diabetic Macular Edema: Pathophysiology and Novel Therapeutic Targets.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the major cause of vision loss in diabetic persons. Alteration of the blood-retinal barrier is the hallmark of this disease, characterized by pericyte loss and endothelial cell-cell junction breakdown. Recent animal and clinical studies strongly indicate that DME is an inflammatory disease. Multiple cytokines and chemokines are involved in the pathogenesis of DME, with multiple cellular involvement affecting the neurovascular unit. With the introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, the treatment of DME has been revolutionized, and the indication for laser therapy has been limited. However, the response to anti-VEGF drugs in DME is not as robust as in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and many patients with DME do not show complete resolution of fluid despite multiple intravitreal injections. Potential novel therapies targeting molecules other than VEGF and using new drug-delivery systems currently are being developed and evaluated in clinical trials."

CD005139,0,17107753,0,A potential therapeutic strategy for inhibition of corneal neovascularization with new anti-VEGF agents.,"The factors triggering corneal neovascularization involve various growth factors. The data supporting a causal role for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in corneal neovascularization are extensive. One possible strategy for treating corneal neovascularization is to inhibit VEGF activity by competitively binding VEGF with a specific neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody. The vireo-retinal service in the recent years enjoyed a high level of success in managing choroidal neovascularization using anti-VEGF strategies. Efficacy and tolerability have been demonstrated for drugs targeting VEGF. We herein hypothesize that topical application of new anti-VEGF agents such as pegaptanib, ranibizumab and bevacizumab are potentially useful for inhibiting corneal neovascularization and restoration of corneal clarity. Further investigations are needed to place these medical treatments alongside corneal neovascularization therapeutics."

CD005139,0,22517209,0,Intravitreal injection therapy in the treatment of noninfectious uveitis.,"Uveitis is responsible for 5-20% of legal blindness in the United States and in Europe. In noninfectious uveitis, the most frequent uveitic complication that endangers sight is cystoid macular edema. Clinical characteristics, inflammation grading and visual acuity determine the choice of the correct therapy for each patient. We can utilize drugs either alone or in combination using different dosages and routes of administration. Intravitreal injection directly into the vitreous cavity leads to rapid therapeutic drug concentration in the retinal tissue and reduces systemic side effects. Intravitreally injected triamcinolone acetonide is the most powerful drug for the treatment of cystoid macular edema related to intraocular inflammation, but it also causes the most frequent and serious side effects. Due to the numerous side effects associated with the use of corticosteroids, there is a need to identify other anti-inflammatory agents with a better safety profile. Recent studies have demonstrated that intravitreal immunosuppressant injections of methotrexate or anti-VEGF agents may lead to fewer intraocular side effects, but also have a lower therapeutic activity for the reduction of macular edema. At present, intraocular anti-TNF-α drugs do not show promising results. As regards nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, further data are necessary to fully understand their efficacy and potential side effects."

To compare visual outcomes and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography results following intravitreal ranibizumab treatment for early and mid-idiopathic choroidal neovascularization (ICNV). Methods. This retrospective, case-controlled study examined 44 patients with ICNV in one eye initially treated with intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg). Further intravitreal treatments were administered as necessary. Patients were divided into two groups according to disease duration, that is, ≤3 months or 3-6 months (early and mid-groups), and the data were compared. Results. All patients completed at least 12 months of follow-up. Significant differences were observed between the groups in best-corrected visual acuity and in central macular thickness (CMT) reduction at all five follow-up visits. At the last follow-up (12 months), 19 early group eyes (79.1%) and 10 mid group eyes (50.0%) had statistically significant visual gains of >15 early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) letters (χ (2) = 4.130, P = 0.042).

CD005139,0,24533641,0,Beta-lapachone inhibits pathological retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy via regulation of HIF-1α.,"Retinal neovascularization in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the most common cause of blindness for children. Despite evidence that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α -VEGF axis is associated with the pathogenesis of ROP, the inhibitors of HIF-1α have not been established as a therapeutic target in the control of ROP pathophysiology. We investigated the hypothesis that degradation of HIF-1α as a master regulator of angiogenesis in hypoxic condition, using β-lapachone, would confer protection against hypoxia-induced retinopathy without affecting physiological vascular development in mice with oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), an animal model of ROP. The effects of β-lapachone were examined after intraocular injection in mice with OIR. Intraocular administration of β-lapachone resulted in significant reduction in hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization without retinal toxicity or perturbation of developmental retinal angiogenesis. Our results demonstrate that HIF-1α-mediated VEGF expression in OIR is associated with pathological neovascularization, not physiological angiogenesis. Thus, strategies blocking HIF-1α in the developing eye in the pathological hypoxia could serve as a novel therapeutic target for ROP."

Subretinal injection was highly reproducible, and no drug-related adverse events were reported. Procedure-related adverse events were mild and self-resolving. Two phakic patients developed cataract and underwent cataract surgery. Four of the 6 patients responded better than the small control group in this study and historical controls in terms of maintaining vision and a relatively dry retina with zero ranibizumab retreatments per annum. Two patients required 1 ranibizumab injection over the 52-week follow-up period. rAAV.sFlt-1 gene therapy may prove to be a potential adjunct or alternative to conventional intravitreal injection for patients with wet AMD by providing extended delivery of a naturally occurring antiangiogenic protein."

CD005139,0,21137472,0,[Combined therapy in the exsudative age-related macular degeneration (photodynamic therapy and intravitreally-applied ranibizumab)].,"The choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the leading cause of blindness in industrial countries. CNV in age-related macular degeneration (AMRD) is dynamic, multifactor process, which cause wasn't revealed until now. It is obvious that in multifactorial disease no single treatment is optimal, and that the monotherapy can't cover all factors leading to the CVN development. The contemporary modern and variably effective treatment techniques have common characteristic--the treatment is very expensive and it is necessary to repeat it to obtain the treatment effect. The authors refer about 18 months lasting period of follow-up of the group of 25 patients (9 men and 16 women, average age was 68 years, range, 59-76 years of age) who underwent the photodynamic therapy followed by ranibizumab intravitreal injections due to an active CNV. Mostly classical membranes were diagnosed in 18 cases (72%), minimally classical membranes in 5 cases (20%) and occult CNV in 2 patients (8%). The average best corrected visual acuity before the treatment was 46 letters of EDTRS chart, and after the treatment it was 50 letters. From the total number of 25 patients, in 20 (80%) of them the stabilization or improvement (+/- 15 letters of EDTRS chart) was achieved, in two patients the improvement was better than 15 letters (8%). Three patients' visual acuity decreased by more than 15 letters (12%). On average, to stabilize the CNV (after the PDT), 3.16 applications of ranibizumab were needed."

CD005139,0,18481343,0,Rational design of highly active and selective ligands for the alpha5beta1 integrin receptor.,"The inhibition of integrin function is a major challenge in medicinal chemistry. Potent ligands are currently in different stages of clinical trials for the antiangiogenic therapy of cancer and age-related macula degeneration (AMD). The subtype alpha5beta1 has recently been drawn into the focus of research because of its genuine role in angiogenesis. In our previous work we could demonstrate that the lack of structural information about the receptor could be overcome by a homology model based on the X-ray structure of the alphavbeta3 integrin subtype and the sequence similarities between both receptors. In this work, we describe the rational design and synthesis of high affinity alpha5beta1 binders, and the optimisation of selectivity against alphavbeta3 by means of extensive SAR studies and docking experiments. A first series of compounds based on the tyrosine scaffold resulted in affinities in the low and even subnanomolar range and selectivities of 400-fold against alphavbeta3. The insights about the structure-activity relationship gained from tyrosine-based ligands could be successfully transferred to ligands that bear an aza-glycine scaffold to yield alpha5beta1 ligands with affinities of approximately 1 nm and selectivities that exceed 10(4)-fold. The ligands have already been successfully employed as selective alpha5beta1 ligands in biological research and might serve as lead structures for antiangiogenic cancer therapy."

One patient received photodynamic therapy (PDT) previously, and all patients received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. At baseline, only one AMD eye (4.8%) showed ORT, which appeared as round or ovoid hyporeflective spaces with hyperreflective borders. During the follow ups, ORT was identified in nine of 15 AMD eyes (60.0%) and one of six PCV eyes (16.7%). These new ORTs in 10 eyes were originated from the intraretinal fluid. Inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) were pulled down to form ""cynapsis"", separating each ORT. However, ORT in 3 eyes disappeared after intravitreal ranibizumab injections.

CD005139,0,17187150,0,[Treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration with antiangiogenic drugs].,"Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) remains a leading cause of blindness in the western world. Several clinical forms of the disease are recognized, whereas choroidal neovascularization (CNV) represents an important manifestation suitable for treatment. The treatment of CNV has been a major focus of research in the past decades, and the first evidence-based established therapy was laser photocoagulation, which reduces the risk of visual loss in extrafoveal lesions. In the late 90's photodynamic therapy has been established as an efficient method for the treatment of predominantly classic and occult CNV. Additional therapies such as macular translocation, submacular surgery, and indocyanine-mediated prothrombosis are currently under investigation in large-scale clinical trials. Molecular biology has recently provided a better comprehension of the pathogenesis of ARMD, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was recognized as key mediator in the angiogenesis of CNV-formation. Therefore, the pharmacological approach rose as a key research area to treat CNV. The first FDA-approved agent for CNV-therapy is aptamer pegaptanib sodium (Macugen), which inactivates the key angiogenic isoform VEGF165. Additional VEGF-blockers such as ranibizumab RhuFab V2 (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin) are under evaluation in major clinical studies. Impressive results of intravitreal bevacizumab were released recently. Moreover, the steroid-derived anecortave acetate as well as the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetate have been proposed as methods for treatment of wet-ARMD. This paper presents the rationale and principles of the pharmacologic antiangiogenic therapy for CNV in ARMD."
CD005139,0,27564719,0,Aflibercept in diabetic macular edema: evaluating efficacy as a primary and secondary therapeutic option.,"The recent results of Protocol T have illustrated the efficacy of aflibercept in the treatment of diabetic macular edema. It also demonstrated that in patients with poor vision (<6/12), aflibercept offers anatomical and visual advantages over ranibizumab and bevacizumab in the first 12 months of treament. At 2 years, the difference between the three drugs decreased with patients with a better baseline VA (69-78) showing a statistically insignificant advantage for ranibizumab compared with aflibercept.These results were achieved using a pro-re nata (PRN) protocol, which was not previously studied in large phase 3 trials, VIVID and VISTA, that chose to compare the 2.0 mg dose in a monthly and bimonthly regimen. In this review article, we analyzed earlier studies such as DAVINCI and VIVID and VISTA to determine which treatment strategy offers the best results; monthly, bimonthly, or PRN. We also studied the different doses for aflibercept used in DAVINCI to determine which is more effective the 0.5 mg dose or the 2.0 mg dose. In addition, we analyzed the recent data from protocol T with regards to visual and anatomic outcomes to try to determine whether these results concur with previous studies. Finally, we discuss the role of aflibercept as a potential alternative to any diabetic macular edema regimen regardless what the primary drug used is."

Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of DR that produces loss of central vision. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a major cause of visual loss in diabetic patients. In PDR, the growth of new vessels is thought to occur as a result of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release into the vitreous cavity as a response to ischemia. Furthermore, VEGF increases vessel permeability leading to deposition of proteins in the interstitium that facilitate the process of angiogenesis and macular edema. This review demonstrates multiple benefits of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) on DR including DME and PDR at 24 months of follow up. The results indicate that IVB injections may have a beneficial effect on macular thickness and visual acuity (VA) in diffuse diabetic macular edema. Therefore, in the future this new therapy could replace or complement focal/grid laser photocoagulation in DME. In PDR, this new option could be an adjuvant agent to pan-retina photocoagulation so that more selective therapy may be applied. In addition, we report a series of patients in which tractional retinal detachment developed or progressed after adjuvant preoperative IVB in severe PDR."

The number of 300 patients (390 eyes) with ocular fundus diseases including retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), choridal new vessel (CNV) received and cured in the hospital from February 2010 to February 2014 were given intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.5mg) with once per month and a total of 2-3 times. Results of patients' vision and fluorescence fundus angiography (FFA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) before and after treatment were compared and curative effects were evaluated. Vision of 349 eyes (89.49%) improved obviously with the average of more than 2 lines, patient's intraocular pressure (IOP) was normal and all indexes were clearly better; vision of 26 eyes (6.67%) was stable before the treatment and without any changes after the treatment, the situation of fundus got better without increased IOP; vision of 15 eyes (3.85%) decreased to some extent, and the symptoms eased slightly after symptomatic treatment. In the 1st day after intravitreal injection, best-corrected visual acuity increased to 0.239±0.175, best-corrected visual acuity in 1 m was 0.315±0.182, in 3m continuously climbed to 0.350±0.270, and in 6 m was 0.362±0.282. Compared with vision before injection, t value was t=3.184, t=7.213, t=9.274 and t=9.970 (P=0.002, P=0.000, P=0.000 and P=0.000) respectively, and all P were less than 0.01. Furthermore, the difference was significant if a=0.01, which could confirm that 1m best corrected visual acuity of patients after intravitreal injection improved clearly in combination with before injection and 3m and 6 m visions enhanced constantly after injection. To sum up, intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in treating ocular fundus disease improves patient's vision effectively, also relieves macula lutea, retinal edema and other symptoms obviously, and promotes the hemorrhage absorption of vitreous body and retina."

The aim of the current study was to determine whether PGC-1α is able to regulate angiogenesis in human retinal vascular endothelial cells (hRVECs) in vitro and in retinas in vivo. hRVECs treated with recombinant PGC-1α were incubated for 24 h and then placed into a normoxic (20% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) environment for a further 16 h. Following this, VEGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased. Cellular proliferation was enhanced by treatment with recombinant PGC-1α in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. At 24 h following recombinant PGC-1α treatment, hRVECs were plated into Matrigel-coated plates and cultured under normoxic (20% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for a further 24 h. Recombinant PGC-1α-treated cells were observed to form significantly greater numbers of tubes. In a C57BL/6J mouse model of ischemic retinopathy, mice received an intravitreal injection of recombinant PGC-1α, resulting in a significant increase in VEGF mRNA and protein levels in the retina. Retinal neovascular tufts and neovascular nuclei were investigated by angiographic and cross-sectional analysis and were observed to be significantly increased in the PGC-1α group compared with the control group. These results indicate that PGC-1α is able to induce angiogenesis in hRVECs and retinas, and suggests that PGC-1α is a potential anti-angiogenic target in retinal neovascularization."

As eotaxin studies are lacking in the human age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients, we sought to determine whether eotaxin-2 (CCL24) has any association with inflammatory processes that occur in CNV. CCL24 levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) after normalization to total serum protein and levels of ELISA were correlated to various risk factors in about 133 AMD patients and 80 healthy controls. The CCL24 levels were significantly higher in wet AMD patients as compared with dry AMD and normal controls. There was a significant difference when compared among wet AMD patients (i.e., minimally classic, predominantly classic, and occult). We also report significant difference in the CCL24 levels of Avastin-treated and untreated AMD patients. This study shows that CCL24 levels were found to be significantly increased in AMD patients despite Avastin treatment as compared with normal controls and those without Avastin, indicating that CCL24 may have an association with CNV and may be an important target to validate future therapeutic approaches in AMD in tandem with Avastin treatment."

CD005139,0,26501927,0,Evolving Knowledge in Pharmacologic Treatments of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Modern retinal drug therapy is a result of the recent challenges and breakthroughs in chemistry, physics, genetics, cell biology and biotechnologies. Specific pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug are of major importance and contribute to its ability to penetrate targeted ocular tissues in order to result in effective therapeutic concentrations. In addition, the drugs should maintain a prolonged time of activity and be safe with minimal local and systemic toxicity. The transporter vehicle or drug delivery system is crucial in order to enhance ocular tissue penetration and establish controlled drug release. Administration methods should be local, thereby reducing systemic side effects, and, ideally, treatment should be noninvasive. Within the group of so-called classic therapies, the use of pharmacologic treatments has become widespread for most severe retinal diseases. Thereby, ocular therapy of diseases like exudative age-related macular degeneration has improved markedly. Moreover, new metabolic pathways have been identified, new molecules have emerged, new synthesis technologies have been discovered, and new formulae conceived.

CD005139,0,24875598,0,"Hypoxia-mediated retinal neovascularization and vascular leakage in diabetic retina is suppressed by HIF-1α destabilization by SH-1242 and SH-1280, novel hsp90 inhibitors.","In diabetic retinopathy (DR), visual deterioration is related with retinal neovascularization and vascular hyperpermeability. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are currently utilized to suppress retinal neovascularization and macular edema (ME); however, there are still concerns on the widespread use of them because VEGF is a trophic factor for neuronal and endothelial cells in the retina. As an alternative treatment strategy for DR, it is logical to address hypoxia-related molecules to treat DR because the retina is in relative hypoxia as DR progresses. In this study, we demonstrate that destabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) by SH-1242 and SH-1280, novel heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) inhibitors, leads to suppression of hypoxia-mediated retinal neovascularization and vascular leakage in diabetic retina. In vitro experiments showed that these inhibitors inhibited hypoxia-induced upregulation of target genes of HIF-1α and further secretion of VEGF. Furthermore, these inhibitors effectively suppressed expression of target genes of HIF-1α including vegfa in the retina of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice. Interestingly, despite hsp90 inhibition, these inhibitors do not induce definite toxicity at the level of gene expression, cellular viability, and histologic integrity. We suggest that SH-1242 and SH-1280 can be utilized in the treatment of DR, as an alternative treatment of direct VEGF inhibition. Key message: SH-1242 and SH-1280 are novel hsp90 inhibitors similar to deguelin. HIF-1α destabilization by hsp90 inhibition leads to anti-angiogenic effects. Despite hsp90 inhibition, both inhibitors do not induce definite toxicity. HIF-1α modulation can be a safer therapeutic option than direct VEGF inhibition."

In this retrospective review, 24 studies published between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Reasons for switching included tachyphylaxis, health insurance coverage, cost issues, and nonresponse or inadequate response. Nine studies had data that could be used for comparison between studies. Median follow-up was 10.6 months (range: 4.2 months to 21.8 months). Mean baseline visual acuity (VA) ranged from 0.42 logMar to 0.94 logMar (standard deviation [SD] range: 0.05 logMar to 0.50 logMar) and mean VA on final follow-up ranged from 0.38 logMar to 0.78 logMar (SD range: 0.08 logMar to 0.50 logMar). Five of nine studies reported no statistically significant change in vision, and five of nine studies reported a statistically significant improvement in central retinal thickness. This review found that switching anti-VEGF did not confer significant improvement of VA, although it provided some anatomical improvement.

CD005139,0,28452992,0,Influence of baseline diabetic retinopathy status on initial anatomical response of intravitreal ranibizumab therapy for diabetic macular oedema.,"PurposeIntraocular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels increases with the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Response of diabetic macular oedema (DMO) to ranibizumab is driven by VEGF suppression. We hypothesised that the initial reduction of central macular thickness by ranibizumab should be maximum in severe diabetic retinopathy until the levels of VEGF decreases to the levels observed in eyes with mild retinopathy.MethodsConsecutive patients with centre-involving DMO (central subfield thickness (CSFT)>300 μm) who had three consecutive monthly ranibizumab injections followed by as needed therapy were included. Retinopathy status was graded as mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (G1), moderate to severe NPDR with no prior panretinal photocoagulation (G2), and treated PDR (G3).ResultsTwo hundred and thirty-nine eyes from 204 patients with a mean age of 64.9 years were included. The distribution was 31.4 G1, 32.2 G2, and 36.4% G3. Mean baseline CSFT for all eyes was 458.5±110.8 μm. Baseline CSFT for G1, G2, and G3, respectively, were 437.6±90.9, 472.3±109.8, and 464.7±124.9 μm (P=0.2155). Mean change in CSFT after three consecutive injections was 128.5±116.6 μm. The mean changes were 95.8±101.4 μm for G1, 137.2±112.9 μm for G2, and 148.9±126.9 μm for G3. The changes in CSFT between groups adjusted for baseline CSFT were statistically significant (P=0.0473). At 6 and 12 months after a mean of 4.5 and 7.7 injections, the changes between groups were no longer significant, P=0.4783 and P=0.8271, respectively.ConclusionsThe initial anatomical response of DMO with intravitreal ranibizumab injections was maximum in eyes with treated PDR, suggesting that the higher the VEGF levels, the better the response with ranibizumab."

Mean central retinal thickness (CRT) decreased from 311 μm at baseline to 211 μm at month 11 (P<0.0001). Our mean VA gain of eight ETDRS letters was comparable to the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 Trials' results at the end of year 1. After loading at month 5, mean BCVA was 0.48 (P<0.0001), and mean CRT was 235 μm. At month 5, 143 eyes (56%) were inactive defined by the absence of macular haemorrhage and intraretinal fluid (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF) on optical coherence tomography, and 112 eyes (44%) remained active. At month 11, 136 eyes (53%) were inactive, and 119 eyes (47%) remained active. At month 11, 77% of inactive eyes after loading remained inactive, and 77% of the active eyes after loading remained active. At month 11, mean BCVA of the inactive group was 0.51, and mean BCVA of the active group was 0.48 (P=0.54).ConclusionsAflibercept administered by fixed dosing over 1 year improved VA and macular morphology in treatment-naïve eyes. Active lesions at month 11 do not have worse VA outcomes compared with inactive lesions. The macular status after loading is a reliable indicator of disease activity at the end of year 1."

CD005139,0,19925410,0,Current molecular understanding and future treatment strategies for pathologic ocular neovascularization.,"The leading cause of blindness in the developed world results from several disorders that have pathologic ocular neovascularization as the common pathway leading to vision loss. These disorders include exudative age related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), retinal vein occlusions (RVO) and ocular tumors. Because neovascularization is the common pathway to blindness in these highly prevalent conditions, the recent understanding of the cascade of angiogenesis has led to clinically available molecular therapeutics that have been proven to restore and preserve vision in patients that suffer from these blinding conditions. This article will summarize the emergence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a validated treatment target for and current understanding of the pathophysiology of ocular neovascularization.

CD005139,0,12516033,0,Role of vascular endothelial growth factor in physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis: therapeutic implications.,"Angiogenesis, or formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is essential for normal development and wound healing/reproductive functions in adults. Abnormal regulation of angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a pivotal stimulator of angiogenesis because its binding to VEGF receptors has been shown to promote endothelial cell migration and proliferation, two key features required for the development of new blood vessels. In addition, VEGF-A increases vascular permeability, which may also contribute to angiogenesis and tumor growth. Recognition of the central role of VEGF-A in angiogenesis has led to the hypothesis that its inhibition may represent a novel and effective approach to the treatment of cancer and other conditions characterized by pathologic angiogenesis. Several lines of evidence support this idea, and early clinical experience with the humanized anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (Avastin, rhuMAb-VEGF; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) has been encouraging. Clinical efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab is being evaluated in several phase 3 trials in various types of cancer, as well as in patients with age-related macular degeneration."

CD005139,0,20939799,0,Fluocinolone acetonide implantable device for diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy remains a major worldwide cause of preventable visual loss. Although photocoagulation and improved metabolic control are effective for patients with diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, some patients continue to lose vision despite treatment. Various classes of pharmacotherapy have shown promise in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, including corticosteroids, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, and others. Off-label intravitreal corticosteroids are associated with short-term anatomic and visual improvement in some patients, but these patients may require repeated intravitreal injections with cumulative risks of cataract formation, intraocular pressure elevation, and endophthalmitis. Various sustained-release corticosteroid delivery systems have been investigated for this purpose. The first to become widely available is the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (Retisert, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY), which received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to treat chronic, noninfectious posterior segment uveitis in 2005. This device also has been investigated as a treatment for diabetic macular edema. Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated medium-term anatomic and visual improvement, but the device is associated with high risks of cataract formation and intraocular pressure elevation. At this time, the device is not widely used in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. A smaller device, designed to be injected in a clinic setting (Iluvien, Alimera Sciences, Alpharetta, GA) is currently being investigated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Results from a phase 3 randomized controlled trial have recently reported medium-term efficacy and safety in the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Combination photocoagulation and pharmacotherapy with these devices has not yet been reported."

In pivotal trials, monthly injections of ranibizumab were superior to verteporfin photodynamic therapy in the treatment of predominantly classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to neovascular AMD (ANCHOR) and sham in the treatment of minimally classic or occult CNV due to neovascular AMD (MARINA). Monthly or less frequent injections of ranibizumab are generally well tolerated and associated with low rates of ocular and systemic serious adverse events (SAEs). Less frequent dosing has been evaluated with the aim of reducing the burden, risk and cost of monthly injections. In the landmark CATT trial, monthly monitoring and retreatment as-needed with ranibizumab was equivalent to monthly treatment in terms of the vision gain at 1 year, but reduced the number of injections (and the related cost) by approximately one-half. In head-to-head comparisons, aflibercept administered bimonthly was noninferior to ranibizumab administered monthly (VIEW 1 and 2), bevacizumab administered monthly was equivalent to ranibizumab administered monthly (CATT), and bevacizumab administered as-needed was equivalent to ranibizumab administered as-needed (CATT). Bevacizumab is widely used (off-label) for economic reasons; while it was less costly than ranibizumab, it was associated with more systemic SAEs. Notwithstanding the availability of other similarly effective anti-VEGF therapies that are approved (aflibercept) or unapproved (bevacizumab), ranibizumab continues to set the standard as regards the totality of evidence from randomized clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy and tolerability (particularly that of the monthly regimen) in the treatment of neovascular AMD."
CD005139,0,19800537,0,Outcome measures to assess efficacy of treatments for age-related macular degeneration.,"In a clinical trial of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the outcome measure chosen to assess the efficacy of treatment should reflect the purpose of the trial and the stage of development of the treatment. This article considers 3 classes of outcomes: continuous variables, such as mean change in best visual acuity; binary (2-category) variables, such as experiencing a 15-letter loss; or 3-category variables, such as experiencing either a 15-letter loss or 15-letter gain. Each type of outcome has advantages and disadvantages. Trials using outcomes based on means require much smaller sample sizes than trials based on 2- or 3-category variables, but means do not address the experience of individuals. Two- and 3-category variables show what happens to individuals, but they are subject to misclassification and are statistically inefficient. The authors recommend considering continuous measures for early stage trials and for trials studying various dose regimens when a treatment has been well characterized. However, 2- and 3-category outcomes are particularly useful in confirmatory phase 3 trials of a new therapy. A new graphical method is proposed to provide insight into the distribution of the time course of changes in acuity on an individual patient basis."

Prospective-randomized control trial of 30 eyes of 30 diabetic patients having Diffuse DME with maximum retinal thickness (MRT) was more than or equal to 350 µm. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups. Group A (12 eyes) received IVB and group B received PST (18 patients) before laser treatment. Grid laser treatment was done when the MRT decreased to less than 350 µm. OCT thickness-guided repeat injections were given if required. The patients had minimum follow-up of 6 months. At 6-month follow-up, the two groups were compared for (1) Maximum change in visual acuity letter score using logMAR chart (2) Reduction in MRT on OCT. The mean logMAR visual acuity at baseline was 0.63 ± 0.45 (0-1.6) in group A and was 0.76 ± 0.38 (0.2-1.3) in group B. The mean logMAR visual acuity at 6 month in group A was 0.34 ± 0.21 (0-0.6) and in group B was 0.64 ± 0.37 (0.3-1.3). The mean visual acuity at last follow-up was significantly better in group A than group B (p = 0.02). The mean change in MRT in Group A and Group B was 177.8 ± 85.64 and 156.07 ± 102.86, respectively, which was significantly better than the baseline in both the groups and was comparable in both groups.

A tremendous advancement in basic science in this field is providing an excellent support for the concept, which is in contrast to a lack of strong clinical support to date. With regard to the large gap between experimental data and clinical data, the best model of human malignancy is in human cancer patients and the best model of human ocular angiogenesis-mediated disorders such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age related macular degeneration (AMD) is in human RD and AMD patients. Additionally, clinical outcomes should include benefit/risk ratios, hard end points (mortality and quality of life as opposed to increased microvascular density with pro-angiogenic agents or tumor size reduction with anti-angiogenesis agents) as well as cost effectiveness. Experimental models should be used to provide guidance, placebo effect, comparative data, and mechanistic understanding as opposed to being used for expected clinical efficacy. We also have to understand existing strategies and how angiogenesis modulation can add further value (i.e. not to replace existing strategy but rather improve efficacy/safety). Recent investigation defined numerous strategies in the modulation of angiogenesis. Those strategies are driven from haemostatic, fibrinolytic, cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix, growth factors, and other endogenous systems involved in the modulation of angiogenesis."

The vast increase in the number of patients undergoing intravitreal treatment and the role of anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy as the mainstay of DME treatment have triggered several challenges. Among them, of considerable interest is the quest for an optimal dosing scheme and the search for combination therapies. Although a significant body of research is directed towards other molecules that could potentially be new therapeutic targets, VEGF inhibition is expected to play an important long-term role in the treatment of DME considering the pathogenesis of the disease.

Patients with recurrence of ME received further IRI as needed. The number of IRIs was significantly correlated with age, baseline best-corrected visual acuity, and baseline central macular thickness (CMT), as well as the baseline aqueous levels of 5 cytokines/factors (soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, platelet-derived growth factor-AA [PDGF-AA], soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-6 [IL-6], and IL-8). Multivariate linear regression analysis with stepwise selection confirmed that age, baseline CMT, and baseline PDGF-AA level were independent determinants of the number of IRIs.

CD005139,0,23031671,0,Vascular endothelial growth factor a in intraocular vascular disease.,"The vascular beds supplying the retina may sustain injury as a result of underlying disease such as diabetes, and/or the interaction of genetic predisposition, environmental insults, and age. The vascular pathologic features observed in different intraocular vascular diseases can be categorized broadly as proliferation, exemplified by proliferative diabetic retinopathy, leakage such as macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion, or a combination of proliferation and leakage, as seen in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The World Health Organization has identified diabetic retinopathy and AMD as priority eye diseases for the prevention of vision loss in developed countries. The pathologic transformations of the retinal vasculature seen in intraocular vascular disease are associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF), a potent endothelial-specific mitogen. Furthermore, in model systems, VEGF alone is sufficient to trigger intraocular neovascularization, and its inhibition is associated with functional and anatomic improvements in the affected eye. Therapeutic interventions with effect on VEGF include intraocular capture and neutralization by engineered antibodies or chimeric receptors, downregulation of its expression with steroids, or alleviation of retinal ischemia, a major stimulus for VEGF expression, with retinal ablation by laser treatment. Data from prospective randomized clinical trials indicate that VEGF inhibition is a potent therapeutic strategy for intraocular vascular disease.

Two agents are approved for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration and are being evaluated for other retinal conditions: the RNA aptamer pegaptanib and the monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment ranibizumab. Bevacizumab, a related antibody, is being used similarly, although its use is off-label. Pegaptanib selectively binds to a VEGF isoform identified as being especially pathogenic in the eye and spares other isoforms, whereas the other two agents nonselectively bind all VEGF isoforms. Because VEGF is involved in a wide variety of physiologic processes, the ocular and systemic safety of anti-VEGF agents is of paramount concern. I provide an overview of safety data for intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies, focusing primarily on randomized, controlled trials. For pegaptanib, an accumulation of data from pivotal trials and a dedicated systemic safety study have revealed no ocular or systemic safety concerns.

Three months later, the patient presented with sudden vision loss. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/200 with presence of subretinal haemorrhage with attached retina and silicone oil in situ. Fluorescein angiography confirmed the diagnosis of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). The patient underwent intravitreal ranibizumab injection (0.5 mg per 0.05 mL). He subsequently underwent oil removal along with intravitreal bevacizumab injection (1.25 mg per 0.05 mL). The CNV completely regressed.

CD005139,0,26036708,0,Current intravitreal pharmacologic therapies for diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults; it is a highly prevalent cause of vision loss overall and has a potent impact on the quality of life in those with diabetes mellitus and public health in general. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of vision loss from diabetic retinopathy. In patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic hyperglycemia leads to activation of the inflammatory cascade and retinal capillary damage that result in microaneurysm formation in the retina. In addition to the possibility of associated ischemia, microaneurysms are hyperpermeable; the resultant loss of the blood-retinal barrier leads to vision loss if consequent edema involves the center of the fovea. The standard of DME therapy for >25 years was focal laser photocoagulation applied to or near the microaneurysms. However, results from clinical trials of intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockers and corticosteroids for the treatment of DME have led to a dramatic paradigm shift away from laser therapy to primary treatment with these pharmacologic agents."

CD005139,0,26919788,0,"IBI302, a promising candidate for AMD treatment, targeting both the VEGF and complement system with high binding affinity in vitro and effective targeting of the ocular tissue in healthy rhesus monkeys.","Uncontrolled activation of complement and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play fundamental roles in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, most drugs used to treat AMD focus on a single target, and the percentage of effectively treated patients in clinical practice needs to be improved. Therefore, novel AMD treatment approaches are needed. IBI302 is a novel bispecific decoy receptor fusion protein designed with both a VEGF inhibition domain and a complement cascade inhibition domain, which are connected by the Fc region of human immunoglobulin. In this study, we systematically evaluated the binding affinity between IBI302 and VEGF isoforms and complement proteins by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. Anti-VEGF blockers (aflibercept and bevacizumab) and complement receptor 1 were used as references. The SPR assay results indicated that IBI302 could bind different VEGF isoforms and complement proteins with high affinity. The biological activity of IBI302 was also studied. IBI302 showed an inhibitory effect on human primary umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation and the activation of complement pathways in vitro. Finally, the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of IBI302 were evaluated in rhesus monkeys. The PK results showed that after a 0.5 mg/eye intravitreal dosage, IBI302 became rapidly distributed from the vitreous humor into targeted tissues and remained active over 504 h. Overall, the favorable anti-angiogenic and anti-complement effects of IBI302 along with the good PK profiles in rhesus monkeys support the selection and development of IBI302 as a promising candidate for AMD treatment."

The patients with an initial diagnosis of nAMD who made through the clinical examination, optical coherence tomography, and fluorescein angiography imaging, and were treated with at least three monthly IVR injections that resulted with a morphological poor response, were included. ICGA was obtained from the patients and evaluated in regard to differential diagnosis of other macular diseases, which might mimic nAMD.ResultsThe study included 132 eyes of 117 patients. The mean age was 67.4±9.4 years. After ICGA imaging, 13 eyes (9.8%) were diagnosed as true nAMD, 74 eyes (56.1%) as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), 35 eyes (26.5%) as chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), 3 eyes (2.3%) as retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), 3 eyes (2.3%) as choroidal neovascularization secondary to CSC, 2 eyes (1.5%) as adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, and 2 eyes (1.5%) as drusenoid pigment epithelial detachment with vitelliform material, respectively. The duration between the initial diagnosis and the revised diagnosis was 15.6±10.5 months in the non-AMD group, and the mean injection number of these patients was 6.6±4.4.ConclusionsMost of the nAMD patients who were thought to be morphologically poor responders to IVR were diagnosed as having non-AMD diseases via ICGA. A detailed differential diagnostic work-up is needed before considering these patients as poor responders."

The selectivity of Lin05 was tested in cell proliferation assays with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and a retinal pigmented epithelial cell line(ARPE-19). In-vivo anti-angiogenic effect of Lin05 was investigated utilizing an experimental laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (ECNV) model in adult Brown Norway rats. Western blot and/or reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to test the effect of Lin05 on potential targets. Our results indicate that Lin05 is at least an 8-fold more selective inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation compared to RPE cells. Systemic administration of Lin05 in an ECNV model was associated with a significant decrease in both vascular leakage on fluorescein angiography and lesion size by histopathology (p = 0.02). No systemic toxicity was detected for Lin05 in major organs such as the liver, lung and kidneys. Lin05 did not inhibit VEGF-induced VEGFR2 (KDR) phosphorylation in HUVEC nor was associated with decreased VEGF gene expression. Also it did not inhibit insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) induced activation of p42/p44 MAPK activation. It inhibited both PDGF- and bFGF-induced p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation. However, the effect on PDGF was variable in different HUVEC cells. In conclusion, Lin05 is a potential anti-angiogenic agent for the treatment of eye diseases associated with pathological neovascularization. The anti-angiogenic effect of Lin05 is likely through inhibition of bFGF but not through inhibition of the VEGF/KDR pathway."

The aim of this pharmacogenetic study was to evaluate the impact of high-risk alleles in factor H, factor C3 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the response to intravitreal bevacizumab in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a Tunisian population. Methods. Ninety patients with active neovascular AMD treated with intravitreal bevacizumab injections were enrolled in the study. Treatment response was evaluated by comparing BCVA at baseline and at 12 months. Patients were classified into either ""poor responders"" (PR) or ""good responders"" (GR). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed for rs1061170 in FH, rs2230199 in C3 andrs699947, rs2010963 and rs3025039 in VEGF. The association between genotype and visual response at 12 months was assessed. Results. Seventy-seven participants were assigned to the GR group and 13 to the PR group. No correlation was found between FH, C3 and VEGF variant alleles and treatment response. However, haplotype analysis of rs699947 ((- 2578) C/A), rs2010963 ((+ 405) C/G) and rs3025039 ((+ 936) C/T) SNPs revealed that the AGT haplotype was associated with a poor response at 12months (p = 0.048). No association was found between treatment response and the cumulative effect of all high-risk alleles of C3, FH and VEGF. All three types of CNV were found in both groups at a comparable frequency. Conclusions. The VEGF haplotype TGA could be used as a marker for poor visual prognosis in Tunisian patients with neovascular AMD treated with bevacizumab."

While pharmacogenetic studies are building stronger foundations for the systematic investigations of phenotype-genotype relationships in many research and clinical fields of medicine, pharmacogenetic data regarding anti-angiogenic drugs are still lacking. Here we review preclinical and clinical genetic studies on angiogenic determinants such as vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.

CD005139,0,19476398,0,Off-label use of bevacizumab for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration: what is the evidence?,"There is an active and controversial debate about the role of intravitreal bevacizumab versus approved drugs in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Because bevacizumab was available prior to the launch of ranibizumab, off-label use of the former became widespread and the cancer drug bevacizumab is the most commonly used medication in ophthalmology nowadays. This review considers every publication identified in MEDLINE using the keywords 'bevacizumab' and 'Avastin' between 1 June 2005 and 31 July 2008. The search identified 511 papers that were evaluated. In 33 studies, there was consistent and clear evidence for the efficacy of bevacizumab in neovascular AMD. However, the highest grade studies (three prospective, randomized, controlled trials) did not attain better than grade 2b level of evidence, and objective evaluation of the benefit of bevacizumab relative to representative controls was therefore not possible. Certainly, the available evidence is inferior to that obtained from the approval studies of ranibizumab and this should influence treatment selection and guidance of patients. These considerations indicate that important quality criteria need to be included in future studies to ensure more meaningful conclusions can be drawn. These include clearly defined inclusion criteria, information about the recruitment procedure (including data on withdrawals, excluded patients, concealed treatment allocation, use of intention-to-treat analyses and blinded assessment procedures). Although preclinical studies have almost exclusively found bevacizumab to be safe, the design utilized in clinical case series cannot rule out a possible increase in adverse events, which already show a high spontaneous incidence in elderly AMD patients. The superior evidence level for ranibizumab and the limited safety data for bevacizumab must be taken into consideration when evaluating the costs that a healthcare system is willing to spend. However, the superior grade of evidence for ranibizumab should not be confused with the (still missing) evidence for superior efficacy. The results of ongoing randomized, controlled, comparative trials will provide further data on the efficacy and cost effectiveness of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in the treatment of AMD. In the meantime, patients should be informed about the alternatives, the price differences and the restricted liability issue when off-label use of bevacizumab is offered."

Decursin is a novel therapeutic that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) with putative anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activities. Thereby we utilized human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) under conditions of excess glucose to explore dose-dependent responses of decursin on markers of migration, angiogenesis, and proliferation. Decursin dose-dependently inhibited tube formation, VEGFR-2 expression, along with relative metabolic activity and 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) activity in both cell lines. We then correlated our findings to the streptozotocin-induced rat model of diabetes. Following three months of decursin treatment VEGFR-2 expression was significantly inhibited. Our data would suggest that decursin may be a potent anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative agent targeting the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway, which significantly inhibits diabetic retinal neovascularization."

We examined 125 patients diagnosed with ARMD and divided into 5 groups of 25 patients according to CARMS (Clinical Age-Related Maculopathy Staging System). Control group consists of 51 patients with similar ages, without ARMD. All of them underwent stereobiomicroscopy, fundus photography and fluorescein angiography. Dietary fatty acids intake was measured using food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The FFQ was based on previously validated questionnaire (DIETQ, Tinuviel Software, Warington, Ches, UK) and FFQ2 from Blue MountainEye Study. The data were analysed using food nutritient dana from McCance and Widdowson's Food Composition Tables, supplemented with a food fatty acid content database (Foodbase, London, UK). We noticed statistically significant difference between omega-6/omega-3 ratio in neovascular ARMD (stage 5) and all other groups including control group (p = 0.000020). The ratio in Stage 5 was about 11:1 like in Western diet. Stage 4-geographic atrophy (GA) has statistically significant difference in o-mega-6/omega-3 ratio compared with stage 1 (p = 0.000571), stage 2 (p = 0.000112) and stage3 (p = 0.000430). The ratio in first three groups is about 7-7.5:1 (greater then Mediteran-4-5:1, but lower then Western Diet-10-20:1). There is no statistically significant difference between first three stages (p > 0.05) and stage 4 and control group (p = 0.172388). Omega-6/omega-3 ratio is connected with development of neovascular ARMD. Decreased ratio protects against neovascular ARMD. On the contrary, GA seems to be connected with prolonged sunlight exposure (the ratio is about 6:1). It is good to know that changing nutrition habits someone can prevent development of severe neovascular form of ARMD because intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy limitations."
CD005139,0,26058945,0,Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Research in Ophthalmology--a Review.,"Similar to cancer, many ocular proliferative disorders could be treated with a specific antibody conjugated to a toxin. Active targeting to inhibit epithelial and endothelial cell proliferation in the eye has been tested using antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) both pre-clinically and clinically. Achieving efficacious drug concentrations in the eye, in particular to treat back of the eye disorders is challenging, and the promise of targeted antibody mediated delivery holds great potential. In this review, we describe the research efforts in drug targeting using ADC for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), posterior lens capsule opacification, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Among these disorders, CNV represents a more active research focus, with more target antigens tested, given the disease prevalence and wider target antigen selection based on current understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. However, the only research advancing to testing in clinical stage is for posterior lens capsule opacification. Compared to oncology, ADC research and development in ophthalmology is much more limited, possibly due to availability of successful therapies that could be administered locally with limited concern of off-target drug toxicity."

CD005139,0,17402563,0,[Aging and retinal vascular diseases].,"Ocular vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and age-related macular degeneration, whose population increases along with aging, have become leading causes of severe visual disturbance. Macular edema and serous retinal detachment are associated with abnormal vascular leakage and tractional retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma is caused by retinal neovascularization. Such ocular vascular diseases are caused by vascular cell aging and vascular damage associated with lifestyle-related diseases including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. In the present study, we investigated molecular mechanisms in such vascular deficiencies using vascular cell biology methodology, and we propose novel strategies for the treatment of such vascular diseases. Along with aging, oxidative stress and physical stress, such as mechanical stretch, continuously and directly insult vascular cells. Such stress induces apoptosis by intracellular signaling through stress kinases in cultured retinal vascular cells. Inhibition of such stress kinases could be an effective treatment to protect the vascular cells against age-related damage. In a retinal vascular developmental model, pericyte loss causes pathology mimicking macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang 1) secreted by pericytes suppresses oxidative stress-induced intracellular signaling through stress kinases linked to cell apoptosis and normalizes such retinal pathology. This suggests that the paracrine action of Ang 1 in the pericytes is necessary to sustain normal retinal vasculature, and that Ang 1-triggered intracellular signaling is useful for the treatment of vascular cell pathology associated with pericyte loss. In diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion, retinal vessels regress along with retinal vascular cell apoptosis, and the retina becomes ischemic followed by pathological retinal neovascularization. VEGF has been recognized as a predominant factor to induce the ischemic retinal neovascularization. We found that retinal vascular cells have a characteristic pattern in VEGF receptor expression, which causes vascular pathology more frequently in the retina than in other organs. Neuropilin 1 (NRP 1), which enhances VEGF receptor function, is abundantly expressed in the retinal endothelial cells and is upregulated by VEGF itself and by hypoxia to regulate a positive feedback mechanism in retinal neovascularization. This receptor could be a unique target for retina-specific therapy. Lifestyle-related diseases increase along with aging and have further increased due to changes in Japanese lifestyle imitating that of Western countries. We found that the renin-angiotensin system which regulates hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, and adipocytokines which are abnormally secreted in obesity, act as proangiogenic factors. Regulation of such lifestyle-related disease factors is important for the treatment of retinal vascular diseases. Finally, we found that erythropoietin is an ischemia-induced angiogenic factor that acts independently and as potently as VEGF in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Our study utilizing human vitreous samples demonstrates that the VEGF level is particularly high and strongly associated with angiogenic activity in PDR patients. The potential of VEGF inhibitors has recently been recognized in clinical applications. The manipulation of each angiogenic factor and adipocytokine that we report here could become potential therapy in the near future."
CD005139,0,25784111,0,What have we learnt about the management of diabetic macular edema in the antivascular endothelial growth factor and corticosteroid era?,To summarize the outcomes of the use of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and corticosteroids on the treatment paradigm for diabetic macular edema (DME).
CD005139,0,26417625,0,Bevacizumab (AVASTIN) and age-related macular degeneration. Lower cost does not justify taking risks.,"Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab, a VEGF inhibitor, is an option for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Because of its lower price, bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor closely related to ranibizumab and marketed for the treatment of various malignancies, is sometimes used off label for intravitreal injection in AMD. In 2011, the harm-benefit balance of bevacizumab in patients with AMD was uncertain. New data are available in 2015. In six randomised trials including a total of about 3200 patients, funded independently of the pharmaceutical industry, bevacizumab (1.25 mg per dose) was about as effective as ranibizumab (0.5 mg per injection): visual acuity stabilised or improved in 90% to 95% of patients after one to two years of treatment. During these trials, bevacizumab did not reduce the number of injections needed, as compared with ranibizumab. These trials confirmed the known adverse effect profile of bevacizumab, which is similar to that of ranibizumab and includes serious ocular as well as extraocular adverse effects, in particular cardiac disorders. Serious extraocular adverse events, especially gastrointestinal disorders, were more frequent with bevacizumab than with ranibizumab at one year (18% versus 14%). In early 2015, there are no bevacizumab products suitable for intravitreal injection. In 2011, cases of sight-threatening infectious endophthalmitis were reported in the United States, following contamination during syringe preparation for intravitreal administration. In practice, when treatment with a VEGF inhibitor is considered for AMD, it is more prudent to choose ranibizumab, despite its currently unacceptable price."

The authors report a case in which the appearance of a choroidal neovascular membrane prior to the final diagnosis of Crohn's disease suggests its role as an advance lesion heralding an inflammatory state. A 13-year-old boy was referred for evaluation of a clinically isolated, unilateral choroidal neovascular membrane, which stabilized after treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab. Two years later, the patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Choroidal neovascular membranes, reported previously as a complication of Crohn's disease following diagnosis, may be a precursor lesion."

CD005139,0,27146677,0,HIF inhibitors for ischemic retinopathies and cancers: options beyond anti-VEGF therapies.,"Aberrant activation of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway causing overexpression of angiogenic genes, like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is one of the underlying causes of ocular neovascularization (NV) and metastatic cancer. Consistently, along with surgical interventions, a number of anti-VEGF agents have been approved by FDA for the treatment of ocular neovascular diseases. These anti-VEGF agents, like ranibizumab/lucentis, have revolutionized the treatment in the past decade. However, substantial vision improvement is observed only in a subset of age-related macular degeneration patients receiving ranibizumab. Further, all current therapies are associated with limitations and side effects. For example, surgeries cause tissue destruction and inflammation while anti-VEGF therapies are expensive, require repeated administration, and offer temporary relief from vascular leakage. These factors impose significant cost and treatment burdens to both the patient and society. With an aging population in most western countries with a continually increasing number of patients on lifelong treatment for these retinal diseases, the focus of ocular drug development for neovascular diseases will be to improve efficacy while reducing treatment costs. Blocking the HIF pathway, a major regulator of ocular NV and cancer, offers an appealing therapeutic strategy. Therefore, this review summarizes HIF inhibitors that have been recently evaluated for the treatment of different cancers and ischemic retinopathies."

Although it is expected that lower doses of Avastin used for intravitreal administration and an intact blood-retina barrier would reduce the systemic exposure of the drug, both animal and human studies suggest that this may not be the case. In addition, emerging real-world and clinical trial data continue to point toward compromises in both cardio- and cerebrovascular safety with Avastin. Thus, clinicians are urged to adopt the highest possible standard of care in the treatment of an already fragile AMD population.

CD005139,0,27720395,0,Fenofibrate Inhibits Cytochrome P450 Epoxygenase 2C Activity to Suppress Pathological Ocular Angiogenesis.,"Neovascular eye diseases including retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy and age-related-macular-degeneration are major causes of blindness. Fenofibrate treatment in type 2 diabetes patients reduces progression of diabetic retinopathy independent of its peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α agonist lipid lowering effect. The mechanism is unknown. Fenofibrate binds to and inhibits cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP)2C with higher affinity than to PPARα. CYP2C metabolizes ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). While ω-3 LCPUFA products from other metabolizing pathways decrease retinal and choroidal neovascularization, CYP2C products of both ω-3 and ω-6 LCPUFAs promote angiogenesis. We hypothesized that fenofibrate inhibits retinopathy by reducing CYP2C ω-3 LCPUFA (and ω-6 LCPUFA) pro-angiogenic metabolites. Fenofibrate reduced retinal and choroidal neovascularization in PPARα-/-mice and augmented ω-3 LCPUFA protection via CYP2C inhibition. Fenofibrate suppressed retinal and choroidal neovascularization in mice overexpressing human CYP2C8 in endothelial cells and reduced plasma levels of the pro-angiogenic ω-3 LCPUFA CYP2C8 product, 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid. 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid reversed fenofibrate-induced suppression of angiogenesis ex vivo and suppression of endothelial cell functions in vitro. In summary fenofibrate suppressed retinal and choroidal neovascularization via CYP2C inhibition as well as by acting as an agonist of PPARα.

CD005139,0,18330892,0,Topical administration of a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor suppresses choroidal neovascularization and retinal edema.,"Age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusions are complicated by neovascularization and macular edema. Multi-targeted kinase inhibitors that inhibit select growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and/or components of their down-stream signaling cascades (such as Src kinases) are rationale treatment strategies for these disease processes. We describe the discovery and characterization of two such agents. TG100572, which inhibits Src kinases and selected receptor tyrosine kinases, induced apoptosis of proliferating endothelial cells in vitro. Systemic delivery of TG100572 in a murine model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) caused significant suppression of CNV, but with an associated weight loss suggestive of systemic toxicity. To minimize systemic exposure, topical delivery of TG100572 to the cornea was explored, and while substantial levels of TG100572 were achieved in the retina and choroid, superior exposure levels were achieved using TG100801, an inactive prodrug that generates TG100572 by de-esterification. Neither TG100801 nor TG100572 were detectable in plasma following topical delivery of TG100801, and adverse safety signals (such as weight loss) were not observed even with prolonged dosing schedules. Topical TG100801 significantly suppressed laser-induced CNV in mice, and reduced fluorescein leakage from the vasculature and retinal thickening measured by optical coherence tomography in a rat model of retinal vein occlusion. These data suggest that TG100801 may provide a new topically applied treatment approach for ocular neovascularization and retinal edema."

In this study, we investigate the therapeutic potential and safety profiles of high-affinity peptides targeting VEGF which are identified using an 'aptide' technology. We show that two VEGF-binding aptides, APTVEGF1 and APTVEGF2, demonstrate high binding affinity and specificity to VEGF. Furthermore, they suppress VEGF-induced activation of VEGF receptor-2, in vitro angiogenesis, and in vivo pathological choroidal and retinal neovascularization. Despite potent anti-angiogenic effects, both VEGF-binding aptides do not induce any definite toxicity at the level of cellular viability, histological integrity, and gene expression.

Since the introduction of anti-inflammatory or anti-VEGF drugs combined with or used alternatively to laser, visual acuity can be stabilized or improved in a significant number of patients. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding the safety, efficiency and economic concerns related to these intravitreal monotherapies because they warrant frequent repetition to maintain the clinical effect. In the literature, the combination of photolasercoagulation, intravitreal steroids or VEGF-inhibitors, or both, shows early compelling evidence that some patients may benefit from less retreatment compared to monotherapy. To provide a conceptual and perspective approach for a first-line combined therapy, this paper also summarizes own results of pilot interventional case series of a 1.5 cc core pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal substitution with balanced salt solution (BSS), 1.25 mg bevacizumab and 8 mg triamcinolone."

We aim to investigate the early predictors of this treatment outcome. Seventy-one treatment-naive eyes of 71 patients with eAMD of all lesion subtypes who received intravitreal ranibizumab treatment and completed 12 months of follow-up were included. All patients were loaded with three injections of ranibizumab at monthly intervals. Further injections were given if clinically indicated based on logMAR best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography findings. Casenotes of eligible patients were reviewed retrospectively. The main outcome measure was logMAR BCVA change at month 12. The mean number of injections given over 12 months was 5.4 ± 1.9. A total of 88.7 % of the patients achieved visual stabilisation (loss of <15 letters) and 15.0 % achieved visual improvement (gain of ≥15 letters). The mean letter change at 12 months was +0.3 letters. Regression analysis showed that baseline BCVA and letter change at month 3 predicted visual acuity outcome at month 12 (baseline BCVA: t = 6.97, p < 0.001; letter change: t = 5.84, p < 0.01) but age, gender and eAMD in the fellow eye were not predictive. Finally, a decisional answer tree model demonstrated that letter change at month 3 was a strong predictor of visual outcome at month 12 with an overall accuracy of 69 %. We found that letter change from baseline at month 3 was strongly predictive of visual outcome at month 12."

CD005139,0,22495396,0,Management of retinal vascular diseases: a patient-centric approach.,"Retinal vascular diseases are a leading cause of blindness in the Western world. Advancement in the clinical management of these diseases has been fast-paced, with new treatments becoming available as well as license extensions of existing treatments. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in certain retinal vascular diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Treatment of wet AMD and visual impairment due to either DMO or macular oedema secondary to RVO with an anti-VEGF on an as needed basis, rather than a fixed schedule, allows an individualised treatment approach; providing treatment when patients are most likely to benefit from it, while minimising the number of unnecessary intravitreal injections. Thus, an individualised treatment regimen reduces the chances of over-treatment and under-treatment, optimising both the risk/benefit profile of the treatment and the efficient use of NHS resource. Streamlining of treatment for patients with wet AMD and visual impairment due to either DMO or macular oedema secondary to RVO, by using one treatment with similar posology across all three diseases, may help to minimise burden of clinic capacity and complexity and hence optimise patient outcomes. Informed treatment decisions and efficient clinic throughput are important for optimal patient outcomes in the fast-changing field of retinal vascular diseases."

CD005139,0,22907145,0,Evidence for anti-VEGF treatment of diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most important cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic retinopathy has a remarkable impact on public health and on the quality of life of diabetic patients and thus requires special consideration. The first line of treatment remains the management of systemic risk factors but is often insufficient in controlling DME and currently, laser retinal photocoagulation is considered the standard of care. However, laser treatment reduces the risk of moderate visual loss by approximately 50% without guaranteeing remarkable effects on visual improvement. For these reasons, new strategies in the treatment of DME have been studied, in particular the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. VEGF is a pluripotent growth factor that acts as a vasopermeability factor and an endothelial cell mitogen. For this reason, it represents an interesting candidate as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DME. The aim of this article is to review the evidence behind the use of anti-VEGF drugs in the treatment of DME."

CD005139,0,19553803,0,Rationale for combination therapy in age-related macular degeneration.,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is typically characterized as an invasion of blood vessels, but it is important to recognize concurrent inflammatory and mesenchymal cell infiltration. A two component model of CNV can be thought to be composed of a vascular component and an extravascular component. Macular damage is possible through either. Given the redundancy and complex interaction among biologic systems involved in the production of CNV, it is likely that a monotherapeutic approach will not be fully effective. The vascular component of CNV arises through the orchestrated interaction of a number of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which maintains pericyte viability. The vascular component of CNV can be selectively targeted with anti-VEGF and anti-PDGF drugs or nonselectively with such modalities as ionizing radiation. The extravascular component can be targeted selectively by inhibiting specific cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha or nonselectively with antiinflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids."

Similar favourable results with pegaptanib 0.3 mg were seen in terms of the secondary efficacy endpoints (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing severe loss of visual acuity or legal blindness in the study eye). These vision-improving effects of pegaptanib were associated with beneficial angiographic effects. Intravitreous pegaptanib 0.3-3 mg was well tolerated with most ocular adverse events being mild-to-moderate and transient. Serious injection-related adverse events occurred in <or=1.3% of patients treated with pegaptanib. There were no systemic adverse events that could be definitely attributed to pegaptanib."

CD005139,0,20703035,0,Antivascular endothelial growth factor treatment in pseudoxanthoma elasticum patients.,"The eye in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, an autosomal recessive disease, shows several lesions, like peau d'orange, angioid streaks, comet lesions, and paired hyperpigmented smudges. The most devastating ocular complication is the development of choroidal neovascularizations (CNV). This exudative disease of the central retina leads to loss of visual acuity, and results of treatments in the past have been disappointing. From the present evidence it may be concluded that intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy with ranibizumab or bevacizumaab is beneficial for the treatment of CNV secondary to angioid streaks associated with PXE. Especially in the early stages of the disease, visual acuity can be maintained or even improved over a prolonged period of time, even with a low number of injections. Later in the course of the disease, when more widespread atrophic changes have occurred, the perspective is more bleak. Although there seem to be arguments to treat selected patients with a maintenance treatment of intravitreal injections once every 2 months, an as-needed regimen is the most used strategy. Patients need to be aware of the off-label nature of the treatment with anti-VEGF and also need to be informed about the possible increased risk of cardiovascular and/or thromboembolic events, although at present no definite proof has been documented of this higher risk in patients with or without PXE treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF. Overall, based on the evidence available, intravitreal treatment with anti-VEGF seems to be the best choice at present to treat patients with CNV secondary to angioid streaks and PXE."

CD005139,0,26650228,0,"Functional characterization of a VEGF-A-targeting Anticalin, prototype of a novel therapeutic human protein class.","Human tear lipocalin (Tlc) was utilized as a protein scaffold to engineer an Anticalin that specifically binds and functionally blocks vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), a pivotal inducer of physiological angiogenesis that also plays a crucial role in several neovascular diseases. Starting from a naive combinatorial library where residues that form the natural ligand-binding site of Tlc were randomized, followed by affinity maturation, the final Anticalin PRS-050 was selected to bind all major splice forms of VEGF-A with picomolar affinity. Moreover, this Anticalin cross-reacts with the murine ortholog. PRS-050 efficiently antagonizes the interaction between VEGF-A and its cellular receptors, and it inhibits VEGF-induced mitogenic signaling as well as proliferation of primary human endothelial cells with subnanomolar IC50 values. Intravitreal administration of the Anticalin suppressed VEGF-induced blood-retinal barrier breakdown in a rabbit model. To allow lasting systemic neutralization of VEGF-A in vivo, the plasma half-life of the Anticalin was extended by site-directed PEGylation. The modified Anticalin efficiently blocked VEGF-mediated vascular permeability as well as growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice, concomitantly with reduction in microvessel density. In contrast to bevacizumab, the Anticalin did not trigger platelet aggregation and thrombosis in human FcγRIIa transgenic mice, thus suggesting an improved safety profile. Since neutralization of VEGF-A activity is well known to exert beneficial effects in cancer and other neovascular diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration, this Anticalin offers a novel potent small protein antagonist for differentiated therapeutic intervention in oncology and ophthalmology."

CD005139,0,18388961,0,The evolving role of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among the ageing population. The introduction of molecular inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), such as pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab, as treatments for exudative AMD has provided new hope for affected patients and has transformed the practices of retina specialists. Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of monthly ranibizumab for the preservation as well as improvement of visual acuity in patients with exudative AMD. Ongoing trials are evaluating the effectiveness of different dosing regimens, monitoring strategies, and combination therapies to determine the optimal niche for this new class of drugs in AMD management. Based on emerging evidence, most clinicians are now adopting a variable VEGF inhibitor dosing strategy guided by serial diagnostic re-evaluation by optical coherence tomography. Some are also finding benefit through the addition of photodynamic therapy and steroids to the treatment regimen. The results of current and upcoming trials systematically addressing these issues are expected to establish new guidelines for the management of AMD. Indeed, a new paradigm may emerge wherein numerous modular therapeutic modalities are administered in customized combinations based on specific clinical and diagnostic findings."

The damage to the macula and vision loss in advanced forms of wet AMD stems from choroidal neovascularization that originates in the choroid and proliferates through breaks in the Bruch membrane. Although inhibitors of angiogenesis have been a recent advance in the treatment of AMD associated with neovascularization, these agents do not appear to cure the condition. Rather, antiangiogensis agents halt or slow progression of AMD in most cases. The development of additional treatments to provide more effective disease control may depend on addressing several pathophysiologic processes simultaneously. The search for more effective treatments will require a better understanding of the different physiologic processes involved with this disease process."

A 33-year-old man presented with decreased vision and a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in his left eye of 20/200 due to CME secondary to RP. Although he had been treated daily for 1 month with 500 mg of oral acetazolamide, the edema was unresponsive. When informed of the available treatment options, the patient requested adjunctive intravitreal pegaptanib sodium. One month after receiving an injection of pegaptanib sodium 0.3 mg and continued daily acetazolamide, the patient's BCVA had improved to 20/40. At the 4-month follow-up visit, no recurrence of CME was found on fundus biomicroscopy, fundus-related perimetry, and optical coherence tomography.

CD005139,0,23372421,0,Prospectives for gene therapy of retinal degenerations.,"Retinal degenerations encompass a large number of diseases in which the retina and associated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells progressively degenerate leading to severe visual disorders or blindness. Retinal degenerations can be divided into two groups, a group in which the defect has been linked to a specific gene and a second group that has a complex etiology that includes environmental and genetic influences. The first group encompasses a number of relatively rare diseases with the most prevalent being Retinitis pigmentosa that affects approximately 1 million individuals worldwide. Attempts have been made to correct the defective gene by transfecting the appropriate cells with the wild-type gene and while these attempts have been successful in animal models, human gene therapy for these inherited retinal degenerations has only begun recently and the results are promising. To the second group belong glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). These retinal degenerations have a genetic component since they occur more often in families with affected probands but they are also linked to environmental factors, specifically elevated intraocular pressure, age and high blood sugar levels respectively. The economic and medical impact of these three diseases can be assessed by the number of individuals affected; AMD affects over 30 million, DR over 40 million and glaucoma over 65 million individuals worldwide. The basic defect in these diseases appears to be the relative lack of a neurogenic environment; the neovascularization that often accompanies these diseases has suggested that a decrease in pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), at least in part, may be responsible for the neurodegeneration since PEDF is not only an effective neurogenic and neuroprotective agent but also a potent inhibitor of neovascularization. In the last few years inhibitors of vascularization, especially antibodies against vascular endothelial cell growth factors (VEGF), have been used to prevent the neovascularization that accompanies AMD and DR resulting in the amelioration of vision in a significant number of patients. In animal models it has been shown that transfection of RPE cells with the gene for PEDF and other growth factors can prevent or slow degeneration. A limited number of studies in humans have also shown that transfection of RPE cells in vivo with the gene for PEDF is effective in preventing degeneration and restore vision.

Inhibition of the VEGF signaling pathways is an effective treatment for cancer patients. In addition, local anti- VEGF therapy was developed and established to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion. For systemic administration of anti-VEGF drugs, serious side effects including hypertension or renal disorders have been observed. Evidence suggests that systemic effects might occur or develop in long-term treatment, despite limited resorption and minimal local side effects. Here, only limited data from clinical studies are available. The VEGF system is delicately balanced, and changes might result in deleterious effects. This review provides a brief overview of the VEGF-system, and summarizes its relevance in proliferative eye diseases. The anti-VEGF drugs locally used to treat different disease conditions are discussed with their local and systemic side effects."

CD005139,0,25700714,0,Comparative safety and tolerability of anti-VEGF therapy in age-related macular degeneration.,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness. Over the last decade, the treatment of NVAMD has been revolutionized by the development of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies. Several anti-VEGF medications are used for the treatment of NVAMD. The safety and tolerability of these medications deserve review given the high prevalence of NVAMD and the significant utilization of these medications. Numerous large randomized clinical trials have not shown any definitive differential safety relative to ocular or systemic safety of these medications. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy does appear to impact systemic VEGF levels, but the implications of these changes remain unclear. One unique safety concern relates drug compounding and the potential risks of contamination, specifically for bevacizumab. Continued surveillance for systemic safety concerns, particularly for rare events, is merited. Overall, these medications are well tolerated and effective in the treatment of NVAMD."

CD005139,0,14566975,0,Transforming growth factor-beta induces expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in human retinal pigment epithelial cells: involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major agent in choroidal and retinal neovascularization, events associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), strategically located between retina and choroid, plays a critical role in retinal disorders. We have examined the effects of various growth factors on the expression and secretion of VEGF by human retinal pigment epithelial cell cultures (HRPE). RT-PCR analyses revealed the presence of three isoforms of mRNA corresponding to VEGF 121, 165, and 189 that were up regulated by TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 were the potent inducers of VEGF secretion by HRPE cells whereas bFGF, PDGF, TGF-alpha, and GM-CSF had no effects. TGF-beta receptor type II antibody significantly reversed induction of VEGF secretion by TGF-beta. In contrast activin, inhibin and BMP, members of TGF-beta super family, had no effects on VEGF expression in HRPE. VEGF mRNA levels and protein secretion induced by TGF-beta were significantly inhibited by SB203580 and U0126, inhibitors of MAP kinases, but not by staurosporine and PDTC, protein kinase C and NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors, respectively. TGF-beta also induced VEGF expression by fibroblasts derived from human choroid of eye. TGF-beta induction of VEGF secretion by RPE and choroid cells may play a significant role in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in AMD. Since the secretion of VEGF by HRPE is regulated by MAP kinase pathways, MAP kinase inhibitors may have potential use as therapeutic agents for CNV in AMD."

CD005139,0,24602183,0,"Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies in ophthalmology: current use, controversies and the future.","Use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies was introduced for the treatment of ocular disorders in 2005. In the UK, the current licensed and NICE approved indications are for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), macular oedema secondary to a retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and choroidal neovascularization in pathological myopia. These diagnoses alone account for two-thirds of the main causes of legally registrable visual impairment and blindness. Ranibizumab (Lucentis®; Genentech/Novartis), a drug specifically designed for intraocular use, is the primary licensed medication. Controversially however, clinicians have been using an unlicensed cheaper drug, bevacizumab (Avastin®; Genentech/Roche), originally designed for systemic administration, with a similar mode of action and shown to have a similar efficacy. However, there are fears of greater side effects with bevacizumab though studies have not been sufficiently powered to show statistical difference. In the current global economic climate, anti-VEGF treatment places huge financial and logistical pressure on already strained health care systems. Bevacizumab is considerably more cost effective than ranibizumab, and thus using bevacizumab would widen access to treatment particularly in developing countries. This licensing issue also places clinicians in a difficult medico-legal position especially in Europe, where doctors are duty bound to use a licensed drug for a particular indication if this is available. As the indications of anti-VEGF therapies expand and the cost of health care provision becomes more expensive, the controversies surrounding their use will inevitably become more important."
CD005139,0,16823865,0,An apolipoprotein E variant may protect against age-related macular degeneration through cytokine regulation.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness among the elderly in Western countries. Genetic factors, age, cigarette smoking, nutrition, and exposure to light have been identified as AMD risk factors. In this study, we investigated the association between ApoE C112R/R158C single nucleotide polymorphisms (which determine the E2, E3, and E4 isoforms) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and the mechanism underlying the association. Genomic DNA was extracted from 133 clinically screened controls, 94 volunteers with a younger mean age, 120 patients with advanced AMD, and 40 archived ocular AMD slides for single nucleotide polymorphism typing. The effects of recombinant ApoE isoforms on CCL2 (a chemokine), CX3CR1 (a chemokine receptor), and VEGF (a cytokine) expression in cultured human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells were tested and serum cholesterol profiles of the clinically screened subjects were analyzed. ApoE112R (E4) distribution differed significantly between AMD patients and controls. ApoE112R allele frequency was 10.9% in the AMD group when compared with 16.5% in the younger controls and 18.8% in the clinically screened controls. The pathologically diagnosed archived AMD cases had the lowest allele frequency of 5%. No significant differences in ApoE158C (E2) distribution were observed among the groups. A meta-analysis of 8 cohorts including 4,289 subjects showed a strong association between AMD and 112R, but not 158C. In vitro studies found that recombinant ApoE suppresses CCL2 and VEGF expression in RPE cells. However, the E4 isoform showed more suppression than E3 in both cases. These results further confirm the association between ApoE112R and a decreased risk of AMD development. The underlying mechanisms may involve differential regulation of both CCL2 and VEGF by the ApoE isoforms."

CD005139,0,24130789,0,Topical application of PPADS inhibits complement activation and choroidal neovascularization in a model of age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness among the elderly. AMD patients have elevated levels of membrane attack complex (MAC) in their choroidal blood vessels and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). MAC forms pores in cell membranes. Low levels of MAC result in an elevation of cytokine release such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes the formation of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). High levels of MAC result in cell lysis and RPE degeneration is a hallmark of advanced AMD. The current standard of care for CNV associated with wet AMD is intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF molecules every 4 to 12 weeks. Such injections have significant side effects. Recently, it has been found that membrane pore-forming proteins such as α-haemolysin can mediate their toxic effects through auto- and paracrine signaling and that complement-induced lysis is amplified through ATP release followed by P2X receptor activation. We hypothesized that attenuation of P2X receptor activation may lead to a reduction in MAC deposition and consequent formation of CNV. Hence, in this study we investigated topical application of the purinergic P2X antagonist Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) as a potential treatment for AMD. We found that 4.17 µM PPADS inhibited formation of HUVEC master junctions and master segments by 74.7%. In a human complement mediated cell lysis assay, 104 µM PPADS enabled almost complete protection of Hepa1c1c7 cells from 1% normal human serum mediated cell lysis. Daily topical application of 4.17 mM PPADS for 3 days attenuated the progression of laser induced CNV in mice by 41.8% and attenuated the deposition of MAC at the site of the laser injury by 19.7%. Our data have implications for the future treatment of AMD and potentially other ocular disorders involving CNV such as angioid streaks, choroidal rupture and high myopia."

CD005139,0,18598098,0,Development of vitreous haemorrhage during treatment with bevacizumab for metastatic rectal cancer.,"Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody with activity against vascular endothelial growth factor used in the treatment of various cancers. This case report describes a 68-year-old [corrected] male with rectal cancer who developed a vitreous haemorrhage during treatment with bevacizumab. After vitrectomy the vitreous haemorrhage subsided and visual acuity was restored. The patient had evidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which may have induced the development of vitreous haemorrhage. This implies that AMD might serve as a risk factor for vitreous haemorrhage in cancer patients treated with systemic bevacizumab. Ophthalmological examination to identify AMD lesions may be necessary prior to administration of bevacizumab. Vitrectomy could serve as a management tool for bevacizumab-associated vitreous haemorrhage."

CD005139,0,24505138,0,Doxycycline inhibits polarization of macrophages to the proangiogenic M2-type and subsequent neovascularization.,"Macrophages occur along a continuum of functional states between M1-type polarized macrophages with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity and M2-type polarized macrophages, which have been implicated to promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. Proangiogenic M2-type macrophages promote various pathologic conditions, including choroidal neovascularization in models of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or certain cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Thus, a potential novel therapeutic approach to target pathological angiogenesis in these conditions would be to inhibit the polarization of macrophages toward the proangiogenic M2-type. However, no pharmacological inhibitors of M2-type macrophage polarization have been identified yet. Here we performed an unbiased pharmacological and small chemical screen to identify drugs that inhibit proangiogenic M2-type macrophage polarization and block pathologic macrophage-driven neovascularization. We identified the well tolerated and commonly used antibiotic doxycycline as a potent inhibitor of M2-type polarization of macrophages. Doxycycline inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, M2-type polarization of human and bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages without affecting cell viability. Furthermore, doxycycline inhibited M2-type macrophage polarization and subsequent neovascularization in vivo in a laser injury model of choroidal neovascularization. Thus, doxycycline could be used to enhance current antiangiogenic treatment approaches in various conditions that are promoted by proangiogenic M2-type macrophages, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration and certain cancers."

CD005139,0,26468327,0,The peptidomimetic Vasotide targets two retinal VEGF receptors and reduces pathological angiogenesis in murine and nonhuman primate models of retinal disease.,"Blood vessel growth from preexisting vessels (angiogenesis) underlies many severe diseases including major blinding retinal diseases such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and aged macular degeneration (AMD). This observation has driven development of antibody inhibitors that block a central factor in AMD, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), from binding to its receptors VEGFR-1 and mainly VEGFR-2. However, some patients are insensitive to current anti-VEGF drugs or develop resistance, and the required repeated intravitreal injection of these large molecules is costly and clinically problematic. We have evaluated a small cyclic retro-inverted peptidomimetic, D(Cys-Leu-Pro-Arg-Cys) [D(CLPRC)], and hereafter named Vasotide, that inhibits retinal angiogenesis by binding selectively to the VEGF receptors VEGFR-1 and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Delivery of Vasotide via either eye drops or intraperitoneal injection in a laser-induced monkey model of human wet AMD, a mouse genetic knockout model of the AMD subtype called retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), and a mouse oxygen-induced model of ROP decreased retinal angiogenesis in all three animal models. This prototype drug candidate is a promising new dual receptor inhibitor of the VEGF ligand with potential for translation into safer, less-invasive applications to combat pathological angiogenesis in retinal disorders."
CD005139,0,26501481,0,Fusion Proteins: Aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye).,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors currently used to treat eye diseases have included monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, and an aptamer. A different method of achieving VEGF blockade in retinal diseases includes the concept of a cytokine trap. Cytokine traps are being evaluated for the treatment of various diseases that are driven by excessive cytokine levels. Traps, such as VEGF Trap, consist of two extracellular cytokine receptor domains fused together to form a human IgG. Aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye) is a soluble fusion protein which combines ligand-binding elements taken from the extracellular components of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1 and VEGFR-2 fused to the Fc portion of IgG. This protein contains all human amino-acid sequences, which minimizes the potential for immunogenicity in human patients. The chapter will summarize the chemical properties of aflibercept and the various studies that have demonstrated a role of aflibercept in the management of retinal vascular diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion."

CD005139,0,24972686,0,Ranibizumab: a review of its use in myopic choroidal neovascularization.,"Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) is the first inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A licensed for the treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia (i.e. myopic CNV). The drug inhibits biologically active isoforms of VEGF-A and is administered via intravitreal injection, with the number of treatments required depending on disease activity. The clinical benefit of such a ranibizumab regimen in adults with myopic CNV was demonstrated in a randomized, double-masked, active comparator-controlled, phase III trial known as RADIANCE. In this trial, intravitreal ranibizumab was superior to the standard licensed therapy available to these patients thus far, namely intravenous verteporfin plus photodynamic therapy (verteporfin PDT), in improving visual acuity from month 1 through month 3 of treatment, with improvements in some aspects of vision-related function also evident with ranibizumab versus verteporfin PDT at 3 months. Improvements in vision were sustained for up to 12 months in ranibizumab recipients and were mirrored by improvements in anatomic outcomes. Few ranibizumab injections were required over the trial, with more than 60 % of patients not needing to receive the drug from month 6 to 11.

PCV is the principal vascular composition of patients of pigmented races experiencing neovascular maculopathies, particularly African Americans and Asians. This form of neovascularization is now known to occur in white patients with or without concomitant drusen, and the site of involvement has extended from the peripapillary area to the peripheral fundus. Indocyanine green angiography has made detection of these abnormal vascular changes more reliable and definitive. More precise diagnosis has also led to a better understanding of specific clinical features that distinguish PCV from more typical proliferations of abnormal choroidal vessels. We review the nature of PCV, including its genetic basis, demographic features, histopathology, clinical manifestations, natural course, response to treatments, and the histopathological and genetic bases.

The published results indicate that intravitreal injections of these agents may have a beneficial effect on macular thickness and visual acuity, independent of the type of macular edema that is present. Therefore, pharmacotherapy could complement focal/grid laser photocoagulation in the management of DME. For this review, we performed a literature search and summarized recent findings regarding combined therapy for DME."

The patient was followed-up with fluorescein angiography (FA) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). On referral, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/60 in the right eye and Counting Fingers in the left eye. FA revealed foveal leakage in both eyes.

BCVA was 6/15 and 6/30 one month after the last injection. OCT revealed significant improvement (DME elimination and significant CME improvement) in both eyes, despite the fact that only the left eye was treated.

CD005139,0,26678602,0,Targeting VEGF in eye neovascularization: What's new?: A comprehensive review on current therapies and oligonucleotide-based interventions under development.,"Roughly ten years ago the FDA approved most of the presently used anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of neovascular AMD and other eye pathologies characterized by ocular neoangiogenesis. However, the recent findings on the physiologic activities of VEGF isoforms impose to reconsider the inhibitory effects of pan-VEGF antagonists and the concept that to face pathological alterations at ocular level is possible only through the full block of all VEGF isoforms. In fact, although pan-VEGF agents rapidly and effectively contrast ocular neovascularization, vascular leakage, and other pathological changes, in the long-term the inhibition of all VEGF isoforms likely may result in the loss of the physiologic effects exerted by VEGF121 and the anti-angiogenic VEGF165b. Notably, selective inhibitors of VEGF165a, such as pegaptanib, spare these targets. Moreover, preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that also systemic side effects, secondary to intraocular treatment with non-selective anti-VEGF drugs, may be reinterpreted in light of these recent findings, which may be useful to clinicians for the choice of the most appropriate anti-VEGF agent. Another aspect that should be considered is the involvement of VEGF-independent pathways in ocular neovascularization, therefore a combined therapy can represent a more effective pharmacological approach that might help also to counteract tachyphylaxis, an important issue in anti-VEGF treatment. This complex picture and the recent findings on current anti-VEGF drugs should be therefore taken into account to guide the development of novel agents targeting VEGF and/or other key factors involved in the pathogenesis of neovascular ocular diseases along the signaling pathways stimulated by the various isoforms. Accordingly, this review also reports on novel pharmacological molecules targeting VEGF at ocular level and currently under development, with a special attention to oligonucleotide-based interventions."

CD005139,0,19287467,0,New paradigms in the treatment of wet AMD: the impact of anti-VEGF therapy.,"The incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the United Kingdom is increasing with the ageing population. The wet form of this progressive and potentially blinding disease can develop very rapidly and lead to severe loss of central vision and reduction in quality of life, sometimes in just a matter of weeks. Recent advances in the treatment of wet AMD with the licensing of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies, coupled with current guidance from the Scottish Medicines Consortium and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence have led to a subsequent increase in workload at AMD clinics due to the increased number of patients now eligible for treatment. In addition, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists recommend a 2-week diagnosis to treatment schedule due to the aggressive nature of the disease. The role of the retinal specialist is thus changing, and business management skills are becoming increasingly necessary to obtain the necessary resources to implement the guidance. Through prior experience and formal external evaluation of services at Frimley Park and Harrogate District Hospitals, a number of critical success factors have been developed for optimising treatment pathways in efficient wet AMD clinics."

The goals of treatment after Y1 are to maintain visual and anatomical gains whilst minimising treatment burden and using resources effectively. The treatment decision should be made at the seventh injection visit (assuming the label has been followed) in Y1, and three approaches are proposed: (a) eyes with active disease on imaging/examination but with stable visual acuity (VA) at the end of Y1 should continue with fixed 8-weekly dosing; (b) eyes with inactive disease on imaging/examination and stable VA should be managed using a 'treat and extend' (T&E) regimen. T&E involves treating and then extending the interval until the next treatment, by 2-week intervals, to a maximum of 12 weeks, provided the disease remains inactive. If there is new evidence of disease activity, treatment is administered and the interval to the next treatment shortened; and (c) if there has been no disease activity for ≥3 consecutive visits, a trial of monitoring without treatment may be appropriate, initiated at the end of Y1 or at any time during Y2. Where possible, VA testing, OCT imaging and injection should be performed at the same visit. The second eye should be monitored to detect fellow eye involvement. In bilateral disease, the re-treatment interval should be driven by the better-seeing eye or, if the VA is similar, the eye with the more active disease."

CD005139,0,26242766,0,Diabetic Macular Edema: Options for Adjunct Therapy.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease that affects 387 million people worldwide. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common complication of DM, is the main cause of blindness in the active population. Diabetic macular edema (DME) may occur at any stage of DR, and is characterized by vascular hyperpermeability accompanied by hard exudates within the macula. Medical and surgical therapies have dramatically reduced the progression of DR, and timely intervention can reduce the risk of severe vision loss by more than 90 %. In 2012, intravitreal ranibizumab became the first antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent approved for DME and, since then, many reports of the use of ranibizumab for DME have been promising. Randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trials-most notably, RESOLVE, READ-2, RISE/RIDE, RESTORE, DRCR.net protocol I, and RETAIN-reported improvements in best-corrected visual acuity and decreased central retinal thickness as measured with optical coherence tomography in patients with DME. Similar treatment benefits have also been noted in clinical trials evaluating intravitreal aflibercept and bevacizumab (DAVINCI, VISTA/VIVID, and BOLT) and more recently DRCR.net protocol T. Intravitreal steroids (dexamethasone intravitreal implant and fluocinolone acetonide), particularly in refractory cases, also play a significant role in the management of DME (MEAD/CHAMPLAIN and FAMOUS/FAME studies). In summary, over the last 5 years, blocking VEGF and inflammation has been shown to improve visual outcomes in patients with macular edema due to DM, revolutionizing the treatment of center-involved DME and establishing a new standard of care."

CD005139,0,28427068,0,Intravitreal Steroids in Diabetic Macular Edema.,"Over the past decade, great strides have been made in the management of diabetic macular edema (DME). Therapeutic alternatives now include focal/grid laser photocoagulation, vitreo-retinal surgery, and intraocular injection of anti-angiogenic and steroid molecules. Intravitreal administration of steroids represents a fundamental alternative for recalcitrant and naive eyes with DME, especially in those cases when anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are contraindicated or a treatment regimen with fewer intravitreal injections is required. Currently, 3 intravitreal corticosteroid options for DME treatment are available: the dexamethasone delivery system, the fluocinolone acetonide insert, and off-label intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. All 3 agents are associated with risk of cataract progression and intraocular pressure elevation, but they maintain a good safety profile. In patients who remain unresponsive to anti-VEGF therapy, are pseudophakic, at low risk for glaucoma, or who have significant cardiovascular risk, treatment with long-lasting intraocular steroids is suggested. There still remain many unanswered questions about intravitreal drugs, regarding dose, frequency, the correct regimen of each treatment, and the potential long-term side effects."

CD005139,0,18076206,0,The therapeutic potential of VEGF inhibition in diabetic microvascular complications.,"During the last few years, the incidence of microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus has rapidly increased as a consequence of both an increase in incidence of type 2 and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular complications is still largely unknown. Among the many hypotheses, a dysfunction in angiogenesis has been suggested as a common origin for retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Based on this hypothesis, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been tested as a potential therapeutic approach to prevent and cure diabetic microvascular complications. Several VEGF inhibitors are currently under evaluation or are approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration and macular edema. These include inhibitors of intracellular transcription of VEGF (e.g. bevasiranib), inhibitors of extracellular VEGF (e.g. pegaptanib), inhibitors of VEGF receptor expression (e.g. aflibercept [VEGF-TRAP]) and inhibitors of the intracellular signaling cascade activating VEGF (e.g. midostaurin). According to the existing evidence base, although inhibition of VEGF results in a better outcome in the case of diabetic retinopathy and also, despite some discrepant results, in the case of diabetic nephropathy, there is no final confirmation that VEGF inhibition is a valid approach for diabetic neuropathy. The latter complication actually, in line with other chronic neuropathies, seems to improve with stimulation of angiogenesis through increased expression of VEGF."

The proliferation of endothelium and formation of new blood vessels further the size of solid tumors. It is expected that blocking angiogenesis will be an efficient therapeutic approach against many tumor types. The key signaling system that regulates proliferation and migration of endothelial cells are vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) and their receptors (VEGFR-1, -2 and -3). VEGFR-2, a receptor with higher affinity and greater kinase activity, is more important in the direct regulation of angiogenesis, mitogenic signaling, and permeability-enhancing effects. VEGFRs are expressed at high levels in many types of human solid tumors, including glioma, lung, breast, renal, ovarian and gastrointestinal tract carcinomas. Inhibition of VEGFR has emerged as a potential therapy method for cancers and it has been clinically validated with FDA-approvals of bevacizumab, sorafenib, and suntinib. Consequently, a number of small molecules with VEGFR inhibitory properties have been developed. Many of these have been evaluated as potent inhibitors and some are currently in clinical-trials for various angiogenic related disorders including inflammatory diseases, retinopathies and age related macular degeneration. This review reports various VEGF/VEGFR pathway inhibitors such as small molecules and monoclonal antibodies, along with their reported activities."

CD005139,0,20964459,0,Current approaches to the management of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness in Europe and North America, and the incidence is expected to increase in parallel with the rising incidence of diabetes mellitus. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical presentation and pathophysiology of DR and its principal associated complications, diabetic macular oedema (DME) and neovascularization, and then proceeds to the primary focus of clinical management. A series of major randomized controlled trials conducted over the past few decades has confirmed that tight glycaemic regulation is the most effective measure to reduce the risk of developing DR and to minimize the likelihood of its progression, and that control of blood pressure is also an important feature of preventive management. Laser-based therapies remain the cornerstone of treatment, with panretinal photocoagulation indicated for proliferative and severe nonproliferative DR and focal photocoagulation indicated for treatment of DME. For patients who do not benefit from these approaches, vitrectomy may provide therapeutic benefits. Medical therapies include two broad classes of agents: anti-inflammatory drugs and agents with molecular targets. The utility of oral anti-inflammatory drugs remains to be established, as dose-finding studies have yet to provide definitive conclusions. Intravitreal corticosteroids may be of value in specific circumstances, although adverse effects include cataract progression and elevated intraocular pressure. However, these complications appear to have been limited with new extended-release technologies. With respect to molecular targets, evidence has been adduced for the roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and protein kinase C (PKC)-β2 in the pathogenesis of DR, and agents targeting these factors are under intense investigation. The role of VEGF in mediating pathological angiogenesis and vascular hyperpermeability has been best defined. Preliminary efficacy of pegaptanib and ranibizumab in the treatment of DME is being confirmed in additional clinical trials with these agents and with the off-label use of bevacizumab, another monoclonal antibody related to ranibizumab. Moreover, other agents targeting VEGF, as well as drugs directed against TNFα and PKC-β2, are under study. Evaluation of the ultimate utility of these approaches will await the efficacy and safety results of properly designed phase III trials."

However, this agent, like others with the same mechanism, has several limitations. Although ranibizumab preserves vision in almost all patients, only a fraction achieves a halving of the visual angle. By inhibiting the activities of VEGF, ranibizumab blocks the continued growth of choroidal neovascularization, but existing neovascular lesions do not regress. Further, ranibizumab addresses only the increased production of VEGF; it does not address the underlying cause of enhanced cytokine production. Although ranibizumab is well tolerated, the course of the disease is unpredictable, necessitating frequent patient monitoring and treatment. Although strategies that guide retreatment based on the reoccurrence of retinal edema can be used to reduce treatment burden, this strategy may not provide optimal patient benefit. Because of these limitations, the identification of effective adjunctive therapies is considered an urgent goal."
CD005139,0,25245600,0,"The influence of anti-VEGF therapy on present day management of macular edema due to BRVO and CRVO: a longitudinal analysis on visual function, injection time interval and complications.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of intravitreal bevacizumab injections on the management and outcome of patients affected by retinal vein occlusions, their effectiveness on morphological and functional parameters, the modalities of long-term management and the need for additional laser treatment due to ischemic retinal evolution. Patients diagnosed with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) had a comprehensive work-up including complete ophthalmic examination, fluorangiography (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual field testing (VFT), microperimetry (MP), and laser flare photometry (LFP). In case of BRVO, intraocular bevacizumab injection was performed if significant macular edema/visual deficit was still present 3 months after onset of occlusion and injections were started at presentation in case of CRVO. Post-injection follow-up examination including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), LFP, OCT, MP, and VFT were performed monthly and recorded at the end of follow-up. Follow-up FA was performed between 12 and 18 months after diagnosis. Injections were repeated in case of recurrence of a significant central macular edema. Patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to number of injections: 1-4 injections or more than 4 injections. The proportion of resolved cases (no recurrence after a minimum follow-up of 12 months) was calculated and correlated with number of injections. In patients needing sustained injections, management modalities were recorded. The proportion of patients having needed laser photocoagulation treatment because of significant ischemic signs was recorded. Fifty-one patients were diagnosed with retinal vein occlusion between 2006 and 2012 at the Centre for Specialized Ophthalmic Care (COS) in Lausanne, Switzerland. Forty-four had enough data and were included in the study. Nine eyes were affected by CRVO and 35 were affected by BRVO. Mean BCVA at presentation was 0.24 ± 0.2 and improved to 0.81 ± 0.38 (p < 0.01) at 48 months. MP improved from 184.9 ± 92 to 362.5 ± 56.2 (p < 0.01) at 42 months follow-up. The number of injections varied from 1 to 25 (mean 5.5 ± 5.43). 31/44 eyes received 1-4 injections (group 1) of which all were recurrence free, with a follow-up of at least 1 years in all. 13/44 eyes received more than 5 injections (group 2) with functional and morphological parameters maintained in 9/13 but only 1/13 patients showed resolution. Rhythm of injection varied from one patient to another but 8/13 patients needing continuous injections had a constant time interval between injections. In 8/44 patients, laser photocoagulation had to be performed due to ischemic complications. The visual outcome using bevacizumab intravitreal injection was exceptionally good and functional parameters such as BCVA, MP, and VFT improved significantly. In about two-thirds of patients, resolution was obtained after 1-4 injections. In one-third of patients, continuous injections were necessary but a constant rhythm for re-injection for each patient could be established allowing to reduce to a minimum follow-up visits. The absence of significant side effects allowed to re-treat apparently without limitation achieving maintained visual function. FA monitoring for the detection of ischemic complications should not be neglected especially in cases where bevacizumab could be discontinued."

CD005139,0,24699803,0,Ocular inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress are attenuated by supplementation with grape polyphenols in human retinal pigmented epithelium cells and in C57BL/6 mice.,"Inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are common denominators for vision-threatening diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Based on our previous study, supplementation with muscadine grape polyphenols (MGPs) alleviated systemic insulin resistance and proinflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that MGPs would also be effective in attenuating ocular inflammation and ER stress. We tested this hypothesis using the human retinal pigmented epithelium (ARPE-19) cells and C57BL/6 mice. In ARPE-19 cells, tumor necrosis factor-α-induced proinflammatory gene expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 was decreased by 35.0%, 68.8%, and 62.5%, respectively, with MGP pretreatment, which was primarily due to the diminished mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and subsequent reduction of nuclear factor κ-B activation. Consistently, acute ocular inflammation and leukocyte infiltration were almost completely dampened (>95%) by MGP supplementation (100-200 mg/kg body weight) in C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, MGPs reduced inflammation-mediated loss of tight junctions and retinal permeability. To further investigate the protective roles of MGPs against ER stress, ARPE-19 cells were stimulated with thapsigargin. Pretreatment with MGPs significantly decreased the following: 1) ER stress-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor secretion (3.47 ± 0.06 vs. 1.58 ± 0.02 μg/L, P < 0.0001), 2) unfolded protein response, and 3) early apoptotic cell death (64.4 ± 6.85 vs. 33.7 ± 4.32%, P = 0.0003). Collectively, we have demonstrated that MGP is effective in attenuating ocular inflammation and ER stress. Our work also suggests that MGP may provide a novel dietary strategy to prevent vision-threatening retinal diseases."
CD005139,0,25925045,0,[Aflibercept. An approach to pharmacology].,"Aflibercept is a fusion protein whose chemical structure combines the constant fraction of any IgG with a variable fraction constructed with fundamental parts of VEGF receptors. Consequently, it is able to bind to various VEGF as well as to placental growth factor (PIGF), which has been related to a possible synergistic effect in efficacy. The affinity of this drug is higher than that of ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Moreover, it has an intraocular antiinflammatory effect. Intravitreal administration leads to the presence of traces of the drug in plasma but the concentrations are so reduced that the presence of systemic adverse effects, including arterial hypertension, is practically nil. Because of its prolonged intraocular elimination half-life and high affinity, the drug can be administered in convenient regimens, since, after an initial monthly injection for the first three doses, the interval between injections is increased to one every two months and, after the first 12 months, the dosing will depend on the visual and anatomical results."

They scavenge reactive oxygen species and act as an oxygen buffer. Their application in industry is well-established. However, their usage as bona fide antioxidants in biological systems has been recent and is quite revolutionary. Other reviews have documented nanoceria's protective effect in reducing oxidative stress in cell culture and in animal disease models that are associated with oxidative stress. We specifically have targeted CeNPs as ophthalmic therapeutics to slow the progression of retinal degeneration and as anti-angiogenic agents in rodent models. The radical scavenging activity of CeNPs is mainly due to the dramatic increase of surface area to volume ratio in these nanocrystalline structures. The parameters for CeNPs usage in industrial settings are decidedly not suitable for biological applications. In this short review, we report the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and toxicity evaluation of CeNPs when applied as ophthalmic therapeutic agents in an in vivo system. We highlight studies that examine how CeNPs behave in biological environments and how they interact with bio-macromolecules.

Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is a vasoactive factor and has been implicated in proliferative retinopathies. In this study, we examined the mechanism of action and efficacy of topical application of HL-217 on subretinal neovascularization in very low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Vldlr(-/-)) mice. In three-week-old male Vldlr(-/-) mice, HL-217 (1.5 or 3mg/ml) was administered twice per day for 4 weeks by topical eye drop instillation. Neovascular areas were then measured. We used a protein array to evaluate the expression levels of angiogenic factors. The inhibitory effect of HL-217 on the PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ interaction was evaluated in vitro. The neovascular area in the Vldlr(-/-) mice was significantly reduced by HL-217. Additionally, HL-217 decreased the expression levels of PDGF-BB protein and VEGF mRNA. Moreover, HL-217 dose-dependently inhibited the PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ interaction (IC50=38.9 ± 0.7 μM). These results suggest that HL-217 is a potent inhibitor of PDGF-BB. HL-217, when applied topically, is an effective inhibitor of subretinal neovascularization due to its ability to inhibit the pro-angiogenic effects of PDGF-BB."

CD005139,0,26797889,0,[Placenta Growth Factor (PlGF) and Retinal Vascular Diseases--Current Knowledge from Experimental and Clinical Studies].,"Pathological angiogenesis is a major characteristic of many diseases, such as cancer and retinal vascular disorders. Vascular diseases of the eye, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and neo-vascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), are the main cause of severe vision loss. The specific role of the cytokine VEGF-A in these pathologies has been proven in many ways. Thus, VEGF-A is still the major target for antiangiogenic therapy. Recently, another angiogenic factor, the placental growth factor (PlGF), has become a focal point for clinical research. This interest is based on the fact that the expression of PlGF is limited to embryonic development and PlGF can hardly be found in healthy tissues. During pathological angiogenetic processes, such as retinal vascular diseases, however, PlGF is increasingly expressed. Substances which inhibit the effect of PlGF and thus pathological angiogenesis, without simultaneously affecting healthy tissues, could significantly extend the therapeutic options for the treatment of retinal vascular diseases. Convincing results have recently been published from clinical trials in oncology, as well as preclinical investigations in animal models of retinal vascular diseases. The aim of this review is to summarise the role of PlGF in retinal vascular diseases and the available experimental data on the therapeutic potential of PlGF inhibitors."

The INTREPID trial suggested that SRT could reduce the frequency of regular intravitreal injections (IVIs) with antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs, which are necessary to control disease activity. However, the efficacy of SRT in nAMD and resulting morphological changes have not been validated under real-life circumstances, an issue, which we would like to address in this retrospective analysis.Patients who met the INTREPID criteria for best responders were eligible for SRT. A total of 32 eyes of 32 patients were treated. Thereafter, patients were examined monthly for 12 months and received pro re nata IVI of aflibercept or ranibizumab. Outcome measures were: mean number of injections, best-corrected visual acuity, and morphological changes of the outer retina-choroid complex as well as patient safety.Mean number of IVI decreased by almost 50% during the 12 months after SRT compared to the year before, whereas visual acuity increased by one line (logMAR).

This prospective study comprised 109 eyes of 109 adult cases who had IV bevacizumab or ranibizumab injections because of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), retinal venous occlusion (RVO), diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema or central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). None of the cases had medical histories of any kinds of glaucoma or increased IOP and IV injection before and all of them underwent a detailed ocular examination including measurements of IOP by non-contact tonometer and CCT by ultrasonic pachymeter pre-injection. IOP measurements were repeated at 30 min and 1st, 7th, and 30th day after the injection. CCT measurements were repeated at the 7th and 30th post-injection day. Paired sample t tests were used for the statistical analysis in order to evaluate the significance of changes in IOP and CCT. The mean age of 56 male and 53 female cases was 63.58 ± 11.04 years. Fifty-six cases (51.4 %) had diabetic retinopathy, 33 cases (30.3 %) had ARMD, 11 cases (10.1 %) had RVO, and 9 cases (8.3 %) had CSCR. Bevacizumab was used in 97 (89 %) cases and ranibizumab was used in 12 (11 %) cases. The IOP increased significantly 30 min after the injection (p < 0.001) but significant decreases were observed at the 1st, 7th, and 30th day post-injection (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in CCT between pre-injection and 7th and 30th post-injection day values (p = 0.924 and p = 0.589, respectively). Intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections can cause hyper acute increase in IOP because of vitreal expansion but this effect is generally reversible in non-glaucomatous cases."

The pathogenesis of AMD is known to have a genetic component, but it is unclear if any particular genotype can predict response to anti-VEGF therapy. With the advent of less expensive genotyping technology, there have been numerous studies within this area. Here we analyze potential biomarker candidates identified that could be used in a clinical setting to predict response to anti-VEGF treatment of nAMD. We analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from 39 publications. The SNPs that appeared to be of most importance fell into two main groups: those previously associated with AMD pathogenesis and those within the signaling pathway targeted by anti-VEGF therapies. A number of small studies found evidence supporting an association between anti-VEGF treatment response and two SNPs, CFH rs1061170 and VEGFA rs699947, but results from randomized controlled trials found no such association. It is possible that, in the future, the cumulative effect of several high-risk SNPs may prove useful in a clinical setting and that other genetic biomarkers may emerge."

It is a common cause of irreversible central vision loss, and severely affects the quality of life in the patients with pathologic myopia. The traditional therapeutic modalities for CNV secondary to pathologic myopia include thermal laser photocoagulation, surgical management, transpupillary thermotherapy, and photodynamic therapy with verteporfin. However, the long-term outcomes of these modalities are disappointing. Recently, intravitreal administration of anti-VEGF biological agents, including bevacizumab, ranibizumab, pegaptanib, aflibercept, and conbercept, has demonstrated promising outcomes for this ocular disease. The anti-VEGF regimens are more effective on improving visual acuity, reducing central fundus thickness and central retina thickness than the traditional modalities. These anti-VEGF agents thus hold the potential to become the first-line medicine for treatment of CNV secondary to pathologic myopia. This review follows the trend of ""from bench to bedside"", initially discussing the pathogenesis of myopic CNV, delineating the molecular structures and mechanisms of action of the currently available anti-VEGF drugs, and then systematically comparing the up to date clinical applications as well as the efficacy and safety of the anti-VEGF drugs to the CNV secondary to pathologic myopia."

CD005139,0,17532250,0,Transplantation of the RPE in AMD.,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) maintains retinal function as the metabolic gatekeeper between photoreceptors (PRs) and the choriocapillaries. The RPE and Bruch's membrane (BM) suffer cumulative damage over lifetime, which is thought to induce age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in susceptible individuals. Unlike palliative pharmacologic treatments, replacement of the RPE has a curative potential for AMD. This article reviews mechanisms leading to RPE dysfunction in aging and AMD, laboratory studies on RPE transplantation, and surgical techniques used in AMD patients. Future strategies using ex vivo steps prior to transplantation, BM prosthetics, and stem cell applications are discussed. The functional peculiarity of the macular region, epigenetic phenomena leading to an age-related shift in protein expression, along with the accumulation of lipofuscin may affect the metabolism in the central RPE. Thickening of BM with age decreases its hydraulic conductivity. Drusen are deposits of extracellular material and formed in part by activation of the alternative complement pathway in individuals carrying a mutant allele of complement factor H. AMD likely represents an umbrella term for a disease entity with multifactorial etiology and manifestations. Presently, a slow progressing (dry) non-neovascular atrophic form and a rapidly blinding neovascular (wet) form are discerned. No therapy is currently available for the former, while RPE transplantation and promising (albeit non-causal) anti-angiogenic therapies are available for the latter. The potential of RPE transplantation was demonstrated in animal models. Rejection of allogeneic homologous transplants in patients focused further studies on autologous sources. In vitro studies elucidated cell adhesion and wound healing mechanisms on aged human BM. Currently, autologous RPE, harvested from the midperiphery, is being transplanted as a cell suspension or a patch of RPE and choroid in AMD patients. These techniques have been evaluated from several groups. Autologous RPE transplants may have the disadvantage of carrying the same genetic information that may have led to AMD manifestation. An intermittent culturing step would allow for in vitro therapy of the RPE, its rejuvenation and prosthesis of BM to improve the success RPE transplants. Recent advances in stem cell biology when combined with lessons learned from studies of RPE transplantation are intriguing future therapeutic modalities for AMD patients."

CD005139,0,15892078,0,Clinical outcomes and mechanism of action for rheopheresis treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).,"The primary goals are to provide a comprehensive explanation of the potential role of therapeutic apheresis in the treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Initial clinical results with this technique and a summary of current literature that addresses the mechanism of action for the Rheopheresis approach are presented. Rheopheresis has been found to be a safe and effective application of double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) for extracorporeal hemorheotherapy. In this report, it is proposed that Rheopheresis results in an immediate decrease in the proportion of high molecular weight proteins that could combine with the TIMP-3 fibulin complex allowing for the barely functioning retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to function better and diminish the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Interim results from the randomized, double-masked MIRA-1 clinical trial include (1) improved vision restoration; 28.0% of Treated Primary Eyes increased by > or = 2 lines of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared to 18.2% of Placebo Eyes; (2) a decline in progressive vision loss; 0.0% of treated eyes progressing to worse than 20/200 vision over the 12-month study compared to 18.2% of Placebo Eyes; (3) 57.9% of Treatment Eyes obtained improvement in their BCVA to 20/40 or better (driver's license qualification), compared to only 14.3% of Placebo Eyes 12-month post-treatment. Rheopheresis treatment shows strong promise as a viable clinical option for patients suffering from the dry form of AMD in terms of minimizing vision loss, vision restoration, and overall quality of life factors. Expanded clinical outcomes from the ongoing MIRA-1 clinical study will be valuable in the assessment of this new clinical tool for ophthalmic applications."

CD005139,0,25562624,0,Pigment epithelium-derived factor inhibits retinal microvascular dysfunction induced by 12/15-lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids.,"We recently demonstrated that 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX) derived metabolites, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), contribute to diabetic retinopathy (DR) via NADPH oxidase (NOX) and disruption of the balance in retinal levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Here, we test whether PEDF ameliorates retinal vascular injury induced by HETEs and the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we pursue the causal relationship between LOX-NOX system and regulation of PEDF expression during DR. For these purposes, we used an experimental eye model in which normal mice were injected intravitreally with 12-HETE with/without PEDF. Thereafter, fluorescein angiography (FA) was used to evaluate the vascular leakage, followed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess the presence of angiogenesis. FA and OCT reported an increased vascular leakage and pre-retinal neovascularization, respectively, in response to 12-HETE that were not observed in the PEDF-treated group. Moreover, PEDF significantly attenuated the increased levels of vascular cell and intercellular adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, elicited by 12-HETE injection. Accordingly, the direct relationship between HETEs and PEDF has been explored through in-vitro studies using Müller cells (rMCs) and human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs). The results showed that 12- and 15-HETEs triggered the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6, as well as activation of NFκB in rMCs and significantly increased permeability and reduced zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) immunoreactivity in HRECs. All these effects were prevented in PEDF-treated cells. Furthermore, interest in PEDF regulation during DR has been expanded to include NOX system.

CD005139,0,21311657,0,Radiation therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies represent the standard of care for most patients presenting with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (neovascular AMD). Anti-VEGF drugs require repeated injections and impose a considerable burden of care, and not all patients respond. Radiation targets the proliferating cells that cause neovascular AMD, including fibroblastic, inflammatory, and endothelial cells. Two new neovascular AMD radiation treatments are being investigated: epimacular brachytherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery. Epimacular brachytherapy uses beta radiation, delivered to the lesion via a pars plana vitrectomy. Stereotactic radiosurgery uses low voltage X-rays in overlapping beams, directed onto the lesion. Feasibility data for epimacular brachytherapy show a greatly reduced need for anti-VEGF therapy, with a mean vision gain of 8.9 ETDRS letters at 12 months. Pivotal trials are underway (MERLOT, CABERNET). Preliminary stereotactic radiosurgery data suggest a mean vision gain of 8 to 10 ETDRS letters at 12 months. A large randomized sham controlled stereotactic radiosurgery feasibility study is underway (CLH002), with pivotal trials to follow. While it is too early to conclude on the safety and efficacy of epimacular brachytherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery, preliminary results are positive, and these suggest that radiation offers a more durable therapeutic effect than intraocular injections."

Sixty NTG patients, 66 HTG patients and 44 control subjects underwent CDI evaluation of the ophthalmic artery (OA), short posterior ciliary artery (SPCA) and central retinal arteries (CRA). The peak systolic velocities (PSV) and end-diastolic velocities (EDV) and resistive index (RI) of all retrobulbar vessels were measured. The latency and amplitude of P100 in P-VEP were recorded from the three groups. The differences of CDI and P-VEP parameters among NTG group, HTG group and control group were compared by one-way analysis of variance. The correlations between CDI parameters and visual field indices, P-VEP and visual field indices, P-VEP and CDI parameters in NTG and HTG patients were evaluated by Pearson's correlation analysis. NTG and HTG patients had the lower EDV and higher RI in the OA, CRA and SPCA comparing with that of control subjects. NTG and HTG patients also had lower PSV in OA and CRA comparing with that of control subjects. There was no significant difference in the blood flow velocities and RI of all retrobulbar vessels between NTG and HTG patients. The latency of P100 in VEP delayed and the amplitude of P100 decreased in the NTG and HTG patients comparing with that of the control group.

Several therapies have been introduced that show promise for halting the progression of this disorder. However, data from controlled clinical trials to test the relative efficacy of different management strategies across the subtypes of disease remain limited. New treatment modalities that target the neovascularization process, including leakage from choroidal neovascularization (CNV), are currently being developed. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated as a key mediator in the pathogenesis of ARMD-related CNV. Anti-VEGF strategies show promise as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of CNV and are currently undergoing active clinical investigation. Such strategies include anti-VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGF aptamer, gene therapy and protein kinase C inhibition. This article reviews the mechanism of action and rationale for anti-VEGF drugs in ARMD."

CD005139,0,27778249,0,Targeting Tie2 for Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema.,"Tie2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor located predominantly on vascular endothelial cells that plays a central role in vascular stability. Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt1), produced by perivascular cells, binds, clusters, and activates Tie2, leading to Tie2 autophosphorylation and downstream signaling. Activated Tie2 increases endothelial cell survival, adhesion, and cell junction integrity, thereby stabilizing the vasculature. Angiopoietin-2 (Angpt2) and vascular endothelial-protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) are negative regulators increased by hypoxia; they inactivate Tie2, destabilizing the vasculature and increasing responsiveness to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other inflammatory cytokines that stimulate vascular leakage and neovascularization. AKB-9778 is a small-molecule antagonist of VE-PTP which increases phosphorylation of Tie2 even in the presence of high Angpt2 levels. In preclinical studies, AKB-9778 reduced VEGF-induced leakage and ocular neovascularization (NV) and showed additive benefit when combined with VEGF suppression. In two clinical trials in diabetic macular edema (DME) patients, subcutaneous injections of AKB-9778 were safe and provided added benefit to VEGF suppression. Preliminary data suggest that AKB-9778 monotherapy improves diabetic retinopathy. These data suggest that Tie2 activation may be a valuable strategy to treat or prevent diabetic retinopathy."

Recent approval of ranibizumab by the European Medicines Agency to treat visual impairment due to DME fulfils the previously unmet medical need for a treatment that can improve visual acuity (VA) in these patients. We reviewed 1- and 2-year clinical trial findings for ranibizumab used as treatment for DME to formulate evidence-based treatment recommendations in the context of this new therapy. DME with or without visual impairment should be considered for treatment when it fulfils the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) criteria for clinically significant oedema. For DME with centre involvement and associated vision loss due to DME, monthly ranibizumab monotherapy with treatment interruption and re-initiation based on VA stability is recommended. Laser therapy based on ETDRS guidelines is recommended for other forms of clinically significant DME without centre involvement or when no vision loss has occurred, despite centre involvement. Because these recommendations are based on randomised controlled trials of 1-2 years duration, guidance may need updating as long-term ranibizumab data become available and as additional therapeutic agents are assessed in clinical trials."

CD005139,0,19736847,0,"Clinical, legal and ethical implications of the intra-ocular (off-label) use of bevacizumab (avastin)--a South African perspective.","Choroidal neovascularisation is a potentially visually devastating element of various forms of eye pathology. Recent research has focused on neurovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as a cause. AMD can be classified as being exudative (wet) or atrophic (dry). Wet AMD is characterised by a pathological process in which new blood vessels develop in the choroids, causing leakage of fluid and haemorrhage under the retina and leading to localised serous detachment and loss of central vision. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates growth of neovascular membranes. Treatments have until recently yielded disappointing results. Ophthalmologists are using intra-ocular injections of bevacizumab (Avastin), an anti-VEGF, to treat AMD. Avastin appears to be safe and effective in the short term, but its intra-ocular administration is entirely off-label. Avastin is registered for treating metastatic colorectal and breast cancer. The off-label use of medication is an important part of mainstream, legitimate medical practice worldwide. Lawyers representing plaintiffs injured by drugs increasingly encounter off-label use claims. From a legal/ethical point of view the off-label use of medication represents a delicate balance between the statutory regulation of medication and a physician's prerogative to prescribe medication that in his or her medical opinion will be beneficial to the patient. The main reason for the controversy created by the off-label use of Avastin is that there are anti-VEGF drugs on the market that have formal approval for the treatment of AMD (and other eye conditions). Lucentis, for example, is extremely expensive, with treatment cost approximately 50 times that of Avastin. Many patients suffering from AMD and macular oedema cannot afford the registered product. The off-label use of Avastin has passed the innovative or experimental stages, as ophthalmologists have used it regularly and openly for a long time, with good success. Such use therefore cannot be considered careless, imprudent or unprofessional. We submit that an ophthalmologist who omits to inform a patient of the availability of Avastin for this form of treatment may be found to be negligent. Protocols developed by the South African Vitreoretinal Society and endorsed by the Ophthalmological Society of South Africa for administering Avastin and other intra-ocular medication intravitreally should be strictly adhered to."

The regularities of retinal functional changes in the early and late periods after mono- and combined therapy are considered. The informative value of various electroretinographic studies was compared in the evaluation of retinal functional changes after therapy and in the prediction of its efficiency. Multifocal electroretinography is today of the greatest value among other conventional methods; however, there is a need for searching for new objective indicators that enable assessment of progress in the treatment of neovascular ARMD and optimization of indications for this or that treatment, particularly when new and expensive technologies of treating CNV emerge."
CD005139,0,21443427,0,Gene transfer for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex disease that has two phases: a degenerative phase often referred to as nonneovascular AMD (non-NVAMD) or dry AMD and a phase dominated by growth of new blood vessels in the subretinal space, referred to as NVAMD or wet AMD. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of NVAMD have led to new drug therapies that have provided major benefits to patients. However, those treatments require frequent intraocular injections that in many patients must be continued indefinitely to maintain visual benefits. Gene transfer to augment expression of endogenous antiangiogenic proteins is an alternative approach that has the potential to provide long-term stability in patients with NVAMD. Studies in animal models that mimic aspects of NVAMD have identified several possible transgenes, and a clinical trial in patients with advanced NVAMD has suggested that the approach may be feasible. Many important questions remain, but the rationale and preliminary data are compelling. The results of two ongoing clinical trials may answer several of the questions and help direct future research."

CD005139,0,17024968,0,Preclinical evaluation of an anti-alpha5beta1 integrin antibody as a novel anti-angiogenic agent.,"Integrin alpha5beta1, the principal fibronectin receptor, is an important survival factor, playing a key role in angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is critical for tumor growth, and anti-angiogenic therapies have met clinical success. To validate the therapeutic potential of an anti-alpha5beta1 strategy, we generated volociximab (M200) a chimeric human IgG4 version of the alpha5beta1 function-blocking murine antibody IIA1; and F200, the Fab derivative. Volociximab, F200 and IIA1 showed similar activity by ELISA (EC50= 0.2nM), Biacore (Kd= 0.1-0.4nM) and inhibition of fibronectin binding (IC50= 2-3nM). The inhibitory potential of alpha5beta1 antibodies was compared to HuMV833, an anti-VEGF antibody. Both volociximab and HuMV833 inhibited HUVEC proliferation (IC50 of volociximab = 0.2-0.5nM; IC50 of HuMV833 = 45nM). However, IIA1, volociximab and F200 were also potent inhibitors of an in vitro model of angiogenesis (HUVEC tube formation assay), unlike HuMV833. Additionally, volociximab inhibited in vitro tube formation induced by VEGF and/or bFGF, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of growth factor stimulus. In fact, inhibition of alpha5beta1 function by volociximab induced apoptosis of actively proliferating, but not resting, endothelial cells. Volociximab does not cross-react with rodent alpha5beta1, therefore in vivo validation of an anti-alpha5beta1 approach was conducted in a cynomolgus model of choroidal revascularization. Volociximab and F200 were potent inhibitors of neovessel formation in this model. These data demonstrate that volociximab has therapeutic potential in diseases in which new vessel formation is a component of the pathology."

CD005139,0,24016866,0,"Decorin inhibits angiogenic potential of choroid-retinal endothelial cells by downregulating hypoxia-induced Met, Rac1, HIF-1α and VEGF expression in cocultured retinal pigment epithelial cells.","Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the most common causes of severe vision loss. Decorin, a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been recently shown to play an important regulatory role in angiogenic response. This study aims to investigate whether the overexpression of decorin in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells under hypoxia alters the in vitro angiogenic ability of cocultured choroid-retinal endothelial cells and to explore the possible mechanisms involved. Human RPE cells (ARPE-19) were subjected to hypoxia with or without decorin pretreatment, and RNA interference technique was used to knock down the Met gene in ARPE-19 cells. Cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Expression of Met, Rac1 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) was evaluated by western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and qRT-PCR. We then constructed a recombinant lentiviral vector carrying the decorin gene to transduce ARPE-19 cells. The overexpression of decorin in transduced RPE cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot. The transduced RPE cells were then cocultured with rhesus macaque choroid-retinal endothelial cells (RF/6A) in a transwell coculture system to observe the effects of decorin overexpression in ARPE-19 cells on the proliferation, migration and tube formation of RF/6A cells. In response to hypoxia, the VEGF concentrations in the culture supernatants increased greatly at 24 and 48 h, and this effect was inhibited significantly and nearly equally in the presence of 50-200 nM decorin. Decorin pretreatment before hypoxia exposure effectively reduced the hypoxia-induced expression of Met, Rac1, HIF-1α and VEGF in ARPE-19 cells. Transfection of small interfering RNA against Met to ARPE-19 cells also resulted in significant downregulation of Rac1, HIF-1α and VEGF under hypoxia, and this effect was similar to that noted with decorin pretreatment alone or with their combination. Results from the coculture system showed that the overexpression of decorin in ARPE-19 cells significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and tube formation of RF/6A cells. These results indicate that Met pathway activation plays an important role in the upregulation of VEGF in RPE cells under hypoxia. Decorin may interfere with angiogenesis by downregulating hypoxia-induced Met, Rac1, HIF-1α and VEGF expression in RPE cells, which suggests a potential strategy for the inhibition of CNV."
CD005139,0,21350699,0,The development of recurrent choroidal neovascularization in a patient with choroidal coloboma.,"We report a case of recurrent choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in an eye with chorioretinal coloboma. A 36-year-old woman presented complaining of decreased visual acuity (VA) in her left eye. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/200 and iris coloboma was observed. Funduscopy and fluorescein angiography (FA) showed CNV in the superior extrafoveal region with chorioretinal coloboma reaching just inferior to the optic disc. No other cause for CNV was observed except for the chorioretinal coloboma. BCVA improved to 20/30 after laser photocoagulation. She revisited our clinic for deteriorating VA (20/400) in the same eye 3 years after treatment. Funduscopy and FA demonstrated recurrent CNV with subfoveal hemorrhage. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was followed by three consecutive intravitreal bevacizumab injections (IVB) for the subfoveally-located CNV. However, the CNV persisted with the appearance of a fresh subretinal hemorrhage. Additional PDT was combined with IVB on the same day 6 months after the initial PDT. The CNV regressed 3 months after treatment and has not recurred as of 8 months after the last treatment. The patient's BCVA improved to 20/60. This case suggests that PDT combined with IVB can be an alternative treatment for the management of recurrent CNV after laser photocoagulation in eyes with chorioretinal coloboma."
CD005139,0,27069359,0,Effects of intravitreal ranibizumab on the untreated eye and systemic gene expression profile in age-related macular degeneration.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the systemic effects of intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis) treatment in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The impact of intravitreal ranibizumab injections on central retinal thickness (CRT) of treated and contralateral untreated eyes, and differences in gene expression patterns in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed. The study included 29 patients aged 50 years old and over with diagnosed neovascular AMD. The treatment was defined as 0.5 mg of ranibizumab injected intravitreally in the form of one injection every month during the period of 3 months. CRT was measured by optical coherence tomography. The gene expression profile was assigned using oligonucleotide microarrays of Affymetrix HG-U133A. Studies have shown that there was a change of CRT between treated and untreated eyes, and there were differences in CRT at baseline and after 1, 2, and 3 months of ranibizumab treatment. Three months after intravitreal injection, mean CRT was reduced in the treated eyes from 331.97±123.62 to 254.31±58.75 μm, while mean CRT in the untreated fellow eyes reduced from 251.07±40.29 to 235.45±36.21 μm at the same time. Furthermore, the research has shown that among all transcripts, 3,097 expresses change after the ranibizumab treatment in relation to controls. Among these transcripts, 1,339 were up-regulated, whereas 1,758 were down-regulated. Our results show the potential systemic effects of anti-VEGF therapy for AMD. Moreover, our study indicated different gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after intravitreal ranibizumab treatment."

CD005139,0,21269789,0,Effective electrophoretic mobilities and charges of anti-VEGF proteins determined by capillary zone electrophoresis.,"Macromolecules such as therapeutic proteins currently serve an important role in the treatment of eye diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Particularly, bevacizumab and ranibizumab have been shown to be effective in the treatment of these diseases. Iontophoresis can be employed to enhance ocular delivery of these macromolecules, but the lack of information on the properties of these macromolecules has hindered its development. The objectives of the present study were to determine the effective electrophoretic mobilities and charges of bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and model compound polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) using capillary zone electrophoresis. Salicylate, lidocaine, and bovine serum albumin (BSA), which have known electrophoretic mobilities in the literature, were also studied to validate the present technique. The hydrodynamic radii and diffusion coefficients of BSA, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and PSS were measured by dynamic light scattering. The effective charges were calculated using the Einstein relation between diffusion coefficient and electrophoretic mobility and the Henry equation. The results show that bevacizumab and ranibizumab have low electrophoretic mobilities and are net negatively charged in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) of pH 7.4 and 0.16M ionic strength. PSS has high negative charge but the electrophoretic mobility in PBS is lower than that expected from the polymer structure. The present study demonstrated that capillary electrophoresis could be used to characterize the mobility and charge properties of drug candidates in the development of iontophoretic drug delivery."

This process, if not controlled by selective laser photocoagulation, leads to irreversible retinal damages and loss of vision. Angiogenesis, that is, the condition characterized by the growth of new blood vessels originated from preexisting ones, was shown to have a major role in the pathogenesis of proliferative retinopathy and, as a consequence, intravitreal antiangiogenic injection was suggested as a feasible treatment for this disease.

Altogether, even though further and longer studies are still needed to clarify the best possible therapeutic protocol, the antiangiogenic treatment will reasonably have a future role in the therapy and prevention of proliferative diabetic retinopathy."

Several sight-threatening ocular conditions are included in the array of health problems associated with this disease. Understandably, 2 of the more sight-threatening problems, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), have received a great deal of attention in recent years. Pivotal studies, such as the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study and the Diabetic Retinopathy Study, have established laser photocoagulation as the accepted treatment modality. The last decade has seen a surge in clinical data supporting the use of pharmacologic therapy in place of the often damaging laser therapy. Supporting data are based on the establishment of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key facilitator of disease progression in diabetic retinopathy. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both selective and pan-blockade anti-VEGF agents available today in an effort to help guide physicians wishing to use these agents to treat PDR and DME."

CD005139,0,27220225,0,Wet age related macular degeneration management and follow-up.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is referred to as the leading cause of irreversible visual loss in developed countries, with a profound effect on the quality of life. The neovascular form of AMD is characterized by the formation of subretinal choroidal neovascularization, leading to sudden and severe visual loss. Research has identified the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an important pathophysiological component in neovascular AMD and its intraocular inhibition as one of the most efficient therapies in medicine. The introduction of anti-VEGF as a standard treatment in wet AMD has led to a great improvement in the prognosis of patients, allowing recovery and maintenance of visual function in the vast majority of cases. However, the therapeutic benefit is accompanied by a difficulty in maintaining the treatment schedule due to the increase in the amount of patients, stress of monthly assessments, as well as the associated economic burden. Therefore, treatment strategies have evolved from fixed monthly dosing, to individualized regimens, aiming for comparable results, with fewer injections. One such protocol is called ""pro re nata"", or ""treat and observe"". Patients are given a loading dose of 3 monthly injections, followed by an as-needed decision to treat, based on the worsening of visual acuity, clinical evidence of the disease activity on fundoscopy, or OCT evidence of retinal thickening in the presence of intra or subretinal fluid. A different regimen is called ""treat and extend"", in which the interval between injections is gradually increased, once the disease stabilization is achieved. This paper aims to review the currently available anti-VEGF agents--bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, and the aforementioned treatment strategies."

CD005139,0,27725196,0,A SEMA3E mutant resistant to cleavage by furins (UNCL-SEMA3E) inhibits choroidal neovascularization.,"Abnormal subretinal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major cause of blindness in exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Current anti-angiogenic treatments by VEGF sequestering agents have been successful, but a significant proportion of patients do not respond well to these treatments, and the response of others diminishes over time, suggesting that additional anti-angiogenic agents that function by separate mechanisms may be of use to such patients. We have previously found that a point mutated form of semaphorin-3E resistant to cleavage by furin like pro-protein convertases (UNCL-Sema3E) displays potent anti-angiogenic properties. We therefore determined if UNCL-Sema3E has potential as an inhibitor of CNV formation. We chose to study UNCL-Sema3E rather than wild type sema3E because unlike full length sema3E, the major p61-Sema3E peptide that is produced by cleavage of sema3E with furin like pro-protein convertases activates signal transduction mediated by the ErbB2 receptor and can promote tumor metastasis in addition to its anti-angiogenic activity. UNCL-Sema3E inhibited efficiently vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) signaling in human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC) and to a lesser extent hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signal transduction. CNV that was induced in the eyes of C57 black mice by laser photocoagulation was inhibited by 65% (P < 0.01) following a single bolus intra-vitreal injection of 5 μg UNCL-Sema3E. This inhibitory effect was similar to the inhibition produced by a single bolus intra-vitreal injection of 5 μg aflibercept. A similar inhibition of CNV was observed following the injection of UNCL-Sema3E into the eyes of Long-Evans rats. However, a higher dose of UNCL-Sema3E (125 μg), partially due to the larger volume of the vitreous cavity of rats, was required to achieve maximal inhibition of CNV. Injection of UNCL-Sema3E into eyes of healthy mice did not have any adverse effect on retinal function as assessed by optic kinetic reflex (OKR) or by electroretinogram (ERG) assays nor did UNCL-Sema3E injection affect the structure of the retina as determined using histology. To conclude, our results suggest that UNCL-Sema3E may be useful for the treatment of exudative AMD, which does not respond well to conventional anti-VEGF therapy."
CD005139,0,26043678,0,Effect of aflibercept in patients with age-related macular degeneration.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of standard induction therapy with intravitreal aflibercept (IVA) in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) at 6 months after completion of induction therapy. Eleven eyes with typical AMD (tAMD) and 13 eyes with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) received three monthly doses of IVA (2 mg/0.05 ml in weeks 0, 4, and 8) for treatment of exudative AMD. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured, and optical coherence tomography was performed at baseline and at each monthly visit until 6 months after IVA. Treatment failure was defined as persistent or recurrent AMD that presented with cystoid macular edema, serous retinal detachment, and pigment epithelium detachment. Mean logMAR BCVA was improved from 0.62 ± 0.46 at baseline to 0.54 ± 0.43 at 6 months after IVA (p < 0.05). The success rate was 95.8 % at 3 months and 75.0 % at 6 months after IVA. Failure of IVA was positively associated with the absence of PVD before treatment (r = 0.35) and with the AMD type (tAMD, r = 0.43) by univariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that the absence of PVD before treatment was associated with an increased risk of failure of IVA (OR = 33.17, p = 0.0219). Three months of induction IVA achieved a high success rate in patients with AMD monitored for up to 6 months. Factors associated with failure of IVA were the absence of PVD and the presence of tAMD. Accordingly, continuation of IVA following induction therapy may be beneficial to manage AMD in patients with tAMD or those without PVD."

CD005139,0,18759208,0,[Chances and risks of anti-VEGF therapy].,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis. Through regulation of haemodynamics, haematopoesis and the immune system, endocrinology and reparative processes, inhibition of VEGF can cause multiple adverse events. Previous data suggest that--even after intravitreal injection--systemic exposure might occur, thus bearing the risk of manifestation of side effects. Experience with intravenous administration of the antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) pointed to the potential consequences of a pan-VEGF blockade. The change of haemodynamic parameters implies a potential influence on the patient's morbidity. Studies already conducted during the approval process do not provide sufficient statistical power when evaluating whether systemic events significantly differ between the treatment and control groups. Retinal perfusion showed an altered vascular tone (change in vessel diameter) following anti-VEGF treatment. Physiological fenestration of the choroicapillaris is significantly reduced. Possible effects on the local oxygen supply in ischaemic tissue have to be considered. In contrast to destructive treatment modalities (laser, cryo), VEGF inhibitors promise the prompt and efficient response of retinal neovascularisation and the preservation of a better function (visual fields). The maturation of growing vessels (pericytes) and the secondary formation of membranes are limiting factors with regard to the time-point at which anti-VEGF therapy is most effective. A diligent use of the available drugs has to take into account which types of exudative retinopathy are showing no or only very limited response to the treatment."

A 69-year-old man presented with persistent bilateral DME despite previous ranibizumab treatment. Bilateral study treatment comprised one cycle of three monthly ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg), followed by one cycle of three aflibercept injections (2.0 mg), a second ranibizumab cycle and a second aflibercept cycle. Baseline visual acuity (ETDRS score) was 60 letters for the right eye and 65 letters for the left eye. Baseline central foveal thickness (CFT) was 305 μm for the right eye and 453 μm for the left eye. Substantially improved outcomes were observed during the first aflibercept cycle. CFT was reduced by 150 μm (mean) in both the eyes and decreased below the lowest level achieved during the previous 2.5-year ranibizumab treatment. Visual acuity was improved by 17.5 letters (mean) in both the eyes. Reintroduction of ranibizumab immediately worsened the status of both eyes back to the baseline level. During the final aflibercept cycle, visual acuity and CFT improved to the same levels achieved during the first aflibercept cycle. In this case study, we prospectively switched the treatment three times and observed a dramatic and consistent treatment advantage for aflibercept."

CD005139,0,16935211,0,Ranibizumab: Phase III clinical trial results.,"Ranibizumab therapy is the first treatment for neovascular AMD to improve vision for most patients. The benefits apply to all angiographic subtypes of neovascular AMD and across all lesion sizes. Although the pivotal phase III trials (MARINA and ANCHOR) used monthly injections of ranibizumab for 2 years, the ongoing PIER, PrONTO, and SAILOR trials are investigating less frequent dosing regimens, and preliminary results from the PrONTO study suggest that fewer injections will most likely result in visual acuity improvements similar to the results from the phase III trials. When comparing the ANCHOR results with the FOCUS results, it also becomes apparent that the combination of ranibizumab with PDT does not necessarily result in better visual acuity outcomes, and the use of PDT may even reduce the visual acuity benefits achieved with ranibizumab alone (see Figs. 1-3). It seems unlikely that combination therapy provides any significant advantage over ranibizumab alone unless the combination of PDT and ranibizumab can decrease the need for frequent retreatment. The results from the PrONTO Study already suggest that less frequent treatment with ranibizumab is possible by using a variable dosing regimen with OCT. Ranibizumab also seems to be safe, with the 2-year MARINA data showing no increase in the incidence of systemic adverse events that could be associated with anti-VEGF therapy, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. There was a hint of a safety concern, however, in the pooled 1-year safety results from the MARINA and ANCHOR trials. Although the combined rate of myocardial infarction and stroke during the first year of the ANCHOR and MARINA trials was similar in the control and the 0.3-mg ranibizumab arms (1.3% and 1.6% respectively), these adverse events were slightly higher in the 0.5-mg ranibizumab arm (2.9%). These differences are not statistically significant, however, and probably do not represent a dose-dependent increase in risk because the 2-year results from the MARINA trial with the same monthly injection regimen showed no increased risk of thromboembolic events. In December 2005, Genentech submitted a Biologics License Application to the FDA for the use of ranibizumab in the treatment of neovascular wet AMD based on 1-year clinical efficacy and safety data from the two pivotal phase III trials, ANCHOR and MARINA, and the phase I-II FOCUS trial. Genentech has been granted a 6-month Priority Review from the FDA with a decision anticipated 6 months from the December submission date or by the end of June 2006 [29]. By the summer of 2006, this revolutionary therapy should be available for the treatment of neovascular AMD. At that time, the major dilemma facing most retina specialists will be whether to use intravitreal ranibizumab or intravitreal bevacizumab, the low cost alternative, for the treatment of neovascular AMD."

Although effective in a majority of cases, a significant proportion of patients have persisting retinal exudation despite regular anti-VEGF therapy. This exudation is considered to produce poorer visual outcomes in these patients. Some of these patients may have misdiagnosed nAMD variants such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; however, the majority of these eyes have what has been termed treatment-resistant nAMD. Currently, the best way to care for these patients is uncertain. Here, we review the evidence for different approaches to the management of treatment-resistant nAMD, including high-dose anti-VEGF therapy, combination regimes and switching of anti-VEGF agents, and discuss possible therapeutic approaches for patients with treatment-resistant nAMD."

We evaluated the efficacy of early treatment using intravitreal triple therapy of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), expansile gas, and an anti-VEGF agent.MethodsThis retrospective case series included eight patients presenting with acute submacular haemorrhage involving the fovea. All patients received treatment with 50 μg (0.05 ml) tPA, 0.3 ml 100% perfluoropropane (C3F8), and an anti-VEGF agent (0.05 mg Ranibizumab or 1.25 mg Bevacizumab in 0.05 ml) administered via intravitreal injection. An anterior chamber paracentesis post injection or vitreous tap was performed before injection to prevent retinal vascular occlusion secondary to raised intra-ocular pressure. Outcomes assessed were visual acuity, change in macular morphology, and complications.ResultsPatients presented promptly with delay between symptom onset and clinic review being 1.9±0.6 days (mean±SD). Treatment was delivered quickly with interval from presentation to treatment being 1.1±1.2 days. Symptom onset to treatment was 3.0±1.0 days. Subfoveal haemorrhage was effectively displaced in all patients. LogMAR visual acuity improved from 1.67±0.47 at presentation to 0.63±0.33 at final follow-up (P<0.0001), a mean of 7.9±4.8 months after treatment. Central retinal thickness improved from 658.1±174.2 μm at presentation to 316.6±142.4 μm at final follow-up (P=0.0028).ConclusionsEarly treatment of submacular haemorrhage using intravitreal tPA, C3F8, and anti-VEGF was effective in significantly improving visual acuity in this series of patients who presented soon after symptom onset. Treatment was well tolerated in this group of elderly and potentially frail patients."
CD005139,0,17658909,0,Sustained-release ophthalmic drug delivery systems for treatment of macular disorders: present and future applications.,"Macular disease currently poses the greatest threat to vision in aging populations. Historically, most of this pathology could only be dealt with surgically, and then only after much damage to the macula had already occurred. Current pathophysiological insights into macular diseases have allowed the development of effective new pharmacotherapies. The field of drug delivery systems has advanced over the last several years with emphasis placed on controlled release of drug to specific areas of the eye. Its unique location and tendency toward chronic disease make the macula an important and attractive target for drug delivery systems, especially sustained-release systems. This review evaluates the current literature on the research and development of sustained-release posterior segment drug delivery systems that are primarily intended for macular disease with an emphasis on age-related macular degeneration.Current effective therapies include corticosteroids and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor compounds. Recent successes have been reported using anti-angiogenic drugs for therapy of age-related macular degeneration. This review also includes information on implantable devices (biodegradable and non-biodegradable), the use of injected particles (microspheres and liposomes) and future enhanced drug delivery systems, such as ultrasound drug delivery. The devices reviewed show significant drug release over a period of days or weeks. However, macular disorders are chronic diseases requiring years of treatment. Currently, there is no 'gold standard' for therapy and/or drug delivery. Future studies will focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of drug delivery to the posterior chamber. If successful, therapeutic modalities will significantly delay loss of vision and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic macular disorders."

The improved macular appearance was maintained for at least 4 weeks, and visual acuity remained stable. No inflammation was observed. An intravitreal injection of bevacizumab may provide an effective, safe, and inexpensive option for patients with age-related macular degeneration who are losing vision secondary to macular neovascularization."

CD005139,0,18855647,0,Inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor in cancer.,"Angiogenesis is a complex process that is regulated by pro- and antiangiogenic factors. These factors can emanate from diverse sources including cancer cells, stromal cells, blood and extracellular matrix. Their relative contribution is likely to change with tumor type and tumor site. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is now well confirmed as the primary and the most potent inducer of angiogenesis. To activate cellular signaling pathways, VEGF binds to receptor kinases VEGF-R1, R2 and R3. It then promotes several events required for the formation of new blood vessels, such as endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration and vascular permeability. Activation of endothelial cells, leads to the secretion of enzymes which degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and hence promote metastasis. Similarly it promotes survival by inducing Bcl-2 expression on VEGF receptor positive leukemia. Besides being a potent mitogen for macrovascular cells derived from arteries, veins and lymphatics, it is also highly involved in a number of angiogenic related disorders including inflammatory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, retinopathies and age related macular degeneration. Neovascularization and increased vessel permeability are being recognized as major causes of VEGF related pathogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of VEGF pathway is a strategy being widely pursued to provide new therapeutics for the treatment of VEGF related disorders. Over twenty compounds with anti-angiogenic properties ranging from VEGF neutralizing antibody, soluble receptors, receptor antagonists or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are either approved or are currently under clinical (phase I - III) study. This review aims to provide an updated account of how VEGF inhibitors are shaping up to become an important class of drugs used in the treatment of cancer."

CD005139,0,19668725,0,Role of pegaptanib sodium in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is responsible for more than half the blind registration in the United Kingdom. Retinal manifestations of AMD can be categorized as either atrophic or neovascular. The hallmark of AMD is the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Until recently, there have been few, limited treatment modalities (eg, photodynamic therapy [PDT]) for this condition and the mainstay of treatment has comprised social and lifestyle support. However, increased understanding of the molecular processes at work in neovascular AMD and CNV in recent years has led to the introduction of new anti-angiogenic agents that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These agents either inhibit a selected VEGF isoform (eg, VEGF(165) inhibition by pegaptanib sodium) or inhibit all forms of the VEGF isoform (eg, non-selective VEGF blockade by ranibizumab). The trial data suggest that non-selective inhibition of VEGF offers better treatment outcomes in neovascular AMD. As a result, agents that inhibit all VEGF isoforms are now widely used as first-line therapy for this condition. However, it is known that VEGF plays an important role in maintaining the intergrity of the cardiovascular system and, particularly as the age of patients with AMD places them at an elevated risk of thromboembolic events, long-term post-marketing surveillance data are essential to determining whether non-selective VEGF blockade confers any increased risk. Theoretically, selective VEGF inhibition may reduce any risk associated with pan-VEGF blockade, yet on the basis of initial trials, their use remains more limited at this time. However, clinical practice suggests that initial trials may have under-estimated the efficacy of selective-VEGF inhibition. Observational studies also indicate that better treatment outcomes may be possible by combining VEGF inhibitors sequentially with each other, or with existing therapies (eg, photodynamic therapy [PDT]). The optimum role and indications of anti-VEGF agents will come through careful consideration of the available efficacy and safety data, from the outcomes of long-term follow-up studies, and through assessment of the relative merits of the two approaches to VEGF inhibition in clinical practice. At this time, further head-to-head trials, and economic evaluations, comparing the treatment alternatives are needed."

Moreover, the clinical studies in progress on photodynamic therapy and antiangiogenic drugs now make it possible to consider combined treatments possibly including TTT. This paper aims to provide a report on the current place and potential of TTT within the therapeutics available or soon available for subfoveal occult choroidal neovessels of AMD."

Macugen has already had a significant impact on neovascular AMD management, in regard to both individual patients with AMD lesions that would become amenable to treatment, and in its effects on visual function and its preservation in the aging United States population. Although results and delivery method are not optimal, the positive outcomes indicate the beginning, and not the limit, of pharmacotherapy for AMD. The benefits of Macugen therapy for AMD strongly outweigh the risks. It is pointed out by some that the overall magnitude of the efficacy results is very similar to the PDT trials and question why there is so much enthusiasm about a treatment that entails intravitreal injections every 6 weeks instead of PDT every 12 weeks. In all fairness, PDT is not equally efficacious across the lesion subtypes and sizes, whereas Macugen has effect with all lesion subtypes.

Dilated fundoscopy revealed significant macular oedema in the right eye and a normal fundus appearance in the left eye. Her medical history was noteworthy for breast ductal carcinoma in situ, for which she had undergone right mastectomy three years earlier. She had not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy but she had been under treatment with letrozole 2.5 mg/day over the past three years. She did not receive any other medication. Optical coherence tomography showed intraretinal fluid and a significant increase in retinal thickness in the foveal and parafoveal areas, while fluorescein angiography detected foveal hyperfluorescence and leakage of the dye in the late phase. Multifocal electroretinogram showed a decreased response in both eyes. In suspicion of letrozole-related retinopathy, the patient was advised to stop the medication.

Twenty eyes of twenty consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes with PDR and clinically significant macular edema were enrolled in this study. Aqueous samples were collected at baseline and one month after IVB to evaluate VEGF and APN levels. Twenty age-matched patients undergoing cataract surgery were used as control. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and foveal thickness (FT) changes after IVB were also measured. Safety was assessed by recording the incidence of ocular and non-ocular adverse events. At baseline APN and VEGF levels were significantly lower in controls than in PDR patients (APN: 3.6 ± 1.1 vs 18.7 ± 4.5 ng/ml; VEGF: 22.6 ± 16.1 vs 146.2 ± 38.71 pg/ml).

Bevacizumab (Avastin) has a similar action, is related to the ranibizumab compound with respect to its structure, but has not been approved by the FDA for intravitreal use and therefore must be utilized only in an off-label setting. While ranibizumab was approved by the FDA at a dose of 0.5 mg per intravitreal injection, the manufacturer recently issued a letter to physicians warning of the increased risk of stroke at the FDA-approved dose as compared to a lower studied dose of 0.3 mg. An interim analysis of the ongoing SAILOR study revealed a 1.2% risk of stroke in the 0.5 mg arm versus 0.3% in the 0.3 mg arm (p = 0.02). It is unclear whether the trend toward a higher risk of stroke in patients receiving 0.5 mg dose of ranibizumab would persist in the final analysis, but details such as causality, topography, and severity of stroke in the SAILOR study should also be delineated.

CD005139,0,26420681,0,[Diabetic maculopathy].,"Diabetic maculopathy is the result of multifactorial and complex alterations of the retinal capillaries in association with diabetes mellitus and is divided into two forms, ischemic maculopathy and diabetic macular edema. Diabetic macular edema is the leading cause of blindness among people of working age. The functional and morphological results of intravitreal pharmacotherapy in cases of fovea-involving macular edema using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors such as ranibizumab and aflibercept obtained in large randomized clinical trials are excellent and are superior to results obtained with focal or grid laser coagulation alone. Steroids including dexamethasone and fluocinolone implants represent approved alternatives, although flucinolone is considered a second-line therapy in refractory and chronic cases. VEGF inhibitors can be used in different treatment strategies such as PRN and treat and extend strategies. Focal laser photocoagulation remains the gold standard for macular edema not involving the fovea (and therefore usually good visual acuity). Laser is also still indicated as a panretinal photocoagulation of peripheral retinal ischemic areas in order to prevent neovascular complications. It remains to be proven whether panretinal photocoagulation can have an effect on the treatment intervals of intravitreal pharmacotherapy, too. Surgical treatments such as vitrectomy are today limited to cases of macular edema with concomitant obvious tractional pathologies at the vitreoretinal interface."

CD005139,0,18020531,0,Combination therapy for choroidal neovascularisation.,"Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) often leads to severe vision loss and is becoming increasingly prevalent as the aging population grows. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of CNV, but CNV also affects younger people with pathological myopia, ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks and idiopathic disorders. The monotherapies available worldwide to treat patients with CNV have primarily been studied in CNV due to AMD, and all have their drawbacks. Combination therapy takes advantage of the strengths of each therapy and their different mechanisms of action to achieve good treatment outcomes with few repeated treatments. For example, combination (triple) therapy with verteporfin photodynamic therapy, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and anti-inflammatory therapy addresses three main targets of CNV development: the CNV itself, VEGF expression (which promotes CNV growth) and inflammation (which exacerbates the disease process). Such triple therapy has been shown to result in sustained improved vision after only one treatment. Vision outcomes similar to those observed with ranibizumab, the most promising and rigorously proven anti-VEGF monotherapy, may be possible with combination therapy without the need for continued monthly intravitreal injections, which are required if sustained outcomes are to be achieved with ranibizumab. The goal of CNV therapy is improved vision outcomes after one course of treatment. Combination therapy may lead to this goal. Such treatment could also result in fewer safety issues (fewer treatments are required and the unknown effects of continued long-term treatment are avoided), lower cost to both the patient and the medical system and greater convenience for patients (fewer clinic visits). However, combination therapy is beset with several challenges: different therapies, doses, timing and treatment sequences are possible, and it is therefore difficult to conduct large, definitive clinical trials to determine which treatment regimen is safest and most effective. Large controlled studies are needed to more clearly define effective and safe combination regimens for CNV."

The current review focuses on the imperative role of VEGF induced angiogenesis in the development of retinal neovascularization and despite the fact that several VEGF targeting ocular drugs are available; the review examines the need for a cost economic alternative, thereby suggesting the role of AgNPs as an emerging economic ocular drug for retinal therapies. The current technologies available for the development of targeted and controlled release of drugs is being discussed and a model has been proposed for the amenable targeting mechanism, by which Poly gamma glutamic acid (PGA) capsulated AgNPs conjugated to cyclic RGD peptides carry out a sustained controlled release specifically targeting the neovascularization cells and induce apoptosis unaffecting the normal retinal cells.

Currently, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections have demonstrated considerably efficacy in treating neovascular ARMD, but patients require frequent treatment to fully benefit. Here, we review the rationale and evidence for radiation therapy of ARMD. The results of early photon external beam radiation therapy are included to provide a framework for the sequential discussion of evidence for the usage of stereotactic radiation therapy, proton therapy, and brachytherapy. The evidence suggests that these 3 modern modalities can provide a dose-dependent benefit in the treatment of ARMD.

Importantly, dysregulated S1P levels are associated with several pathologies, including cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases and cancer. This report describes the successful production and characterization of a murine monoclonal antibody, LT1002, directed against S1P, using novel immunization and screening methods applied to bioactive lipids. We also report the successful generation of LT1009, the humanized variant of LT1002, for potential clinical use. Both LT1002 and LT1009 have high affinity and specificity for S1P and do not cross-react with structurally related lipids. Using an in vitro bioassay, LT1002 and LT1009 were effective in blocking S1P-mediated release of the pro-angiogenic and prometastatic cytokine, interleukin-8, from human ovarian carcinoma cells, showing that both antibodies can out-compete S1P receptors in binding to S1P. In vivo anti-angiogenic activity of all antibody variants was demonstrated using the murine choroidal neovascularization model. Importantly, intravenous administration of the antibodies showed a marked effect on lymphocyte trafficking. The resulting lead candidate, LT1009, has been formulated for Phase 1 clinical trials in cancer and age-related macular degeneration. The anti-S1P antibody shows promise as a novel, first-in-class therapeutic acting as a ""molecular sponge"" to selectively deplete S1P from blood and other compartments where pathological S1P levels have been implicated in disease progression or in disorders where immune modulation may be beneficial."

Although the neovascular type accounts for only 10-15% of the total cases of AMD, it is responsible for 90% of the cases with severe vision loss. A main treatment target is to identify and destroy the newly formed choroidal vessels while preserving central vision. Laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy with verteporfin have been the mainstay of the treatment of neovascular membranes for some time. In the last decade, the development of antiangiogenic substances (anti-VEGF) and their application in ophthalmology in the treatment of neovascular AMD has marked a new, promising therapeutical approach.

OIR was induced in neonatal C57BL6 mice and the neonates were treated s.c. with squalamine doses begun at various times after OIR induction. A system of retinal whole mounts and assessment of neovascular nuclei extending beyond the inner limiting membrane from animals reared under room air or OIR conditions and killed periodically from d 12 to 21 were used to assess retinopathy in squalamine-treated and untreated animals. OIR evolved after 75% oxygen exposure in neonatal mice with florid retinal neovascularization developing by d 14. Squalamine (single dose, 25 mg/kg s.c.) given on d 15 or 16, but not d 17, substantially improved retinal neovascularization in the mouse model of OIR. There was improvement seen in the degree of blood vessel tuft formation, blood vessel tortuosity, and central vasoconstriction with squalamine treatment at d 15 or 16. Single-dose squalamine at d 12 was effective at reducing subsequent development of retinal neovascularization at doses as low as 1 mg/kg. Squalamine is a very active inhibitor of OIR in mouse neonates at doses as low as 1 mg/kg given once.

Investigations revealed an active choroidal neovascular membrane. She underwent treatment with intravitreal Bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml). Follow-up at 1 month revealed the development of lacquer crack running through the macula, underlying the fovea. The patient received two re-treatments at 1-month intervals, following which the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) regressed completely. However, further progression of lacquer cracks was noted. At the last follow-up, 6 months following the last injection, the fundus remained stable and vision was maintained at 20/200. Considering the natural history of the disease and the increased risk of rupture of the Bruch's membrane in such eyes, the possible complication of a lacquer crack developing must be borne in mind, before initiating treatment."

CD005139,0,28114356,0,Co-Evaluation of Peripapillary RNFL Thickness and Retinal Thickness in Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema: RNFL Misinterpretation and Its Adjustment.,"We investigated the relationship between the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and peripapillary retinal thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema. Fifty eyes (group I) with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injection, and 90 eyes (group II) without diabetic macular edema were included in this case-control study. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, peripapillary retinal thickness, and a new retinal nerve fiber layer index using a modeled relationship between the two parameters were evaluated with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up. In group I, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness decreased from 126.4 μm at baseline to 117.6 μm at 6 months (p < 0.001), while the peripapillary retinal thickness decreased from 376.0 μm at baseline to 359.6 μm at 6 months (p < 0.001) after intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. In group II, however, both the parameters remained stable at the 6-month follow-up (100.7 to 102.1 μm and 311.1 to 316.2 μm, respectively, and all p > 0.01). Analysis with the new index to adjust for retinal edema showed no significant change from baseline to 6 months in both groups (p = 0.593 and p = 0.101, respectively). The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness is strongly affected by the peripapillary retinal thickness. Therefore, the measured changes in peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness may not represent the real gain or loss of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Therefore, the new retinal nerve fiber layer index, which corrects for the component of macula edema, could be a better means of assessing the changes of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema."

The disease has a profound effect on quality of life of affected individuals and represents a major socioeconomic challenge for societies due to the exponential increase in life expectancy and environmental risks. Advances in medical research have identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an important pathophysiological player in neovascular AMD and intraocular inhibition of VEGF as one of the most efficient therapies in medicine. The wide introduction of anti-VEGF therapy has led to an overwhelming improvement in the prognosis of patients affected by neovascular AMD, allowing recovery and maintenance of visual function in the vast majority of patients. However, the therapeutic benefit is accompanied by significant economic investments, unresolved medicolegal debates about the use of off-label substances and overwhelming problems in large population management. The burden of disease has turned into a burden of care with a dissociation of scientific advances and real-world clinical performance. Simultaneously, ground-breaking innovations in diagnostic technologies, such as optical coherence tomography, allows unprecedented high-resolution visualisation of disease morphology and provides a promising horizon for early disease detection and efficient therapeutic follow-up. However, definite conclusions from morphologic parameters are still lacking, and valid biomarkers have yet to be identified to provide a practical base for disease management.

Mono-disperse, 20nm-size TiO2 nanoparticles did not affect the viability of retinal constituent cells within certain range of concentrations (~1.30μg/mL). Furthermore, local delivery of TiO2 nanoparticles did not induce any significant toxicity at the level of gene expression and histologic integrity in the retina of C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, at the low concentration (130ng/mL) without definite toxicity, these nanoparticles suppressed in vitro angiogenesis processes and in vivo retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy mice when they are administered intravitreally. Taken together, our results demonstrate that even TiO2 nanoparticles can be safely utilized for the treatment of retinal diseases at the adequate concentration levels, especially through local administration."

In this retrospective case study 33 eyes from 33 patients with stage III RAP lesions were included and initially treated with 3 intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab at monthly intervals. Criteria for extended treatment were visual deterioration, fresh bleeding, residual fluid or increase of the central retinal thickness in optical coherence tomography (OCT) as well as persisting activity in fluorescence angiography (FLA).

LSFG measures the relative velocity index of erythrocytes (mean blur rate) in a previously confirmed area, with neovascularization elsewhere (NVE), neovascularization of the disc (NVD), and without neovascularization. The authors compared mean blur rate before and after bevacizumab injection in each area. In LSFG images, regression of blood flow was observed at the area of neovascularization sequentially as the change of color pattern. Finally, decrease of the mean blur rate of an average 32.7% was observed in the NVE area. Similarly, a reduction of 31.9% of mean blur rate was observed in the NVD area. However, in the area of without neovascularization, reduction of mean blur rate was not observed.

CD005139,0,25960634,0,Profile of conbercept in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"In developed countries, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in individuals over the age of 65 years. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a vital role in the formation of neovascular AMD. VEGF regulates angiogenesis, enhances vascular permeability, and drives the formation of choroidal neovascularization. As a result of the introduction of anti-VEGF drugs, the incidence of blindness from neovascular AMD has greatly reduced. Anti-VEGF drugs are used as a first-line treatment for neovascular AMD. The most recent anti-VEGF drug is conbercept, also named KH902, which was approved for the treatment of neovascular AMD by the China Food and Drug Administration in December 2013. In this review, recent clinical information regarding the use of conbercept to treat neovascular AMD is summarized. Conbercept is a soluble receptor decoy that blocks all isoforms of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and PlGF, which has a high binding affinity to VEGF and a long half-life in vitreous. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its anti-angiogenesis activity in both ocular neovascular disease models and tumor models. Clinical trials of conbercept have shown its superior efficacy and safety. Patients respond well even with 3-month treatment intervals following loading doses once a month for 3 months. The potential therapeutic effect of conbercept on the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, a special type of neovascular AMD, is also promising. In summary, conbercept is a new treatment option for ophthalmologists and their patients and may help address the limitations of current anti-VEGF drugs."

CD005139,0,24467200,0,"Glucocorticoids: structure, signaling and molecular mechanisms in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the working population worldwide. Vascular leakage, angiogenesis and neuronal degeneration are key features of DR. Current effective interventions for DR include treatment of systemic risk factors such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia. Ocular treatments include vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) inhibitors, laser photocoagulation and surgery. While anti-VEGF therapy has become as first-line treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) that causes reduced vision, intravitreal glucocorticoids also have been shown to be efficacious in this situation. It has been reported that all the major pathological processes of DR are susceptible to glucocorticoid treatment. The effects of glucocorticoids on vascular leakage and angiogenesis may be mediated through their well established anti-inflammatory role. Alternatively, glucocorticoids may affect other mechanisms known to be activated in DR. Potential mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids include blockage of cytokine production and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion induced by VEGF-A. Glucocorticoids decrease the expression of VEGF-A directly, and increase the production, or decrease phosphorylation, of tight junction-associated proteins. Glucocorticoids have also been shown to be neuroprotective, in contrast to VEGF-A inhibitors which animal studies suggest may be neurotoxic. This review outlines the biological properties of synthetic glucocorticoids, with particular emphasis on the potential beneficial effect of combining glucocorticoids with anti-VEGF treatment for DME and DR."

Although intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF based therapeutics have significantly improved the visual outcome for many patients, current therapeutic options still show significant drawbacks such as the injection-related risk of contracting an infection. Due to their ability to encapsulate drugs with otherwise poor bioavailability, accumulate in areas of increased vascular permeability and control the release of active ingredients over time, nanoparticle systems have been widely researched to enhance current therapeutic strategies and expand the therapeutic arsenal. In this review, emphasis is placed both on the possibilities and drawbacks that a systemic nanoparticle-based therapy could have in the context of neovascular posterior eye diseases. Recent investigations into intravenous and intravitreal administration of nanomaterials and their potential to deliver potent drugs and genes to pathologic lesions will also be presented. Furthermore, we will focus on the exceptional anti-oxidative and anti-angiogenic properties of selected nanoscale systems that carve out new paths for the treatment of these severe posterior eye diseases."

Even with its proven effectiveness, there are still cases that do not respond satisfactorily. In those cases, a treatment option is to change to another anti-VEGF drug. In this paper, the authors review studies on switching between different anti-VEGF drugs in the treatment of persistent DME. An extensive bibliographic review was done using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Fourteen studies published from March 2010 to April 2017 reporting switching from anti-VEGF drugs in DME treatment were included. All reported good anatomical results after conversion; however, visual acuity outcomes showed great variability between publications. Therefore, switching to other anti-VEGFs in patients with DME not responding to previous anti-VEGF therapy may be an option, but the results are still not well-known due to a lack of randomized clinical trials.

CD005139,0,20075967,0,Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy: an angiographic discussion.,"The understanding of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy has evolved rapidly in the past three decades. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of typical hyperfluorescent nodules in the early phase of indocyanine green angiography. Although the classical clinical presentation is recurrent serosanguinous detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium, it may present with clinical features indistinguishable from exudative age-related macular degeneration secondary to choroidal neovascularization. Some cases may present initially with submacular haemorrhage, but later with features of exudative age-related macular degeneration. Studying the associated network of vessels using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy indocyanine green dynamic angiography revealed in many cases feeder vessels, branching pattern, and leakage similar to choroidal neovascularization. Owing to the overlap of clinical and angiographic features, it may be considered as a vascular subtype of exudative age-related macular degeneration. However, having seemingly better natural history, better response to photodynamic therapy, and incomplete response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy suggests that it should be studied as a separate entity from choroidal neovascularization. Combining angio-occlusion of the polyps using photodynamic therapy and anti-permeability effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy on the branching vascular network may provide a synergistic effect. We await the result of EVEREST trial, a multi-centre randomized controlled trial comparing photodynamic therapy, with or without ranibizumab, with ranibizumab monotherapy."

Two hundred and two eyes of 175 patients who received repeated intravitreal ranibizumab injections were included in this study. IOP measurements were obtained at both 30 min and 24 h after each injection. IOP changes after the first, third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth injections were analyzed. Data gotten from subgroups with pre-existing glaucoma and pseudophakia were also analyzed. The mean number of injections was 4.81 ± 2.7 (range: 3-18), while the mean IOP prior to the first intravitreal ranibizumab injection was 15.11 ± 2.8 (9-25) mmHg. At the last visit, IOP was 14.66 ± 2.8 (9-22) mmHg. There was no cumulative increase in IOP at either 30 min or 24 h values throughout repeated injections. Pseudophakic patients had significantly lower mean IOP values at 30 min after all injections except for twelfth. The number of eyes with an IOP higher than 21 mm Hg and the mean IOP values were significantly higher in patients with pre-existing glaucoma at 30 min after the first and third injections. Pseudophakic eyes are less prone to immediate IOP spikes than phakic eyes. Pre-existing glaucoma may be a potential risk factor for uncontrolled IOP spikes immediately after intravitreal injection; nonetheless, this effect is usually transient and does not cause long-term problems. Also, ranibizumab injections can be administered safely under close monitoring."

Vascular endothelial growth factor has been identified as playing a key role in ocular angiogenesis. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to all isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor, has shown promising results in regression of neovascularization. The use of bevacizumab has been reported extensively in various retinal pathologies, including proliferative diabetic retinopathy, cystoid macular edema, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and neovascular glaucoma, but the clinical use in glaucoma is not yet clear. Glaucoma filtering surgery entails fashioning an external filter for aqueous drainage, and a prerequisite to its optimum functioning is a patent filtering bleb. Since fibroblast function and growth of new vessels is a component of healing of the bleb, there have been attempts to retard this healing by the use of bevacizumab. This article reviews current clinical studies documenting the use of bevacizumab in glaucoma."

CD005139,0,27045225,0,Vascular endothelial growth factor and diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetes mellitus is a major global health epidemic, and diabetic macular edema is the leading cause of vision loss in this population. Macular focal and/or grid laser photocoagulation applied to microaneurysms and thickened retina had long been primary therapy for diabetic macular edema. Chronically elevated serum glucose is known to cause breakdown in the inner and outer retinal blood barrier resulting in upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, including ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept, have been shown in randomized clinical trials to be superior to macular laser for the treatment of clinically relevant diabetic macular edema. The READ-2, RISE/RIDE, and RESTORE trials established ranibizumab's superiority to macular laser, whereas the BOLT trial demonstrated bevacizumab's superiority to laser. The DRCR.net Protocol T results showed that intravitreal aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab were all effective in reducing retinal thickness secondary to diabetic edema and in improving vision. When the presenting vision was 20/40 or better, visual improvement was equivalent. With eyes presenting with 20/50 or worse vision, aflibercept was superior with respect to visual improvement. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy can be burdensome for the patient and health care system, often requiring monthly treatment visits. To reduce burdens, anti-VEGF strategies are in development to lengthen the treatment interval."
CD005139,0,22718058,0,Current trends in the pharmacotherapy of diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most debilitating disorders of microvasculature of the retina and one of the leading causes of vision loss among the working class worldwide. At present, intravitreal anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids) and anti-angiogenesis (anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) agents are being used as wide options for the pharmacotherapy of DR and diabetic macular edema (DME). Anti-inflammatory agents (Triamcinolone acetonide and other agents) have shown evidence-based clinical benefits in various randomized clinical trials for the treatment of DR and DME, and also shown improvement in best corrected visual acuity. However, direct intravitreal injections are associated with serious side-effects like cataract and elevation of Intra Ocular Pressure. Despite this, corticosteroid therapy has been effective for DR and DME, therefore current focus is on the development of novel intravitreal steroid delivery devices that release a small quantity over a prolonged period of time. In addition to corticosteroids, anti-angiogenic agents are found to be effective for the treatment of DR and DME. The most popular target of these agents is the subfamily of proteins known as VEGF, whose over-expression is believed to play a role in numerous diseases including DR and Age-related Macular Degeneration. Intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin®) and Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) are gaining popularity as a clinical adjunct to panretinal photocoagulation in patients with proliferative DR. Moreover, Lucentis has been recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. Further, systemic agents (specially, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and anti-hypertensive agents) have shown beneficial results in reducing the progression of DR. In conclusion, it can be stated that for the present scenario systematic use of available pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to laser photocoagulation, which is gold standard therapy, can be a useful tool in the prevention of vision loss from DR and related disorders. This article summarizes the up-to-date developments in the pharmacotherapy of DR. Method- Literature search was done on online database, Pubmed, Google Scholar, clinitrials.gov and browsing through individual ophthalmology journals and leading pharmaceutical company websites."

The exact mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of ocular NV is not yet well understood, and as a consequence, there is no satisfactory therapy for ocular NV. In the last 10 years, a number of studies provided increasing evidence demonstrating that the imbalance between angiogenic stimulating factors and angiogenic inhibitors is a major contributor to the angiogenesis induced by various insults, such as hypoxia or ischemia, inflammation and tumor. The angiogenic inhibitors alone or in combination with other existing therapies are, therefore, believed to be promising in the treatment of ocular NV in the near future.

CD005139,0,21627341,0,Neovascular age-related macular degeneration: opportunities for development of first-in-class biopharmaceuticals.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that may cause blindness. The prevalence of the disease in the Western world is estimated at 1-2% of the population. Over the past decade, treatment of neovascular AMD has been shifting from destruction of newly formed blood vessels towards inhibitors that silence the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. Such agents are often first-in-class biopharmaceuticals that benefit from the fact that they can be locally administered in an immune-privileged environment with slow clearance. These new VEGF pathway inhibitors have improved therapeutic effects over conventional treatment and have promoted the identification of novel targets for inhibition of AMD angiogenesis. This review describes the rationale behind the shift from conventional to current treatment options and discusses investigational, most notably biopharmaceutical, drugs that are in clinical trials. It also provides possible points for improvement of these treatments, specifically regarding their delivery."

Innate immunity and autoimmune components, such as complement factors, chemokines, cytokines, macrophages, and ocular microglia, are believed to be heavily involved in AMD development. Targeting these specific inflammatory molecules has recently been explored in an attempt to better understand and treat AMD. Although antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy is the first line of defence against neovascular AMD, anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), immunosuppressive agents (eg, methotrexate and rapamycin), and biologics (eg, infliximab, daclizumab, and complement inhibitors) may provide an adjunct or alternative mechanism to suppress the inflammatory processes driving AMD progression.

This led to the generation of two sets of scenario options. Subsequently 100 patients undergoing active treatment for nAMD in the National Health Service University Hospital, United Kingdom underwent interview assessment. They were asked to rank their preferences for provision of their care with reference to these two sets of scenario options. Using conjoint analysis, percentage preferences, and utility scores for each variable in each scenario design were calculated.ResultsNinety-five patients completed the preference ranking for both scenarios. Eight patients ranked worse vision as preferable to better vision and were excluded on the basis that they had not understood the task. The results of the remaining 87 patients are presented. The most important factor to patients was having good vision, followed by a one-stop service and less frequent follow up. The least important factors were label status of the drug, cost to the health service, and grade of the injector.ConclusionPatients regard good vision and minimal visits to the hospital above the status of injector, label status of drug, or cost to the NHS."
CD005139,0,18516776,0,[Is there a drug therapy for age-related macular degeneration?--current status and new therapeutic approaches].,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the major cause of legal blindness in society today. In dry AMD age-related changes in Bruch's membrane and RPE result in the accumulation of cell debris with consequent degeneration. In the less common but more aggressive form, wet AMD, hypoxia and inflammation lead to an up-regulation of different growth factors such as VEGF resulting in formation of choroidal neovascularisation. Different therapeutic modalities have evolved to address this problem. Examples are photodynamic therapy to eradicate choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) via a physiochemical reaction or intravitreal application of anti-VEGF agents to stop leakage of fluid from the same CNV. The overall results have been either disappointing or not practical because of the necessity of chronic treatment. The treatment goal continues to evolve to that already realised in oncology which is for a cure. This mandates the investigation of combination strategies. Combination strategies should focus on utilising the differing mechanisms of action on the pathogenesis of the disease all the while minimising the side effects of the individual therapeutic agents."

We aimed to demonstrate the antiangiogenic effect of silicate nanoparticles (SiNPs) on the retinal neovascularization. No direct toxicity of SiNPs was observed on retinal neuronal or endothelial cells, nor on the retinal tissue. Furthermore, intravitreal injection of SiNPs effectively reduced anomalous retinal angiogenesis in oxygen-induced retinopathy mice. SiNPs also effectively inhibited in vitro vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. Via suppression of VEGF receptor-2 phosphorylation induced by VEGF, SiNPs blocked ERK 1/2 activation.

CD005139,0,20494915,0,Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in uveitis: a systematic review.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of uveitic complications such as cystoid macular oedema (CMO), choroidal neovasularisation (CNV) and retinal neovascularisation (RNV). The use of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies, namely bevacizumab and ranibizumab, has recently been described in the treatment of these complications. Evidence describing the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for these complications consists of case reports and case series, most of which are retrospective and have limitations in design and analysis. As such, the current level of evidence supporting the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for these complications of uveitis would be rated as very low. Furthermore, blockage of VEGF has not been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, treatment of the underlying inflammatory disease should play a central role in the management of uveitic CMO, CNV and RNV. A two-pronged treatment regimen that focuses on achieving disease quiescence through the use of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, while treating complications that arise despite adequate disease quiescence with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, may be useful. However, further data from prospective controlled trials are needed before the therapeutic role of anti-VEGF therapy in the uveitis treatment regimen can be fully determined."

CD005139,0,19800535,0,Antiangiogenic approaches to age-related macular degeneration today.,"Intravitreal ranibizumab reduces the risk of visual acuity loss and increases the chance of visual acuity gain compared with no treatment or photodynamic therapy for selected cases of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although intravitreal ranibizumab did not result in substantial improvement (15 or more letters on an ETDRs chart) in the majority of cases treated in the MARINA (Minimally classic/occult trial of the Anti-VEGF antibody Ranibizumab in the treatment of Neovascular AMD) or ANCHOR (Anti-VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic CHORoidal Neovascularization in AMD) trials, few cases experienced substantial visual acuity loss. The most serious known risk of treatment, endophthalmitis, although rare, is always a possibility. Intravitreal bevacizumab might be considered when ranibizumab is not available because of regulatory or financial constraints, and it might be considered in place of ranibizumab even without financial constraints if noninferiority trials show that bevacizumab is almost as good as-or is better than-ranibizumab. Systemic risks of intravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab are unknown, although trials have ruled out moderate or large systemic risks for ranibizumab. This therapy should be considered when initiating therapy for lesions that are subfoveal, and predominantly CNV when the lesion composition on fluorescein angiography (FA) is predominantly classic, or when there is presumed recent disease progression and the lesion composition is minimally classic or occult with no classic. Optical coherence tomography, FA, or both also might be of value to assist with decisions regarding continuation of treatment after it has been initiated. However, to date, there is little consistent information to suggest that utilizing these imaging modalities to consider withholding treatment before 2 years has been shown confidently to result in outcomes as good as monthly treatment. Extrapolation of these recommendations should be done with caution when considering the treatment of subfoveal CNV that is not predominantly CNV, such as predominantly blood lesions or lesions that are predominantly scar, as well as lesions associated with very low levels of visual acuity or those owing to causes other than AMD. A subsequent review in this series discusses other therapies for CNV being considered in the future."

It is also one of the most frequently encountered non.age-related macular degeneration causes of CNV and affects young patients in the working age group. Fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) are generally indicated to confirm the diagnosis of active myopic CNV before initiation of treatment. Without treatment, natural history studies have shown that the vision outcome can be very poor. More recently, a number of retrospective, prospective and phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trials have established the safety and efficacy of intravitreal anti.vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for the treatment of myopic CNV. Long-term follow-up studies have found that some of the initial vision gained after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may not be maintained, owing to the presence and progression of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) adjacent to the CNV.

CD005139,0,26423869,0,[Carrier-mediated Transport of Cationic Drugs across the Blood-Tissue Barrier].,"Studies of neurological dysfunction have revealed the neuroprotective effect of several cationic drugs, suggesting their usefulness in the treatment of neurological diseases. In the brain and retina, blood-tissue barriers such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) are formed to restrict nonspecific solute transport between the circulating blood and neural tissues. Therefore study of cationic drug transport at these barriers is essential to achieve systemic delivery of neuroprotective agents into the neural tissues. In the retina, severe diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration can cause neurological dysfunction that dramatically affects patients' QOL. The BRB is formed by retinal capillary endothelial cells (inner BRB) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (outer BRB). Blood-to-retina transport of cationic drugs was investigated at the inner BRB, which is known to nourish two thirds of the retina. Blood-to-retinal transport of verapamil suggested that the barrier function of the BRB differs from that of the BBB. Moreover, carrier-mediated transport of verapamil and pyrilamine revealed the involvement of novel organic cation transporters at the inner BRB. The identified transport systems for cationic drugs are sensitive to several cationic neuroprotective and anti-angiogenic agents such as clonidine and propranolol, and the involvement of novel transporters was also suggested in their blood-to-retina transport across the inner BRB."
CD005139,0,19199898,0,Ranibizumab for diabetic retinopathy.,"Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is a Fab-Antibody with high affinity for VEGF, and is being designed to bind to all VEGF isoforms. This quality makes it a powerful drug for VEGF inhibition. Diseases of retinal and choroidal blood vessels are the most prevalent causes of moderate and severe vision loss in developed countries. Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of many of these diseases. Results of the pilot studies showed that intraocular injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis) decrease the mean retinal thickness and improve the BCVA in all the subjects. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy, currently treated with destructive laser photocoagulation, represents another potential target for anti-VEGF therapy. The early experience in animal models with proliferative retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma shows that posterior and anterior neovascularizations are very sensitive to anti-VEGF therapy. The outcome of two phase III clinical trials will increase our knowledge of the role of Lucentis in the treatment of DME."

CD005139,0,26285742,0,VEGF Splicing and the Role of VEGF Splice Variants: From Physiological-Pathological Conditions to Specific Pre-mRNA Splicing.,"During this past decade, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway has been extensively studied. VEGF is a paradigm of molecular regulation since its expression is controlled at all possible steps including transcription, mRNA stability, translation, and pre-mRNA splicing. The latter form of molecular regulation is probably the least studied. This field has been neglected; yet different forms of VEGF with different sizes and different physiological properties issued from alternative splicing have been described a long time ago. Recently a new level of complexity was added to the field of splicing of VEGF pre-mRNA. Whereas thousands of publications have described VEGF as a pro-angiogenic factor, an alternative splicing event generates specific anti-angiogenic forms of VEGF that only differ from the others by a modification in the last six amino acids of the protein. According to the scientists who discovered these isoforms, which are indistinguishable from the pro-angiogenic ones with pan VEGF antibodies, some of the literature on VEGF is at least inexact if not completely false. Moreover, the presence of anti-angiogenic forms of VEGF may explain the disappointing efficacy of anti-VEGF therapies on the overall survival of patients with different forms of cancers and with wet age-related macular degeneration. This review focuses on the existence of the different alternative splice variants of VEGF and the molecular mechanisms associated with their expression and function."

In the present study, we examined the efficacy and the mechanism of candesartan, an AT(1) receptor antagonist, in suppressing pathological retinal neovascularization. We used an in vivo murine oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model and also studied the in vitro proliferation and migration of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. The regulation of angiogenesis-associated genes such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), VEGF-A, VEGF receptor-1, and VEGF receptor-2 was evaluated with real-time RT-PCR in the OIR model. In the OIR model, candesartan suppressed the pathological neovascularization in a dose-dependent manner, but did not prevent the physiological angiogenesis. However, candesartan did not inhibit VEGF-A-induced proliferation or migration in HRMECs in the in vitro study. When administered interperitoneally in the OIR model, candesartan reduced the upregulation of VEGF receptor-2 in the retina, but had no effects in the other angiogenesis-related genes, such as HIF-1α, VEGF-A, and VEGF receptor-1. These findings indicate that candesartan inhibited the retinal pathological neovascularization, at least in part, by suppressing the expression of VEGF receptor-2, independent of VEGF signaling cascade. Therefore, candesartan may be a useful therapeutic target for the inhibition of retinal neovascularization that has a low risk of serious side effects."

CD005139,0,19519581,0,Predictive role of gene polymorphisms affecting thrombin-generation pathway in variable efficacy of photodynamic therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the leading cause of central blindness in developed countries. The majority of severe vision loss occurs in the neovascular form of AMD, generally characterized by the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) beneath the fovea. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V) and drugs acting against vascular endothelial growth factor are the most commonly employed treatments for AMD-related subfoveal CNV. The combined use of both these strategies is the most promising therapeutic approach towards this harmful disease. The therapeutic action of PDT-V depends to a photochemical perturbation of thrombo-coagulative processes within CNV. Predictive correlations between peculiar coagulation-balance gene polymorphisms and different levels of post-PDT-V benefit have been recently documented in Caucasian patients with neovascular AMD. Particularly, heterozygous A-allele carriers of factor V Leiden 1691 or prothrombin 20210 gene are characterized by a greater possibility to exhibit clinical benefit after PDT-V. Both mutations induce thrombophilia increasing the thrombin generation in plasma and, thus, they can consistently intensify the photothrombotic phase of the therapeutic CNV occlusion. In prospect, considering the different individual susceptibility to PDT-V, a preoperative assessment of the genotypic thrombophilic background could optimize the eligibility criteria of this intriguing treatment. This review summarizes some of the recent published patents on treatment of neovascular AMD, with a particular attention to PDT-V application in combined therapeutic modalities."

The loading and releasing capacity were tested by employing emodin, and the effect on VEGF expression was performed at the gene and protein level. Finally, an investigation on angiogenesis was carried on fertilized chicken eggs. The results indicated that the magnesium silicate nanoparticles had low toxicity. Emodin-MgSiO3 can inhibit the expression of both VEGF gene and protein effectively. Angiogenesis of eggs was also reduced significantly.

Aflibercerpt is a 115-kDA recombinant fusion protein consisting of VEGF binding domains of human VEGF receptors-1 and -2 fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin-G1. The ability to bind placental growth factors 1 and 2 (which is another pro-permeability mediator) and a theoretically long half-life are potential advantages of aflibercept over other anti-VEGF agents. The use of intravitreal aflibercept in DME treatment has been investigated in several RCTs. The aim of this chapter is to briefly report on the current evidence for treating DME with intravitreal aflibercept."

Experimental and clinical evidence has demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a vital role in the formation of choroidal neovascularization. Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents have been recommended as a first-line treatment for neovascular AMD. However, persistent fluid or recurrent exudation still occurs despite standardized anti-VEGF therapy. Patients suffering from refractory or recurrent neovascular AMD may develop mechanisms of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, which results in a diminished therapeutic effect. Until now, there has been no consensus on the definitions of refractory neovascular AMD and recurrent neovascular AMD. This article aims at clarifying these concepts to evaluate the efficacy of switching drugs, which contributes to making clinical decision more scientifically.

CD005139,0,25745942,0,[Tetraspanins: a new target for antiangiogenic therapy?].,"Inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor A or inhibition of its receptors are currently used for the treatment of cancer. However, the results are still modest, especially because of the multitude and redundancy of angiogenic factors. It can be hypothesized that therapies targeting directly endothelial cells themselves could be more effective. The tetraspanins are transmembrane molecules, which are devoid of intrinsic enzymatic activity but can associate with each other and with other molecules such as integrins or proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily to form a network. The tetraspanins are present on the surface of endothelial cells and in vitro, inhibition of these molecules by antibodies or small interfering RNA suggests that tetraspanins play a role in angiogenesis. These preliminary data have been confirmed by the study of cancer xenografts in tetraspanin-deficient mice, which have a significant decrease in tumor size and tumor angiogenesis. In vivo, it has been shown that intravenous administration of a monoclonal antibody (ALB6) directed against CD9 decreases the tumor growth and angiogenesis and that intravitreal injection of a small interfering RNA decreasing CD9 significantly inhibits choroidal neovascularization induced by laser. Finally, anti-angiogenic effects and potent anti-tumor activity are observed by the intraperitoneal administration of GS-168AT2, a peptide derived from CD9-Partner 1, a molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, which interacts strongly with the CD9 and CD81. These data suggest that the pharmacological modulation of the tetraspanin web could play a new promising anti-angiogenic strategy."

CD005139,0,18452647,0,Vascular endothelial growth factor-dependent and -independent regulation of angiogenesis.,"Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels, is essential for preparing a closed circulatory system in the body, and for supplying oxygen and nutrition to tissues. Major diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis include pathological angiogenesis in their malignant processes, suggesting anti-angiogenic therapy to be a new strategy for suppression of diseases. However, until the 1970s, the molecular basis of angiogenesis was largely unknown. In recent decades, extensive studies have revealed a variety of angiogenic factors and their receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-VEGFRs, Angiopoietin-Tie, Ephrin-EphRs and Delta-Notch to be the major regulators of angiogenesis in vertebrates. VEGF and its receptors play a central role in physiological as well as pathological angiogenesis, and functional inhibitors of VEGF and VEGFRs such as anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody and small molecules that block the tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFRs have recently been approved for use to treat patients with colorectal, lung, renal and liver cancers. These drugs have opened a novel field of cancer therapy, i.e. anti-angiogenesis therapy. However, as yet they cannot completely cure patients, and cancer cells could become resistant to these drugs. Thus, it is important to understand further the molecular mechanisms underlying not only VEGF-VEGFR signaling but also the VEGF-independent regulation of angiogenesis, and to learn how to improve anti-angiogenesis therapy."

The correlation between the dynamic expression of Ang2 in tumors with regions of high angiogenic activity and a poor prognosis in many tumor types makes Ang2 an ideal drug target. We have generated MEDI3617, a human anti-Ang2 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes Ang2 by preventing its binding to the Tie2 receptor in vitro, and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Treatment of mice with MEDI3617 resulted in inhibition of angiogenesis in several mouse models including: FGF2-induced angiogenesis in a basement extract plug model, tumor and retinal angiogenesis. In xenograft tumor models, treatment with MEDI3617 resulted in a reduction in tumor angiogenesis and an increase in tumor hypoxia. The administration of MEDI3617 as a single agent to mice bearing human tumor xenografts resulted in tumor growth inhibition against a broad spectrum of tumor types. Combining MEDI3617 with chemotherapy or bevacizumab resulted in a delay in tumor growth and no body weight loss was observed in the combination groups. These results, combined with pharmacodynamic studies, demonstrate that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with MEDI3617 significantly inhibited tumor growth as a single agent by blocking tumor angiogenesis. Together, these data show that MEDI3617 is a robust antiangiogenic agent and support the clinical evaluation and biomarker development of MEDI3617 in cancer patients."

CD005139,0,22675660,0,Antiangiogenic therapy for ischemic retinopathies.,"Neovascularization is a common pathological process in various retinal vascular disorders including diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). The development of neovascular vessels may lead to complications such as vitreous hemorrhage, fibrovascular tissue formation, and traction retinal detachments. Ultimately, irreversible vision loss may result. Various proangiogenic factors are involved in these complex processes. Different antiangiogenic drugs have been formulated in an attempt treat these vascular disorders. One factor that plays a major role in the development of retinal neovascularization is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Anti-VEGF agents are currently FDA approved for the treatment of AMD and RVO. They are also extensively used as an off-label treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME), proliferative DR, and neovascular glaucoma. However, at this time, the long-term safety of chronic VEGF inhibition has not been extensively evaluated.

CD005139,0,16026270,0,Vascular endothelial growth factor and diabetic retinopathy: role of oxidative stress.,"Retinal neovascularization and macular edema are central features of diabetic retinopathy, a major cause of blindness in working age adults. The currently established treatment for diabetic retinopathy targets the vascular pathology by laser photocoagulation. This approach is associated with significant adverse effects due the destruction of neural tissue and is not always effective. Characterization of the molecular and cellular processes involved in vascular growth and hyperpermeability has led to the recognition that the angiogenic growth factor and vascular permeability factor VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) play a pivotal role in the retinal microvascular complications of diabetes. Thus, VEGF represents an important target for therapeutic intervention in diabetic retinopathy. Agents that directly inhibit the actions of VEGF and its receptors show considerable promise, but have not proven to be completely effective in blocking pathological angiogenesis. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular events that control VEGF expression and mediate its downstream actions is important to define more precise therapeutic targets for intervention in diabetic retinopathy. This review highlights the current understanding of the process by which VEGF gene expression is regulated and how VEGF's biological effects are altered during diabetes. In particular, cellular and molecular alterations seen in diabetic models are considered in the context of high glucose-mediated oxidative stress effects on VEGF expression and action. Potential therapeutic strategies for preventing VEGF overexpression or blocking its pathological actions in the diabetic retina are considered."

Multimodal imaging findings, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were reviewed. Genetic testing for the RS1 gene was performed in one patient.ResultsWe identified two female patients who fit the definition of SNIFR and presented with concomitant neovascular age-related macular degeneration (n-AMD). In both the patients, SD-OCT showed exudative macular features and splitting (bilateral in patient 1, unilateral in patient 2) of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) in the macula with no other evidence of hereditary or an acquired predisposing condition. Genetic testing excluded mutation of RS1 gene in patient 1. The fundi of both the patients showed characteristic signs of active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and following anti-VEGF treatment, visual acuity improved and CNV-related exudative changes resolved.

CD005139,0,24740170,0,Intravitreal aflibercept (Eylea(®)): a review of its use in patients with macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion.,"Aflibercept is a fully human, recombinant fusion protein that acts as a soluble decoy receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members, including VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placental growth factor (P1GF), thereby inhibiting downstream signalling mediated by these ligands. Aflibercept binds all isoforms of VEGF-A with high affinity, and a markedly higher affinity than that of ranibizumab or bevacizumab. A formulation of aflibercept developed specifically for intravitreal injection (Eylea(®)) is approved for use in several countries for the treatment of patients with macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). In clinical trials (GALILEO and COPERNICUS) in patients with this condition, intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg every month improved best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as measured by the proportion of study eyes with a gain of ≥15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters from baseline, significantly more than sham injections at week 24 (primary analysis). The significant improvements achieved with intravitreal aflibercept compared with sham in the first 6 months were maintained in the second 6 months with as-needed (prn) dosing and monthly monitoring. Continued prn dosing with a reduced monitoring frequency was associated with decreased improvements. More data are needed to confirm the optimal monitoring frequency for use with prn dosing, subsequent to initial monthly injections, in order to maintain long-term efficacy. Intravitreal aflibercept was generally well tolerated in clinical trials and there is little potential for systemic drug accumulation. Thus, intravitreal aflibercept is an effective and generally well tolerated agent that extends the options available for the treatment of macular oedema secondary to CRVO."

AMD is a degenerative retinal disease that causes progressive loss of central vision and is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss and legal blindness in individuals over the age of 50. Both environmental and genetic components play a role in its development. AMD is a multifactorial disease with characteristics that include drusen, hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), geographic atrophy and, in a subset of patients, late-stage choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have proven effective in treating late-stage CNV, but optimal means of drug delivery remains to be determined. Microscopic particles, whose size is on the nanometer scale, show considerable promise for drug delivery to the retina, for gene therapy, and for powering prosthetic ""artificial retinas."" This article summarizes the pathophysiology of AMD stressing potential applications from nanotechnology."
CD005139,0,17245083,0,Vascular endothelial growth factor and the potential therapeutic use of pegaptanib (macugen) in diabetic retinopathy.,"Both clinical and preclinical findings have implicated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathophysiology of diabetic macular edema (DME). VEGF is both a potent enhancer of vascular permeability and a key inducer of angiogenesis. VEGF levels are elevated in the eyes of patients with DME, and in animal models of diabetes this elevation coincides with the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Moreover, injection of VEGF (the VEGF165 isoform in particular) into healthy eyes of animals can induce diabetes-associated ocular pathologies.Pegaptanib, a novel RNA aptamer currently used in the treatment of agerelated macular degeneration, binds and inactivates VEGF165 and has been shown in animal models to reverse the blood-retinal barrier breakdown associated with diabetes. These findings formed the basis of a phase II trial involving 172 patients with DME, in which intravitreous pegaptanib (0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg) or sham injections were administered every 6 weeks for 12 weeks, with the option of continuing for 18 more weeks or undergoing laser treatment. Compared to sham, patients receiving 0.3 mg displayed superior visual acuity (p = 0.04) as well as a reduction in retinal thickness of 68 micrometers compared to a slight increase under sham treatment (p = 0.021). These data support the use of pegaptanib in the treatment of DME."
CD005139,0,20188747,0,EPCs and pathological angiogenesis: when good cells go bad.,"Bone-marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to angiogenesis-mediated pathological neovascularization, and recent studies have begun to recognize the biological significance of this contribution. This review will discuss the ability of EPCs to contribute to neovascularization in both physiological and pathological conditions. Circulating EPCs were originally identified in 1997 by Asahara as CD34(+) VEGFR2(+) mononuclear cells. These cells differentiated into an endothelial phenotype, expressed endothelial markers, and incorporated into neovessels at sites of ischemia (Asahara et al., 1997). EPCs provide both instructive (release of pro-angiogenic cytokines) and structural (vessel incorporation and stabilization) functions that contribute to the initiation of neo-angiogenesis. EPC populations can be characterized based on surface markers of freshly isolated cells, or they can be described by their in vitro characteristics once placed in culture. However, a major stumbling block to progress in the field has been the lack of consensus among investigators as to the optimal characterization of EPCs. This review intends to address the role of both EPC classes and evaluate how they interact in the setting of pathological angiogenesis. Since the EPCs may be responsible for turning on the ""angiogenic switch,"" strategies have been employed to keep this switch in the ""off"" position for diseases like cancer, retinopathy, and wet AMD. The expectation is that EPCs will evolve into clinically useful prognostic and predictive tools in cancer and in ocular diseases associated with pathological neovascularization and that targeting this cell type is a key to successful management of patients suffering from diseases associated with pathological neovascularization."

Work with anti-cancer, anti-angiogenic agents has fueled the way for ocular therapeutics. The market size for age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy is huge. Fifteen million people in the United States alone have age-related macular degeneration with 2 million new cases each year (1). About 20.8 million people in the United States have diabetes. Of those, 14.6 million are diagnosed and 6.2 million are undiagnosed (2). Of patients who have had type 1 diabetics for more than 20 years, 50% will have proliferative diabetic retinopathy (3). Between 60% and 80% of type 2 diabetics will manifest retinopathy after 15 years, and 20% will progress to proliferative retinopathy after 25 years of duration (4). Big pharma and biotech were complacent in developing drugs capable of having effect on ocular neovascular diseases even though technologies were available, at least on the research level, long before there was serious activity to bring such technologies to the clinic. Finally, over the last three years, triple digit million dollar business development deals have been consummated, mostly for VEGF-A targeted modalities. Such biodollar partnerships were the eye openers which have now led to a concerted action to develop ocular drugs to combat ocular neovascularization. Anti-VEGF-A technologies do not constitute the whole story. Agents with broader activity, activity that occurs later down the angiogenic pathway and those drugs which are capable to synergize with anti-VEGF-A technologies will dominate the next wave in ocular diseases of neovascularization and will lead the next round of significant business development deals."

CD005139,0,21913742,0,Genetic predictors of response to photodynamictherapy.,"In Western countries, therapeutic management of patients affected by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to different typologies of macular degeneration represents a major health care problem. Age-related macular degeneration is the disease most frequently associated with CNV development. Schematically, CNVs can be distinguished into classic and occult subtypes, which are characterized by variable natural history and different responsiveness to some therapeutic procedures. At present, the dramatic vision loss due to CNV can be mainly treated by two interventional strategies, which are utilizable in either single or combined modalities: photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V), and intravitreal administration of drugs acting against vascular endothelial growth factor. The combined use of PDT-V and anti-angiogenic drugs represents one of the most promising strategies against neovascular macular degeneration, but it unavoidably results in an expensive increase in health resource utilization. However, the positive data from several studies serve as a basis for reconsidering the role of PDT-V, which has undergone a renaissance prompted by the need for a more rational therapeutic approach toward CNV. New pharmacogenetic knowledge of PDT-V points to exploratory prospects to optimize the clinical application of this intriguing photothrombotic procedure. In fact, a Medline search provides data regarding the role of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetic predictors of CNV responsiveness to PDT-V. Specifically, correlations between SNPs and different levels of PDT-V efficacy have been detected by examining the gene variants influencing (i) thrombo-coagulative pathways, i.e. methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T (rs1801133), factor V (F5) 1691G>A (rs6025), prothrombin (F2) 20210G>A (rs1799963), and factor XIII-A (F13A1) 185G>T (rs5985); (ii) complement activation and/or inflammatory processes, i.e. complement factor H (CFH) 1277T>C (rs1061170), high-temperature requirement factor A1 (HTRA1) promoter -512G>A (rs11200638), and two variants of the C-reactive protein (CRP) gene (rs2808635 and rs876538); and (iii) production and bioavailability of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA -2578C>A [rs699947] and rs2146323). This article critically evaluates both the clinical plausibility and the opportunity to utilize the most important SNP-response interactions of PDT-V for an effective upgrade of the current anti-CNV therapeutic scenario. In addition, the pharmacogenetics of a very severe post-PDT-V adverse event, i.e. a decrease in acute vision, is briefly discussed. A comprehensive appraisal of the findings reviewed in this article should be carefully considered to design future trials aimed at verifying (after proper genotypic stratification of the enrolled patients) whether these innovative pharmacogenetic approaches will be able to improve the multifaceted interventional management of neovascular macular degeneration."

There are many drug targets for anti-angiogenesis, such as promoting angiogenesis factor, integrins and matrix proteinases. Some drugs act on the typical tip cells which is much important in the process of angiogenesis differentiation and proliferation. Overall, these studies opened our view of anti-angiogenesis. The purpose of this article is to summarize the possible drug targets of angiogenesis and the key issues in the study of anti-angiogenic drugs."

CD005139,0,21875571,0,Targeting CD9 produces stimulus-independent antiangiogenic effects predominantly in activated endothelial cells during angiogenesis: a novel antiangiogenic therapy.,"The precise roles of tetraspanin CD9 are unclear. Here we show that CD9 plays a stimulus-independent role in angiogenesis and that inhibiting CD9 expression or function is a potential antiangiogenic therapy. Knocking down CD9 expression significantly inhibited in vitro endothelial cell migration and invasion induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Injecting CD9-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA-CD9) markedly inhibited HGF- or VEGF-induced subconjunctival angiogenesis in vivo. Both results revealed potent and stimulus-independent antiangiogenic effects of targeting CD9. Furthermore, intravitreous injections of siRNA-CD9 or anti-CD9 antibodies were therapeutically effective for laser-induced retinal and choroidal neovascularization in mice, a representative ocular angiogenic disease model. In terms of the mechanism, growth factor receptor and downstream signaling activation were not affected, whereas abnormal localization of integrins and membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase was observed during angiogenesis, by knocking down CD9 expression. Notably, knocking down CD9 expression did not induce death and mildly inhibited proliferation of quiescent endothelial cells under conditions without an angiogenic stimulus. Thus, CD9 does not directly affect growth factor-induced signal transduction, which is required in angiogenesis and normal vasculature, but is part of the angiogenesis machinery in endothelial cells during angiogenesis. In conclusion, targeting CD9 produced stimulus-independent antiangiogenic effects predominantly in activated endothelial cells during angiogenesis, and appears to be an effective and safe antiangiogenic approach. These results shed light on the biological roles of CD9 and may lead to novel antiangiogenic therapies."

A treatment algorithm is provided regarding the management of DME. While grid laser photocoagulation remains the first-line therapy for focal vasogenic DME, diffuse DME can be effectively treated by means of intravitreal injections of corticosteroids. Recalcitrant DME can also be managed beneficially with intravitreal steroids. The management of DME is complex, and often multiple treatment approaches are needed.

CD005139,0,20065654,0,A dual-targeting PDGFRbeta/VEGF-A molecule assembled from stable antibody fragments demonstrates anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo.,"Targeting angiogenesis is a promising approach to the treatment of solid tumors and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Inhibition of vascularization has been validated by the successful marketing of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target specific growth factors or their receptors, but there is considerable room for improvement in existing therapies. Combination of mAbs targeting both the VEGF and PDGF pathways has the potential to increase the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy without the accompanying toxicities of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the inability to combine efficiently with traditional chemotherapeutics. However, development costs and regulatory issues have limited the use of combinatorial approaches for the generation of more efficacious treatments. The concept of mediating disease pathology by targeting two antigens with one therapeutic was proposed over two decades ago. While mAbs are particularly suitable candidates for a dual-targeting approach, engineering bispecificity into one molecule can be difficult due to issues with expression and stability, which play a significant role in manufacturability. Here, we address these issues upstream in the process of developing a bispecific antibody (bsAb). Single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) targeting PDGFRbeta and VEGF-A were selected for superior stability. The scFvs were fused to both termini of human Fc to generate a bispecific, tetravalent molecule. The resulting molecule displays potent activity, binds both targets simultaneously, and is stable in serum. The assembly of a bsAb using stable monomeric units allowed development of an anti-PDGFRB/VEGF-A antibody capable of attenuating angiogenesis through two distinct pathways and represents an efficient method for rapid engineering of dual-targeting molecules."

Improvements have been made regarding the management of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) since it was described in the Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity study. A more appropriate time for therapeutic intervention was defined by the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity (ETROP) trial. Advances in screening strategies with the use of digital imaging systems are now available. All of this and the use of laser photocoagulation and vitreoretinal surgery have contributed to significant increases in favorable outcomes and decreases in child blindness secondary to ROP.

All patients received three consecutive monthly injections of ranibizumab after the surgery, and were reviewed monthly and treated on a pro re nata regime.ResultsA total of 45 eyes of 45 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 77.07±9.67 years, and 32 of 45 patients (71.1%) were women. Surgery was performed on average 6.98±5.70 days after the onset of symptoms, and patients were observed for a follow-up period of 12.9±10.8 months.

Recently, novel complement therapeutics have been created with the capacity to be ""targeted"" to sites of complement activation. One example is our recombinant form of fH, CR2-fH, which consists of the N-terminus of mouse fH that contains the CAP-inhibitory domain, linked to a complement receptor 2 (CR2) targeting fragment that binds complement activation products. CR2-fH was investigated in vivo in the mouse model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and in vitro in oxidatively stressed RPE cell monolayers. RPE deterioration and CNV development were found to require CAP activation, and specific CAP inhibition by CR2-fH reduced the loss of RPE integrity and angiogenesis in CNV. In both the in vivo and in vitro paradigm of RPE damage, a model requiring molecular events known to be involved in AMD, complement-dependent VEGF production, was confirmed. These data may open new avenues for AMD treatment strategies."

CD005139,0,21143129,0,Recent advances in intraocular drug delivery systems.,"Vitreoretinal diseases are refractory to both topical and systemic pharmacological approaches because of specific environment of the eye. That is, the cornea, the sclera, nasolacrimal drainage of tears, frontward stream of aqueous humor, blood-aqueous barrier, and blood-retinal barrier strictly limit penetration and diffusion of drug into the retina. However, recent advances in intraocular drug delivery systems (DDS) have enabled drug to be delivered effectively into the eye. Clinically successful or promising cases involve non-biodegradable implants and inserts, biodegradable inserts and microparticles, intravitreal or sub-Tenon's injection of triamcinolone acetonide, and a photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin, a photosensitizer. More recently, a variety of pharmacological challenges to treat exudative age-related macular degeneration and macular edema are proceeding into clinical trials, as soon as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies have been proved to be effective by repeated intravitreal injections. In the near future, DDS must be required not only to develop a new treatment modality but also to improve efficacy and/or reduce injection numbers of currently available drugs.

CD005139,0,24895562,0,Visual and anatomical outcomes of intravitreal aflibercept for treatment-resistant neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"A retrospective chart review of patients with persistent subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid, despite previous treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg), who were switched to aflibercept injections, was performed. Treatment was three monthly aflibercept (2 mg) injections followed by dosing on pro re nata basis. Main outcome measures included changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), 1 mm central subfield (CSF) retinal thickness, the height of the pigment epithelial detachment (PED), and subfoveal choroidal thickness on optical coherence tomography at 6 months. Thirty-one eyes of 30 patients were analyzed. The mean number of injections before aflibercept conversion was 34.4 ± 11.9. After an average of 4.5 aflibercept injections (range 3 to 6) over 6 months, no significant change in BCVA was observed (P > 0.05). Compared with baseline, there was a significant reduction of the CSF retinal thickness (449 ± 179 versus 269 ± 145  μ m, P < 0.001), maximum PED height (262 ± 134 versus 183 ± 100  μ m, P < 0.001), and choroidal thickness (192 ± 67 versus 167 ± 51  μ m, P < 0.01).

CD005139,0,17719376,0,Treatment of Co-existent occult choroidal neovascular membrane and macular hole.,"The co-existence of a macular hole and a choroidal neovascular membrane can represent a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. In this noncomparative case report, we report on a patient with co-existent macular hole and choroidal neovascular membrane. The patient initially was found to have an occult choroidal neovascular membrane. The patient was not treated and the vision remained stable for almost 1 year until the patient noted further visual decline. The patient was treated with intravitreal pegaptanib and the patient's vision remained stable for 6 months. However, on follow-up the patient presented with visual decline and a full thickness macular hole was confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). The patient underwent repair and vision improved with closure of the macular hole. The occult choroidal neovascular membrane remained stable with no evidence of disease progression. Fundus photos, intravenous fluorescein angiograms, and OCT were obtained before and after therapy and confirmed the diagnosis. This report highlights how the detection of co-existent macular hole and choroidal neovascular membrane may require OCT scanning. When treatment is entertained, therapy should be directed first toward the neovascular complex and then to repair the macular hole."

Seventy patients in G2 were treated with 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab at 6-week intervals until choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was no longer active. The frequency of the CFH 402H allele was significantly higher in AMD patients than in controls (p = 2.62 × 10(-16)). However, subgroup analysis does not reveal any association between the variant allele H and phenotypes of AMD or CNV. Also, there was no significant difference in response to bevacizumab treatment according to Y402H CFH genotype (p = 0.59). A strong association of the 402H allele with susceptibility to AMD in the Tunisian population was confirmed; however, this variant does not appear to be involved in the clinical progression of this disease or in the postintravitreal bevacizumab response."

CD005139,0,24206851,0,Implementation studies of ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"The pathogenesis of AMD is associated with age changes plus pathological changes involving oxidative stress and an altered inflammatory response leading to injury of retinal pigment epithelial cells and the adjacent choroidea and photoreceptor cells. AMD is divided into early, intermediate and advanced AMD. The advanced form of AMD is further divided into non-neovascular AMD and neovascular AMD. The diagnosis of neovascular AMD is based on FA and clinical characteristics of the eyes. The CNV lesions are by their growth pattern divided into type 1 CNV lesions, which grow primarily beneath the RPE, and type 2 CNV lesions, which have penetrated the RPE and evolve within the subretinal space. The natural course of neovascular AMD leads to visual disability in a majority of cases within the first years after onset, primarily caused by the development of subfoveal fibrous tissue and atrophy of the RPE. The prognosis of visual acuity in neovascular AMD has been markedly improved by the introduction of an intravitreal administered VEGF inhibitor (ranibizumab) given on a monthly basis. Treatment with ranibizumab for neovascular AMD was introduced in Denmark in 2006 under a fully reimbursed national healthcare plan. Treatment with ranibizumab is given in a variable dosing regimen that varies from the monthly dosing regimen administered in the studies that led to the approval of ranibizumab for neovascular AMD in Europe. The main objectives of this PhD thesis were to evaluate and potentially improve treatment with ranibizumab in a variable OCT guided regimen for neovascular AMD. Another intension of this PhD thesis was to prepare the conditions for future research to further improve the visual prognosis in neovascular AMD treated with anti-VEGF agents. The first study revealed that vision was improved in eyes with active neovascular AMD treated for 1 year in a variable ranibizumab treatment regimen as compared to PDT and the natural course of the disease. We assumed by comparing our results with other pro re nata regimens based on a monthly reassessment of disease activity that our patients could gain substantial vision if we optimized our frequency of re-examinations. The analysis demonstrated that we could discontinue treatment in patients who had a poor visual acuity during the first 3 months of treatment and that visual outcome could be improved by minimizing the delay from diagnosis of neovascular AMD to first administered ranibizumab injection. This study led to changes in departmental treatment procedures. In the second study, we found that type 2 CNV lesions had a higher hazard ratio as compared to type 1 CNV lesions in developing subfoveal fibrosis. Prominent subfoveal fibrous tissue and fibrous tissue with retinal atrophy led to poorer visual performances in eyes with neovascular AMD after 2 years of treatment as compared with eyes without subfoveal fibrous tissue. In the development of randomized clinical trials designed to address how treatment with VEGF inhibitors can be improved by limiting the growth of subfoveal fibrous tissue or neuroretinal atrophy, it is important to define subgroups of eyes at risk of these pathological changes. The second PhD study has contributed to identify this subgroup of eyes. The third study included in this PhD thesis revealed that the annual incidence rate of AMD-related legally blind persons registered in Denmark has halved during the last decade, with the bulk of the reduction observed after the introduction of ranibizumab for neovascular AMD."
CD005139,0,20802176,0,The role of vascular endothelial growth factor-induced activation of NADPH oxidase in choroidal endothelial cells and choroidal neovascularization.,"Rac1, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, plays an important role in directed endothelial cell motility. We reported previously that Rac1 activation was necessary for choroidal endothelial cell migration across the retinal pigment epithelium, a critical step in the development of vision-threatening neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Here we explored the roles of Rac1 and NADPH oxidase activation in response to vascular endothelial growth factor treatment in vitro and in a model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization. We found that vascular endothelial growth factor induced the activation of Rac1 and of NADPH oxidase in cultured human choroidal endothelial cells. Further, vascular endothelial growth factor led to heightened generation of reactive oxygen species from cultured human choroidal endothelial cells, which was prevented by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium, or the antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine. In a model of laser-induced injury, inhibition of NADPH oxidase with apocynin significantly reduced reactive oxygen species levels as measured by dihydroethidium fluorescence and the volume of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization. Mice lacking functional p47phox, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, had reduced dihydroethidium fluorescence and choroidal neovascularization compared with wild-type controls. Taken together, these results indicate that vascular endothelial growth factor activates Rac1 upstream from NADPH oxidase in human choroidal endothelial cells and increases generation of reactive oxygen species, contributing to choroidal neovascularization. These steps may contributed to the pathology of neovascular age-related macular degeneration."

Reinjections were performed with IVB if optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed recurrent ME associated with decreased visual acuity. The main outcome measurement was the number of additional IVB injections, and changes of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) during a 6-month follow-up period were compared.ResultsBCVA showed significant improvement in two groups at 6 months. In addition, CMT showed significant decrease in two groups at 6 months. No significant differences in the change of BCVA and CMT at 6 months after injection (P=0.973, P=0.639) were observed between the two groups. A statistically significant difference was found regarding the number of additional IVB injections (IVB group 0.96±0.83; IVB/STA group 0.44±0.70, P=0.034).ConclusionAlthough combination therapy of IVB with a single simultaneous STA for treatment of ME secondary to BRVO did not affect the visual outcomes compared with IVB monotherapy, it had a benefit of reducing the number of additional IVB injections."

The only treatments currently available, such as ranibizumab injections, are for neovascular AMD, which accounts for only 10 to 15% of people with the condition. Hypoxia has been implicated as one of the primary causes of AMD, and is most acute at night when the retina is most metabolically active. By increasing light levels at night, the metabolic requirements of the retina and hence the hypoxia will be considerably reduced. This trial seeks to determine whether wearing a light mask that emits a dim, green light during the night can prevent the progression of early AMD."

The visual acuity (VA) was 6/60 (R) and 6/6 (L). Funduscopy revealed superficial macular haemorrhage in the right eye. Using fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography, retinal angiomatous proliferation was confirmed. Two intra-vitreal injections of bevacizumab were given but the VA did not improve. Following this, he received an intra-vitreal injection of ranibizumab. Regression of the retinal angiomatous proliferation was observed and the VA of the right eye returned to 6/10. Simultaneously, his left eye suffered from sudden visual loss and retinal angiomatous proliferation was diagnosed. Three intra-vitreal injections of ranibizumab were given. Regression of the retinal angiomatous proliferation was observed and the VA of the left eye was stabilised. Another 80-year-old man complained of sudden distorted vision in his left eye. Funduscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed superficial macular haemorrhage and retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED). The VA was 6/12 and retinal angiomatous proliferation was diagnosed. He received an intra-vitreous injection of bevacizumab followed by photodynamic therapy (PDT). The RPED was resolved; however, the VA dropped to 2/60. Optical coherent tomography, fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography were used to indentify retinal angiomatous proliferation. Intra-vitreal injection(s) of a double dose (1 mg) of ranibizumab is a worthwhile treatment, as it can stabilise and even improve the VA without significant side effects."

CD005139,0,20813746,0,Submacular haemorrhages associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"The exact incidence of submacular haemorrhage (SMH) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is unknown, and risk factors for its occurrence ill defined. It is known, however, to be a relatively common problem and important because the visual prognosis of these patients is poor. Unfortunately, patients with significant SMH were excluded from all the recent major randomised control trials for nAMD with antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and photodynamic therapy, and as such, the optimum management of patients is uncertain. SMH can present initially or during treatment of nAMD. The location, size, thickness and duration of SMH have an important bearing on treatment and outcomes. Thin or extrafoveal SMH are probably best treated with anti-VEGF agents alone. It has been proposed that patients with moderate-sized SMH, particularly thick haemorrhages, have an improved prognosis with surgical SMH displacement combined with treatment of CNVM if present. SMH drainage, macular translocation and RPE patch grafting are reserved for more severe extensive cases of SMH. Using these techniques, outcomes better than the natural history have been achieved. This review aims to summarise what is known about SMH in nAMD and will discuss a variety of therapeutic interventions."

CD005139,0,17979601,0,Emerging pharmacotherapies for diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most frequent cause of severe vision impairment in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Even though patients should achieve optimal glycemic control, normalization of blood pressure and serum lipids, as well as improvement of cardiac and renal status, these measures alone will not prevent every patient from developing visual loss caused by DME. The goal of local treatment for DME is vision improvement, usually achieved after reducing leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA) and retinal thickness on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Laser photocoagulation is still the standard treatment for clinically significant DME. However, laser photocoagulation rarely provides major visual improvement, especially in patients with diffuse DME. Thus, a therapeutic intervention that restores visual acuity impaired by DME more often remains a significant unmet medical need. This review aims to present the most important emerging drug technologies for therapy of DME at present, including corticosteroids, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, small interfering RNA, hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and non-hormonal anti-inflammatory agents. Recent progress in this field suggests that local management of DME may change rapidly in the near future. Novel emerging drugs should enable better anatomical and functional outcomes for therapy of this sight-threatening disease."

The use of antiangiogenic agents in the management of macular edema due to inflammation is a fairly new approach. It is not entirely clear if these agents should be used as an adjunct to anti-inflammatory therapy or if they can be used as stand-alone agents in edema due to infections where immunosuppressive therapy could be detrimental to the resolution of infection. This treatment paradigm is largely borrowed from large randomized trials in other retinovascular diseases. Similar prospective studies are needed to clarify the role of antiangiogenic therapy in UME.

CD005139,0,19470386,0,Rosmarinic acid suppresses retinal neovascularization via cell cycle arrest with increase of p21(WAF1) expression.,"Pathological angiogenesis is the most common cause of blindness at all ages including retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. Despite advances in therapy, retinopathy of prematurity remains the most sight-threatening vaso-proliferative retinopathy in children. Herein, we demonstrated that rosmarinic acid has an anti-angiogenic activity to retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity, which is related to cell cycle arrest with increase of p21(WAF1). Rosmarinic acid significantly inhibited the proliferation of retinal endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibited in vitro angiogenesis of tube formation. Interestingly, the anti-proliferative activity of rosmarinic acid on retinal endothelial cells was related to G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. With treatment of rosmarinic acid, retinal endothelial cells in G2/M phase increased whereas those in G0/G1 and S phases decreased, which was accompanied by increase of p21(WAF1) expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, rosmarinic acid effectively suppressed retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity, and showed no retinal toxicity. These data suggest rosmarinic acid could be a potent inhibitor of retinal neovascularization and may be applied in the treatment of other vasoproliferative retinopathies."

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a well known pro-inflammatory cytokine, acts on the vascular endothelium by promoting vasodilatation, edema, and leukocyte recruitment, which are all commonly associated with the development of CNV. Corneal neovascularization is the second cause of blindness worldwide; hence, pharmacological TNF-α inhibition might represent an attractive therapeutic option. Although none of the existing TNF-α antagonists has been registered as a CNV inhibitor, three of them (etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) have been proposed to control ocular inflammation. More specifically, it has been demonstrated that infliximab is also effective in reducing hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in different animal models of CNV. In this article, we review the role of TNF-α on the ocular surface and, in particular, its specific role in the process of CNV.

CD005139,0,12354124,0,Antiangiogenic effects of somatostatin analogues.,"Inhibition of angiogenesis has become a target for antineoplastic therapy and for treatment of retinal neovascularization. The presence of somatostatin receptors on tumour cells and on the proliferating vascular endothelium has led to several in vitro and in vivo studies to investigate the antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects of somatostatin analogues. Currently available data suggest that somatostatin analogues might inhibit angiogenesis directly through somatostatin receptors present on endothelial cells and also indirectly through the inhibition of growth factor secretion such as IGF-I and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and reducing monocyte chemotaxis. However, beneficial effects on inhibition of neovascularization have been questioned by some studies. More work is therefore required to firmly establish the role of somatostatin analogues as potential antiangiogenic therapy. The currently available somatostatin analogues have high affinity for somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) and, to a lesser extent, sst5 and sst3. However, because vascular endothelial cells express several types of somatostatin receptors, it will be important to investigate somatostatin analogues with different receptor subtype affinities, which might increase the spectrum of available therapy for tumours."

CD005139,0,26771090,0,Response to anti-VEGF-A treatment of endothelial cells in vitro.,"This study was conducted to compare the effects of two anti-VEGF-A drugs, Ranibizumab and Aflibercept, on the expression and secretion of VEGFs family members, and on their influence in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (HECV) in vitro. HECV cells were exposed 24 h (T1), 4 days (T2) and 6 days (T3) to Ranibizumab or Aflibercept at pharmacodynamically relevant concentrations (Ranibizumab: 12.5 μg/ml and 125 μg/ml; Aflibercept: 50 μg/ml and 500 μg/ml). Cell viability and then expression and secretion of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C and PlGF were evaluated respectively by Real Time-PCR and ELISA. Intracellular signaling activated by VEGF-A and VEGF-C was investigated evaluating phosphorylation of VEGFR2. Influence in would healing was evaluated through scratch assay. In general no differences were observed among the tested concentrations of anti-vegf drugs. Ranibizumab and Aflibercept did not affect HECV cell viability in all experimental times. At T1, Ranibizumab decreased mRNA levels of VEGF-A, induced VEGF-C secretion, abrogated phosphorylation of VEGFR2 stimulated by VEGF-A, and impaired ability of HECV cells to repair wound healing. Aflibercept decreased mRNA levels of VEGF-A, -B and PlGF; slightly increased basal level of phVEGFR2, and completely abrogated phosphorylation stimulated by VEGF-A and VEGF-C. No effects on secretion of VEGF-B and on would healing were observed after exposure to Aflibercept. Prolonged exposure to anti-VEGFs decreased expression and secretion of VEGF-A and VEGF-B, up-regulated VEGF-C mRNA levels and its secretion, and increased basal phosphorylation of VEGFR2. Acute treatment with Ranibizumab or Aflibercept evoked different responses on endothelial cells, however these differences were lost after prolonged exposure. Scratch test results suggest that treatment with Ranibizumab may be more effective than Aflibercept in reducing angiogenic potential of endothelial cells in vitro."

CD005139,0,16842164,0,Antineovascular agents in the treatment of eye diseases.,"Neovascularization is a common and potentially visually threatening complication of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). An antiangiogenic therapy is aimed at inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels and should prevent onset or progression of neovascularization. Accumulated evidence indicates that growth factors, endothelial cell surface receptors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are major mediators of neovascularization and appealing targets for pharmacotherapeutical intervention. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of retinal neovascularization (in linking tissue ischemia to angiogenesis), and is likely to contribute also significantly to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Several antineovascular agents antagonize the function of VEGF, by blocking its proangiogenic activity. Indeed, VEGF targeting or disruption of VEGF signalling is the most effective strategy known so far in the pharmacological treatment of ocular neovascularization. Other compounds such as pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) either aim at balancing the levels of pro-angiogenic and angiostatic molecules, target inflammation (cyclooxygenase inhibitors, steroids) or comprise modifiers of the ECM such as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and agents that block the action of integrins. Vascular targeting agents (combretastatin) promote removal of newly formed vessels. This review provides an update on recent investigations directed at the pharmacotherapeutical management of ocular neovascular diseases, placing special emphasis on the underlying target molecules and relevant intracellular signalling pathways."

CD005139,0,12064086,0,Mechanisms of age-related macular degeneration.,"AMD is a poorly understood disease at this time. Since it is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world, there is a pressing need for better treatment. Therefore, there is extensive ongoing research in both pathogenesis and therapy of AMD. Epidemiological studies have shown significant risk associated with increasing age and cigarette smoking, future studies may identify environmental risk factors though at present studies have been inconclusive. Genetic studies may identify subgroups of disease and thus help provide a selective approach to treatment. The vascular model of AMD may provide better understanding of the blood flow and post capillary resistance and help in early and newer intervention in the disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor has been extensively studied in choroidal neovascularization. It has been demonstrated in human and animal models of CNV and VEGF antagonists are currently in clinical trial. Extensive work is ongoing to prevent and treat CNV with antiangiogenic agents."

CD005139,0,20388340,0,[Be cautious of using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for treatment of macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion].,"There are various therapies for the treatment of macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Intravitreous injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a new procedure. The efficacy and safety of this therapy have been widely proved in short term clinical observations. However, the relapse of macular edema and the requirement for multi-injections are still remaining problems. It requires more evidences to prove that a better long term prognosis could be obtained from this procedure as compared with traditional laser coagulation. The optimizing therapies should include a combination of anti-VEGF therapy with other drugs and laser treatment to decrease the risk of multi-injections and to obtain the best results. Selection of appropriate therapeutic procedure (based on the evidence based medicine) to protect and improve visual function are the important project of clinicians and require further exploration and investigation."
CD005139,0,19668726,0,Pegaptanib sodium for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: clinical experience in the UK.,"The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is unclear, but it can take either a neovascular/exudative/wet form, characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), or a dry form. No treatments are available for the dry form, but there are a number of pharmacological interventions that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is central to the pathogenesis of CNV and neovascular AMD. Available anti-VEGF agents either target all active VEGF isoforms (eg, ranibizumab), or take a more selective approach and inhibit only VEGF(165) (eg, pegaptantib sodium). Current guidance on their use is equivocal and restrictive at best, resulting in associated difficulties in securing adequate, timely funding for treatment. The Moorfields Eye Hospital undertook an audit of 70 patients receiving intravitreal (ITV) pegaptanib sodium on a pro re nata (prn) dosing schedule. Despite initial funding delays, the audit recorded superior treatment outcomes compared with those reported in the VISION trials at 12 weeks: 88% of audit patients maintained stable vision, 29% gained vision and 6% experienced severe vision loss compared with 70%, >/=6% and </=10% of patients in VISION at 54 weeks, respectively. The audit indicates a positive correlation between patients with better baseline visual acuity (VA) and improved therapeutic benefits, including a greater likelihood of both vision gain and vision preservation. Experience at Moorfields also suggests that pegaptanib sodium is more useful in occult lesions than minimally classic lesions, and clinical experience suggests that combination therapies may offer the best approach with anti-VEGF therapies. Further randomized clinical trials will help better determine the optimal treatment strategies with pegaptanib sodium in neovascular AMD."

The number of patients having age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in association with glaucoma grows all over the world that attaches medical and social value to this problem. 102 patients with AMD were under follow-up, 7 of them had primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Three consecutive injections of ranibizumab resulted in visual acuity increase from 0.21 +/- 0.17 till 0.37 +/- 0.12. The mean retinal thickness in foveal zone decreased from 289.36 +/- 88.73 till 230.47 +/- 88.02 microm. Ocular hypertension within 12 hours after procedure was observed in 13 (12.7%) of 102 patients. In all cases intraocular pressure (IOP) returned to preoperative values in 3 days after hypotensive medical treatment. In one case trabeculectomy was performed simultaneously with ranibizumab intravitreal injection, the next two injections were performed in a month intervals. So the problem of IOP increase after intravitreal injections remains unsolved. Glaucoma is not an absolute contraindication to intravitreal injections in treatment of exudative AMD although patients with associated conditions need individual approach in terms of both IOP compensation and number of ranibizumab injections."

CD005139,0,23092791,0,Endothelial tip cells in ocular angiogenesis: potential target for anti-angiogenesis therapy.,"Endothelial tip cells are leading cells at the tips of vascular sprouts coordinating multiple processes during angiogenesis. In the developing retina, tip cells play a tightly controlled, timely role in angiogenesis. In contrast, excessive numbers of tip cells are a characteristic of the chaotic pathological blood vessels in proliferative retinopathies. Tip cells control adjacent endothelial cells in a hierarchical manner to form the stalk of the sprouting vessel, using, among others, the VEGF-DLL-Notch signaling pathway, and recruit pericytes. Tip cells are guided toward avascular areas by signals from the local extracellular matrix that are released by cells from the neuroretina such as astrocytes. Recently, tip cells were identified in endothelial cell cultures, enabling identification of novel molecular markers and mechanisms involved in tip cell biology. These mechanisms are relevant for understanding proliferative retinopathies. Agents that primarily target tip cells can block pathological angiogenesis in the retina efficiently and safely without adverse effects. A striking example is platelet-derived growth factor, which was recently shown to be an efficacious additional target in the treatment of retinal neovascularization. Here we discuss these and other tip cell-based strategies with respect to their potential to treat patients with ocular diseases dominated by neovascularization."
CD005139,0,22798045,0,Cell cycle regulation by bevacizumab in ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelial cells.,"Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibits its interaction with receptors found on endothelial cells. Bevacizumab has been increasingly used as an off-label treatment for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Whether or not bevacizumab is capable of arresting the growth of human retinal pigment epithelial cells remains to be clarified. In this study, flow cytometry was used to evaluate whether bevacizumab markedly induced the G1/S phase arrest. The G1/S phase cycle-related protein analysis demonstrated that the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, 4 and 6 and of cyclin D and E, as well as the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (ppRB) production were found to be markedly reduced by bevacizumab. By contrast, the protein levels of p53, p16, p21 and p27 were increased in bevacizumab-treated ARPE-19 cells (a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line). These events of G1/S arrest induced by bevacizumab in ARPE-19 cells suggest that a preventive effect of bevacizumab exists in AMD."

In the Netherlands, there is now a total of around 55,000 patients with age-related macular degeneration, and this figure is expected to rise to approximately 114,000 by 2025. Loss of central vision is caused by a degeneration of photoreceptors cells and pigment epithelium. Age-related macular degeneration is subdivided into a dry, atrophic form and an exudative form with neovascularisations. Many international studies have been published over the past ten years on potential new therapies for neovascular macular degeneration. For conventional laser treatment, it has been shown that visual loss in the long term is less marked in the treated group than in the observation group, despite the immediate destruction of the retina. Photodynamic therapy seems a promising new form of local therapy with few side-effects. For both therapies, however, the indication is limited to patients with the classic type of neovascularisation.

A 41-year-old patient presented with multiple small, discrete yellow-whitish spots in both eyes, compatible with MFC. A few weeks later, despite treatment with sub-Tenon and systemic corticosteroids, a choroidal neovascularization occurred in the right eye. The patient was treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. After 2 months, reduced visual acuity, photopsia and visual field defect in the left eye occurred. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed photoreceptor outer segment defects common to all choriocapillaritis. The additional finding of an annular scotoma and a 360° ring on indocyanine green angiography led us to make the diagnosis of presumed AZOOR. Despite the combination of several immunosuppressive agents leading to temporary control of the disease, the patient experienced a further worsening. At that point, adalimumab was introduced, which led to an obvious improvement. This case supports the hypothesis that two different entities of the so-called AZOOR complex can be possible in the same eye, even asynchronously. In our case, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody therapy represented a valid treatment option in a patient unresponsive to traditional immunosuppressive treatments."

All eyes received either intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) or bevacizumab (IVB). On the consecutive day following the initial IVR/IVB treatment, ICGA-guided verteporfin (6 mg/m(2)) PDT with half-fluence rate (25 J/cm(2)) was performed on every patient. IVR or IVB was rescheduled on a pro re nata regimen. Main outcome measures were changes in visual acuity (VA) according to the ETDRS letter score and changes in the central foveal thickness (CFT).ResultsBest-corrected VA at baseline was 65.6 letters (±6.7; n=17) according to the ETDRS letter score. At 12 months, mean ETDRS letter score improved to 71.2 letters (P=0.34). CFT was 309 μm and decreased to 216 μm at month 12 control (P=0.0004). Nine eyes (52.9%) received additional treatment with IVR/IVB due to recurrence of subretinal fluid, with an overall mean number of IVR/IVB treatment of 1.8±3.6 per patient with no systemic side effects during 12 months' follow-up.ConclusionsIVR or IVB combined with ICGA-guided half-fluence PDT with verteporfin is effective in treating CNV in chronic CSCR, with choroidal hyperpermeability in ICGA, resulting in stable vision and significant reduction of CFT."

In most cases, laser treatment does not improve visual acuity. Therefore research in ophthalmology focuses on the improvement of the prognosis of DMO patients with a drug-based DMO therapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is considered the most important therapeutic target because this growth factor also is the most potent permeability factor affecting the inner retinal barrier formed by endothelial cells (ECs). Compared to its angiogenic stimulation of proliferation and migration of ECs, effects of VEGF on permeability have not been studied in all details. In vitro investigations on the behaviour of primary or immortalised retinal endothelial cells confirmed the key role of VEGF in the regulation of the permeability of the inner retinal barrier. Despite the presence of a variety of other factors found to be elevated in DR, a VEGF-disrupted barrier can be completely restored with the VEGF-inhibiting ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and bevacizumab (Avastin®) when applied at clinically achievable concentrations. The antibody bevacizumab, but not the antibody fragment ranibizumab, accumulates in both retinal EC and pigment epithelial cells during prolonged treatment. This observation might be relevant because patients are often treated for several years and additional long-term side effects may be recognised in the future."

The most common causes of vision loss in children and adults involve at least in part perturbation of the normal vascular physiology or development. Vascular endothelial growth factor has emerged as a key molecular regulator of retinal vascular development as well as retinal and choroidal neovascularization, which underlie the pathophysiology of many retinal diseases. Over the past decade, the advent of injectable pharmacotherapeutic agents into the vitreous cavity of the eye has revolutionized our management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration and other retinal diseases and has, for the first time, offered an opportunity to improve vision rather than just slow the progression of disease processes. The transient duration of these agents, however, requires chronic treatment with repeated intraocular injections and significant treatment burden for patients and the healthcare system.

CD005139,0,20825071,0,Safety of ranibizumab therapy in wet AMD and the role of vascular endothelial growth factors in physiological angiogenesis.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor - A (VEGF-A), is a major factor implicated in choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and therefore a target for therapeutic agents in wet age related macular degeneration (AMD). Ranibiuzumab (Lucentis) blocks all active isoforms of VEGF-A and the products of their degradation. It penetrates through all layers of the retina in order to reach the target tissue. It is quickly removed from the system and it is characterised by low level of immunogenicity. The essence of angiogenesis is formation of new vessels by branching and expansion of already existing ones. Angiogenesis is an important physiological process that takes place during the healing of wounds, reconstruction of hypoxic injury and reproduction. However some diseases such as cancer, arthritis, diabetes and neovascular AMD are associated with persistent unregulated angiogenesis. There is an important question whether binding vascular-endothelial growth factors in wet AMD therapies using ranibizumab is correlated with the increase of the incidence of systematic adverse effects (AEs), such as cardiovascular episodes or thrombosis. The aim of this article is to present ranibizumab as a safe drug in treating wet AMD patients. Even though the concentration of Lucentis administered in a dose of 0.3 or 0.5 mg into the vitreous body in the organism is very low, the incidence of AEs during the anti-VEGF therapy was traced. In MARINA and ANCHOR studies, occurrence of possible AEs was observed. No statistically significant differences were shown in the AEs frequency between the patients treated with ranibizumab and the control group, and in correlation with the general population of patients suffering from wet AMD."

Aflibercept was applied again for persistent or recurrent CNV, as required. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS.RESULTS Mean patient age was 45.8 years, and mean eye refractive error was -7.79 D. For the total patient group (n=38 eyes), mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) significantly improved from 0.69 at baseline to 0.15 at 18 months (P<0.01). Over half of the treated eyes obtained resolution with one aflibercept injection. Patients were also grouped according to age, as <50 years (n=20 eyes) and ≥50 years (n=18 eyes). Mean BCVA improvement was significantly greater in eyes of the younger myopic CNV group, compared with those of ≥50 years (0.21 vs 0.35; P<0.05). The mean number of aflibercept injections was 1.8 for the <50 years myopic CNV group, and 3.6 for the ≥50 years myopic CNV group (P<0.001). Correlation between spherical equivalent refraction and final visual acuity reached statistical significance only for the <50 years myopic CNV group (P<0.001; Levene's correlation).CONCLUSIONS Intravitreal aflibercept provides long-term visual acuity improvement in myopic CNV. The <50 years old myopic CNV group had significantly fewer injections, with greater visual acuity improvement.

In addition to the direct costs of treating age-related eye diseases, elderly persons with vision loss are at significantly increased risk for falls and fractures, experiencing social isolation, and suffering from an array of comorbid medical conditions compared with individuals with normal vision. Recent studies estimate the total economic burden (direct and indirect costs) of adult vision impairment in the United States at $51.4 billion. This figure is expected to increase as the baby boomer generation continues to age. While a number of highly effective new therapies have caused a paradigm shift in the management of several major age-related ocular diseases in recent years, these treatments come at a substantial cost.

Review of the literature and personal experience.,"Ocular photodynamic therapy (PDT) was introduced as a novel treatment for neovascular forms of age-related macular degeneration and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia in the mid/end 1990s. The current treatment recommendations are based on the results of two large, prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trials (Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration with Photodynamic Therapy and Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy Studies) and thousands of patients have been treated worldwide over the last years. Meanwhile, PDT has been performed in several other ocular pathologies with some remarkable results, however, with most reports being case reports and small case series without statistical significance. These extended applications include CNV secondary to choroiditis and retinochoroiditis, angioid streaks, central serous chorioretinopathy, retinal angiomatous proliferation, parafoveal telangiectasia or CNV associated with macular dystrophy and idiopathic CNV, as well as diseases without CNV, such as choroidal hemangioma, retinal hamartoma, choroidal melanoma, chronic central serous chorioretinopathy, angiomatous lesions secondary to systemic diseases, rubeosis iridis or neovascular glaucoma. To date, with the introduction of anti-VEGF therapy, the role of PDT will certainly change. However, it is reasonable to believe that it will maintain an important role in combination therapy due to its unique properties of selective vascular targeting. Therefore, it is essential for the ophthalmologist to be familiar with the extended applications and their modifications of treatment parameters. This review will summarize the standard and experimental applications of PDT based on our own results and the literature."

CD005139,0,28905539,0,New Treatment Modalities for Geographic Atrophy.,"Age‑related macular degeneration (AMD) is a significant cause of global visual morbidity and is projected to affect 288 million people by the year 2040. The advent of treatment with anti‒vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‑VEGF) drugs has revolutionized the treatment of neovascular AMD (nAMD) but there have been no similar breakthroughs for the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) to retard its progression. The advancements in imaging and new understanding of disease mechanisms, based on molecular and genetic models, have paved the way for the development of novel experimental treatment options for GA that aim to cater to a thus far largely unmet need. This review paper focuses on the recent clinical trials of new treatment options for slowing GA progression rates with emphasis on the agents that are currently undergoing, or have already undergone, significant clinical trial testing. Several new groups of drugs, including those targeting the complement cascade and agents considered as neuroprotective, have shown some promising results and could potentially pave the way forward in the treatment of this devastating disease."

His laboratory has investigated many aspects of VEGF biochemistry and molecular biology. In 1993, Ferrara reported that inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis by specific monoclonal antibodies resulted in dramatic suppression of the growth of a variety of tumors in vivo. These findings provided an important evidence that inhibition of angiogenesis may suppress tumor growth and blocking VEGF action could have therapeutic value for a variety of malignancies and validate the notion introduced in 1971 by Judah Folkman that inhibition of tumor angiogenesis might be a valid approach to control tumor growth. A further development was the design in a rational fashion in 1997 of a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (Avastin), now in clinical trials as a treatment for several solid tumors and also outside of cancer, for example, in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration."

In the past three decades, significant progress has been made in our understanding of angiogenesis; progress driven in large part by the increasing realization that blood vessel growth can promote or facilitate disease. By the early 1990s, it had become clear that the recently discovered ""vascular endothelial growth factor"" (VEGF) was a powerful mediator of angiogenesis. As a result, several groups targeted this molecule as a potential mediator of retinal ischemia-induced neovascularization in disorders such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion. Around this time, it also became clear that increased intraocular VEGF production was not limited to ischemic retinal diseases but was also a feature of choroidal vascular diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Thus, a new therapeutic era emerged, utilizing VEGF blockade for the management of chorioretinal diseases characterized by vascular hyperpermeability and/or neovascularization.

Baseline characteristics, resource use, and outcomes were analyzed using an instrumental variable approach and regression analysis.ResultsData were analyzed from 2227 patients enrolled in AURA. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ophthalmoscopy were the most common diagnostic tests used, and this combination was the strongest instrumental variable. Use of OCT and ophthalmoscopy affected the number of injections given and resulted in an increase in visual acuity gains from baseline of 17.6 letters in year 1 and 2.5 letters in year 2. Regression models using the instrumental variable (OCT and ophthalmoscopy combined) showed that ≥5.1 (95% CI: 3.3-11.4) ranibizumab injections were needed to maintain visual acuity from baseline to year 1 and ≥8.3 (95% CI: 5.3-18.8) injections were needed to maintain visual acuity from year 1 to year 2. To gain ≥15 letters, ≥7.9 (95% CI: 5.1-17.5) ranibizumab injections would be needed in year 1 and ≥16.1 (95% CI: 10.3-36.4) injections would be needed over 2 years.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the role that regular monitoring plays in guiding neovascular AMD therapy and they showed that the number of ranibizumab injections needed to maintain visual acuity is higher than that administered in AURA."

Ranibizumab (Lucentis(TM) Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) is a monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) directed toward all isoforms of VEGF-A that was specifically designed to target wet AMD. The human antibody fragment is produced by an E. coli expression system and has a molecular weight of 48kD allowing for excellent retinal penetration. The most common ocular complaints of patients receiving ranibizumab injections in randomized clinical trials were transient conjunctival hemorrhage, vitreous floaters, intraocular inflammation, increased intraocular pressure and eye pain. The rates of serious adverse events such as retinal detachment, cataract and endophthalmitis were similar to those that have been reported with other intravitreal injections and patients should always be treated under strict aseptic conditions to reduce this risk. There were no significant non-ocular events found during any study so far and the risk of thromboembolic events was less than 4% and not different than sham. The MARINA, ANCHOR and PIER studies validated the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab amongst a large population with different choroidal neovascular membrane lesion types against sham or standard of care treatment. These studies recommended monthly intravitreal ranibizumab for patients. However, the PIER study reported that an alternative dosing of every three months is acceptable but less effective than monthly injections."

After established neovascularisation, several pro- and antiangiogenic agents start to play an important role.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor, on the other hand, shows neuroprotective and antiangiogenic activities. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has a mitogenic effect on a wide range of epithelial and endothelial cells, and it is inhibited by an anti-HGF monoclonal antibody. Platelet-derived growth factor is a potent chemoattractant and mitogen for both fibroblasts and retinal RPE cells, which has been inhibited experimentally by VEGF Trap and human anti-platelet-derived growth factor-D monoclonal antibody. Fibroblast growth factor-2 has pleiotropic effects in different cell and organ systems, and it is blocked by anti-FGF antibodies, with a greater benefit regarding antiangiogenesis when combined treatment with anti-VEGF is performed. Tumour necrosis factor alpha is expressed in the retina and the choroid, and its blockade in choroidal neovascularisation includes the use of monoclonals such as infliximab. This paper reviews the most important cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of wet-AMD, with emphasis on potential combined therapies for disease control."

No meta-analysis of results is possible because of a lack of controlled and randomized trials, varying treatment regimes and outcome measures used, as well as suboptimal reporting. For genetic factors, most evidence to date has been generated for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the complement factor H (CFH), and VEGF-A genes. Just under half of the SNPs assessed in the CFH gene and 15% of the SNPs assessed in the VEGF gene were found to be associated with visual outcomes or the number of injections required during follow-up. Some evidence suggests association of worse treatment outcomes as well as a younger age at treatment onset with an increasing number of risk alleles in known risk genes (CFH and ARMS2/HTRA1) and polymorphisms in the VEGF-A gene. Clinical factors such as higher age, a better visual acuity (VA), a larger choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion at baseline, and a delay between symptom onset and initiation of treatment of more than 3 weeks also impact outcomes. Conversely, a worse acuity at baseline predicted more gain in vision. Overall, patients presenting with good acuity at baseline were more likely to have good VA at follow up, but the gain afforded by treatment was impacted by a ceiling effect. Most available evidence suggests a strong association of clinical factors such as age, baseline VA, and CNV lesion size with anti-VEGF treatment outcomes. No behavioral factors such as smoking influence treatment outcomes. Based on the studies conducted so far, the evidence suggests that underlying genotype of known AMD risk associated genes or of the VEGF-A gene have a limited effect, whereas presenting clinical factors appear to be more important in determining treatment outcomes."

Identification of key regulators of angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 2, pigment epithelium-derived growth factor, angiopoietins and extracellular matrix molecules, has facilitated the development of novel therapeutic agents that target the underlying pathological angiogenic process. Among these, VEGF serves as a ""master switch"" for many ocular neovascular conditions through its promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and survival, vascular permeability and ocular inflammation. Two anti-VEGF agents are now clinically available: bevacizumab, an antibody for metastatic colorectal cancer, and pegaptanib sodium, an aptamer for neovascular AMD. Unlike bevacizumab, which binds all VEGF isoforms, pegaptanib targets only VEGF165, the isoform responsible for pathological ocular neovascularization and thus an ideal target for treatment of AMD. Although other therapies targeting angiogenesis in AMD are in clinical development, to date, pegaptanib is the only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States for the treatment of all neovascular AMD and represents a valuable addition to the hitherto limited options available for patients."

The process of angiogenesis is tightly regulated by a balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a pro-angiogenic factor and several anti-VEGF therapies are used in the treatment of diseases that are characterized by abnormal formation of blood vessels such as certain cancers and age-related macular degeneration. In addition, dysregulated angiogenesis has been observed in inflammatory diseases and might underly chronic cutaneous inflammation in psoriasis. Several experimental studies and clinical reports suggest that VEGF is involved in psoriasis pathogenesis. Among those, transgenic over-expression of VEGF in keratinocytes in mice resulted in skin inflammation and a phenotype resembling human psoriasis. In different psoriasis models, anti-VEGF antibody treatment of mice, already displaying disease symptoms, resulted in an overall improvement of the cutaneous lesions. On the molecular level human keratinocytes produce VEGF after stimulation with cytokines involved in psoriasis pathogenesis. Finally, patients with psoriasis receiving anti-VEGF treatment for cancer showed complete remission of their cutaneous symptoms. Therefore, VEGF might be an underappreciated pro-inflammatory factor in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In this review, current knowledge on the significance of VEGF in psoriasis pathogenesis is summarized. Furthermore, current reports on treatments directed against VEGF or its receptors and their potential as future therapy for psoriasis are discussed."

CD005139,0,26424177,0,Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Properties of Anti-VEGF Drugs After Intravitreal Injection.,"Subretinal neovascularization and pathologic ocular angiogenesis are common causes of progressive, irreversible impairment of central vision, and dramatically affect quality of life. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy has improved the quality of life for many patients with age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and other ocular diseases involving neovascularization and edema. In these pathologies, the inhibition of intraocular VEGF is the only therapy that can preserve vision. Four anti-VEGF drugs are currently used to treat ocular neovascularization; pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and aflibercept have been approved for this condition, while bevacizumab can be used off-label. Anti-VEGF therapy is administered regularly for many months or years because its suspension or discontinuation may cause recurrence of neovascularization. On the other hand, VEGF is necessary for the survival of retinal and choroidal endothelial cells. Experimental studies in animal models have shown that local inhibition of VEGF causes thinning and atrophy of the choriocapillaris and degeneration of photoreceptors, primarily cones. These studies combined with clinical experience indicated that prolonged VEGF inhibition could impair retinal function. Moreover, anti-VEGF compounds can cross the blood-retina barrier, enter the systemic circulation, and inhibit serum VEGF. Since circulating VEGF protects blood vessel integrity, prolonged anti-VEGF treatment could induce thromboembolic adverse events from vascular causes such as heart attack and stroke, and even death. The ocular dosing regimen and systemic toxicity of anti-VEGF compounds are therefore central concerns. A better understanding of this topic requires knowledge of the metabolism, tissue distribution, and clearance of anti-VEGF compounds. This manuscript reviews the properties of anti-VEGF compounds following intravitreal administration."

CD005139,0,15369682,0,Current approaches and perspectives in the medical treatment of diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of visual loss in industrialized countries. Its classification includes preclinical, nonproliferative (mild, moderate, and severe or preproliferative diabetic retinopathy) and proliferative stages (low risk, high risk, and advanced). Diabetic maculopathy (exudative, edematous, or ischemic) may be associated with either nonproliferative or proliferative retinopathy. Prevention requires the tightest possible control of both blood glucose and blood pressure. Laser photocoagulation remains the only procedure recommended for severe nonproliferative or proliferative retinopathy and maculopathy. Since it reduces legal blindness by more than 90% in proliferative retinopathy and prevents severe sight loss in diabetic maculopathy, photocoagulation is probably one of the most effective forms of treatment known today. Less destructive approaches are desirable, however, and those currently under phase 3 trial include blockade of angiotensin receptors, the beta-isoform of protein kinase C, and growth hormone secretion by long-acting analogues of somatostatin. Evidence from past randomized controlled studies does not support a role for inhibitors of platelet aggregation, aldose reductase, and advanced glycosylation end products in the prevention/treatment of retinopathy. Future approaches might include the use of thiamine and its analogues in the primary and secondary prevention of early retinopathy and blockers of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor in more advanced stages."

To better understand the effectiveness of ranibizumab in clinical practice, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 12-month outcomes reported in peer-reviewed 'real-world' publications. Key measures included in our analysis were mean change in visual acuity (VA) and the proportion of patients gaining ≥15 letters or losing ≤15 letters. Twenty studies were eligible for inclusion in our study, with 18 358 eyes having sufficient data for analysis of 12-month outcomes. Mean baseline VA ranged from 48.8 to 61.6 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters. Mean change in VA was between -2.0 and +5.5 letters, with a grand mean of +2.9±3.2, and a weighted mean (adjusted for the number of eyes in the study) of +1.95. Eleven studies reported that 19±7.5 (mean value) of patients gained ≥15 letters, while in 12 studies the mean percentage of patient losing ≤15 letters was 89±6.5%. Our comprehensive analysis of real-world ranibizumab study data confirm that patient outcomes are considerably poorer than those reported in randomised control trials of both fixed and pro re nata regimens."

CD005139,0,22838951,0,Pharmacogenetics of antiangiogenic and antineovascular therapies of age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common age-related disease causing irreversible visual loss in industrialized countries, is a complex and multifactorial illness. Researchers have found components of the complement alternative pathway inside drusen and Bruch's membrane of AMD patients, underlying a possible important role of complement factor H in the pathogenesis of AMD. The neovascular (wet) AMD is the most destructive form and it is characterized by invasion of new blood vessels into subretinal spaces with subsequent exudation and bleeding, resulting in scarring of the macular region and loss of the central vision. The hallmark of the neovascular form is the choroidal neovascularization, where VEGF-A has an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. SNPs of these genes have recently been investigated as potential pharmacogenetic markers of the antiangiogenic and antineovascular therapy of AMD, which includes verteporfin photodynamic therapy and anti-VEGF-A drugs, such as pegaptanib, bevacizumab and ranibizumab. The CFH rs1061170 CT and TT genotypes have been associated with an improvement of visual acuity in bevacizumab or ranibizumab treated patients, whereas patients harboring VEGF-A rs699946 G allele responded better to bevacizumab-based therapy if compared with patients carrying the A allele. In conclusion, the discovery of pharmacogenetic markers for the personalization of the antiangiogenic and/or antineovascular therapy could be, in the future, a key issue in ophthalmology to obtain a personalization of the therapy and to avoid unnecessary costs and adverse drug reactions."

CD005139,0,17984175,0,Therapeutic antibodies targeting angiomotin inhibit angiogenesis in vivo.,"We have previously shown that angiomotin (Amot) mediates angiostatin inhibition of endothelial migration and tube formation in vitro. A crucial role of angiomotin in regulating endothelial cell motility is indicated by the findings that knockdown of Amot in zebrafish reduces the number of filopodia of endothelial tip cells and severely impairs the migration of intersegmental vessels. In addition, targeting angiomotin using DNA vaccination inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. In this report, we have generated antibodies that, similar to angiostatin, bind to angiomotin on the endothelial cell surface. These antibodies inhibited FGF-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced endothelial migration in the Boyden chamber assay. Furthermore, the anti-Amot B06 antibody significantly reduced the number of endothelial filopodia and inhibited vessel migration during retinal angiogenesis in vivo. We also show that systemic or local treatment with this antibody inhibits pathological blood vessel formation associated with tumor growth or laser-induced choroid neovascularization of the eye. These findings provide a rationale for using angiomotin antibodies for specifically targeting endothelial migration in angiogenesis-dependent diseases."

Eyes with nvAMD having incomplete response to 3-9 prior bevacizumab injections were recruited. Three monthly intravitreal aflibercept (2 mg) injections were administered, followed by two bi-monthly injections and a final examination at week 28. An optional injection was allowed at week 20.ResultsForty-seven eyes of 46 patients (mean±SD age 76±8 years) were recruited. The mean number of prior bevacizumab injections was 5.5±2.9.

CD005139,0,27355557,0,Metabolism of 4-Hydroxy-7-oxo-5-heptenoic Acid (HOHA) Lactone by Retinal Pigmented Epithelial Cells.,"4-Hydroxy-7-oxo-5-heptenic acid (HOHA)-lactone is a biologically active oxidative truncation product released (t1/2 = 30 min at 37 °C) by nonenzymatic transesterification/deacylation from docosahexaenoate lipids. We now report that HOHA-lactone readily diffuses into retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells where it is metabolized. A reduced glutathione (GSH) Michael adduct of HOHA-lactone is the most prominent metabolite detected by LC-MS in both the extracellular medium and cell lysates. This molecule appeared inside of ARPE-19 cells within seconds after exposure to HOHA-lactone. The intracellular level reached a maximum concentration at 30 min and then decreased with concomitant increases in its level in the extracellular medium, thus revealing a unidirectional export of the reduced GSH-HOHA-lactone adduct from the cytosol to extracellular medium. This metabolism is likely to modulate the involvement of HOHA-lactone in the pathogenesis of human diseases. HOHA-lactone is biologically active, e.g., low concentrations (0.1-1 μM) induce secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from ARPE-19 cells. HOHA-lactone is also a precursor of 2-(ω-carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP) derivatives of primary amino groups in proteins and ethanolamine phospholipids that have significant pathological and physiological relevance to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cancer, and wound healing. Both HOHA-lactone and the derived CEP can contribute to the angiogenesis that defines the neovascular ""wet"" form of AMD and that promotes the growth of tumors. While GSH depletion can increase the lethality of radiotherapy, because it will impair the metabolism of HOHA-lactone, the present study suggests that GSH depletion will also increase levels of HOHA-lactone and CEP that may promote recurrence of tumor growth."

Prokineticin-2 (Bv8) expression in CD11b(+) cells has been linked to anti-VEGF response. We have developed a reproducible method to quantify gene expression in circulating CD11b + cells. Utilizing this method we tested the hypothesis that high Bv8 expression in circulating CD11b(+) cells is associated with anti-VEGF refractoriness in nvAMD patients. Two groups of nvAMD subjects undergoing treatment with anti-VEGF agents were recruited and classified as refractory or non-refractory to anti-VEGF treatment (n = 33 for each group). Two blood draws were obtained from each subject 1-9 months apart. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and CD11b(+) cells were purified via magnetic bead separation. RNA was purified, and relative expression of Bv8 among the subjects was compared via quantitative PCR analysis. Utilizing this approach no significant difference was detected in the mean LogRQ values between the first and second blood draws (t-test, p = 0.826) indicating low intra-patient variability and demonstrating good reproducibility of the assay. There was no significant difference in Bv8 expression between nvAMD subjects classified as refractory versus non-refractory. We were unable to find a correlation between Bv8 expression in CD11b + cells and anti-VEGF refractoriness in human nvAMD subjects.

CD005139,0,25576666,0,Excessive retinol intake exacerbates choroidal neovascularization through upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor in retinal pigment epithelium in mice.,"As a part of the visual cycle, all-trans-retinol (all-trans-ROL), the major form of vitamin A in circulating blood, is transported to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). All-trans-ROL is essential for normal retina function. However, recent researches have shown that excessive retinol intake can cause increase of all-trans-retinal. This can lead to the accumulation of lipofuscin, which is important in the pathogenesis of retina degeneration disease, such as dry type age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Since there are few reports regarding the involvement of all-trans-ROL in exudative AMD, we investigated the effects of all-trans-ROL in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in ARPE-19 cells and THP-1 cells after all-trans-ROL treatment using ELISA and real-time RT-PCR. In-vitro tube formation assay was performed with HUVEC cells using the conditioned medium (CM) obtained from ARPE-19 cells treated with all-trans-ROL. Transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) was evaluated using luciferase assay. In mice, VEGF expressions were investigated in the retina and RPE/choroid after three weeks of excessive oral retinol intake. Laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) models were evaluated after they were fed with various doses of retinol. VEGF mRNA expression and VEGF production were significantly increased in all-trans-ROL treated ARPE-19 cells, which were inhibited by an RAR antagonist LE540. In contrast, there were no significant changes in VEGF production in THP-1 cells. Transcriptional activity of RAR was upregulated by all-trans-ROL treatment in ARPE-19 cells. The CM, obtained from ARPE-19 cells treated with all-trans-ROL, induced more capillary-like tube formation than cells treated with control vehicles. In vivo, the high retinol diet group has increased VEGF expression in the RPE/choroid and larger lesion size was induced. Our results suggest that all-trans-ROL is a pro-angiogenic factor. Excessive retinoid intake may be a potential risk factor for exudative AMD."
CD005139,0,20217540,0,Medical devices for the treatment of eye diseases.,"Development of intraocular drug delivery systems (DDSs) is urgently required for the treatment of eye diseases, especially in the posterior segment of the eye (the vitreous cavity, retina, and choroid), most of which are refractory to conventional pharmacologic approaches; eye drops and systemically administered drugs cannot achieve therapeutic drug concentrations in the posterior segment of the eye. Repeated intravitreal injections of anti-angiogenic agents are effective in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, but there remain risks of serious side effects such as endophthalmitis associated with repeated injections. Intraocular DDSs may address these problems. Intraocular sustained drug release from implantable or injectable devices has been investigated to treat vitreoretinal diseases. A reservoir-type nonbiodegradable implant was first launched in the market in 1996 for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis secondary to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, followed by clinical trials for a variety of potent devices to treat other challenging eye diseases. An injectable rod-shaped insert releasing a steroid is presently being assessed in a phase III trial to treat macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion. Thus various types of intraocular DDSs will be commercially available to treat vision-threatening intraocular diseases in the near future."

In this non comparative case study, 30 eyes of 27 patients with CNV due to AMD received intravitreal DSP (0.2 mg) and bevacizumab (1.25 mg) during a 6-month PRN (pro re nata) dosing regimen. Visual acuity, macular thickness and intraocular pressure (IOP) were monitored and recorded. After 6 months, mean retinal thickness decreased from 423.5 ± 75.3 to 228.2 ± 34.5 and mean visual acuity improved from 0.9 ± 0.39 logMAR to 0.53 ± 0.34 (p = 0.001) logMAR. During the trial period, 81 intravitreal injections were performed in 30 eyes, thus the mean number of injections per eye was 2.7 ± 1.1. 86.7% of the eyes required 3 or less injections while only 13.3% needed 4 or more injections. None of the patients, phakic or pseudophakic, manifested an elevation of IOP during the treatment, ranging between 12 and 22 mmHg.

CD005139,0,20932321,0,The potential of nanomedicine therapies to treat neovascular disease in the retina.,"Neovascular disease in the retina is the leading cause of blindness in all age groups. Thus, there is a great need to develop effective therapeutic agents to inhibit and prevent neovascularization in the retina. Over the past decade, anti-VEGF therapeutic agents have entered the clinic for the treatment of neovascular retinal disease, and these agents have been effective for slowing and preventing the progression of neovascularization. However, the therapeutic benefits of anti-VEGF therapy can be diminished by the need for prolonged treatment regimens of repeated intravitreal injections, which can lead to complications such as endophthalmitis, retinal tears, and retinal detachment. Recent advances in nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems offer the opportunity to improve bioactivity and prolong bioavailability of drugs in the retina to reduce the risks associated with treating neovascular disease. This article reviews recent advances in the development of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems which could be utilized to improve the treatment of neovascular disease in the retina."

The up-regulation of the pro-angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is intimately linked to the pathogenesis of exudative AMD, and its antagonism has been effectively targeted for treatment. However, very little is known about potential changes in expression of anti-angiogenic factors and the role they play in choroidal vascular homeostasis and neovascularization associated with AMD.

CD005139,0,12582462,0,Somatostatin analogues as drug therapies for retinopathies.,"Proliferative retinopathies account for the majority of cases of vision loss throughout the world. Currently accepted therapy for retinopathy consists of retinal ablation by panretinal laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy. This technique is not without deleterious effects to patients, including diminished night vision, reduced peripheral vision and loss of precise vision, decreasing visual acuity by one to two lines in magnitude. One promising area of research into pharmacotherapeutics for retinopathies, especially proliferative diabetic retinopathy, involves the use of synthetic analogues of somatostatin. The rationale for somatostatin as a therapeutic agent for retinal neovascularization is discussed. Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide have shown promise as a safe and effective treatment for severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy by blocking the local and systemic production of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor type 1 associated with angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. There are also observations suggesting an autocrine and paracrine effect of somatostatin, perhaps directly on retinal cells, which are known to express somatostatin receptors (SSTR). SSTR2 and SSTR3 are the most important receptor subtypes mediating growth hormone secretion and endothelial cell cycle arrest, retinal endothelial cell apoptosis and release of insulin. Thus, analogues that target these receptor subtypes may prove more useful. Long-acting somatostatin analogues are currently being tested for treatment of diabetic retinopathy and are, in fact, the only therapeutic alternative for patients who fail panretinal photocoagulation. Whether such a therapy may also prove effective for other retinal vascular proliferative diseases such as retinopathy of prematurity and age-related macular degeneration remains an open question that deserves attention, given our new understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which somatostatin may exert its antiangiogenic effects."

CD005139,0,22393532,0,Vascular normalization as a therapeutic strategy for malignant and nonmalignant disease.,"Pathological angiogenesis-driven by an imbalance of pro- and antiangiogenic signaling-is a hallmark of many diseases, both malignant and benign. Unlike in the healthy adult in which angiogenesis is tightly regulated, such diseases are characterized by uncontrolled new vessel formation, resulting in a microvascular network characterized by vessel immaturity, with profound structural and functional abnormalities. The consequence of these abnormalities is further modification of the microenvironment, often serving to fuel disease progression and attenuate response to conventional therapies. In this article, we present the ""vascular normalization"" hypothesis, which states that antiangiogenic therapy, by restoring the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signaling, can induce a more structurally and functionally normal vasculature in a variety of diseases. We present the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting this concept and discuss how it has contributed to successful treatment of both solid tumors and several benign conditions."

CD005139,0,26726925,0,A Mechanistic Model of the Intravitreal Pharmacokinetics of Large Molecules and the Pharmacodynamic Suppression of Ocular Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Levels by Ranibizumab in Patients with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibodies or antibody fragments has been shown to be a highly effective treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The ocular half-life (t1/2) of these large molecules, determined in ocular fluids or derived from serum levels, varies with molecular size and is larger in humans than in preclinical animal species. The high affinity binding of VEGF to these molecules lowers the free concentration of VEGF and reduces its occupancy on VEGF receptors in ocular tissues. To understand the biophysical determinants of t1/2 for anti-VEGF antibodies and the time-course of VEGF in ocular fluids, we developed a mechanistic model of intravitreal pharmacokinetics (IVT PK) for anti-VEGF antibodies and combined it with a mechanistic model of the pharmacodynamics (RVR PD) of VEGF suppression by ranibizumab, an anti-VEGF recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab). Our IVT PK model predicts that the ocular t1/2 of a large molecule will be approximately four-times the calculated value of its vitreous diffusion time (Tdiff), defined as rvit(2)/6D, where rvit is the radius of the vitreous chamber in that species (modeled as a sphere), and D is the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in physiological saline at 37 °C obtained from the Stokes-Einstein relation. This prediction is verified from a compilation of data and calculations on various large molecules in the human, monkey, rabbit, and rat and is consistent with the reported t1/2 values of ranibizumab in humans (mean value 7.9 days) and the calculated Tdiff of 1.59 days. Our RVR PD model is based on the publication of Saunders et al. (Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2015, 99, 1554-1559) who reported data on the time-course of VEGF levels in aqueous humor samples obtained from 31 patients receiving ranibizumab treatment for wet AMD and developed a compartmental mathematical model to describe the VEGF suppression profiles. We modified Saunders' model with the known 2:1 stoichiometry of ranibizumab-VEGF binding and included the association and dissociation kinetics of the binding reactions. Using the RVR PD model, we reanalyzed Saunders' data to estimate the in vivo dissociation constant (KD) between ranibizumab and VEGF. Our analysis demonstrates the delicate interrelationship between the in vivo KD value and the intravitreal half-life and yields an in vivo KD estimate that is appreciably larger than the in vitro KD estimates reported in the literature. Potential explanations for the difference between the in vivo and in vitro KD values, which appear to reflect the different methodologies and experimental conditions, are discussed. We conclude that the combined mechanistic model of IVT PK and RVR PD provides a useful framework for simulating the effects of dose, KD, and the molecular weight of VEGF-binding molecules on the duration of VEGF suppression."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in pathological angiogenesis in AMD. Herein, we present the development of an anti- human VEGF repebody, which is a small-sized protein binder consisting of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules. The anti-VEGF repebody selected through a phage-display was shown to have a high affinity and specificity for human VEGF. We demonstrate that this repebody effectively inhibits in vitro angiogenic cellular processes, such as proliferation and migration, by blocking the VEGF-mediated signaling pathway. The repebody was also shown to have a strong suppression effect on choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and vascular leakage in vivo. Our results indicate that the anti-VEGF repebody has a therapeutic potential for treating neovascular AMD as well as other VEGF-involved diseases including diabetic retinopathy and metastatic cancers."

Practical notes on functional and anatomical examination parameters from drug approval studies, specialist information and case series].","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most common causes of blindness in western industrialised nations. Most AMD patients suffer from the dry early form of AMD; however, wet AMD with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the main cause of blindness in all AMD patients. New prospects have been developed in AMD treatment using pharmacological methods available for treating all subtypes of exudative AMD. A number of inhibiting and inducing growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are particularly important in the pathophysiology of wet AMD. The secreted VEGF appears to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CNV and macular edemas as a result of its angiogenetic and permeability-enhancing effect. This recognition led to the treatment approach now used, i.e., competitive VEGF blocking through intravitreal adminsitration of anti-VEGF drugs. The anti-VEGF durgs lead to a rapid decrease in retinal thickness. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a valuable monitoring tool, but may only be used to assist in decision-making. Clinical follow-up of patients and further treatment recommendations must always be guided by the overall clinical picture. Visual acuity is regarded as the decisive criterion for repeat treatment."

It was originally designed and is still in use as antitumor agent (for colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers). Besides inhibiting vessel growth and neovascularization, the drug promotes the regression of existing microvessels and induces 'normalization' of surviving mature vasculature, stabilizes vessels and prevents leakage. Its molecular weight is 149 kDa and its estimated terminal half-life is approximately 20 days for both men and women. The effectiveness and safety of bevacizumab was proven in retrospective and prospective controlled clinical trials for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion and retinopathy of prematurity, especially for zone I. Uncontrolled trials have shown its effectiveness in various other conditions as myopic and uveitic choroidal neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma. There are no absolute contraindications to intravitreal injection though it is recommended to withhold treatment in patients who have recently suffered from a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event and during pregnancy. Ocular complications from intravitreal use are usually mild and transient (corneal abrasion, chemosis, subconjunctival hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage). Bacterial endophthalmitis is rare (about 0.1%).

CD005139,0,19223981,0,Proinflammatory role of vascular endothelial growth factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis: prospects for therapeutic intervention.,"Recent experimental and clinical studies have placed new emphasis on the role of angiogenesis in chronic inflammatory disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors are the best characterized system in the regulation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by angiogenesis. Furthermore, in addition to its angiogenic role, VEGF can act as a direct proinflammatory mediator during the pathogenesis of RA, and protect rheumatoid synoviocytes from apoptosis, which contributes to synovial hyperplasia. Therefore, the developments of synovial inflammation, hyperplasia, and angiogenesis in the joints of RA patients seem to be regulated by a common cue, namely, VEGF. Agents that target VEGF, such as anti-VEGF antibody and aptamer, have yielded promising clinical data in patients with cancer or macular degeneration, and in RA patients, pharmacologic modulations targeting VEGF or its receptor may offer new therapeutic approaches. In this review, the authors integrate current knowledge of VEGF signaling and information on VEGF antagonists gleaned experimentally and place emphasis on the use of synthetic anti-VEGF hexapeptide to prevent VEGF interacting with its receptor."

CD005139,0,27231313,0,Predicting outcomes to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in diabetic macular oedema: a review of the literature.,"Diabetic macular oedema affects visual acuity to a varying degree. The current treatment of choice is intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that has proven both its anatomical and visual efficacy in several large randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Although most patients respond well to anti-VEGF agents, some, however, show a moderate or even poor response. There is no clear consensus as to how to manage these patients, or define them. In addition, identifying early in the course of treatment which patients will respond and which patients will not is paramount to any personalised treatment regimen. Most large RCTs such as RESTORE and Protocol I have attempted post hoc analyses to identify demographic, clinical, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography findings that might predict patient response. Although some factors were found to be predictive, the lack of uniformity between the different RCTs means that no consensus exists as to which of these factors can be reliably used. This review looks at the large diabetic macular oedema RCTs such as RESTORE, Protocol I, READ-2 and BOLT in an attempt to identify common prognostic indicators between the various studies. We also attempted to look at several other OCT parameters such as the inner segment-outer segment (IS-OS) layer, the external limiting membrane layer, and choroidal thickness to help determine whether they can truly predict visual outcomes in patients being treated with anti-VEGF therapy. Finally, we provide a simplified summary about which factors might be relevant in clinical practice to help guide physicians in treatment decisions."

CD005139,0,22568102,0,[Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy].,"Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is characterized by a branching vascular network with polypoidal lesions under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In Japan, it is classified as a specific form of exudative age-related macular degeneration. However, several issues which we investigated regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of PCV remain unresolved. We investigated the pathogenesis, clinical findings and treatment of PCV. 1. Indocyanine green angiographic findings. There were two different patterns on indocyanine green angiograms. In the first pattern, both feeder and draining vessels were visible and network vessels showed characteristic findings of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Points of focal dilatation on marginal vessels were comprised of polypoidal lesions. In the second pattern, neither feeder nor draining vessels were visible and there were few network vessels. The points of deformation of network vessels appeared to be polypoidal lesions. The former represents a deformation of CNV, i.e. polypoidal CNV; the latter is thought to result from abnormalities of the choroidal vessels, i.e. PCV in the strict sense. 2. Pathological findings of PCV in the strict sense. The histopathological characteristics of PCV in the strict sense, which had been eliminated by vitrectomy, were dilatation and hyalinization of vessels, massive exudative changes in blood plasma, basement membrane-like deposits and scant granulomatous tissue. These vessels were located beneath Bruch's membrane. The findings indicate that PCV in the strict sense arises from hyalinized arteriolosclerosis of choroidal vessels. 3. Optical coherence tomographic findings. A break was found in the high reflective line which revealed Bruch's membrane. Low reflective tissue was observed at the break corresponding to a feeder vessel. The high reflective line which corresponded to the retinal pigment epithelium was uneven, and highly elevated portions of the RPE corresponded to thick network vessels and polypoidal lesions. Feeder vessels are thought to invade via Bruch's membrane to form network vessels and polypoidal lesions at the termini of the network vessels, both of which push the RPE upward. Therefore, polypoidal CNV is thought to represent a deformation of the CNV under the RPE. In PCV in the strict sense, an irregular thickened line with highly reflective substances adhering to the lower portion of it, curved downward corresponding to the site at which the network vessel filling began. A dimple in the RPE was observed which paralleled the curve of the line. The RPE was pushed upward, corresponding to the network vessels. Judging from the results of histopathological studies, abnormal vessels may be pushed up the RPE secondary to an increase in intravascular pressure due to the presence of several dilated vessels and by massive exudation from these vessels within the choroid at network vessels. The dimple in the RPE might be attributable to intra-choroidal pressure being decreased at the point at which network vessel filling began. 4. Genetic findings. There were significant differences in all distributions of ARMS 2 (A69S) between the polypoidal CNV and control groups. In contrast, the distribution of ARMS 2 (A69S) did not differ between the PCV in the strict sense group and the control group. The ARMS 2 (A69S) gene is closely related to age-related macular degeneration. Polypoidal CNV was thought to be associated with age-related macular degeneration. 5. Treatment of subfoveal PCV. Mean visual acuity improved 1 year after photodynamic therapy (PDT). Good visual acuity, small lesion size of the network of vessels with polypoidal lesions, and the absence of subfoveal polypoidal lesions were pre-PDT predictors that corresponded to the improvement in vision. However, mean visual acuity had decreased to a level similar to that prior to PDT at 2 and 3 years after treatment. In PCV in the strict sense, the branching vascular network persisted after PDT, and polypoidal lesions frequently recurred at the termini. The branching vascular network sometimes expanded and was accompanied by polypoidal CNV or classic CNV. These results indicate that repeated PDT, as monotherapy, has limitations as a long-term treatment for PCV in the strict sense. Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab for eyes with a visual acuity of 0.6 or more, which is not a good indication for PDT, achieved improvement in mean visual acuity 1 year after the treatment, though the frequency of polypoidal lesion regression was low. This procedure seems to be useful for eyes with good visual acuity for a period of at least one year. 6. Conclusion. Using indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography and genetic testing, PCV was classified into 2 groups, polypoidal CNV and PCV in the strict sense. PCV in the strict sense was characterized by arteriolsclerosis histopathologically. Polypoidal CNV is thought to represent deformation of CNV under the RPE in age-related macular degeneration, while PCV in the strict sense is thought to be due to choroidal vessel abnormalities. The long-term efficacy of repeated PDT as monotherapy, for subfoveal PCV was limited. Further evaluation is necessary to establish a treatment algorithm for PCV."
CD005139,0,23989128,0,Radiation therapy: age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe irreversible vision loss in patients over the age of 50 years in the developed world. Neovascular AMD (NVAMD) is responsible for 90% of the cases with severe visual loss. In the last decade, the treatment paradigm for NVAMD has been transformed by the advent of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. Despite the excellent results of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, frequent injections remain a necessity for most patients. The burden of these frequent visits as well as the cumulative risks of indefinite intravitreal injections demand continued pursuit of more enduring therapy that provides similar functional results. Radiotherapy has been studied for two decades as a potential therapy for NVAMD. Because of its antiangiogenic properties, radiation therapy remains a promising potential adjunctive resource for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to NVAMD. This review considers the past, present and future of radiation as a treatment or combination treatment of NVAMD."

CD005139,0,20812499,0,[The use of anti-angiogenic drugs for central retinal vein occlusion].,"Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is one of the common causes of visual loss. The main reasons for decreased vision are development of macular edema, macular ischemia and neovascular glaucoma. The introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs for CRVO in 2005 demonstrated marked improvement in visual acuity, macular edema and ocular neovascularization. However, the absence of clear guidelines for the treatment of CRVO presents a genuine therapeutic challenge. In a national study conducted among the Israeli society of retinal specialists (personal communication), it was found that most of these specialists would recommend intravitreal anti-VEGF drug injection immediately upon the diagnosis of macular edema in non-ischemic CRVO with visual acuity of 6/15 or less. Only 21% would recommend this treatment in ischemic CRVO with visual acuity of 6/60 or less, if no macular edema exists. After the edema resolves, 94% would follow-up the patients by imaging with optical coherent tomography every 4-6 weeks, and recommend further treatment accordingly. Large prospective controlled studies are warranted in order to address the important issues of when to start anti-VEGF treatment for CRVO, when to withhold treatment, and recommended treatment intervals."

While current NVAMD treatments target angiogenesis, these treatments are not effective for all patients and also require frequent intravitreal injections. New agents and delivery systems to treat NVAMD could be beneficial to many patients. We have recently developed a serpin-derived peptide as an anti-angiogenic agent. Here, this peptide is investigated for activity in human retinal endothelial cells in vitro and for reducing angiogenesis in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization mouse model of NVAMD in vivo. While frequent intravitreal injections can be tolerated clinically, reducing the number of injections can improve patient compliance, safety, and outcomes. To achieve this goal, and to maximize the in vivo activity of injected peptide, we have developed biodegradable polymers and controlled release particle formulations to extend anti-angiogenic therapy. To create these devices, the anionic peptides are first self-assembled into nanoparticles using a biodegradable cationic polymer and then as a second step, these nanoparticles are encapsulated into biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles. In situ, these particles show approximately zero-order, linear release of the anionic peptide over 200 days. These particles are made of safe, hydrolytically degradable polymers and have low endotoxin. Long-term in vivo experiments in the laser-induced neovascularization model for NVAMD show that these peptide-releasing particles decrease angiogenesis for at least fourteen weeks in vivo following a single particle dose and therefore are a promising treatment strategy for NVAMD."

CD005139,0,25821585,0,Gene Therapy with Endogenous Inhibitors of Angiogenesis for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Beyond Anti-VEGF Therapy.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of substantial and irreversible vision loss amongst elderly populations in industrialized countries. The advanced neovascular (or ""wet"") form of the disease is responsible for severe and aggressive loss of central vision. Current treatments aim to seal off leaky blood vessels via laser therapy or to suppress vessel leakage and neovascular growth through intraocular injections of antibodies that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the long-term success of anti-VEGF therapy can be hampered by limitations such as low or variable efficacy, high frequency of administration (usually monthly), potentially serious side effects, and, most importantly, loss of efficacy with prolonged treatment. Gene transfer of endogenous antiangiogenic proteins is an alternative approach that has the potential to provide long-term suppression of neovascularization and/or excessive vascular leakage in the eye. Preclinical studies of gene transfer in a large animal model have provided impressive preliminary results with a number of transgenes. In addition, a clinical trial in patients suffering from advanced neovascular AMD has provided proof-of-concept for successful gene transfer. In this mini review, we summarize current theories pertaining to the application of gene therapy for neovascular AMD and the potential benefits when used in conjunction with endogenous antiangiogenic proteins."

Compared to macular laser photocoagulation (READ-2 study), RBZ provided a greater improvement in BCVA and regression in foveal thickness, but required a higher number of injections compared to patients treated with both RBZ and laser. In RESTORE trial, RBZ alone or combined with macular laser turned out to be superior to laser alone, without significant differences between the 2 RBZ groups. Compared to combined treatment (RBZ or triamcinolone associated with macular laser) or photocoagulation laser alone (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network trial), RBZ with prompt or deferred laser was more effective than laser alone at 1-year follow-up. At 3 years, prompt laser was not better than deferring laser for 24 weeks or more. At 5 years, subjects treated with RBZ achieved better long-term visual outcomes than patients managed with triamcinolone or laser followed by very deferred RBZ. In conclusion, randomized clinical trials showed that RBZ was superior to laser in DME treatment, providing excellent long-term visual outcomes.

CD005139,0,22495066,0,Polyethylene glycol-modified pigment epithelial-derived factor: new prospects for treatment of retinal neovascularization.,"Pathological retinal neovascularization and choroidal neovascularization are major causes of vision loss in a variety of clinical conditions, such as retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. Pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) has been found to be the most potent natural, endogenous inhibitor of neovascularization, but its application is restricted because of its instability and short half-life. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been used as a drug carrier to slow clearance rate for decades. The present study investigated PEGylated-PEDF for the first time and evaluated its long-term effects on preventing angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. PEG showed lower cytotoxicity to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In vitro, PEGylated-PEDF inhibited HUVEC proliferation, migration, tube formation, and vascular endothelium growth factor secretion and induced HUVEC apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and it showed a statistically significant difference compared with the PEDF treatment group. In vivo, PEGylated-PEDF had a long-lasting effect in both plasma and retinal concentrations. In an oxygen-induced retinopathy model, one intravitreous injection of PEGylated-PEDF after mouse pups were moved into room air resulted in a significant difference in the inhibition of retinal neovascularization, which decreased the nonperfusion area, compared with the PEDF-treated group. Our present study demonstrated for the first time the long-term inhibitory effects of PEGylated-PEDF on the prevention of neovascularization in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that PEGylated-PEDF could offer an innovative therapeutic strategy for preventing retinal neovascularization."

CD005139,0,19089562,0,Current status of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in Europe.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important modulator of angiogenesis, and has been implicated in the pathology of a number of conditions, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and cancer. AMD is a progressive disease of the macula and the third major cause of blindness worldwide. If not treated appropriately, AMD can progress rapidly, causing legal blindness within months of the second eye becoming affected. Until recently, the treatment options for AMD have been limited, with photodynamic therapy (PDT) the mainstay treatment. Although PDT is effective at slowing disease progression, it rarely results in improved vision. Pegaptanib and ranibizumab are both anti-VEGF therapies licensed for the treatment of neovascular AMD in Europe; however, these drugs are not yet available in Japan. This article reviews the available clinical data on anti-VEGF therapies for the treatment of neovascular AMD in Europe, and considers the future of this exciting therapy."

CD005139,0,25725263,0,Antibody therapies and their challenges in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the western world. This multifactorial disease results from the combined contributions of age, environment and genetic predisposition. Antibody-based treatment of late-stage neovascular AMD with inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor has had great success, which is now the goal for currently untreatable AMD manifestations. The existence of an immune-privileged environment in the eye supports the feasibility of localized antibody therapy. Many different antibodies against various targets are being developed for the treatment of AMD, which reflects the etiological complexity of the disease. This review provides an overview of 19 potential therapeutic antibodies targeting angiogenesis, the complement system, inflammation or amyloid beta deposition in the eye. It summarizes the immunoglobulin structure, the specific target and study outcomes for each approach. The latter include beneficial results or adverse effects in AMD models and patients. Finally, this article discusses the challenges in the development of antibody-based drugs to treat degenerative processes in the posterior eye. In spite of these difficulties, to date, the following four antibodies have overcome the technical and preclinical hurdles and are being tested in active clinical studies: Lampalizumab, Sonepcizumab, GSK933776 and LFG316. We conclude that, while there are some antibody-based drugs that have made it into clinical practice, a successful transfer from bench to beside is still pending for many promising approaches."

CD005139,0,20190181,0,From combinatorial peptide selection to drug prototype (I): targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor pathway.,"Inhibition of blood vessel formation is a viable therapeutic approach in angiogenesis-dependent diseases. We previously used a combinatorial screening on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-activated endothelial cells to select the sequence CPQPRPLC and showed that the motif Arg-Pro-Leu targets VEGF receptor-1 and neuropilin-1. Here, we evaluated and validated (D)(LPR), a derivative molecule with strong antiangiogenesis attributes. This prototype drug markedly inhibits neovascularization in three mouse models: Matrigel-based assay, functional human/murine blood vessel formation, and retinopathy of prematurity. In addition to its systemic activity, (D)(LPR) also inhibits retinal angiogenesis when administered in an eye-drop formulation. Finally, in preliminary studies, we have showed targeted drug activity in an experimental tumor-bearing mouse model. These results show that drugs targeting extracellular domains of VEGF receptors are active, affect signal transduction, and have potential for clinical application. On a larger context, this study illustrates the power of ligand-directed selection plus retro-inversion for rapid drug discovery and development."

A 54-year-old man was referred to the authors' department with diagnosis of early onset retinal drusen. Multimodal imaging led to a diagnosis of LCD complicated by GA in the right eye and CNV in the left eye. The patient received a single injection of intravitreal aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY) in the left eye. Six months later, best-corrected visual acuity improved to 20/25, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography still showed absence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid. GA and CNV are possible complications of LCD, and contrary to previous beliefs, it should therefore not be considered as a benign condition.

The effects of AMD on quality of life and visual function have been extensively reported in the literature, however, less is known about the burden imposed on patients by the arduous and often indefinite treatment schedule which habitually follows a diagnosis of wet AMD. To date, no systematic review has been conducted of research investigating patients' experiences of anti-VEGF treatment for AMD. A systematic search of the Embase, Medline, PsycINFO and PubMed electronic databases was undertaken to identify all studies between January 2004 and December 2013, published in the English language and involving human participants. A hand-search of an additional four journals was conducted. Ten articles were identified for inclusion in this review. A critical appraisal was undertaken using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Research Checklist and the results synthesised to form a narrative review. Few studies to date have investigated patients' experiences of treatment for AMD. These studies have focused primarily on patients' experiences of the injection procedure with respect to pain and anxiety. Anticipated discomfort is often greater than actual discomfort experienced during intra-vitreal injection. However, different stages of the treatment procedure produce varying levels of patient discomfort. No one method of anaesthesia has consistently been shown to be more effective in reducing discomfort associated with treatment. Common reasons underlying patient apprehension surrounding treatment include the thought of having an injection, fear of losing eyesight and fear of the unknown. Whilst these studies have not been without their methodological limitations, they provide a platform for further exploration of the patient experience."

CD005139,0,15456709,0,Translating angiogenesis research into the clinic: the challenges ahead.,"The field of angiogenesis research has evolved to become one of the most rapidly growing biomedical disciplines. The interest in basic angiogenesis research is sparked by the translational therapeutic potential aimed at developing anti-angiogenesis as a novel therapeutic modality for tumours and a number of non-oncological diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy and age-dependent macula degeneration. The molecular determinants of the angiogenic cascade have been characterized in great detail over the last few years. Likewise, intense ongoing efforts are aimed at identifying and validating additional vascular specific determinants that may be exploited as therapeutic targets for pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic therapy. At the same time, a large number of angiomodulatory compounds are in various phases of clinical trials. These include the neutralizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody Avastin, which has successfully passed phase III clinical trials for the combination with chemotherapy in colorectal cancers. In view of the dramatic progress in basic angiogenesis research, surprisingly little is known about the nature of the neovasculature in human tumours. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical trials of anti-angiogenic compounds are devoid of angiogenesis-related parameters and reliable biomarkers to trace the efficacy of an anti-angiogenic intervention are largely missing. Based on a brief review of the biology of the angiogenic cascade, this review provides an overview of the current concepts of the angiogenic vasculature in human tumours and discusses some key unanswered questions in translating angiogenesis research into the clinic."

CD005139,0,25807249,0,Attenuation of choroidal neovascularization by histone deacetylase inhibitor.,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a blinding complication of age-related macular degeneration that manifests as the growth of immature choroidal blood vessels through Bruch's membrane, where they can leak fluid or hemorrhage under the retina. Here, we demonstrate that the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) trichostatin A (TSA) can down-regulate the pro-angiogenic hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and up-regulate the anti-angiogenic and neuro-protective pigment epithelium derived factor in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Most strikingly, TSA markedly down-regulates the expression of VEGF receptor-2 in human vascular endothelial cells and, thus, can knock down pro-angiogenic cell signaling. Additionally, TSA suppresses CNV-associated wound healing response and RPE epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation. In the laser-induced model of CNV using C57Bl/6 mice, systemic administration of TSA significantly reduces fluorescein leakage and the size of CNV lesions at post-laser days 7 and 14 as well as the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF, VEGFR2, and smooth muscle actin in CNV lesions at post-laser day 7. This report suggests that TSA, and possibly HDACi's in general, should be further evaluated for their therapeutic potential for the treatment of CNV."

CD005139,0,10818676,0,New paradigms for the treatment of cancer: the role of anti-angiogenesis agents.,"Angiogenesis, the sprouting of new blood vessels, plays a role in diverse disease states including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, and restenosis. With regard to cancer, the clinical association of tumor vascularity with tumor aggressiveness has been clearly demonstrated in numerous tumor types. The observation of increased microvessel density in tumors not only serves as an independent prognostic indicator, but also suggests that anti-angiogenic therapy may be an important component of treatment regimens for cancer patients. The complexity of the angiogenic process, which involves both positive and negative regulators, provides a number of targets for therapy. Many positive regulators, including growth factor receptors, matrix metalloproteinases, and integrins, have been correlated with increased vascularity of tumors and poor prognosis for patient survival. Thus, these serve as ideal targets for anti-angiogenesis therapy. Many inhibitors of these targets are currently undergoing clinical evaluation as potential anti-cancer agents. In this article, we discuss the role of positive regulators in angiogenesis and tumor growth and describe the anti-angiogenic agents under development."

CD005139,0,16724865,0,New pharmacologic approaches to therapy for age-related macular degeneration.,"As a result of a better understanding of molecular mechanisms, a variety of new pharmacologic treatments have recently been developed for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Efficacy and tolerability have been demonstrated for drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key player in the pathogenesis of choroidal neovascularization. Both pegaptanib (anti-VEGF aptamer) and ranibizumab (anti-VEGF antibody fragment), applied at 4- to 6-week intervals into the vitreous, modified the natural course of the disease in phase III clinical studies. Corticosteroids with anti-angiogenic properties also represent a treatment option for wet AMD. Both intravitreal triamcinolone and anecortave acetate, administered juxtasclerally, are currently being pursued. The combination of different treatment strategies and potential synergistic effects offers new perspectives. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) combined with intravitreal triamcinolone is already frequently applied, other combinations (e.g. anti-VEGF drugs with PDT or antifibrotic agents) appear to be attractive alternatives. Pigment epithelium-derived factor represents another potential target, as well as inhibitors of matrix-metallo-proteinases. With the advent of gene therapy, the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is also on the horizon. Prophylactic measures are still limited. The combination of vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and zinc as used in the AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) reduces risk for conversion from early- to late-stage disease in patients with high-risk features, at least to some extent. Lutein and zeaxanthin dietary supplements for improvement of macular pigment density need to be investigated in future longitudinal trials."

CD005139,0,25365937,0,"Sipjeondaebo-tang, a traditional herbal formula, inhibits retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.","Retinal neovascularization is a common pathology in age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is a vasoactive factor and has been implicated in proliferative retinopathies. Oxygen-induced retinopathy in the mouse is the standard experimental model of proliferative retinopathies. Sipjeondaebo-tang (SDT) is the most widely used traditional herbal formula in East Asia, also known as Shi-Quan-Da-Bu-Tang in Chinese and Juzen-taiho-to in Japanese. SDT has been known to exert anti-angiogenic activities in several tumor models, but the role of SDT in proliferative retinopathies remains unclear. Thus, the object of the present study is to examine the mechanism of action and efficacy of SDT on retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR) mice. Neonatal mice at postnatal day 7 (P7) were exposed to 75% concentration of oxygen for 5 days (P7-P12), and then returned to room air from P12 to P17 to induce retinal neovascularization. SDT were administered once per day for 5 consecutive days (P12-P16) by intraperitoneal injection. Retinal neovascularization was measured at P17. We used a protein array to evaluate the expression levels of angiogenic factors. Inhibitory activity of SDT on PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ interaction was evaluated in vitro. Retinal neovascularization in the OIR mice was significantly decreased by SDT. SDT decreased the expression levels of PDGF-BB protein and VEGF mRNA. Moreover, SDT dose-dependently inhibited PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ interaction (IC50 = 388.82 ± 7.31 µg/ml). In conclusion, SDT is a potent inhibitor of retinal neovascularization through inhibiting the pro-angiogenic effect of PDGF-BB."

CD005139,0,23300882,0,Dual inhibition of plasminogen kringle 5 on angiogenesis and chemotaxis suppresses tumor metastasis by targeting HIF-1α pathway.,"We had demonstrated that plasminogen kringle 5 (K5), a potent angiogenic inhibitor, inhibited retinal neovascularization and hepatocellular carcinoma growth by anti-angiogenesis. The current study investigated the effects and the underlying mechanisms of K5 on both tumor growth and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) implanted mouse model. Similarly, K5 could decrease expression of VEGF in LLC cells and grafted tissues and suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth. K5 had no direct effect on proliferation and apoptosis of LLC. However, K5 could significantly inhibit SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis movement of LLC cells and resulted in a great reduction of surface metastatic nodules and micrometastases in the lungs of LLC tumor-bearing mice. K5 also decreased expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) in LLC cells and grafted tissues. Furthermore, K5 down-regulated SDF-1α expression in metastatic lung tissues of LLC-bearing mice. Therefore, K5 may suppress tumor pulmonary metastasis through inhibiting SDF-1α-CXCR4 chemotaxis movement and down-regulation of VEGF. Moreover, the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a crucial transcriptional factor for both VEGF and CXCR4 expression, was evaluated. The siRNA of HIF-1α attenuated expression of VEGF and CXCR4 and inhibited LLC migration. K5 decreased HIF-1α protein level and impaired nuclear HIF-1α accumulation. These results showed for the first time that K5 inhibits LLC growth and metastasis via the dual effects of anti-angiogenesis and suppression of tumor cell motility by targeting the pivotal molecule, HIF-1α."

Patients with nAMD treated with ranibizumab on a pro re nata regimen. Disease activity was analyzed monthly by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and correlated with VSTs.ResultsOverall, 73 eyes of 73 patients were included in the study with a mean follow-up of 717 days (range: 412-1239 days). Overall, the mean CNV-activity-free interval was 76.5 days (range: 0-829 days). The individual range of the length of dry intervals was high. A total of 42% of patients had a range of more than 90 days. Overall, 16% of patients showed persistent activity. And 12% stayed dry after the initial ranibizumab treatment. No significant correlation was found between the CNV-recurrence pattern and VST (P=0.12).ConclusionsCNV activity in nAMD is irregular, which is reflected in the range of the duration of dry intervals and late recurrences.

In this study, we characterized the previously unknown effects of BPI in the eye and the molecular mechanisms involved in its action. BPI mRNA was detected in bovine retina; retinal pigment epithelium; and primary cultures of bovine retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), pericytes (RPC), and endothelial cells (REC); while BPI protein was measured in human vitreous and plasma. BPI, but not control protein thaumatin, activated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT, and increased DNA synthesis in RPE and RPC but not in REC. A human recombinant 21 kDa modified amino-terminal fragment of BPI (rBPI21) reduced H2O2-induced apoptosis in RPE and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in REC when preincubated with VEGF. Intraperitoneal (i.p.)-injected rBPI21 reduced ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization and diabetes-induced retinal permeability. Since BPI has unusual dual properties of promoting RPC and RPE growth while suppressing VEGF-induced REC growth and vascular permeability, the mechanistic understanding of BPI's action may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration."

The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD, -0.91, 95%CI: -1.39 to -0.42, P = 0.0003) demonstrates that combined treatment may reduce required anti-VEGF injection number, probably by means of decreasing central retina thickness (CRT) (WMD = -22.9, 95% CI: -41.20 to -4.59, P = 0.01).

CD005139,0,26307399,0,A paradigm shift in imaging biomarkers in neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has undergone substantial break-throughs in diagnostic as well as therapeutic respect, with optical coherence tomography (OCT) allowing to identify disease morphology in great detail, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy providing unprecedented benefit. However, these two paths have yet not been combined in an optimal way, real-world outcomes are inferior to expectations, and disease management is largely inefficient in the real-world setting. This dilemma can be solved by identification of valid biomarkers relevant for visual function, disease activity and prognosis, which can provide solid guidance for therapeutic management on an individual level as well as on the population base. Qualitative and quantitative morphological features obtained by advanced OCT provide novel insight into exudative and degenerative stages of neovascular AMD. However, conclusions from structure/function correlations evolve differently from previous paradigms. While central retinal thickness was used as biomarker for guiding retreatment management in clinical trials and practice, fluid localization in different compartments offers superior prognostic value: Intraretinal cystoid fluid has a negative impact on visual acuity and is considered as degenerative when persisting through the initial therapeutic interval. Subretinal fluid is associated with superior visual benefit and a lower rate of progression towards geographic atrophy. Detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium was identified as most pathognomonic biomarker, often irresponsive to therapy and responsible for visual decline during a pro-re-nata regimen. Alterations of neurosensory tissue are usually associated with irreversible loss of functional elements and a negative prognosis. Novel OCT technologies offer crucial insight into corresponding changes at the level of the photoreceptor--retinal pigment epithelial--choriocapillary unit, identifying the biological limits of therapeutic interventions. To optimally benefit from high-resolution multi-modal imaging, an integrated analysis of all functional and structural features is required involving reliable automated algorithms and computational data analyses. Using innovative analysis methods, retinal biomarkers can be used to provide efficient personalized therapy for the individual patient, predictive disease- and population-based models for large-scale management and identifying promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

The two leading agents are similar in effectiveness but vary greatly in price-up to $2,000 per injection for ranibizumab compared to $50 for bevacizumab. We examined the diffusion of these drugs in fee-for-service Medicare and Veterans Affairs (VA) systems during 2005-11, in part to assess the impact that differing financial incentives had on prescribing. Physicians treating Medicare patients have a direct financial incentive to prescribe the more expensive agent (ranibizumab), while VA physicians do not. Medicare injections of the more expensive ranibizumab peaked in 2007 at 47 percent. Beginning in 2009 the less expensive bevacizumab became the predominant therapy for Medicare patients, accounting for more than 60 percent of injections. For VA patients, the distribution of injections across the two drugs was relatively equal, particularly from 2009 to 2011.

Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) often leads to rapid loss of sight. Fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) remain the existing gold standards for CNV diagnosis. However, these methods are invasive and time-consuming. Recently, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has been used more frequently as an adjunct to FA/ICGA. In this report, a 38-year-old woman with PIC and idiopathic CNV presented with blurred vision despite 18/20 visual acuity. FA revealed positive staining and possible leakage, but did not provide clear evidence of CNV. OCTA detected abnormal flow in the outer retina, corresponding to type 2 CNV, that decreased following intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Furthermore, OCTA could show remodeling of the choroidal capillaries after the treatment. OCTA may be helpful in the detection, follow-up, and evaluation of therapeutic strategies to treat CNV secondary to PIC. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2016;47:1157-1161.]."

Over a 12-month period, intravitreal pegaptanib (IVP) 0.3 mg was administered at intervals of 6 weeks until the exudation disappeared prospectively. All patients were examined with the following tests: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT), determined at the initial visit, before the first IVP (baseline), and at 12 months. The factors responsible for achieving dry macula with IVP were examined statistically.The rate of persistent cases with intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) and/or PDT was 17.0%. The mean number of IVPs administered was 5.4 (range, 2-9). Logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution BCVA at 12 months was stable or improved by ≥ 0.3 in 49 eyes (98.0%), with a significant improvement noted between the baseline and final BCVA (P=0.01, paired t test). The CRT (mean ± standard deviation) was 446.9 ± 150.6 µm at the initial visit, 414.5 ± 146.5 µm at baseline, and 318.7 ± 99.0 µm at 12 months. There was a significant decrease in the mean CRT between the measurements at baseline and at 12 months after the first IVP (P=0.002, Bonferroni correction). At 12 months, the exudative change was completely resolved in 27 eyes (54.0%) and reduced in 21 eyes (42.0%). The number of previous IVR treatments was significantly correlated with dry macula at 12 months.After switching therapy to pegaptanib in persistent cases of AMD, most patients maintained or improved their BCVA and exhibited a positive treatment response at 12 months."

CD005139,0,22517122,0,Diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of visual loss. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is an ocular manifestation of the disease causing visual deterioration. The prevalence of visual impairment due to DME is estimated to be 5.4% in Europe. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in diabetic eyes and plays a key role in the development of DME. VEGF levels were proven to be elevated in the vitreous and retina in patients with diabetic retinopathy. VEGF causes a breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier by influencing the tight junctions of retinal endothelial cells and leading to accumulation of fluid in the macula. Therefore, intravitreal VEGF inhibitors are ideal candidates to treat DME by counteracting VEGF overexpression. This review summarizes the results of the most recent prospective, controlled studies on DME with promising novel VEGF inhibitors. It focuses on the efficacy and safety aspects of anti-VEGF treatment of DME."

CD005139,0,11193943,0,[Treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration].,"I PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT: We followed 75 eyes contralateral to eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), using indocyanine green angiography (IA), for more than one year. Hyperfluorescent areas in the late phase of IA were seen in 19 eyes at the initial examination, and in 25 eyes during follow-up. Exudative AMD developed in 9 of the 25 eyes. Using timetable analysis, we estimated that 11% of these 27 eyes developed AMD within one year and 55% within three years. The hyperfluorescent areas seen on IA appeared to be latent choroidal neovascularization (CNV) under the retinal pigment epithelium. We propose that photocoagulation aimed at hyperfluorescent areas should be considered in such cases. We performed prophylactic laser photocoagulation in 21 eyes, which were then followed up for at least six months. These eyes all had 10 or more serous drusen within 1,500 microns of the fovea and did not show hyperfluorescence, suggesting latent CNV in the late phase of IA. The majority or a small fraction of the serous drusen disappeared in 48% and 18% of the 21 eyes, respectively. CNV appeared adjacent to the laser scar in one eye (5%). Judging from these results, it is important to establish a method of definitively abolishing drusen and preventing the development of CNV. II TREATMENT OF CNV: Of 229 eyes which showed occult CNV in fluorescein angiography (FA), 124 eyes (54%) showed classic CNV outside the fovea on IA. One hundred and two of the 124 eyes (45%) underwent laser photocoagulation. We evaluated indocyanine green guided laser photocoagulation of extrafoveal CNV in 139 eyes. The success rate was 81% at 3 months after laser photocoagulation. This was estimated using timetable analyses to have decreased to 78% at one year and 71% at three years. Eighty percent of successfully treated eyes showed maintained or improved visual acuity. These results did not differ significantly from those obtained with laser photocoagulation based on FA findings. When classic CNV is not detected on FA, IA is indicated and if classic CNV is detected outside the fovea, photocoagulation should be performed aggressively. We compared the histological findings of removed subfoveal CNV with the IA findings prior to removal. IA findings of CNV before removal were divided into four types. Types I and II showed numerous vascular lumina in von Willebrand factor staining. Prominent proliferation in types I and II was demonstrated with Ki-67. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) showed strong staining in types I, II and III. Therefore, CNV in eyes with types I, II and III, and especially type I, requires urgent treatment. We compared visual outcomes one year after treatment between 52 eyes that underwent removal and 56 eyes that underwent laser photocoagulation of subfoveal CNV. When CNV size was one disc diameter or less, mean visual acuity, the percentage of eyes with improved vision and with a visual acuity of 0.1 or more, was significantly greater in operated eyes than in coagulated eyes. Removal is therefore superior to photocoagulation in subfoveal CNV of one disc diameter or less in size. We evaluated preoperative factors influencing the best corrected visual acuity at least six months after removal of subfoveal CNV in 67 eyes. Factors influencing the best corrected visual acuity were IA findings, feeder vessel ingrowth sites and CNV sizes. Good indications for removal included types I, II and III IA findings, extra foveal location feeder vessel ingrowth sites, and small CNV. III LOW VISION CARE: We performed reading tests using the MN read J chart for 90 eyes with the scar stage of CNV. Reading speed profiles of the 90 eyes were classified into two groups: 48 eyes showing a plateau with a relatively constant reading rate at the maximum level; and 42 eyes showing steadily increasing reading rate without a plateau. Eyes without a plateau had worse visual acuity, worse reading acuity, and slower reading speed. We evaluated newspaper reading performance by comparing conventional versus new methods based on the critical print size of the MN read J chart. Magnification power based on the critical print size were similar to those finally chosen as the best aid by the patients. On the other hand, magnification power was lower when conventional methods were used. The critical print size of the MN Read J chart appears to be valuable for determining low vision aids which facilitate reading by AMD patients."

We have shown that pure honokiol inhibits the HIF pathway and hypoxia-mediated expression of pro-angiogenic genes in a number of cancer and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell lines. The crude extracts, containing honokiol, from Magnolia plants have been used for thousands of years in the traditional oriental medicine for a number of health benefits. We have recently demonstrated that daily intraperitoneal injection of honokiol starting at postnatal day (P) 12 in an oxygen induced retinopathy mouse model significantly reduced retinal neovascularization at P17. Here, we evaluate the mechanism of HIF inhibition by honokiol in RPE cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate that honokiol inhibits binding of HIF to hypoxia-response elements present on VEGF promoter. We further show using a number of in vitro angiogenesis assays that, in addition to anti-HIF effect, honokiol manifests potent anti-angiogenic effect on human retinal micro vascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that honokiol possesses potent anti-HIF and anti-angiogenic properties. These properties of honokiol make it an ideal therapeutic agent for the treatment of ocular neovascular diseases and solid tumors."
CD005139,0,26927930,0,Axitinib inhibits retinal and choroidal neovascularization in in vitro and in vivo models.,"Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in the elderly in developed countries. Neovascular/exudative (wet) AMD is the aggressive form of AMD and can involve choroidal neovascularization and vascular leakage. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications have significantly improved treatment of wet-AMD. However, only approximately 40% of patients obtain full benefit from anti-VEGF therapy and the medications are given by intravitreal injection. Axitinib, a small molecule multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, is taken orally and inhibits VEGF activity by blocking VEGF receptors. Axitinib also has the advantage of blocking platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors which play a role in neovascularization. Using in vitro human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs), human brain vascular pericytes (HBVRs), 3D co-culture vessel sprout assay, and in vivo laser induced rat choroidal neovascularization (CNV) models, the effect of axitinib on neovascularization was evaluated. Axitinib inhibited neovascularization better than anti-VEGF and/or anti-hPDGF-B mAb in the in vitro models demonstrating that combined inhibition of both VEGF and PDGF pathways may be synergistic in treating wet-AMD. Additionally, axitinib showed good efficacy at a low dose (0.875 mg/day) in laser-induced CNV model in rats. In conclusion our data shows that axitinib, an inhibitor of VEGF and PDGF-B pathways may be useful in ameliorating wet-AMD therapy."

In vitro studies on HUVEC showed that GNX-686 inhibited cell growth with an ED(50) of 20-25 μM, while human HeLa tumor cells and non-transformed embryonic mouse fibroblasts were less sensitive for the drug. More importantly, at 4 μM, a concentration that was non-toxic to any cell in culture, GNX-686 showed a significant inhibitory effect on tube formation by HUVEC, indicating a profound anti-angiogenic activity. Angiogenesis inhibition was subsequenly tested in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo. A significant angiostatic activity was observed in the CAM model, and results were compared with the effect of bevacizumab, a well known and clinically used VEGF inhibitor. Under our experimental conditions, GNX-686 was found to be as effective as bevacizumab, significantly changing the morphology of the vascular network, as illustrated and quantified by the relative number of branching points and the relative mean mesh size of the vascular network. In another in vivo model of neovascularization, the mouse retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the vascular network of GNX-686-treated mice was significantly altered, reducing the density of the retinal microvasculature, as compared to the control retinas. Immunohistochemical processing of the GNX-686 treated (4μM) eyes showed over 50% reduction of the number of cell nuclei associated with neovasculature, as compared to the control-treated eye. Taken together these results demonstrate that GNX-686 is a promising anti-angiogenic compound that could be developed for the treatment of diseases characterized by aberrant angiogenesis such as ocular pathologies and cancer."

Despite the use of anti-VEGFA therapies, this complication continues to cause blindness, suggesting a role for additional molecules in retinal neovascularization. Besides VEGFA and VEGFB, hypoxia induced VEGFC expression robustly. Based on this finding, we tested the role of VEGFC in pathological retinal angiogenesis. VEGFC induced proliferation, migration, sprouting and tube formation of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs) and these responses require CREB-mediated DLL4 expression and NOTCH1 activation. Furthermore, down regulation of VEGFC levels substantially reduced tip cell formation and retinal neovascularization in vivo. In addition, we observed that CREB via modulating the DLL4-NOTCH1 signaling mediates VEGFC-induced tip cell formation and retinal neovascularization. In regard to upstream mechanism, we found that down regulation of p38β levels inhibited hypoxia-induced CREB-DLL4-NOTCH1 activation, tip cell formation, sprouting and retinal neovascularization. Based on these findings, it may be suggested that VEGFC besides its role in the regulation of lymphangiogenesis also plays a role in pathological retinal angiogenesis and this effect depends on p38β and CREB-mediated activation of DLL4-NOTCH1 signaling."

Drugs are difficult to deliver to the lesions in the back of the eye and this is a major obstacle for the therapeutics. Current pharmacological approach involves an intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents to prevent aberrant growth of blood vessels, but it has limitations including therapeutic efficacy and side-effects associated with systemic exposure and invasive surgery. Nanotechnology provides novel opportunities to overcome the limitations of conventional delivery system to reach the back of the eye through fabrication of nanostructures capable of encapsulating and delivering small molecules. This review article introduces various forms of nanocarrier that can be adopted by ocular drug delivery systems to improve current therapy.

Thirty-five eyes of 35 patients were treated with a single injection of IVD because of refractory DMO with CFT over 300 μm, and persistent intraretinal and subretinal fluid despite of multiple intravitreal bevacizumab injections. Patients were followed-up for 6 months for the evaluation of CFT and subfoveal CT by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.ResultsAll eyes (mean age: 59.4±12.35 years; 18 males, 17 females) had been previously treated with multiple bevacizumab injections and showed persistent DMO (mean number of injections 4.08±2.98) The preoperative logMAR BCVA was 0.49±0.24, which gradually improved to 0.46±0.32 at 6 months (P=0.652) and 26% gained two or more lines of Snellen visual acuity. At baseline, the mean CFT was 526.29±123.48 μm, which significantly improved to 316.15±100.09 μm at 3 months (P<0.001). However, CFT deteriorated to 457.07±136.53 μm at 6 months (P=0.051). Similarly, the mean preoperative subfoveal CT was 288.91±36.47 μm and it decreased to 266.85±30.93 μm at 3 months (P<0.01), but increased to 278.63±32.55 μm at 6 months (P=0.137). The reduction of CFT from baseline showed significant correlation with that of subfoveal CT at 3 months (P=0.041) and at 6 months (P=0.008).ConclusionsIn DMO refractory to multiple bevacizumab injections, IVD significantly reduced CFT and subfoveal CT, with BCVA improvement in one-fourth of the patients.

CD005139,0,18537702,0,Eye disorders in diabetes: potential drug targets.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a serious medical problem that causes long-term systemic complications and considerable associated morbidity. DM can cause retinopathy (DRP), maculopathy, cataract, optic neuropathy, defects of eye muscles. DM is a risk factor for acute infectious conjunctivitis, bacterial keratitis, herpes virus infections and endophtalmitis. Elevated blood glucose induces structural, physiological and hormonal changes which affect retinal capillaries. DRP is recognized by loss of pericyte function and capillary occlusions together leading to breakdown of blood-retinal barrier, edematous changes and proliferation of vessels and fibrous tissue. Depending on stage of DRP, there are different preferable therapeutic approaches applied. In the case of ETDRS, in the area of leakage focal treatment should be performed, while panretinal photocoagulation is applied towards ischemic areas or beginning proliferations. Vitreal haemorrhage followed by fibroproliferative changes or tractional retinal detachment is treated by vitrectomy alone or in combination with ILM peeling. In pathogenesis of DRP, Insulin Growth Factor (IGF-1) can play an important role in production of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor). Hypoxia can up-regulate VEGF expression levels leading to pathologic ocular neovascularisation. An application of intravitreal corticosteroid treatment modulates vascular permeability by suppressing the production of VEGF, reducing both extracellular matrix metalloproteinase activity and basic fibroblast growth factor, decreasing major histocompatibility complex 2 Ag expression levels, and inhibiting activity of inflammatory cells. Clinical effects of treatment using intravitreal corticosteroids are evaluated by reduction of macular thickness and visual improvement. Intravitreal use of Anti-VEGF drugs, Pegaptanib, Ranibizumab and Bevacizumab can modify vasoproliferation, trigger macular edema, and, therefore, influence a prognosis for visual loss."

We performed a meta-analysis using databases including PubMed and EMBASE to find relevant studies. 13 published association studies were selected for this meta-analysis, including 2704 patients. For the CFH Y402H polymorphism, anti-VEGF treatment was much less effective in AMD patients with the CFH CC genotype (CC versus TT: odds ratio (OR) = 55, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31 to 0.95, P = 0.03; CC versus CT: OR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.91, P = 0.02; and CC versus CT + TT: OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.90, P = 0.02, respectively).

CD005139,0,21988318,0,Antiangiogenic effects of β2 -adrenergic receptor blockade in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.,"Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is a model for human retinopathy of prematurity. In mice with OIR, beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockade with propranolol has been shown to ameliorate different aspects of retinal dysfunction in response to hypoxia. In the present study, we used the OIR model to investigate the role of distinct β-ARs on retinal proangiogenic factors, pathogenic neovascularization and electroretinographic responses. Our results demonstrate that β(2) -AR blockade with ICI 118,551 decreases retinal levels of proangiogenic factors and reduces pathogenic neovascularization, whereas β(1) - and β(3) -AR antagonists do not. Determination of retinal protein kinase A activity is indicative of the fact that β-AR blockers are indeed effective at the receptor level. In addition, the specificity of ICI 118,551 on retinal angiogenesis has been demonstrated by the finding that in mouse retinal explants, β(2) -AR silencing prevents ICI 118,551 effects on hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor accumulation. In OIR mice, ICI 118,551 is effective in increasing electroretinographic responses suggesting that activation of β(2) -ARs constitutes an important part of the retinal response to hypoxia. Lastly, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that β(2) -ARs are localized to several retinal cells, particularly to Müller cells suggesting the possibility that β(2) -ARs play a role in regulating vascular endothelial growth factor production by these cells. The present results suggest that pathogenic angiogenesis, a key change in many hypoxic/ischemic vision-threatening retinal diseases, depends at least in part on β(2) -AR activity and indicate that β(2) -AR blockade can be effective against retinal angiogenesis."

Vitreous fluid levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) were determined. Visual acuity and central macular thickness were significantly improved at 6 months in both groups. Vitreous fluid levels of VEGF and sICAM-1 were higher in the major BRVO group than the macular BRVO group, while the PEDF level was lower in the major group than the macular group. The mean visual acuity and central macular thickness at 6 months were not significantly different between the macular and major groups. In conclusion, patients with major BRVO had higher vitreous levels of inflammatory factors and lower vitreous levels of anti-inflammatory PEDF.

In total, 26 eyes in 26 patients were treated with three intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (Avastin™) given at 4-week intervals. Study parameters included: visual acuity (VA), perceived visual improvement, central macular thickness as measured by Spectralis OCT, macular sensitivity and fixation pattern as measured by MP-1 microperimetry, and the incidence of ocular and systemic side-effects. At the time of follow-up, 76.9 % of eyes showed a significant improvement in VA (p = 0.012), 38.4 % showed a one-line improvement on the ETDRS chart compared with VA at day 0, 30.7 % showed a two-line improvement, and 7.6 % showed at least a three-line improvement. The mean central macular thickness was 447 microns at day 0 and 311.1 microns at follow-up (p = 0.003). The mean baseline macular sensitivity, by MP-1 microperimetry, was 8.29 dB; at follow -up, macular sensitivity had improved to 14.26 dB (p = 0.025).

A. number of landmark clinical trials have provided strong evidence of the safety and efficacy of agents such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factors for the treatment of DME. Decades of clinical research, ranging from the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study to the present-day randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing novel agents, have shifted the goal of therapy from preventing vision loss to ensuring a maximum visual gain. Systematic study designs have provided robust data with an attempt to optimize the treatment regimens including the choice of the agent and timing of therapy. However, due to a number of challenges in the management of DME with approved agents, further studies are needed. For the purpose of this review, an extensive database search in English language was performed to identify prospective, RCTs testing pharmacological agents for DME.

Several different therapies are currently under consideration for the aforementioned disorders. In the following section, agents targeting platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) are discussed as a potential therapeutic option for retinochoroidal vascular diseases. PDGF play an important role in the angiogenesis cascade that is activated in retinochoroidal vascular diseases. The mechanism of action, side effects, efficacy, and the potential synergistic role of these agents in combination with other treatment options is discussed. The future of treatment of retinochoroidal vascular diseases, particularly neovascular AMD, has become more exciting due to agents like PDGF antagonists."

The objective of the current study was to analyze the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with exudative age related macular degeneration. A total of 73 patients with exudative age related macular degeneration (without previous anti-VEGF therapy) were treated with two anti-VEGF: Ranibizumab and Pegaptanib sodium. The follow up was 6 months. The following parameters were determined before and after treatment: homocysteine, lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-c, LDL-c), C-Reactive Protein and fibrinogen. There were not statistically significant differences in parameters studied before and after treatment with both Pegaptanib sodium and Ranibizumab, except C-Reactive Protein. Of all patients analyzed, only 3 of them have initially C-Reactive Protein levels above normal levels and after antiangiogenic therapy, there was a significant increase in C-Reactive Protein. We have not found results in our study who to suspect that treatment with anti-VEGF in the patients with exudative age related macular degeneration increases cardiovascular risk predictors.

CD005139,0,19668384,0,Treatment of age-related macular degeneration: focus on ranibizumab.,"Ranibizumab, a humanized antigen-binding fragment (Fab) that binds all isoforms of VEGF-A, significantly slows down loss of vision and causes significant visual improvement in many patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These benefits of intravitreal ranibizumab apply to all angiographic subtypes of neovascular AMD and across all lesion sizes when the drug is injected at monthly intervals as shown in two pivotal phase III trials (ANCHOR and MARINA). The results from the PrONTO study suggest that less frequent treatment with ranibizumab through a variable dosing regimen dependent on optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings is a treatment option that results in comparably favorable visual outcomes. Currently, it is unclear whether combination therapy of ranibizumab with photodynamic therapy (PDT) provides any significant advantage over ranibizumab monotherapy (FOCUS trial); however, the combination of PDT and ranibizumab may decrease the need for frequent retreatment. This question will be addressed in the SUMMIT trial. Therapy with ranibizumab is generally very well tolerated with a low rate of seriously adverse ocular events or systemic side-effects. The advent of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors has revolutionized the therapy of neovascular AMD. Ranibizumab at the moment appears to be the most effective approved treatment for neovascular AMD."

Several pharmaceutical treatments that use anti-angiogenic agents have been tried to inhibit the activity of CNV experimentally and clinically. In general, however, systemically administered drugs may reach not only targeted tissues but also other tissues, resulting in unwanted side effects. Also, to maintain therapeutic levels of the drugs in targeted tissues, frequent administration for an extended period of time is required. To solve these problems, drug delivery systems targeted to the CNV are being developed. Anatomic characteristics of CNV tissues resemble those of tumor vasculature, exhibiting enhanced permeability and retention effect. Drug targeting to CNV may be feasible in the same manner as it is to tumors. In this review, we describe two approaches of drug targeting to CNV: passive targeting and active targeting."
CD005139,0,24979237,0,Estimated cases of blindness and visual impairment from neovascular age-related macular degeneration avoided in Australia by ranibizumab treatment.,"Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, such as ranibizumab, have significantly improved the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. This study used patient-level simulation modelling to estimate the number of individuals in Australia who would have been likely to avoid legal blindness or visual impairment due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration over a 2-year period as a result of intravitreal ranibizumab injections. The modelling approach used existing data for the incidence of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in Australia and outcomes from ranibizumab trials. Blindness and visual impairment were defined as visual acuity in the better-seeing eye of worse than 6/60 or 6/12, respectively. In 2010, 14,634 individuals in Australia were estimated to develop neovascular age-related macular degeneration who would be eligible for ranibizumab therapy. Without treatment, 2246 individuals would become legally blind over 2 years. Monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab would reduce incident blindness by 72% (95% simulation interval, 70-74%). Ranibizumab given as needed would reduce incident blindness by 68% (64-71%). Without treatment, 4846 individuals would become visually impaired over 2 years; this proportion would be reduced by 37% (34-39%) with monthly intravitreal ranibizumab, and by 28% (23-33%) with ranibizumab given as needed. These data suggest that intravitreal injections of ranibizumab, given either monthly or as needed, can substantially lower the number of cases of blindness and visual impairment over 2 years after the diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration."

CD005139,0,16524319,0,A preliminary benefit-risk assessment of verteporfin in age-related macular degeneration.,"The prevalence of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is expected to increase significantly during the next 20 years. New treatment alternatives to laser photocoagulation are on the horizon - the first of these, photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin, was approved by the US FDA in 2000. In this article we present a preliminary risk-benefit assessment of verteporfin in AMD, focusing on the landmark randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The TAP (Treatment of Age-related macular degeneration with Photodynamic therapy) trial established the efficacy of PDT for classic subfoveal neovascularisation in AMD at 2 years follow-up. The VIP (Verteporfin in Photodynamic therapy) study concentrated on subfoveal occult-only lesions not included in the TAP study. After 2 years, treated eyes were less likely to experience visual loss. Exploratory analyses of TAP and VIP suggest that lesion size is a more significant predictor of the treatment benefit than either lesion composition or visual activity. The VIM (Visudyne in Minimally classic) trial altered the standard PDT light fluence rate in the treatment of subfoveal minimally classic lesions. This trial again demonstrated a beneficial effect for those receiving treatment with PDT. The VIO (Visudyne in Occult) trial, evaluating PDT in occult-only lesions as a confirmatory study of the VIP trial, did not achieve its primary end-point at 2 years. Further analyses are pending.PDT with verteporfin has an excellent safety profile that has been established with >1 million treatment applications. Cost-effectiveness data are limited but suggest that PDT may be a cost-effective treatment modality. Other FDA-approved treatments (pegaptanib, ranibizumab and bevacizumab) for neovascular AMD are discussed, as well as investigational substances such as anecortave acetate."

CD005139,0,21312012,0,Solution formulation development of a VEGF inhibitor for intravitreal injection.,"PF-00337210 is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of VEGFRs and has been under consideration for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. An ophthalmic solution formulation intended for intravitreal injection was developed. This formulation was designed to maximize drug properties such that the formulation would precipitate upon injection into the vitreous for sustained delivery. As a parenteral formulation with additional constraints dictated by this specialized delivery route, multiple features were balanced in order to develop a successful formulation. Some of these considerations included low dosing volumes (≤0.1 mL), a limited repertoire of safe excipients for intravitreal injection, and the unique physical chemical properties of the drug. The aqueous solubility as a function of pH was characterized, buffer stressing studies to select the minimal amount of buffer were conducted, and both chemical and physical stability studies were executed. The selected formulation consisted of an isotonic solution comprised of PF-00337210 free base in a citrate-buffered vehicle containing NaCl for tonicity. The highest strength for regulatory toxicology studies was 60 mg/mL. The selected formulation exhibited sufficient chemical stability upon storage with no precipitation, and acceptable potency and recovery through an intravitreal dosing syringe. Formulation performance was simulated by precipitation experiments using extracted vitreous humor. In simulated injection experiments, PF-00337210 solutions reproducibly precipitated upon introduction to the vitreous so that a depot was formed. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a nonpolymeric in situ-forming depot formulation has been developed for intravitreal delivery, with the active ingredient as the precipitating agent."
CD005139,0,20021287,0,Anti-VEGF agents for age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of legal blindness in the elderly in the industrialized world and the third major cause of blindness around the globe. Although neovascular AMD is less prevalent than atrophic AMD, it accounts for most cases with severe visual loss from AMD. VEGF seems to be a key contributary factor in the pathophysiology underlying neovascular AMD. Until recently, treatment options for neovascular AMD were limited. With the recent development of anti-VEGF therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in studies with broad eligibility criteria, the repertoire of treatments for neovascular AMD has been significantly expanded to now include the various recognized angiographic lesion subtypes. To discuss recent anti-VEGF agents in the management of AMD. Although therapy with anti-VEGF agents is the gold standard with promising results, many intravitreal injections are often required, and they do not cure all cases of wet AMD. With the recent advances in the medical therapy of exudative AMD, there is reason to be optimistic about future management of AMD as well."

CD005139,0,15133229,0,Cancer anti-angiogenic therapy.,"Tumor angiogenesis affords new targets for cancer therapy, since inhibition of angiogenesis suppresses tumor growth by cutting out the supply of oxygen and nutrients. Anti-angiogenic therapy is thought to be free of the severe side effects that are usually seen with cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Furthermore, anti-angiogenic therapy is thought not only to eradicate primary tumor tissues, but also to suppress tumor metastases. However, it is uncertain whether this therapy causes tumor regression because it inhibits only angiogenic events. Recently, a novel anti-angiogenic therapy called anti-neovascular therapy (ANET) has become notable. This therapy inflicts indirect lethal damage on tumor cells by damaging newly formed blood vessels using anti-cancer drugs targeting the angiogenic vasculature, since cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs cause damage to proliferating neovascular endothelial cells as well as tumor cells. Moreover, neovascular endothelial cells would not be expected to acquire drug-resistance. Traditional chemotherapy, which directly targets tumor cells, has potential problems such as low specificity and severe side effects. On the contrary, in ANET, severe side effects may be suppressed, since traditional anti-cancer agents are delivered to the neovessels by DDS technology. Besides the usage of DDS technology, anti-neovascular scheduling of chemotherapy, or metronomic-dosing chemotherapy, has also been attempted in which anti-cancer drugs are administered on a schedule to damage neovessels. In this review, we describe traditional anti-angiogenic therapy and ANET. We also discuss anti-angiogenic cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT), since PDT is clinically applied to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which uncontrolled angiogenesis occurs."

CD005139,0,20703030,0,Antivascular endothelial growth factors in age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in adults aged over 50 years in developed countries. Until recently, argon laser photocoagulation and photo-dynamic therapy (PDT) were the only treatments available for the neovascular form of AMD. The introduction of new intravitreally injectable inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) revolutionized the management of the wet form. Pegaptanib was the first anti-VEGF agent to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in neovascular AMD. The VISION study showed that patients receiving pegaptanib lost vision in a smaller rate than those treated with conventional care. Bevacizumab is a full-length recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody which binds to all isoforms of VEGF-A. It is licensed for the intravenous administration for the treatment of malignant solid tumors and is available for off-label use in the treatment of AMD-related CNV. Numerous retrospective studies have shown beneficial effects of bevacizumab in patients with neovascular AMD. Ranibizumab is a recombinant, humanized antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) that binds to all known active forms of VEGF-A. The US FDA approved ranibizumab for treatment of all subtypes of choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD. VEGF trap is a pharmacologically engineered protein that binds VEGF with higher affinity than pegaptanib or ranibizumab and thus prevents VEGF binding to its cellular receptor offering a theoretically longer interval between necessary treatments. A number of studies have shown that OCT imaging allows identification of functionally relevant factors like subretinal fluid or retinal thickness, which are important for the establishment of optimized individual dosing regimen during anti-angiogenesis therapies."

More recently, focus has been directed to the molecular basis of the disease process in diabetic retinopathy. Of particular importance in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy is the role of growth factors (eg vascular endothelial growth factor, placenta growth factor and pigment epithelium-derived factor) together with specific receptors and obligate components of the signal transduction pathway needed to support them. Despite these advances there are still a number of important questions that remain to be answered before we can confidently target pathological signals. How does hyperglycaemia regulate retinal vessels? Which growth factors are most important and at what stage of retinopathy do they operate?

In diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, uncontrolled angiogenesis can lead to blindness. Our goal is to better understand the molecular processes controlling retinal angiogenesis and discover novel drugs that inhibit retinal neovascularization. Phenotype-based chemical screens were performed using the ChemBridge Diverset(TM)library and inhibition of hyaloid vessel angiogenesis in Tg(fli1:EGFP) zebrafish. 2-[(E)-2-(Quinolin-2-yl)vinyl]phenol, (quininib) robustly inhibits developmental angiogenesis at 4-10 μmin zebrafish and significantly inhibits angiogenic tubule formation in HMEC-1 cells, angiogenic sprouting in aortic ring explants, and retinal revascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy mice. Quininib is well tolerated in zebrafish, human cell lines, and murine eyes. Profiling screens of 153 angiogenic and inflammatory targets revealed that quininib does not directly target VEGF receptors but antagonizes cysteinyl leukotriene receptors 1 and 2 (CysLT1-2) at micromolar IC50values. In summary, quininib is a novel anti-angiogenic small-molecule CysLT receptor antagonist. Quininib inhibits angiogenesis in a range of cell and tissue systems, revealing novel physiological roles for CysLT signaling. Quininib has potential as a novel therapeutic agent to treat ocular neovascular pathologies and may complement current anti-VEGF biological agents."

Before the introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs, photodynamic therapy (PDT) was used, with conflicting functional results. We report a case of a 69-year-old male patient who came to our attention for macular edema in hemiretinal vein occlusion. Fluorescein angiogram showed presence of venous collaterals, but the pattern of the edema was atypical; optical coherence tomography (OCT) and indocyanine green angiography (ICG) were used to confirm the diagnosis of CNV. A chorio-retinal shunt was demonstrated. The autofluorescence technique was used to predict the risk of CNV in the fellow eye. PDT was performed twice, but after the second cycle, patient developed choroidal ischemia and the visual outcomes were poor. The temporal course of CNV, the presence of a chorio-retinal shunt, and the autofluorescence pattern in the fellow eye let us to speculate that the CNV was related to the vascular occlusive process. We can speculate that the overexpression of VEGF induced by local ischemia and inflammation can make these patients more likely to have CNV. However, to our knowledge, there are no accurate estimates of the incidence of CNV in other retinal vascular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy."

We asked whether a small molecule, carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effects and its ability to be administered orally in humans, could have anti-angiogenic effects in ocular in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis models. The anti-proliferative effects of CAI were examined by BrdU incorporation using human retinal and dermal endothelial cells and human pigment epithelial cells. The effect of CAI was determined using the Matrigel tube formation assay. The mouse model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) initiated by laser rupture of Bruch's membrane was used to quantify in vivo effects of aqueous beta-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin (bHPCD) formulations of CAI on neovascularization. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of CAI after intravitreal administration of bHPCD-CAI was studied in rabbit. The intravitreal toxicology of bHPCD-CAI was also examined in rat ocular tissue. We observed that CAI treatment of human endothelial cells decreased cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In the in vivo tests bHPCD-CAI treatment reduced choroidal neovascular lesion volume, also in a dose-dependent manner. The intravitreal PK of bHPCD-CAI demonstrated that highly efficacious concentrations of CAI are reached in the vitreous compartment. No ocular toxicology was observed with intravitreous injection of CAI. These studies support the potential of developing intravitreal CAI in an bHPCD ocular formulation for treatment of proliferative retinopathies in humans."

Review of the literature and personal experience.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a well-established treatment for vascular forms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The implementation of evidence-based medicine principles into the treatment regimen of AMD seems to be immensly important, since AMD continues to be the most frequent cause of blindness among patients older than 65 years in industrialized countries. Numerous randomized prospective studies demonstrated high levels of evidence for the efficacy of various treatment approaches such as laser photocoagulation, PDT, subretinal surgery or novel anti-angiogenic drugs [Arch Ophthalmol 2006;124:597-599]. The high evidence shown by these studies supported the rationale to use PDT also in additional, less frequent, vasoproliferative diseases. Although these 'case series' and 'individual case control studies' have a low level of evidence, they give us important information for treatment decisions in these rare conditions. The goal of this survey is to review the current literature regarding PDT in vasoproliferative and exudative ocular diseases outside AMD. Many studies modified the treatment parameters of PDT to address the specific pathology of the underlying disease. Table 1 summarizes the diseases and treatment parameters that are described in this part 2, the entire table of this review is included in part 1 (www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/ 000101922)."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the major angiogenesis factors, and induces endothelial cell proliferation and migration. VEGF stimulates NADPH oxidase to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS induce the transcription factors and genes involved in angiogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that GPU-4, 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedione derivative, demonstrates anti-angiogenic activity regarding human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity. GPU-4 inhibited the VEGF-induced radicals, proliferation, and migration in HRMECs without a PPARγ-mediated effect. Furthermore, systemic administration of GPU-4 inhibited the development of retinal neovascularization in a murine oxygen-induced retinopathy model but did not exert revascularization of the capillary-free area, which shows normal physiological revascularization. These findings indicate that GPU-4 suppressed in vitro and in vivo retinal neovascularization partly by a radical scavenging effect, suggesting that GPU-4 might be a potential therapeutic agent candidate for proliferative diseases of the retinal vasculature."

Thirty-four eyes of 22 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and DME refractory to laser photocoagulation therapy received an intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg/0.05 ml of bevazicumab. Changes in mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), regression of neovascularization over time, and correlation between BCVA and CMT were evaluated. Follow-up visits were at weeks 1, 2 and 4 and months 3 and 6. Mean BCVA was significantly better than baseline only at week 2 (P = 0.036). Mean CMT decreased significantly from baseline at weeks 1, 2, and 4 (P = 0.001). At months 3 and 6, mean CMT increased, albeit insignificantly (P = 0.804 and P = 1.0). The decrease in fluorescein leakage was moderate in all eyes at the end of week 1. At week 2, there was total resolution of fluorescein leakage in 24 (70.5%) eyes and moderate resolution in 10 (29.5%) eyes. At the end of month 3, the fluorescein leakage was fully resolved in 5 (14.7%) eyes, moderately resolved in 24 (70.5%) eyes, and was similar to baseline in 5 (14.7%) eyes.

CD005139,0,25533679,0,Intracellular pathways following uptake of bevacizumab in RPE cells.,"The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab is widely used off-label for the treatment of various ocular diseases, most commonly in age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Bevacizumab is able to penetrate the retina and is found in the choroid after intravitreal injection in a time dependent manner. It has previously been shown to be taken up by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In this study, we have investigated the intracellular pathway following uptake of bevacizumab in RPE cells, tested both in primary porcine RPE cells and in the human cell line ARPE19. Bevacizumab displays a characteristic, time-dependent pattern of intracellular distribution, as detected by immunofluorescence and pulse chase experiments. In both primary cells and the cell line, intracellular bevacizumab can be found after seven days, as detected by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Immediately after application, bevacizumab partially colocalizes with Rab5, indicating some uptake in early endosomes. Intracellularly, bevacizumab is detected in the cytoskeletal fraction, aligning with actin filaments, as revealed by subcellular fractioning and immunofluorescence. Bevacizumab seems to travel along actin filaments by myosin7a, as determined by triple staining immunofluorescence. Interestingly, over a period of seven days, bevacizumab seems to accumulate in certain storage areas, as observed by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, results obtained with immunocytochemistry, Western blotting and flow cytometry indicate that bevacizumab may be released from the RPE cells via exosomes. In conclusion, bevacizumab is taken up by and transported in the retinal pigment epithelial cells in a characteristic, time-dependent manner, where it seems to move along actin filaments by myosin7a and seem to be partially released from the cells via exosomes."

CD005139,0,16951216,0,Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathways: therapeutic perspective.,"The establishment of a vascular supply is one of the earliest and most important events occurring during embryonic development. Growth and maturation of a functional vascular network are complex and still incompletely understood processes involving orchestrated activation of vascular progenitors in the early stages of embryonic development followed by vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. These processes require a tightly regulated activation of several growth factors and their receptors. The role of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and their receptors has been studied extensively due to their prominent role during blood vessel formation. Mice deficient in various VEGF ligands or receptors show serious defects in vascular formation and maturation. Moreover, members of the VEGF family are involved in other significant biological processes, including lymphangiogenesis, vascular permeability, and hematopoiesis. Importantly, VEGF is released by tumor cells and induces tumor neovascularization. It is now well established that the VEGF axis represents an important target for antitumor therapy. Aberrant VEGF signaling is also a feature of several other pathologic conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration and rheumatoid arthritis."

CD005139,0,20887245,0,Anti-VEGF compounds in the treatment of neovascular age related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly patients in developed countries. Although the pathogenesis of AMD is still largely unknown, it is now well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in the growth of the abnormal blood vessels (i.e. choroidal neovascularization, CNV) which characterizes the ""wet form"" of this ocular disease. Therefore, inhibiting VEGF has turned out to be a good way of more effectively controlling neovascular AMD. VEGF is a heparin-binding glycoprotein with potent angiogenic, mitogenic and vascular permeability-enhancing activities specific for endothelial cells. Currently two anti-VEGF compounds have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of neovascular AMD: pegaptanib and ranibizumab. Off-label usage of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent similar to ranibizumab, has also become fairly common. The substantial improvement of visual acuity noticed in patients treated with ranibizumab has made this drug the gold standard for AMD therapy. However, as with many new therapies, there are unresolved issues, including safety, cost, and dosing frequency. This review describes in details the properties and efficacy of the three anti-VEGF agents in use in clinical practice. Promising emerging anti-VEGF strategies (VEGF-trap, small interfering RNA, tyrosine kinase inhibitors) which aim to improve outcomes, safety and treatment burden through novel mechanisms of action are also discussed."

The foveal morphologic changes were examined via optical coherence tomography (OCT). At initial examination, 63 eyes exhibited subfoveal hemorrhage. At final examination, the defect lengths in the foveal external limiting membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid lines in these eyes were longer, and final VA was significantly poorer, compared with eyes without subfoveal hemorrhage. In comparisons between the final measurements in eyes with subfoveal hemorrhage in the IVR(-) and IVR(+) groups, while there were no differences in initial ocular conditions, final VA was significantly better in the IVR(+) group. The defects in the ELM and ellipsoid lines in the IVR(+) group were shorter than those of the IVR(-) group (p = 0.002 in both). Final VA was correlated with the defect lengths of foveal ELM and ellipsoid lines in both the IVR(-) and IVR(+) groups (both p < 0.001). In addition, the defect lengths of foveal ELM and ellipsoid lines were closely correlated with the duration of subfoveal hemorrhage (both p < 0.001). BRVO-associated subfoveal hemorrhage caused damage to the foveal photoreceptors, and visual dysfunction. However, IVR improved these prognoses, by accelerating the absorption of the subfoveal hemorrhage."

Because much of the literature comprises case reports and retrospective case series, the level of evidence supporting its use as a primary treatment option, or even as adjuvant therapy, is low. The standard of care is treatment of the underlying disorder to prevent neovascularization (retinal or subretinal), vitreous hemorrhage, or subsequent retinal detachment. However, these complications may not present until late in the disease course. It may then be useful to treat with these agents. Prospective studies are warranted to further elucidate the role of anti-VEGF therapy in these diseases."

The efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept in the treatment of wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration has been compared with that of intravitreal ranibizumab, the current gold standard for this indication, in two pivotal phase III studies of virtually identical design (VIEW 1 and 2). In both trials, the recommended regimen of aflibercept [2 mg every second month (after three initial monthly doses)] was shown to be noninferior to the recommended regimen of ranibizumab (0.5 mg every month) in terms of the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients who maintained their vision after 1 year of treatment; similar results were seen when monthly dosing with aflibercept (0.5 or 2 mg) was compared with ranibizumab. Over a period of 96 weeks in the VIEW studies, patients receiving the recommended regimen of aflibercept during the first year followed by modified quarterly treatment during the second year had a similar visual acuity gain to those receiving the recommended regimen of ranibizumab during first year followed by modified quarterly treatment during the second year, but on average required five fewer injections.

After 2 decades of extensive research into the VEGF families and receptors, specific molecules have been targeted for drug development, and several medications have received US Food and Drug Administration approval. Bevacizumab, a full-length antibody against VEGF approved for the intravenous treatment of advanced carcinomas, has been used extensively in ophthalmology for exudative age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, retinopathy of prematurity, and other chorioretinal vascular disorders. Pegaptanib and ranibizumab have been developed specifically for intraocular use, whereas the soon-to-be-introduced aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye) is moving through clinical trials for both intraocular and systemic use. Although these drugs exhibit excellent safety profiles, ocular and systemic complications, particularly thromboembolic events, remain a concern in patients receiving therapy. Patients experiencing adverse events that may be related to VEGF suppression should be carefully evaluated by both the ophthalmologist and the medical physician to reassess the need for intraocular therapy and explore the feasibility of changing medications. For this review a search of PubMed from January 1, 1985 through April 15, 2011, was performed using the following terms (or combination of terms): vascular endothelial growth factors, VEGF, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retina vein occlusions, retinopathy of prematurity, intravitreal injections, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and VEGF Trap.

The exact pathogenesis and etiology of ROP is unknown and genetic susceptibility is considered as risk factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in retinal neovascularization and subsequently retinal detachment. VEGF polymorphism is associated with proliferative ROP in some studies. We examined the possible association of the VEGF gene polymorphisms with ROP in preterm infants in south of Iran. A total of 111 preterm infants were examined by ophthalmologist and after that were genotyped. Genotyping of the VEGF +405 (rs2010963) and VEGF +936 (rs3025039) was done by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. The frequency of VEGF alleles, genotypes and haplotype distribution were compared between groups. The patients were divided in three groups: 66 to the normal group (normal fundoscopy), and 45 to the ROP group; 30 infants were not treated with Lasertherapy (Regressive group) and 15 treated with Lasertherapy. The frequency of VEGF +405 and VEGF +936 G/C genotypes as well as allele frequencies was not different between groups. No significant difference was found between ROP with treatment and ROP without lasertherapy. Our report indicate that there is no association between the carrier states of gene polymorphisms VEGF +405, VEGF +936 and progression or spontaneous regression of ROP in preterm infants in Iranian population. However, it should be considered that angiogenesis is a complex process and genetic factors in addition to environmental factors are contributed in this pathway."

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is often associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and pathological myopia (PM). Bisphosphonates, the drug of choice to treat osteoporosis, have been recently reported to have anti-angiogenic effects. The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of oral bisphosphonates for CNV in humans. Methods. Thirty-six consecutive cases with CNV due to AMD or PM who declined anti-VEGF therapy were recruited. The patients were prescribed 5 mg of oral alendronates daily for 6 months. The best-corrected visual-acuity (BCVA), the lesion size in fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography, foveal thickness and total macular volume in optical coherence tomography were compared between pre- and post-treatment. Results. The mean BCVA of the patients was significantly improved after a months with the treatment in the AMD group. In the PM group, the mean BCVA was maintained up to 6 months with the treatment. The mean lesion size was significantly decreased by 3 months in both groups. The averages of foveal thickness and total macular volume were significantly reduced after 1 month of treatment in the AMD group.Conclusions. Oral bisphosphonate should be further investigated as a possible therapeutic and preventive drug for CNV due to AMD and PM."

Vitrectomy can release the mechanical traction on the macula and increase oxygenation with subsequent reduction in DME. Early vitrectomy even in nontractional DME results in significant macular thinning and may lead to rapid improvement in vision with long-term stabilization. Unfortunately, a randomized trial pitting vitrectomy against the methods currently employed has not yet been performed."

CD005139,0,24558482,0,Fucoidan reduces secretion and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in the retinal pigment epithelium and reduces angiogenesis in vitro.,"Fucoidan is a polysaccharide isolated from brown algae which is of current interest for anti-tumor therapy. In this study, we investigated the effect of fucoidan on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), looking at physiology, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, and angiogenesis, thus investigating a potential use of fucoidan for the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration. For this study, human RPE cell line ARPE-19 and primary porcine RPE cells were used, as well as RPE/choroid perfusion organ cultures. The effect of fucoidan on RPE cells was investigated with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium--assay, trypan blue exclusion assay, phagocytosis assay and a wound healing assay. VEGF expression was evaluated in immunocytochemistry and Western blot, VEGF secretion was evaluated in ELISA. The effect of fucoidan on angiogenesis was tested in a Matrigel assay using calcein-AM vital staining, evaluated by confocal laser scanning microcopy and quantitative image analysis. Fucoidan displays no toxicity and does not diminish proliferation or phagocytosis, but reduces wound healing in RPE cells. Fucoidan decreases VEGF secretion in RPE/choroid explants and RPE cells. Furthermore, it diminishes VEGF expression in RPE cells even when co-applied with bevacizumab. Furthermore, fucoidan reduces RPE-supernatant- and VEGF-induced angiogenesis of peripheral endothelial cells. In conclusion, fucoidan is a non-toxic agent that reduces VEGF expression and angiogenesis in vitro and may be of interest for further studies as a potential therapy against exudative age-related macular degeneration."

CD005139,0,19272333,0,The role of choroidal hypoperfusion associated with photodynamic therapy in neovascular age-related macular degeneration and the consequences for combination strategies.,"The clinical benefits of verteporfin therapy have been documented in a wide variety of patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and there is encouraging evidence of improved outcomes when this angioocclusive modality is combined with antiangiogenic agents. Although the clinical benefits of verteporfin mono- and combination therapy are well established, there has been concern that treatment with verteporfin results in hypoperfusion in the treated area and that concomitant use of antiangiogenic agents could prolong this effect. However, despite well-documented occurrences of hypoperfusion on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, there is little evidence of associations with functional impairment or other adverse effects. It has also been suggested that hypoperfusion might actually help to reduce recanalization of CNV and permit neuronal recovery by decreasing exposure to oxygen and oxidative radicals. The reduced need for frequent retreatments clearly has a major appeal due to the lower costs associated with fewer interventions and reduced burden of clinical monitoring and diagnostic reevaluations. Ongoing evaluation in randomized clinical trials will provide further clarification on the effect of verteporfin plus ranibizumab compared with ranibizumab monotherapy in terms of visual acuity, anatomical outcomes, treatment frequency, and health economics. The results of these large-scale clinical trials will provide a strong basis for determining the benefits and risks of combination therapy."
CD005139,0,18208562,0,Deguelin inhibits retinal neovascularization by down-regulation of HIF-1alpha in oxygen-induced retinopathy.,"Retinal neovascularization is the most common cause of blindness; Retinopathy of pre-maturity (ROP) for children and diabetic retinopathy for young age group. ROP still remains as the most serious cause of vision loss in children. We provided that deguelin significantly reduces retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of ROP. Deguelin never affected the transcriptional activity of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1, however, reduced HIF-1 expression, which led to the decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Deguelin effectively suppressed endothelial cell proliferation without cytotoxic effect under therapeutic concentration range. In addition, deguelin demonstrated no reduction or retardation in normal retinal development and no retinal toxicity. These data suggest deguelin is a potent inhibitor of retinal neovascularization and may be applied in the treatment of other vasoproliferative retinopathies."

CD005139,0,24339679,0,Systemic medical management of diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) has assumed epidemic proportions and as a consequence, diabetic retinopathy is expected to be a major societal problem across the world. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects the vision by way of proliferative disease that results in vitreous hemorrhage and traction retinal detachment or by way of diabetic maculopathy (DME). The present-day management of diabetic retinopathy revolves around screening the diabetics for evidence of retinopathy and treating the retinopathy with laser photocoagulation. DME is treated with laser photocoagulation and/or intra- vitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents or steroids. Laser remains the mainstay of treatment and is potentially destructive. Systemic management aims at preventing or delaying the onset of retinopathy; reversing the early retinopathy; or delaying the progression of established retinopathy. Evidence from multiple studies has confirmed the protective role of rigid control of blood glucose and blood pressure. The evidence for lipid control versus maculopathy was less definitive. However, the use of fenofibrates (originally used for lowering serum lipids) has shown a benefit on both proliferative disease and maculopathy outside their lipid-lowering effect. Other drugs being tried are the Protein Kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, other peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonists, Forsoklin (which binds GLUT 1 receptor), minocycline (for its anti inflammatory effect), and Celecoxib (Cox-2 inhibitor)."

Sixty eyes of sixty patients with refractory DME were included. Half of them received injections of IVB (1.25 mg/0.05 ml) or combined IVB and IVT (1.25 mg/0.05 ml and 2 mg/0.05 ml respectively). The primary outcome measure was change in central macular thickness (CMT). Secondary outcome measures were change in best-corrected logMAR visual acuity (BCVA) and incidence of potential adverse events. Central macular thickness was reduced significantly in both the IVB and IVB/IVT groups. At week 24, CMT change compared to the baseline was -93.7 microm (95% CI, -172.2 to -19.26) in the IVB group and -93.1 microm (95% CI, -154.4 to -29.7) in the IVB/IVT group. There was not a significant difference between the IVB and the IVB/IVT groups. Improvement of BCVA was initiated at weeks 6 and 12 in the IVB/IVT and IVB groups respectively. Anterior chamber reaction was noticed in six (20%) and six (20%) eyes respectively in the IVB and IVB/IVT groups the day after injection, and it resolved with no sequel. Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) occurred in two eyes (6%) in the IVB/IVT group. Intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab had a beneficial effect on refractory DME in terms of CMT reduction and BCVA improvement. Addition of triamcinolone in the injection seemed to induce earlier visual improvement; however, it did not show any significant additive effect later during follow-up."

Although the cause of wet macular degeneration is not known, it is believed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces angiogenesis, resulting in a neovascular process, the hallmark of wet macular degeneration. Macugen is a VEGF antagonist. In two controlled, double-blinded identical studies, Macugen 0.3 mg was shown to slow the progression of wet macular degeneration. Using strict aseptic technique, Macugen 0.3 mg is administered via intravitreal injection every six weeks for one to two years. Serious adverse reactions include endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. Macugen is administered after a topical anesthetic, a subconjuctival block, or a combination of both is used to numb the injection site on the temporal sclera. Post-procedure patients may initially complain of transient vision loss, burning, pressure, eye pain, or ""floaters"". At time of discharge, patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of infection and instructed in the administration of antibiotic drops and in proper follow-up care.

Areas covered: In this review, the authors assess the evolution of gene therapy for AMD. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors can transduce retinal pigment epithelium; one such early application was a phase I trial of AAV2-delivered pigment epithelium derived factor gene in advanced nAMD. Subsequently, gene therapy for AMD shifted to the investigation of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1), an endogenously expressed VEGF inhibitor, binding and neutralizing VEGF-A. After some disappointing results, research has centered on novel vectors, including optimized AAV2, AAV8 and lentivirus, as well as genes encoding other anti-angiogenic proteins, including ranibizumab, aflibercept, angiostatin and endostatin. Also, gene therapy targeting the complement system is being investigated for geographic atrophy due to non-neovascular AMD. Expert opinion: The success of gene therapy for AMD will depend on the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic protein and its level of chronic expression. Future investigations will center on optimizing vector, promoter and delivery methods, and evaluating the risks of the chronic expression of anti-angiogenic or anti-complement proteins."

At present, the combined employment of drugs acting against vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) and photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V) is a promising therapeutic strategy for neovascular macular degenerations. However, this approach inevitably leads to an increase in health-resource utilization. In several clusters of patients treated for CNV, correlations among common gene polymorphisms implicated in coagulation- or complement-cascade and different levels of, respectively, post-PDT-V or post-anti-VEGF benefit have been reported. Factor XIII-A G185T substitution (rs5985), a frequent anti-thrombophilic genetic variant of Caucasian ethnic groups, unequivocally influences a worsening of the CNV responsiveness to PDT-V in patients affected by either AMD- or PM-related CNV. These coherent pharmacogenetic findings point out the opportunities to: i. optimize the eligibility criteria of PDT-V and, ii. customize the interventional strategy against CNV, for finally minimizing the socio-economic burden of neovascular macular degenerations."

These landmark clinical trials such as ANCHOR and MARINA and, more recently, the Comparison of AMD Treatment Trials and VIEW studies have revolutionized the management of neovascular AMD. While AMD continues to remain a leading cause of severe visual loss worldwide, advances in pharmacotherapeutics have led to substantial improvements in the outcome of these patients. The introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents has resulted in improvement of visual outcomes and has had a positive impact on the quality of life among elderly population. While the contemporary management of neovascular AMD has been successful in tremendously reducing the visual morbidity, the financial burden of therapy has increased exponentially. To overcome these challenges, newer pharmacologic agents are evaluated for their efficacy and safety in AMD. Ground-breaking advances in bench to bedside research have led to discovery of new pathways that appear to be viable targets for preventing visual loss in AMD. In this review, study designs and results of landmark clinical trials in AMD from the past decade have been summarized."

Or Losing?,"The widespread use of drugs that bind diffusible vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has revolutionized the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The pivotal ranibizumab and aflibercept registration trials featured monthly intravitreal injections for 12 months, during which visual acuities and macular edema rapidly improved for the first 3 months and modest gains or stabilization continued until the primary endpoint. In many subsequent trials, patients were evaluated monthly and treated as-needed (PRN) according to the results of visual acuity (VA) testing, fundus examinations and optical coherence tomography scans. Compared to monthly-treated control groups, PRN treated patients require fewer injections during the first year but they also experience smaller VA gains (1-3 letters). A small number of prospective trials that directly compared monthly with PRN therapy showed that VA gains with discontinuous therapy lag slightly behind those achieved with monthly injections. Physicians recognize that monthly office visits with frequent intraocular injections challenge patients' compliance, accrue high drug and professional service costs, and clog office schedules with frequently returning patients. To decrease the numbers of both office visits and anti-VEGF injections without sacrificing VA gains, physicians have embraced the treat-and-extend strategy. Treat-and-extend has not been studied as rigorously as PRN but it has become popular among both vitreoretinal specialists and patients. Despite the possible risks associated with discontinuous therapy (decreased VA and increased macular fluid), most physicians individualize treatment (PRN or treat-and-extend) for the majority of their patients. This review chapter explores the many advantages of individualized therapy, while balancing these against suboptimal responses due to the decreased frequency of anti-VEGF injections."

Present ocular siRNA delivery technology is limited due to poor delivery through the retina to the choroid, where CNV originates. Our goal was to develop an optimized nanosized polyRNAi-based therapeutic delivery system to the subretinal space. We developed it by siRNA multimerization (polysiRNA) followed by coating with branched polyethylenimine and hyaluronic acid, and then evaluated its efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The polysiRNA polyplex showed a narrow size distribution (260.7 ± 43.27 nm) and negative charge (-4.98 ± 0.47 mV) owing to the hyaluronic acid outer layer. In vitro uptake of the polysiRNA polyplex by human ARPE cells was discovered, and the direct inhibition of VEGF mRNA translation was confirmed in B16F10 cells. The intravitreally administered polysiRNA polyplex overcame both the vitreous and retina barriers in vivo and reached the subretinal space efficiently. Intravitreal injection of the polysiRNA polyplex was not toxic to the retina in histopathology. Furthermore, intravitreal injections of the polysiRNA polyplex at both 1 and 7 days after laser photocoagulation inhibited laser-induced choroidal neovascularization, compared to that of the control (p < 0.05). These results suggest that anti-VEGF polysiRNA polyplexes show great potential in delivering multimeric RNAi-based therapeutics to treat retinal or choroidal disorders."

AMD is a degenerative disease, and the degeneration affects primarily the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and secondarily the photoreceptors, leading consequently to disturbances or partial loss of central vision and legal blindness. Clinically, the disease is classified as: atrophic--dry AMD (in majority of cases), and neovascular--wet AMD (with choroidal neovascularization--CNV: 10-15% of all AMD cases). Pathogenesis of AMD is complex, multifactorial and only poorly recognized. Main risk factors include: advanced age, genetic predispositions, environmental determinants, history of exposure to intensive light and smoking. At least four molecular processes contribute to the development of AMD pathology: lipofuscinogenesis, drusogenesis, inflammation and choroidal neovascularization (in wet AMD). Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a predominant proangiogenic factor in CNV. the wet AMD can be treated with intravitreous application of ""anti-VEGF"" agents (Avastin, Lucentis, Eylea). Till now, there is no approved therapy for dry AMD, although several agents/treatments are currently in clinical trials.

Fundoscopy reveals angioid streaks as irregular dark brownish lines radiating from the area around the optic disc. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the major cause of severe visual loss in patients with angioid streaks. Argon-laser treatment of CNV secondary to angioid streaks shows poor results. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin does not seem to be an effective treatment for achieving stabilization of visual acuity and lesion size in CNV secondary to angioid streaks. Results after a combination of the intravitreal application of triamcinolone with PDT did not show the expected benefit. In the era of promising new intravitreal treatments for patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, it is interesting to observe this effect of angiogenesis inhibitors (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, pegaptanib) in patients with neovascilarization secondary to angioid streaks.

CD005139,0,26824524,0,Novelties in Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of vision loss, the last decade has brought significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of this common complication of diabetes mellitus. First, optical coherence tomography allows for noninvasive imaging of the retina, in particular, the macula, with very high resolution, thus facilitating the management of diabetic macular edema. In addition, recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of DR, in particular, the key role of cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), have led to the development of anti-VEGF antibodies for intraocular use. Anti-VEGF therapies have largely replaced laser photocoagulation for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. The benefit of intravitreal anti-VEGF in diabetic macular edema has been proven in numerous large randomized controlled trials. Moreover, a role of inflammation in DR has been recognized, and several mainly steroid-based, anti-inflammatory agents for intravitreal treatment have been shown to be effective. Despite these recent advances, strict systemic control of glycemia remains the cornerstone of the management of DR, significantly reducing ocular complications.

In neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause for legal blindness in many industrialised countries, abnormal blood vessels grow in the macula and cause blindness. There are a number of factors important in the angiogenic cascade but VEGF-A has been implicated in recent years as the major factor responsible for neovascular and exudative diseases of the eye. Numerous antiangiogenic drugs are in development but anti-VEGF drugs have shown great promise in treating neovascular AMD and other ocular diseases, and many of these drugs have been adopted from oncology where antiangiogenic therapy is gaining wide acceptance.

CD005139,0,25125423,0,Clinical applications of age-related macular degeneration genetics.,"Understanding genetic causes of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) will eventually yield effective discoveries and improvements in predictive/prognostic methods. These include, but are not limited to, reliable disease prediction (screening for increased discrimination of clinical risk), differential classification of AMD subtypes with biomarkers (development of risk-linked molecular taxonomies), selection of optimal preventive and therapeutic interventions (guided by a biologically meaningful understanding of treatment response), and drug dosing. In this review, we discuss clinical applications informed by key findings in AMD genetics, and provide commentary on leveraging extant and forthcoming evidence to improve AMD risk prediction, AMD classification, and knowledge on the genetic basis of drug activity and toxicity. Advances in translating AMD genetics findings for AMD risk prediction require development of a genetics-based causality for AMD incidence and progression. Molecular subtyping of AMD phenotypes requires a set of dynamic biomarkers presenting prognostic value; although these have yet to be identified, the formation of multidisciplinary teams and their participation in large-scale consortia may yield promising results. Drugs targeting complement and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) systems are under evaluation, and forthcoming work on rare variants and noncoding DNA in AMD pathogenesis will likely reveal biochemical pathways enriched with AMD-associated genetic variants. Pharmacologic targets in these pathways may inform a rational and effective therapeutic approach to preventing and treating this sight-threatening disease."
CD005139,0,26022642,0,Nanoengineering of therapeutics for retinal vascular disease.,"Retinal vascular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, neovascular age related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion, are leading causes of blindness in the Western world. These diseases share several common disease mechanisms, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, hypoxia, and inflammation, which provide opportunities for common therapeutic strategies. Treatment of these diseases using laser therapy, anti-VEGF injections, and/or steroids has significantly improved clinical outcomes. However, these strategies do not address the underlying root causes of pathology, and may have deleterious side effects. Furthermore, many patients continue to progress toward legal blindness despite receiving regular therapy. Nanomedicine, the engineering of therapeutics at the 1-100 nm scale, is a promising approach for improving clinical management of retinal vascular diseases. Nanomedicine-based technologies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of ophthalmology, through enabling sustained release of drugs over several months, reducing side effects due to specific targeting of dysfunctional cells, and interfacing with currently ""undruggable"" targets. We will discuss emerging nanomedicine-based applications for the treatment of complications associated with retinal vascular diseases, including angiogenesis and inflammation."

CD005139,0,24426775,0,Age-related macular degeneration: beyond anti-angiogenesis.,"Recently, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration have been developed. These agents, originally developed for their anti-angiogenic mechanism of action, probably also work through an anti-permeability effect in preventing or reducing the amount of leakage from submacular neovascular tissue. Other treatment modalities include laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, and submacular surgery. In reality, these latter treatments can be similarly categorized as anti-angiogenic because their sole aim is destroying or removing choroidal neovascularization (CNV). At the cellular level, CNV resembles stereotypical tissue repair that consists of several matricellular components in addition to neovascularization. In the retina, the clinical term CNV is a misnomer since the term may more appropriately be referred to as aberrant submacular repair. Furthermore, CNV raises a therapeutic conundrum: To complete or correct any reparative process in the body, angiogenesis becomes an essential component. Anti-angiogenic therapy, in all its guises, arrests repair and causes the hypoxic environment to persist, thus fueling pro-angiogenesis and further development of CNV as a component of aberrant repair. However, we realize that anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy preserves vision in patients with age-related macular degeneration, albeit temporarily and therefore, repeated treatment is needed. More importantly, however, anti-angiogenic therapy demonstrates that we can at the very least tolerate neovascular tissue beneath the macula and preserve vision in contrast to our historical approach of total vascular destruction. In this clinical scenario, it may be possible to look beyond anti-angiogenesis if our goal is facilitating submacular repair without destroying the neurosensory retina. Thus, in this situation of neovascular tolerance, it may be timely to consider treatments that facilitate vascular maturation, rather than its arrest or destruction. This would neutralize hypoxia, thus removing the stimulus that drives neovascularization and in turn the need for repeated lifelong intravitreal therapy. A pro-angiogenic approach would eliminate neovascular leakage and ultimately complete repair and preserve the neurosensory retina."

Retrospective review of 11 patients (11 eyes) with ranibizumab-resistant macular edema secondary to RVO. Macular edema was considered refractory to ranibizumab if no change of the pattern of macular fluid on optical coherence tomography and no change of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was observed after at least three consecutive monthly injections, excluding the loading dose. A single Ozurdex injection was performed and BCVA and central foveal thickness (CFT) were reviewed 2, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Mean BCVA improved significantly from 0.51 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (log MAR) at baseline to 0.3 log MAR (p = 0.03) at 2 months and 0.29 log MAR (p = 0.003) at 3 months. There was no significant difference in the BCVA between baseline at 6 months (p = 0.62). Mean CFT reduced significantly from 538 µm at baseline to 281 µm at 2 months (p = 0.00003), 281 µm at 3 months (p = 0.00003), and 445 µm at 6 months (p = 0.03). Treatment with Ozurdex results in improvement of BCVA and reduction of CFT in patients with ranibizumab refractory macular edema due to RVO at 3 months.

This study aims to review the systemic and ocular adverse events among patients treated at a tertiary eye center over a period of 8 years. A retrospective review of all intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF performed over an 8-year period at a tertiary eye care center in Singapore was done. We report the frequency of systemic and ocular adverse events and compared it among the various anti-VEGF agents. A total of 14 001 intravitreal injections were performed on 2225 patients from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2014, and this included 9992 bevacizumab (71.4 %), 3306 ranibizumab (23.6 %) and 703 aflibercept (5.0 %) injections. Systemic complications related to treatment were 26 (1.17 %) deaths (from any cause), of which 11 (0.49 %) were from fatal thromboembolic events, 7 (0.31 %) non-fatal thromboembolic events and two (0.09 %) serious non-ocular hemorrhage. Ocular complications included one (0.007 %) endophthalmitis, three (0.021 %) traumatic cataracts, and one (0.007 %) retinal detachment. Rates of death and thromboembolic events were similar among ranibizumab (lucentis), bevacizumab (avastin) and aflibercept (Eylea).

CD005139,0,28436035,0,NAP counteracts hyperglycemia/hypoxia induced retinal pigment epithelial barrier breakdown through modulation of HIFs and VEGF expression.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common complication leading to a central vision loss in patients with diabetes. In this eye pathology, the hyperglycaemic/hypoxic microenvironment of pigmented epithelium is responsible for outer blood retinal barrier integrity changes. More recently, we have shown that a small peptide derived from the activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), known as NAP, counteracts damages occurring during progression of diabetic retinopathy by modulating HIFs/VEGF pathway. Here, we have investigated for the first time the role of this peptide on outer blood retinal barrier (BRB) integrity exposed to hyperglycaemic/hypoxic insult mimicking a model in vitro of DME. To characterize NAP role on disease's pathogenesis, we have analyzed its effect on HIFs/VEGF system in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells, ARPE-19, grown in high glucose and low oxygen tension. The results have shown that NAP prevents outer BRB breakdown by reducing HIF1α/HIF2α, VEGF/VEGFRs, and increasing HIF3α expression, moreover it is able to reduce the percentage of apoptotic cells by modulating the expression of two death related genes, BAX and Bcl2. Further investigations are needed to determine the possible use of NAP in DME treatment."

CD005139,0,24889941,0,Switching to less expensive blindness drug could save medicare part B $18 billion over a ten-year period.,"The biologic drugs bevacizumab and ranibizumab have revolutionized treatment of diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, leading causes of blindness. Ophthalmologic use of these drugs has increased and now accounts for roughly one-sixth of the Medicare Part B drug budget. The two drugs have similar efficacy and potentially minor differences in adverse-event rates; however, at $2,023 per dose, ranibizumab costs forty times more than bevacizumab. Using modeling methods, we predict ten-year (2010-20) population-level costs and health benefits of using bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Our results show that if all patients were treated with the less expensive bevacizumab instead of current usage patterns, savings would amount to $18 billion for Medicare Part B and nearly $5 billion for patients. With an additional $6 billion savings in other health care expenses, the total savings would be almost $29 billion. Altering patterns of use with these therapies by encouraging bevacizumab use and hastening approval of biosimilar therapies would dramatically reduce spending without substantially affecting patient outcomes."
CD005139,0,23929309,0,Different antivascular endothelial growth factor treatments and regimens and their outcomes in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a literature review.,"Antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy has revolutionised the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD). Recent research has focused on evaluating competing agents and alternative dosage regimens, providing evidence to help determine optimal treatment strategies. We therefore conducted a review of clinical research studies in wAMD published since 2008 that compared anti-VEGF dosing regimens and therapies; seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Data on baseline disease characteristics, disease outcomes, safety (ocular and systemic) and treatment burden (injection and visit frequencies) were extracted on patients treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg, bevacizumab 1.25 mg or aflibercept 2.0 mg for up to 2 years. For ranibizumab and bevacizumab, visual and anatomical outcomes at 1 and 2 years were superior using scheduled monthly (or 4 weekly (q4w)) compared with as needed or scheduled quarterly dosing regimens. Treatment outcomes were generally better for both drugs when more aggressive retreatment criteria were used, which resulted in more frequent injections. Bevacizumab, however, was associated with a 30-35% elevated rate of serious systemic adverse events compared with ranibizumab, regardless of dosing interval; further study in larger patient populations will be required to determine the validity of this finding. Intravitreal aflibercept injection every 8 weeks was non-inferior to ranibizumab q4w on all visual and anatomical endpoints at week 52, had a similar safety profile and required five fewer anti-VEGF injections."

CD005139,0,15296845,0,Transient exposure of rat pups to hyperoxia at normobaric and hyperbaric pressures does not cause retinopathy of prematurity.,"We have shown that hyperoxia reduces brain damage in a rat model of hypoxia-ischemia. The purpose of this study was to examine the possibility of hyperoxia in inducing vision-threatening retinopathy. Two different experiments were conducted in this study. PART 1: seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by 2 h of hypoxia (8% O2 at 37 degrees C). Pups were treated with 100% oxygen at 1 ATA, 1.5 ATA, and 3.0 ATA for a duration of 1 h. PART 2: Newborn rat pups were exposed to 100% oxygen at 1, 1.5, or 3.0 ATA for 1 h, the same treatment protocol used for brain protection after hypoxia-ischemia. Retinopathy was evaluated by the degree of neovascularization (measuring retinal vascular density), by the structural abnormalities (histology) in the retina, and by the expression of hypoxia-hyperoxia sensitive proteins including hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at 24 h, 1, 2, and 10 weeks after hyperoxia exposure. Hyperoxic treatment at all pressures administered significantly reduced the hypoxia-ischemic-induced reduction in brain weight. Retinal vascular density measurements revealed no signs of neovascularization after hyperoxia exposure. There were also no abnormalities in the structure of the retina and no changes in the protein expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF following hyperoxia exposure. Exposure to hyperoxia for 1 h at normobaric or hyperbaric pressures did not result in the structural changes or abnormal vascularization that is associated with retinopathy of prematurity, suggesting that hyperoxia is a safe treatment for hypoxic newborn infants."

In this randomized clinical trial, 57 eyes of 57 patients were randomly assigned to IVD group (30 eyes), cases who received a single intravitreal injection of diclofenac (500 μg/0.1 ml), and IVB group (27 eyes), cases who received a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg). Change in best-corrected visual acuity in logMAR at week 12 was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included changes in central macular thickness, macular leakage, and potential injection-related complications. Best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly more in the IVD group than in the IVB group (P = 0.033), from 0.57 ± 0.25 to 0.49 ± 0.31 versus 0.55 ± 0.24-0.59 ± 0.27 logMAR at 12 weeks, respectively. However, the difference of macular thickness changes was in favor of IVB, but not to a significant level. The amount of change in leakage was not significantly different between the groups either. None of the eyes, in either group, developed ocular hypertension (≥23 mmHg) or cataract progression. No important injection-related complication was observed during the study period. This study demonstrated the superiority of IVD over IVB in the treatment of naïve DME regarding functional, but not anatomical outcomes. Therefore, using IVD as an adjunct or even alternative to other treatments might enhance the functional outcomes in such cases. Further studies are warranted to confirm potential benefit of IVD observed in this study."

To assess the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab compared to ranibizumab, verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT), and usual care for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in China. Methods. A Markov model was developed according to patient visual acuity (VA) in the better-seeing eye (Snellen scale). Four cohorts of patients were treated with one of the following therapies: bevacizumab, ranibizumab, PDT, or usual care. Clinical data related to treatments were obtained from published randomized clinical trials. Direct medical costs and resource utilization in the Chinese health care setting were taken into account. Health and economic outcomes were evaluated over a lifetime horizon. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results. Treatment with ranibizumab provided the greatest gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost per marginal QALY gained with bevacizumab over usual care was $1,258, $3,803, and $2,066 for the predominantly classic, minimally classic, and occult lesions, respectively. One-way sensitivity analysis showed considerably influential factors, such as utility values and effectiveness data. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that, compared to usual care, PDT and ranibizumab most cases would be cost-effective in the bevacizumab arm at a threshold of $7,480/QALY. Conclusion. Bevacizumab can be a cost-effective option for the treatment of AMD in the Chinese setting."
CD005139,0,20804843,0,Calpain inhibitors reduce retinal hypoxia in ischemic retinopathy by improving neovascular architecture and functional perfusion.,"In ischemic retinopathies, underlying hypoxia drives abnormal neovascularization that damages retina and causes blindness. The abnormal neovasculature is tortuous and leaky and fails to alleviate hypoxia, resulting in more pathological neovascularization and retinal damage. With an established model of ischemic retinopathy we found that calpain inhibitors, when administered in moderation, reduced architectural abnormalities, reduced vascular leakage, and most importantly reduced retinal hypoxia. Mechanistically, these calpain inhibitors improved stability and organization of the actin cytoskeleton in retinal endothelial cells undergoing capillary morphogenesis in vitro, and they similarly improved organization of actin cables within new blood vessels in vivo. Hypoxia induced calpain activity in retinal endothelial cells and severely disrupted the actin cytoskeleton, whereas calpain inhibitors preserved actin cables under hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that hyper-activation of calpains by hypoxia contributes to disruption of the retinal endothelial cell cytoskeleton, resulting in formation of neovessels that are defective both architecturally and functionally. Modest suppression of calpain activity with calpain inhibitors restores cytoskeletal architecture and promotes formation of a functional neovasculature, thereby reducing underlying hypoxia. In sharp contrast to ""anti-angiogenesis"" strategies that cannot restore normoxia and may aggravate hypoxia, the therapeutic strategy described here does not inhibit neovascularization. Instead, by improving the function of neovascularization to reduce underlying hypoxia, moderate calpain inhibition offers a method for alleviating retinal ischemia, thereby suggesting a new treatment paradigm based on improvement rather than inhibition of new blood vessel growth."

CD005139,0,17430137,0,Current and emerging concepts in the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly worldwide. The more severe form of the disease, known as neovascular AMD, is characterized by aberrant growth of blood vessels from the choroid into the subretinal space. This pathologic choroidal neovascularization can have drastic consequences, often seriously impairing vision in affected individuals. Current treatment approaches focus on combination therapies that include photodynamic therapy in conjunction with numerous forms of antiangiogenic or anti-inflammatory drug intervention. To date, however, no adequate treatment is available for the majority of affected individuals. The threat of a rapidly aging population provides the impetus for aggressive efforts to control the prevalence and progression of this disease. This review will outline the currently available pharmacotherapies, discussing the justification for their use as well as their shortcomings. Furthermore, drugs that are currently under investigation as monotherapies and adjuncts will be highlighted.

Developing effective therapies for this disease has been difficult. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of introducing new therapies for treating exudative ARMD on vision of the affected population and other outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed as having ARMD. DESIGN The study used data from a 5% sample of Medicare claims and enrollment data with a combination of a regression discontinuity design and propensity score matching to assess the effects on the introduction or receipt of new technologies on study outcomes during a 2-year follow-up period. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The analysis was based on longitudinal data for the United States, January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2011, for Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service coverage. The sample was limited to beneficiaries 68 years or older newly diagnosed as having exudative ARMD as indicated by beneficiaries having no claims with this diagnosis in a 3-year look-back period. EXPOSURES The comparisons with vision outcomes were after vs before the introduction of photodynamic therapy and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. The comparisons for depression and long-term care facility admission were between beneficiaries newly diagnosed as having exudative ARMD who received photodynamic therapy or anti-VEGF therapy compared with beneficiaries having the diagnosis who received no therapy for this disease. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Onset of decrease in vision, vision loss or blindness, depression, and admission to a long-term care facility. RESULTS Among beneficiaries newly diagnosed as having exudative ARMD, the introduction of anti-VEGF therapy reduced vision loss by 41% (95% CI, 52%-68%) and onset of severe vision loss and blindness by 46% (95% CI, 47%-63%). Such beneficiaries who received anti-VEGF therapy and were not admitted to a long-term care facility during the look-back period were 19% (95% CI, 72%-91%) less likely on average to be admitted to a long-term care facility during the follow-up period.

Current treatment consists of peripheral laser ablation and subsequent surgical intervention if a detachment occurs. We sought to evaluate the vitreous biochemistry of eyes that progress despite appropriate laser intervention. Additionally, a limited trial of an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapy was used in one eye of infants with persistent Plus disease and neovascularization. The anti-VEGF treatment successfully decreases abnormal angiogenesis but does not decrease the proliferative changes associated with retinal detachment.

Four drugs (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept) effectively treat DME when administered by intravitreal injections. Only ranibizumab has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for DME, but bevacizumab is commonly used off-label, and an FDA application for aflibercept is pending. Effective treatment requires repeated injections, although recent data suggest that the treatment burden diminishes after 1 year.

The cases of eighteen patients with histoplasmosis-related subfoveal CNV treated with corticosteroids were reviewed. Ten patients received oral prednisone for 4 to 6 weeks, and eight received a single sub-Tenon's injection of triamcinalone. Visual acuity outcomes were analyzed along with side effect profiles. At two-week follow-up, the prednisone group showed a median improvement in Snellen visual acuity of +2.0 lines, while the triamcinalone group remained essentially stable with a 0.5 line median loss. At treatment end (4 to 6 weeks), both groups showed no significant change in median acuity at 0.0 and -1.0 lines, respectively. Median final vision at 3 months also remained essentially stable at -0.5 lines for each group. Three patients reported anxiety, all of whom were taking prednisone 80 mg daily. Two patients reported increased appetite and weight gain on regimens of prednisone 80 and 100 mg daily. There were no adverse effects reported in the other patients receiving oral prednisone or in any patient receiving sub-Tenon's triamcinalone. The results suggest a beneficial effect of corticosteroids in stabilizing subfoveal CNV secondary to ocular histoplasmosis. In this small series, oral prednisone resulted in a short-term improvement in visual acuity, which stabilized over longer follow-up. The sub-Tenon's triamcinalone group achieved similar final stabilization without the initial improvement. Corticosteroids may be particularly valuable in managing neovascularization in patients who are awaiting interventions currently under development, in preventing recurrence after subfoveal surgery, or in treating non-surgical candidates. Further study is warranted to define the precise role of corticosteroids in this condition."

Retinal vein occlusions are classified as either branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), or hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO) based on the specific occlusion site. Decreased vision in patients afflicted with CRVO may result from retinal ischemia and/or the accumulation of fluid within the center of the retina (macular edema). The Central Vein Occlusion Study (CVOS) Group demonstrated that grid laser photocoagulation is not an effective treatment for decreased vision due to CRVO-related macular edema. Since publication of that report, the standard of care for patients with decreased vision due to CRVO-associated macular edema was observation. However, in the past 5 years, several major randomized controlled clinical trials have investigated new therapeutic modalities for the treatment of macular edema secondary to CRVO. This article aims to provide insight into current evidence-based approaches to the management of macular edema secondary to CRVO.

CD005139,0,17172400,0,Discovery and development of anticancer aptamers.,"Aptamers, also termed as decoys or ""chemical antibodies,"" represent an emerging class of therapeutics. They are short DNA or RNA oligonucleotides or peptides that assume a specific and stable three-dimensional shape in vivo, thereby providing specific tight binding to protein targets. In some cases and as opposed to antisense oligonucleotides, effects can be mediated against extracellular targets, thereby preventing a need for intracellular transportation. The first aptamer approved for use in man is a RNA-based molecule (Macugen, pegaptanib) that is administered locally (intravitreally) to treat age-related macular degeneration by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor. The most advanced aptamer in the cancer setting is AS1411, formerly known as AGRO100, which is being administered systemically in clinical trials. AS1411 is a 26-mer unmodified guanosine-rich oligonucleotide, which induces growth inhibition in vitro, and has shown activity against human tumor xenografts in vivo. The mechanism underlying its antiproliferative effects in cancer cells seems to involve initial binding to cell surface nucleolin and internalization, leading to an inhibition of DNA replication. In contrast to other unmodified oligonucleotides, AS1411 is relatively stable in serum-containing medium, probably as a result of the formation of dimers and a quartet structure. In a dose escalation phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors, doses up to 10 mg/kg/d (using a four or seven continuous infusion regime) have been studied. Promising signs of activity have been reported (multiple cases of stable disease and one near complete response in a patient with renal cancer) in the absence of any significant adverse effects. Further trials are ongoing in renal and non-small cell lung cancers. In preclinical studies, additional aptamers have been described against several cancer targets, such as tenascin-C, the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and antiapoptotic and Ku proteins."

This protocol is not directed at experienced retinologists but rather at general ophthalmologists who require a practical and up to date guide of a pathology as prevalent as RD. The different therapeutic options available, and their most accepted indications depending on the degree of diabetic retinopathy that patients have, are reviewed. We propose what to do in cases of mild, moderate and severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy as well as in cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (panphotocoagulation/antiangiogenic drugs/vitreorretinal surgery). The treatment of diabetic macular edema depending on its angiographic and topographic characteristics is also discussed. The importance of metabolic control of the patient is stressed (tight glycemic control, control of arterial hypertension and dyslipemia) in aiding the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This therapeutic proposal has been discussed widely by retinologists from the four largest hospitals in the Canary Islands, and is therefore an agreed text based on recent scientific literature."

CD005139,0,15051479,0,Herbimycin A inhibits angiogenic activity in endothelial cells and reduces neovascularization in a rat model of retinopathy of prematurity.,"The pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity involves dysregulated angiogenesis resulting in pre-retinal growth of new vessels. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase-dependent pro-angiogenic signals may provide a rational therapeutic approach to the reduction of pre-retinal neovascularization. Vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates endothelial cell mitogenesis, differentiation and migration, by binding and activating the receptor tyrosine kinases vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. One of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor substrates implicated in vascular endothelial growth factor signal transduction is c-Src. The ability of herbimycin A, a c-Src-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor-induced bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation was investigated. The ability of the compound to inhibit pathologic angiogenesis was tested in a rat model of retinopathy of prematurity. Exposure of neonatal rats to oxygen concentrations cycling between 10 and 50% induced severe pre-retinal neovascularization in all rats. Some of the eyes of these variable oxygen-exposed rats were herbimycin A-injected or vehicle-injected 1 or 3 days post-oxygen exposure while some eyes were non-injected. All rats were sacrificed for assessment 6 days post-exposure. Herbimycin A inhibited both vascular endothelial growth factor-induced bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cell proliferation and capillary tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. Injection of herbimycin A into oxygen-treated rats 1 day post-oxygen exposure produced a 63% decrease in pre-retinal neovascularization relative to vehicle (P = 0.0029). There was a 41% decrease in pre-retinal neovascularization in herbimycin-injected eyes relative to vehicle-injected eyes 3 days post-oxygen (P = 0.031). Pre-retinal neovascularization was reduced in vehicle-injected eyes relative to non-injected eyes at both injection times. There were no significant differences in retinal vascular area between any of the experimental groups. Based on the results of this study, herbimycin A inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation at non-toxic concentrations and reduces pre-retinal neovascularization in a rat model of retinopathy of prematurity. Reduction of angiogenesis by the inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity may be a viable route to the development of effective chemotherapies applicable to eye disease."
CD005139,0,27179659,0,"Diabetic macular oedema: pathophysiology, management challenges and treatment resistance.","Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is the leading cause of vision loss in patients living with diabetes. DMO results from hyperglycaemia-induced activation of pathways that lead to oxidative stress and release of cytokines, impairing the inner and outer blood-retinal barriers. Improved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to DMO have led to the development of effective therapies, including vitreoretinal surgery, laser photocoagulation, intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs and corticosteroids. Advances in imaging, including fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, have also enhanced diagnosis and management of the condition. Despite these advances, there remain patients who do not respond completely to therapy, reflecting the complex pathophysiology of DMO. These patients may be considered treatment-resistant. In this review, we summarise the pathophysiology of DMO, as well as the available treatments and their mechanism of action. Additionally, we focus on treatment-resistant disease and review the literature on potential options for managing this complication of diabetes."

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) provides new insights into the understanding of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) but limited information on the nature of hyperreflective tissue at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium. Therefore, polarization-sensitive (PS) SD-OCT was used to identify and characterize typical RPE findings in AMD. Methods. Forty-four eyes of 44 patients with AMD were included in this prospective case series representing the entire AMD spectrum from drusen (n = 11), geographic atrophy (GA; n = 11), neovascular AMD (nAMD; n = 11) to fibrotic scars (n = 11). Imaging systems were used for comparative imaging. A PS-SD-OCT instrument was developed that was capable of recording intensity and polarization parameters simultaneously during a single scan. Results. In drusen, PS-SD-OCT identified a continuous RPE layer with focal elevations. Discrete RPE atrophy (RA) could be observed in two patients. In GA, the extension of the RA was significantly larger. Residual RPE islands could be detected within the atrophic zone. PS-SD-OCT identified multiple foci of RPE loss in patients with nAMD and allowed recognition of advanced RPE disease associated with choroidal neovascularization. Wide areas of RA containing residual spots of intact retinal pigment epithelium could be identified in fibrotic scars. Conclusions. PS-SD-OCT provided precise identification of retinal pigment epithelium in AMD. Recognition of these disease-specific RA patterns in dry and wet forms of AMD is of particular relevance to identify the status and progression of RPE disease and may help to better estimate the functional prognosis of AMD."

Its pathogenesis is likely multifactorial, involving a complex interaction of metabolic, functional, genetic, and environmental factors, and remains poorly understood. For these reasons, currently used therapeutic approaches are insufficiently effective. Although major abnormalities are seen in four functionally interrelated tissues, i.e. photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruch's membrane, and choriocapillaries, the impairment of RPE cell functions is an early and crucial event in the molecular pathways leading to clinical relevant AMD changes. The RPE progressively degenerates, which results in an irreversible degeneration of photoreceptors. Four processes: lipofuscinogenesis, drusogenesis, inflammation, and neovascularization, specifically contribute to the development of the disease. Two types of AMD are distinguished: the dry and the wet form. This paper briefly describes major molecular and cellular events leading to AMD, and presents currently used and new, forthcoming therapeutic strategies."

Ranibizumab is an antibody fragment approved for the treatment of wet AMD. Bevacizumab is a full-length antibody registered for use in oncology but unlicensed for wet AMD. However, it is used off-label worldwide not only for wet AMD but also for various other ocular diseases associated with macular edema and abnormal vessel growth. We consider aspects of ranibizumab and bevacizumab in relation to their molecular characteristics, in vitro and in vivo properties, and preclinical safety data. Before 2009, most studies described the short-term toxicity of bevacizumab in multiple cell types of the eye. Since 2009, an increasing number of studies have compared the properties of ranibizumab and bevacizumab and investigated their impact on retinal cell functioning. Compared with bevacizumab, ranibizumab neutralizes VEGF better at low concentrations, maintains efficacy for longer, and has a higher retinal penetration and potency. Studies in animals demonstrate ranibizumab to be better localized to the injected eye, whereas bevacizumab appears to have a greater effect in the fellow eye. In humans, a localized and systemic effect has been reported for both molecules. In conclusion, overlapping yet distinct pharmacological properties of ranibizumab and bevacizumab indicate that safety or efficacy data from one cannot be extrapolated to the other."

CD005139,0,11772308,0,Farnesyltransferase inhibitors: mechanism and applications.,"Farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibitors (FTIs) are among the first wave of signal transduction inhibitors to be clinically tested for antitumour properties. FTIs were designed to attack Ras oncoproteins, the function of which depends upon post-translational modification by farnesyl isoprenoid. Extensive preclinical studies have demonstrated that FTIs compromise neoplastic transformation and tumour growth. In preclinical models, FTIs display limited effects on normal cell physiology and in Phase I human trials FTIs have been largely well tolerated. Exactly how FTIs selectively target cancer cells has emerged as an important question, one which has become more pressing with the somewhat disappointing results from initial Phase II efficacy trials. Although FTI development was predicated on Ras inhibition, it has become clear that the drugs' antineoplastic properties are based to a large degree on altering the prenylation and function of proteins other than Ras. One key candidate that has emerged is RhoB, an endosomal protein that has been implicated in selective growth inhibition and apoptosis in neoplastic cells. On the basis of mechanistic studies and other recent developments, we propose that FTIs may be useful to treat a unique spectrum of diseases including not only inflammatory breast cancer and melanoma but also non-neoplastic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration."

CD005139,0,17240254,0,Ocular neovascularization: basic mechanisms and therapeutic advances.,"The vast majority of diseases that cause catastrophic loss of vision do so as a result of ocular neovascularization. During normal retinal vascular development, vascular endothelial cells proliferate and migrate through the extracellular matrix in response to a variety of cytokines, leading to the formation of new blood vessels in a highly ordered fashion. During abnormal neovascularization of the iris, retina, or choroid, angiogenesis is unregulated and usually results in the formation of dysfunctional blood vessels. When these newly formed vessels leak fluid, hemorrhage, or are associated with fibrous proliferation, retinal edema, retinal/vitreous hemorrhage, or traction retinal detachments may occur resulting in potentially catastrophic loss of vision. In this review, we will briefly discuss the scope of the clinical problem and the general underlying principles of angiogenesis. We will focus on recent laboratory advances that have led to the development of therapeutics useful in the treatment of neovascular eye diseases. We will describe compounds currently in pre-clinical development stages as well as the results of clinical trials involving the use of these drugs as treatments for ocular neovascularization."

CD005139,0,23528535,0,Eye drop propranolol administration promotes the recovery of oxygen-induced retinopathy in mice.,"The mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is a well-established model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), characterized by the abnormal formation of new blood vessels, which is similar to ROP. In this model, we have recently shown that subcutaneous (sc) administration of the non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blocker propranolol ameliorates angiogenic processes in the retina when its effects are evaluated at postnatal day (PD) 17. In the present study, we investigated whether propranolol application as collyrium can promote the recovery of OIR. After propranolol administration on the eye, mice were first tested for retinal concentrations of propranolol as compared with those measured after sc or per os administration. Subsequently, we determined the effects of propranolol ophthalmic solutions, at the optimal dose for delivery, on VEGF, IGF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and retinal neovascularization as assessed in both the superficial and the deep vascular plexuses. The results showed that 2% topical propranolol has an efficiency (in terms of final propranolol concentration in the retina) comparable to that of 20 mg/kg propranolol sc or per os and significantly higher than those observed with doses and administration routes that are currently used with children. Propranolol ophthalmic solutions reduced VEGF and IGF-1 up-regulation in response to hypoxia and drastically inhibited HIF-1α accumulation and STAT3 phosphorylation. As a result of its inhibitory effects on hypoxia-induced proangiogenic factors, propranolol significantly reduced retinal neovascularization in the superficial but not in the deep vascular plexus. An evaluation of retinal neovascularization at PD21 showed that propranolol was still effective in inhibiting OIR. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that β-AR blockade can efficiently counteract OIR and suggest that topical eye application of propranolol can represent an alternative delivery route to systemic administration thus avoiding the risk of associated complications and side effects that could make this drug unsafe in the ROP treatment."

CD005139,0,14516424,0,New treatments in age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of legal blindness in individuals 50 years and older in the developed world. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in exudative AMD is responsible for the majority of severe vision loss. Until recently, laser photocoagulation was the only well-established and widely accepted treatment for CNV. However, it is beneficial only for a small subset of patients, has a high rate of CNV persistence and recurrence and results in iatrogenic, collateral damage to the overlying retina. These issues make it difficult to recommend in the case of subfoveal lesions. Consequently, numerous experimental therapeutic interventions are under investigation with the common objective of destroying the CNV but leaving the foveal neurosensory retina intact. Treatment modalities can be grouped into five major categories: photodynamic therapy; radiotherapy; transpupillary thermotherapy; anti-angiogenic and angiostatic agents; and surgical intervention. The present review aims to explain the rationale behind these new treatments, analyse the evidence for their safety and efficacy, determine their stage of development and indicate in which patients they are potentially useful."

Application of saline solution or scrambled ODN17 solution on eyes of rats led to the highest extent of corneal neovascularization. The groups treated with blank nanoemulsion or scrambled ODN17 nanoemulsion showed moderate inhibition in corneal neovascularization with no significant difference with the saline and scrambled ODN17 control solution groups, while the groups treated with ODN17 solution or Avastin® (positive ODN17 control) clearly elicited marked significant inhibition in corneal neovascularization confirming the results reported in the literature. The highest significant corneal neovascularization inhibition efficiency was noted in the groups treated with ODN17 nanoemulsion (topical and subconjunctivally). However, in the ROP mouse model, the ODN17 in PBS induced a 34% inhibition of retinal neovascularization when compared to the aqueous-vehicle-injected eyes. A significantly higher inhibition of vitreal neovascularization (64%) was observed in the group of eyes treated with ODN17 nanoemulsion. No difference in extent of neovascularization was observed between blank nanoemulsion, scrambled ODN17 nanoemulsion, vehicle or non-treated eyes. The overall results indicate that cationic nanoemulsion can be considered a promising potential ocular delivery system and an effective therapeutic tool of high clinical significance in the prevention and forthcoming treatment of ocular neovascular diseases."

CD005139,0,19086934,0,Uveal melanoma and macular degeneration: molecular biology and potential therapeutic applications.,"Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults with 30% to 50% of patients that ultimately succumb to metastatic disease, mainly to the liver. (Shields et al. 1991) Although new diagnostic and therapeutic tools have been developed during the most recent years, only the eye conservation rate has been achieved, while the survival rate remains poor. The reason for this liver-homing is largely unknown, but it is conceivable that hepatic environmental factors may be implicated in the growth, dissemination, and progression of this malignancy. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) that binds to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is mainly produced in the liver. It has been shown to be crucial for tumor transformation, maintenance of malignant phenotype, promotion of cell growth, and prevention of apoptosis. (Baserga 1995) The hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is another growth factor produced in the liver and exerts its biological effects through binding to the plasma membrane receptor c-Met. The activation of this receptor by HGF/SF ligand can induce proliferation, motility, adhesion, and invasion of tumor cells. (Cruz et al. 2003) Metastasis is a process involving many components, including tumor cell adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis, and invasion. The tumor cells undergo intravasation, disperse via the vascular and the lymphatic systems, and finally extravasate to invade the secondary sites. In all these steps, proteolytic enzyme systems are involved, including the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system and the plasminogen activation system. The migration of a malignant cell through the ECM and the basement membrane requires proteolytic activities. (Stetler-Stevenson et al. 1993). Efforts to target the IGF-I system has been made with different types of cancer but not with uveal melanoma."

CD005139,0,27221536,0,Involvement of NADPH oxidases in alkali burn-induced corneal injury.,"Chemical burns are a major cause of corneal injury. Oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and neovascularization after the chemical burn aggravate corneal damage, and lead to loss of vision. Although NADPH oxidases (Noxs) play a crucial role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the role of Noxs in chemical burn-induced corneal injury remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the transcription and expression of Noxs in corneas were examined by RT-qPCR, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. It was found that alkali burns markedly upregulated the transcription and expression of Nox2 and Nox4 in human or mouse corneas. The inhibition of Noxs by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or apocynin (Apo) effectively attenuated alkali burn-induced ROS production and decreased 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) protein levels in the corneas. In addition, Noxs/CD11b double‑immunofluorescence staining indicated that Nox2 and Nox4 were partially co-localized with CD11b. DPI or Apo prevented the infiltration of CD11b-positive inflammatory cells, and inhibited the transcription of inflammatory cytokines following alkali burn-induced corneal injury. In our mouse model of alkali burn-induced corneal injury, corneal neovascularization (CNV) occurred on day 3, and it affected 50% of the whole area of the cornea on day 7, and on day 14, CNV coverage of the cornea reached maximum levels. DPI or Apo effectively attenuated alkali burn‑induced CNV and decreased the mRNA levels of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

CD005139,0,26882365,0,Cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema.,"Objective Ranibizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor designed for ocular use, has been deemed cost-effective in multiple indications by several Health Technology Assessment bodies. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab monotherapy or combination therapy (ranibizumab plus laser photocoagulation) compared with laser monotherapy for the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME). Methods A Markov model was developed in which patients moved between health states defined by best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) intervals and an absorbing 'death' state. The population of interest was patients with DME due to type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Baseline characteristics were based on those of participants in the RESTORE study. Main outputs were costs (in 2013 CA$) and health outcomes (in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. This cost-utility analysis was conducted from healthcare system and societal perspectives in Quebec. Results From a healthcare system perspective, the ICERs for ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy vs laser monotherapy were CA$24 494 and CA$36 414 per QALY gained, respectively. The incremental costs per year without legal blindness for ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy vs laser monotherapy were CA$15 822 and CA$20 616, respectively. Based on the generally accepted Canadian ICER threshold of CA$50 000 per QALY gained, ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy were found to be cost-effective compared with laser monotherapy. From a societal perspective, ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy provided greater benefits at lower costs than laser monotherapy (ranibizumab therapy dominated laser therapy). Conclusions Ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy resulted in increased quality-adjusted survival and time without legal blindness and lower costs from a societal perspective compared with laser monotherapy."

CD005139,0,18940262,0,"Blood-retinal barrier in hypoxic ischaemic conditions: basic concepts, clinical features and management.","The blood-retinal barrier (BRB) plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the microenvironment in the retina. It consists of inner and outer components, the inner BRB (iBRB) being formed by the tight junctions between neighbouring retinal capillary endothelial cells and the outer barrier (oBRB) by tight junctions between retinal pigment epithelial cells. Astrocytes, Müller cells and pericytes contribute to the proper functioning of the iBRB. In many clinically important conditions including diabetic retinopathy, ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion, and some respiratory diseases, retinal hypoxia results in a breakdown of the iBRB. Disruption of the iBRB associated with increased vascular permeability, results in vasogenic oedema and tissue damage, with consequent adverse effects upon vision. Factors such as enhanced production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), NO, oxidative stress and inflammation underlie the increased permeability of the iBRB and inhibition of these factors is beneficial. Experimental studies in our laboratory have shown melatonin to be a protective agent for the iBRB in hypoxic conditions. Although oBRB breakdown can occur in conditions such as accelerated hypertension and the toxaemia of pregnancy, both of which are associated with choroidal ischaemia and in age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), and is a feature of exudative (serous) retinal detachment, our studies have shown that the oBRB remains intact in hypoxic/ischaemic conditions. Clinically, anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to improve vision in diabetic maculopathy and in neovascular ARMD. The visual benefit in both conditions appears to arise from the restoration of BRB integrity with a reduction of retinal oedema."

CD005139,0,26692257,0,A Review of Randomized Trials of Approved Pharmaceutical Agents for Macular Edema Secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion.,"There are 3 approved pharmaceutical agents for treating macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO): dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) implant and ranibizumab and aflibercept (both antivascular endothelial growth factor agents). All show a superior ability to improve vision and reduce macular thickness in comparison with sham injections or macular grid laser treatment. Prompt treatment with these agents may lead to a better outcome. A review of randomized trials of injected aflibercept or ranibizumab reveals protocol variations. They include ""as needed"" injections until functional and anatomical changes are achieved, preceded by either 1 injection or 3 to 6 monthly injections as loading doses. Ocular and systemic adverse effects of vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists for macular edema secondary to RVO are rarely severe. The antiedematous response to a single intravitreal dexamethasone implant is maximal 1 to 3 months after the injection. Intraocular pressure elevation and cataract aggravation should be monitored after the use of intravitreal dexamethasone implants. Intravitreal dexamethasone implants and ranibizumab injections reduce not only macular edema, but also the risk of retinal ischemia and neovascularization in patients with RVO."

CD005139,0,27348433,0,The Role of Anti-VEGF Therapy in the Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. DR often leads to diabetic macular edema (DME), which often goes unnoticed until a patient presents with vision loss. However, treatment options and data for DME are continually improving. We know that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in DME progression; therapies that act by inhibiting VEGF production seem to improve visual acuity in patients with DME. Of the anti-VEGF therapies available, two have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat DME: ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) and aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY). Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), which is approved for the treatment of certain types of cancer, is occasionally used off-label to treat DME. Anti-VEGF therapy can stop vision loss and even improve visual acuity. Other treatments remain effective, and these various treatment options fuel a need for new data and discussion. This roundtable discussion, which took place during the 2015 annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, outlines the current protocols used to treat DME and provides clinical opinions about selecting and treating with an appropriate anti-VEGF therapy.

CD005139,0,24990871,0,Myopic choroidal neovascularisation: current concepts and update on clinical management.,"Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) is a common vision-threatening complication of myopia and pathological myopia. Despite significant advances in understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis and natural history of myopic CNV, there is no standard definition of myopic CNV and its relationship to axial length and other myopic degenerative changes. Several treatments are available to ophthalmologists, but with the advent of new therapies there is a need for further consensus and clinical management recommendations. Verteporfin photodynamic therapy has been an established treatment for subfoveal myopic CNV for many years, but this treatment does not restore visual acuity and is associated with long-term chorioretinal atrophy. More recently, clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents in patients with myopic CNV have demonstrated substantial visual acuity gains and quality of life increases compared with photodynamic therapy. These enhanced outcomes provide updated evidence-based clinical management guidelines of myopic CNV, and increase the need for a generally accepted definition for myopic CNV. This review critically summarises the latest myopic CNV literature in the context of clinical experience and recommends a myopic CNV treatment algorithm."

CD005139,0,21358858,0,Therapeutic antibodies in ophthalmology: old is new again.,"More than a century after the first successful use of serotherapy, antibody-based therapy has been renewed by the availability of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. As in the past, current clinical experience has prompted new pharmacological questions and induced much debate among practitioners, notably in the field of ophthalmology. An examination of the history of antibodies as treatments for ocular disorders reveals interesting parallels to the modern era. The fact that a treatment administered by a systemic route could be efficacious in a local disease was not widely accepted and the ""chemical"" nature of antibodies was not clearly understood in the late 19(th) century. Clinical studies by Henry Coppez, a Belgian ophthalmologist, established in 1894 that antidiphtheric antitoxins could be used to treat conjunctival diphtheria. Nearly 20 years later, Coppez and Danis described age-related macular degeneration, a disorder which today benefits from ranibizumab therapy. The product, a locally-administered recombinant monoclonal Fab fragment, is directed against vascular endothelial growth factor A. Interestingly, its full-size counterpart, bevacizumab, which is approved for the treatment of solid tumors, has also demonstrated efficacy in age-related macular degeneration when administered either intravenously or locally, which raises new questions about antibody pharmacology and biodistribution.In order to shed some light on this debate, we recount the early history of serotherapy applied to ophthalmology, review the exact molecular differences between ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and discuss what is known about IgG and the blood-retina barrier and the possible role of FcRn, an IgG transporter."
CD005139,0,26107601,0,An Update on the Diagnosis and Management of Central Serous Chorioretinopathy.,"Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a complicated disease with still unclear causes, pathogenesis and management strategy despite active research. CSC has been traditionally considered as a self-limiting disease where spontaneous recovery occurs in 90% of the patients within a few months. This proclaimed ""benign"" nature of CSC, however, has been queried by increasing scientific evidence that permanent photoreceptors damage and neurosensory-cystoid degeneration of macula occur in the event of chronic CSC. CSC is probably not a benign disease. Treatments for CSC are still evolving. It is very difficult to define the proper timing for active treatment of CSC because it is not easy to define a universally accepted cut-off time point for active intervention. There is a recent suggestion that active CSC treatment should be considered if symptoms last longer than 3 months as atrophy of photoreceptors may occur as early as 4 months after initial presentation. The CSC patients may be stratified into two groups based on the initial presenting visual acuity and duration of symptom: the good visual prognosis group and the dubious visual prognosis group. The management may then be tailor-made based on the visual prognosis group. ""Safety-enhanced'"" photodynamic therapy (PDT) using lower doses and reduced fluence is still the mainstay of treatment. Newer treatment modalities like intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, micropulsed diode laser treatment, and the use of corticosteroid antagonists do warrant further investigation. Combination therapies involving two or more of the above modalities of treatments may have a role to play in this actively researched area."

CD005139,0,18637105,0,Inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a review of current practice.,"We review the fundamental changes that are now occurring to the management of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). An improved understanding of the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the genesis of choroidal neovascular membranes has led to the creation and use of intravitreous anti-VEGF antibodies (bevacizumab and ranubizumab) and an aptamer (pegaptanib) in the treatment of these lesions. These new intravitreous injections for AMD have supplanted previous treatments in both efficacy and safety and are now the standard of care for neovascular AMD. We discuss the biochemistry of the anti-VEGF pathway. While there is substantial evidence for the use of ranubizumab and pegaptanib, the intravitreous administration of bevacizumab has not been tested in randomised controlled clinical trials. We review the evidence base for all three agents and the patho-physiological basis for adverse reactions to intravitreous VEGF blockade."
CD005139,0,24140257,0,Photodynamic therapy for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.,"The first effective therapy for exudative macular degeneration (AMD) was Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). Diagnosis of the disease was to a large extent by fluorescein angiography (FA). Distinguishing between the leaky choroidal neovessels (CNV) associated with exudative AMD, and the polypoidal structures associated with Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV) is not always easy using FA alone. The switch to Indocyanine Green angiography helped to pinpoint PCV, and thus to study the efficacy of photodynamic therapy of this particular form of retinal disease, which is more frequently encountered among pigmented individuals. The results appear to be quite promising, and in the year following treatment only a small fraction of the patients had to be retreated. Alternatively, treating PCV with repeated intravitreal VEGF blocking agents was not as successful as it was in the treatment of wet AMD. However, combining PDT-induced angio-occlusion of the polypoidal lesions with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy was shown to be quite effective, and the combination of PDT with an anti-angiogenic agent as well as a steroid, in a triple therapy, was recently also shown to be a quite promising option. In the present article we review the data on PDT of PCV, including combination therapies and alternative treatments. We also report on similarities and differences between AMD and PCV."

Currently, there are four anti-VEGF agents in use: bevacizumab, ranibizumab, pegaptanib, and aflibercept. The success and frequency of anti-VEGF therapy have made the ocular safety profile of these agents of vital importance. This paper focuses on sterile endophthalmitis. In this paper, we compare the incidences of posttreatment sterile endophthalmitis among the four agents, review the mechanism of actions, and discuss the most prevalent hypotheses leading to sterile endophthalmitis."

CD005139,0,10077351,0,Deficient activation and different expression of transforming growth factor-beta isoforms in active proliferative diabetic retinopathy and neovascular eye disease.,"An increased expression and secretion of angiogenic growth factors was proposed to occur in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and other neovascularizing retinal diseases. However, a loss of anti-angiogenic factors also might promote retinal neovascularization. Therefore we investigated the active and latent vitreous levels of the subtypes of the endothelial anti-mitogen transforming growth factor-beta in vitreous of 58 patients. Four groups of patients were compared: Controls without retinal hypoxia, patients with quiescent and active proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and patients with severe retinal hypoxia resulting in rubeosis iridis. Whereas the amount of total TGF-beta in the four groups did not differ significantly, latent TGF-beta isoform expression showed complex alterations in ocular vitreous. Levels of active TGF-beta of patients with active PDR (79.5 +/- 28 pg/ml; n = 8) were decreased to 20% of the control levels (378 +/- 55 pg/ml; n = 12; p = 0.0005) and 25% of the mean concentration in quiescent PDR (346 +/- 64 pg/ml; n = 9; p = 0.0021). Levels in rubeosis (52 +/- 10 pg/ml; n = 10) did not differ significantly from those found in active PDR but were decreased to 15% of those in patients with quiescent PDR (p = 0.0004). Furthermore a highly significant inverse correlation between active TGF-beta and alpha2-antiplasmin, a liver produced inhibitor of the activation of TGF-beta by plasmin was noted (r = -0.59; n = 28; p = 0.001). We conclude that deficient activation of TGF-beta occurs in active proliferative diabetic retinopathy and in hypoxic angiogenesis most likely as a consequence of a blood retina barrier breakdown and influx of alpha2-antiplasmin from serum. The disinhibition of endothelial cell proliferation may be a central component in the process of neovascularization."

CD005139,0,24018558,0,Retinal angiogenesis suppression through small molecule activation of p53.,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the Western world. Cytokine-targeted therapies (such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) are effective in treating pathologic ocular angiogenesis, but have not led to a durable effect and often require indefinite treatment. Here, we show that Nutlin-3, a small molecule antagonist of the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase MDM2, inhibited angiogenesis in several model systems. We found that a functional p53 pathway was essential for Nutlin-3-mediated retinal antiangiogenesis and disruption of the p53 transcriptional network abolished the antiangiogenic activity of Nutlin-3. Nutlin-3 did not inhibit established, mature blood vessels in the adult mouse retina, suggesting that only proliferating retinal vessels are sensitive to Nutlin-3. Furthermore, Nutlin-3 inhibited angiogenesis in nonretinal models such as the hind limb ischemia model. Our work demonstrates that Nutlin-3 functions through an antiproliferative pathway with conceivable advantages over existing cytokine-targeted antiangiogenesis therapies."

This was a retrospective study of young adults with CNV treated with PDT. Data collected included age, diagnosis, type and size of CNV, number of treatments, visual outcome, and side effects. Ten patients (11 eyes) were included in the study (mean age 27.2 +/- 13.3 years). Etiologies included multifocal choroiditis (3 eyes), idiopathic CNV (5 eyes), central serous chorioretinopathy (1 eye), and toxoplasma (2 eye). The mean number of treatments was 2 +/- 0.7 and the mean follow-up time was 13.1 +/- 9.5 months.

Sixty-one AMD patients from phase II clinical trial were entered into an extended trial and followed up for more than 2 years. Pegaptanib sodium 0.3 mg was administered once every six weeks. Changes in visual acuity were evaluated using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The number of responders and adverse events were monitored. The mean change in visual acuity decreased by 10.3 letters for up to 199 weeks (62-199 weeks; mean 140 weeks) during follow-up. There were 77.4% responders at the beginning (54 weeks since the beginning of phase II trial) and 56.6% at the end of the extended trial. Adverse events were found in 57 of 61 patients (93.4%); 36 of the events (59.0%) were due to a preparation procedure, while 12 adverse events (19.7%), including retinal hemorrhage (3 events; 4.9%), anterior chamber inflammation (2 events; 3.3%), macular degeneration, floaters, photopsia, retinal vessel aneurysm, vitreous hemorrhage, ocular hypertension, arteriosclerosis obliterans and hypertension (1 event; 1.6%, respectively) were associated with pegaptanib sodium. Thus, the majority of adverse events was at least in part a result of the preparation procedure for injection. Based on the long-term efficacy and tolerability data of this trial, pegaptanib sodium appears to be beneficial for preventing the worsening of visual acuity caused by age-related macular degeneration with choroidal neovascularization."
CD005139,0,29204993,0,Update on the Use of Anti-VEGF Intravitreal Therapies for Retinal Vein Occlusions.,"The use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in ophthalmology has profoundly changed our management and treatment of conditions such as cystoid macular edema, diabetic macular edema, choroidal neovascularization, and other proliferative retinopathies. Although initially used for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization in neovascular age-related macular degeneration, their application has spread rapidly for other indications as their outcomes have often outperformed previously existing treatments. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) continues to be one of the leading causes of vision loss secondary to macular edema, in addition to macular ischemia and neovascularization in more severe cases. Before the availability of anti-VEGF therapy, the use of macular grid laser and panretinal photocoagulation was the mainstay of treatment of macular edema and neovascularization, respectively, in patients with RVOs. Two landmarks studies established the guidelines of these treatments for nearly a quarter century. Since the availability of anti-VEGF agents, there has been a paradigm shift in the treatment of RVO. Most importantly, there has also been a significant improvement in visual outcomes in these patients. The goal of this article is to provide a review of the pertinent clinical studies that have investigated the use of anti-VEGF in patients with retinal vein occlusions."

CD005139,0,24695684,0,IL-18 attenuates experimental choroidal neovascularization as a potential therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common form of central retinal blindness globally. Distinct processes of the innate immune system, specifically activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, have been shown to play a central role in the development of both ""dry"" and neovascular (""wet"") forms of the disease. We show that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) can regulate choroidal neovascularization formation in mice. We observed that exogenous administration of mature recombinant IL-18 has no effect on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell viability, but that overexpression of pro-IL-18 or pro-IL-1β alone can cause RPE cell swelling and subsequent atrophy, a process that can be inhibited by the promotion of autophagy. A direct comparison of local and systemic administration of mature recombinant IL-18 with current anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-based therapeutic strategies shows that IL-18 treatment works effectively alone and more effectively in combination with anti-VEGF therapy and represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of wet AMD."

Mean inter-centre VA change from baseline to 12 months varied from +6.9 letters to -0.6 letters (mean of +2.5 letters). The proportion of eyes achieving VA of 70 letters or more varied between 21.9 and 48.7% at 12 months. Median number of injections (visits) at each centre varied from 5 to 8 (9 to 12), with an overall median of 6 (11). Age, starting VA, number of injections, and visits, but not gender were significantly associated with variation in these VA outcomes (P<0.01). Significant variation between centres persisted even after adjusting for these factors.ConclusionThere are modest differences in VA outcomes between centres in the UK. These differences are influenced, but not completely explained, by factors such as patient age, starting VA, number of injections, and visits. These data provide an indication of the VA outcomes that are achievable in real-world settings."
CD005139,0,17925884,0,Targeted pharmacotherapy of retinal diseases with ranibizumab.,"Diseases of retinal and/or choroidal blood vessels are the most prevalent causes of moderate and severe vision loss in developed countries. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of many of these diseases. Ranibizumab is a humanized antigen-binding fragment that binds all isoforms of VEGF-A. Intraocular injections of ranibizumab cause significant visual improvement in approximately 40% of patients with choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Pilot trials have indicated that intraocular injections of ranibizumab also provide benefits in patients with macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusions. Based upon several case series, bevacizumab, a full-length humanized monoclonal antibody that binds all isoforms of VEGF-A, improves vision in patients with choroidal neovascularization due to AMD and other diseases. Case series also suggest that bevacizumab can cause regression of retinal neovascularization in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Taken together, results with ranibizumab and bevacizumab suggest that potent antagonists of VEGF will provide the foundation of treatment for a wide variety of diseases complicated by retinal or choroidal neovascularization, or by excessive vascular leakage leading to macular edema."

Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of a monoclonal antibody (Mab) specific for the E1E2 domain of Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6, Mab2F1, on canonical Wnt signaling and its therapeutic potential for diabetic retinopathy. Mab2F1 displayed robust inhibition on Wnt signaling with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of 20 μg/mL in retinal pigment epithelial cells. In addition, Mab2F1 also attenuated the accumulation of β-catenin and overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α induced by high-glucose medium in retinal endothelial cells. In vivo, an intravitreal injection of Mab2F1 significantly reduced retinal vascular leakage and decreased preretinal vascular cells in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) rats, demonstrating its inhibitory effects on ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization. Moreover, Mab2F1 blocked the overexpression of the inflammatory/angiogenic factors, attenuated leukostasis, and reduced retinal vascular leakage in both early and late stages of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. In conclusion, Mab2F1 inhibits canonical Wnt signaling, vascular leakage, and inflammation in the retina of diabetic retinopathy models, suggesting its potential to be used as a therapeutic agent in combination with other antiangiogenic compounds."

To identify the predictors of visual response to the bevacizumab treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Design. A cohort study within the Neovascular AMD Treatment Trial Using Bevacizumab (NATTB). Methods. This was a multicenter trial including 144 participants from the NATTB study. Visual outcomes measured by change in visual acuity (VA) score, proportion gaining ≥15 letters, and change in central retinal thickness (CRT) were compared among groups according to the baseline, demographic, and ocular characteristics and genotypes. Results. Mean change in the VA score was 9.2 ± 2.3 SD letters with a total of 46 participants (31.9%) gaining ≥15 letters. Change in median CRT was -81.5  μ m. Younger age, lower baseline VA score, shorter duration of neovascular AMD, and TT genotype in rs10490924 were significantly associated with greater VA score improvement (P = 0.028, P < 0.001, P = 0.02, and P = 0.039, resp.). Lower baseline VA score and TT genotype in rs10490924 were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of gaining ≥15 letters (P = 0.028, and P = 0.021, resp.). Conclusions. Baseline VA and genotype of rs10490924 were both important predictors for visual response to bevacizumab at 6 months. This trial is registered with the Registration no. NCT01306591."

CD005139,0,19199897,0,Intravitreal bevacizumab for diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the major threat to sight in the working age population. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of DR that produces loss of central vision. Macular edema within 1 disk diameter of the fovea is present in 9% of the diabetic population. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a major cause of visual loss in diabetic patients. In PDR, the growth of new vessels from the retina or optic nerve, is thought to occur as a result of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release into the vitreous cavity as a response to ischemia. Furthermore, VEGF increases vessel permeability leading to deposition of proteins in the interstitium that facilitate the process of angiogenesis and macular edema. This review demonstrates multiple benefits of intravitreal bevacizumab on DR including DME and PDR. The results indicate that intravitreal bevacizumab injections may have a beneficial effect on macular thickness and visual acuity (VA), independent of the type of macular edema that is present. Therefore, in the future this new treatment modality could replace or complement focal/grid laser photocoagulation in DME.

The off-label, intravitreal use of ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) has provided clinicians with an additional cost-effective drug. The commercial preparation of ziv-aflibercept contains the same aflibercept (VEGF-trap) molecule as Eylea but has a much higher osmolarity (1000 mOsm/kg vs 300 mOsm/kg). Initial concerns regarding cytotoxicity and long-term safety of intravitreal ziv-aflibercept have been largely negated after a series of publications failed to identify adverse ocular and systemic side effects. Both treatment-naive and anti-VEGF‒resistant cases of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) may respond as well to ziv-aflibercept as to aflibercept. A higher dose of ziv-aflibercept (2 mg in 0.08 mL) does not cause any adverse effects during short-term follow-up period (1 month). Data from various sources suggest that ziv-aflibercept may be as cost effective as bevacizumab, thereby making it an attractive treatment option in low- and middle-income countries.

CD005139,0,17712362,0,Antiangiogenic therapy for normalization of atherosclerotic plaque vasculature: a potential strategy for plaque stabilization.,"Angiogenesis within human atherosclerotic plaques has an important role in plaque progression as immature blood vessels leak red blood cells and inflammatory mediators into the plaque center. Accumulation of free cholesterol from red blood cell membranes potentially increases the size of the necrotic core and triggers a chain of events that promote plaque destabilization. Antiangiogenic agents have been shown to prune some tumor vessels and 'normalize' the structure and function of the remaining vasculature, thereby improving the access of chemotherapeutic agents to tumors. We propose that antiangiogenic therapy can similarly stabilize vulnerable 'rupture-prone' plaques by pruning and normalizing immature intraplaque vessels, preventing further intraplaque hemorrhage. This normalization would limit necrotic core enlargement, further luminal narrowing and the degree of inflammation. Such normalization has been realized using vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists for the treatment of cancer and age-related macular degeneration. The development of this novel approach to prevent plaque progression might add to the armamentarium of preventive measures for acute myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden cardiac death."

However, only few studies evaluate the safety of intravitreal bevacizumab injections in regard to retinal photoreceptor function. We evaluated retinal function after repeated (2-3) monthly injections of bevacizumab in a prospective case series of 10 patients with various retinal diseases. Study endpoints were visual acuity (VA) using ETDRS charts and 3 full-field electroretinography sessions with a flash intensity range of 0.0005-2 cds/m(2). V-log-I b-wave amplitudes were fitted by a Naka-Rushton model. No significant changes in scotopic or photopic ERG measures were observed between baseline ERG and last follow-up ERG. Individual patients showed transient alterations of ERG measures on the first follow-up visit. Mean visual acuity was stable over the time course of the study (logMAR = 0.42 at baseline and logMAR = 0.48 at last follow-up). In conclusion, three monthly repeated injections of bevacizumab do not affect mid-term electrophysiological retinal function. Transient alterations in ERG readings of individual patients 1 week after intravitreal bevacizumab injection may be attributed to short-term disruption of the retinal equilibrium through the trauma of injection. Evaluation of patients receiving more than three injections of anti-VEGF substances should be the focus of future studies."

For this reason, some patients with macular ischaemia were excluded from studies showing the effectiveness of therapy. A considerable number of patients present with mixed pathology of macular oedema and macular ischaemia and it is often impossible to determine the degree to which ischaemia accounts for decreased vision. In this review, the authors have dealt with the specific question of whether or not there is evidence to support potential worsening of the macular perfusion and visual function after anti-VEGF treatment with bevacizumab or ranibizumab for macular oedema secondary to diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusions, especially if there is coexisting macular ischaemia. The authors conclude that anti-VEGF therapy rarely seems to further compromise the retinal circulation; however, worsening of macular ischaemia in the long term cannot be definitely excluded, particularly in eyes with significant ischaemia at baseline and after repeated intraocular anti-VEGF injections. The decision to offer prolonged anti-VEGF treatment in cases of significant coexisting macular ischaemia should not be based only on measurements of macular thickness; instead repeat fluorescein angiograms should be performed."

CD005139,0,25190312,0,"[Review and expert opinion in age related macular degeneration. Focus on the pathophysiology, angiogenesis and pharmacological and clinical data].","Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a pathological aging of the macula, brought about by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. It induces geographic atrophy of the retina and/or choroidal neovascularization. In the latter, abnormal vessels develop from the choriocapillaris, with the involvement of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). The VEGF family includes several factors, including VEGF-A, B, C, D, F and PlGF (placental growth factor). Their biological properties and their affinities to the VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 receptors found on endothelial cells differ. Exudative AMD involves mainly VEGF-A and VEGF-R2. Anti-VEGF agents used in ophthalmology (ranibizumab, bevacizumab and aflibercept) are designed to primarily target this pathway. In vitro, all have sufficient affinity to their ligands. Their therapeutic efficacy must therefore be judged based on clinical criteria. In clinical practice, the minimum number of injections required for a satisfactory result appears to be comparable with all the three. The few available studies on therapeutic substitutions of anti-VEGF compounds suggest that some patients may benefit from substituting the anti-VEGF in cases of an unsatisfactory response to an initial molecule. Although local side effects, including increased risk of geographic atrophy, and systemic effects, including vascular accidents, have been suggested, these risks remain low, specially compared to the benefits of the treatment. Differences in safety between anti-VEGF are theoretically possible but unproven."

The early promise of monotherapy with the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide has yet to be borne out in larger clinical trials, but outcomes may be improved when it is used in combination with verteporfin therapy. The angiostatic cortisone anecortave acetate was recently reported to have failed to meet the primary efficacy criterion in two large, placebo-controlled trials, and its clinical utility is uncertain. Other potential treatments with varying mechanisms of action are currently under investigation. To date, no agent has been shown to significantly restore lost vision in patients with AMD.

Fifteen eyes of 11 patients with clinically significant macular edema were retrospectively divided into either the control group (only DME) or the experimental group (DME and VMIA) based on optical coherence tomography images. We defined VMIA patterns as epiretinal membrane and/or anomalous vitreomacular adhesion. Changes in central macular thickness (CMT), total macular volume (TMV), and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from the baseline to post third injection were compared between the two groups. After the third injection, the decreases in CMT and TMV were not statistically different between the two groups. The improvement in BCVA was larger in the control group (0.1742 ± 0.0508 logMAR) than in the experimental group (0.0766 ± 0.0562 logMAR; p < 0.01). Our study showed that after the third anti-VEGF injection, the BCVA of patients with both DME and VMIAs improved significantly less than that of patients with only DME.

CD005139,0,16316706,0,Regulatory aspects of drug approval for macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries with approximately 15 million people with the disease in the United States. AMD is characterized as a progressive degenerative disease of the macula. There are two forms of AMD: neovascular and non-neovascular. The non-neovascular form of AMD is more common and leads to a slow deterioration of the macula with a gradual loss of vision over a period of years. The neovascular form of the disease is responsible for the majority of cases of severe vision loss and is due to proliferation of abnormal blood vessels behind the retina. These blood vessels leak blood and fluid into the retina, which results in visual abnormalities. The development of these abnormal blood vessels is due in part to the activity of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and its inhibition is expected to impact on the onset and/or severity of vision loss associated with the proliferation of abnormal blood vessels. Age-related macular degeneration is an underserved treatment population. Visudyne (verteporfin for injection), Novartis Ophthalmics, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia or presumed ocular histoplasmosis. Pegaptanib sodium (Macugen, Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc.) is indicated for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration. This article will review the approval pathway for these two products and that required of future products indicated for macular degeneration."

CD005139,0,27286558,0,PLGA Microparticles Entrapping Chitosan-Based Nanoparticles for the Ocular Delivery of Ranibizumab.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of certified vision loss worldwide. The standard treatment for neovascular AMD involves repeated intravitreal injections of therapeutic proteins directed against vascular endothelial growth factor, such as ranibizumab. Biodegradable polymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), form delivery vehicles which can be used to treat posterior segment eye diseases, but suffer from poor protein loading and release. This work describes a ""system-within-system"", PLGA microparticles incorporating chitosan-based nanoparticles, for improved loading and sustained intravitreal delivery of ranibizumab. Chitosan-N-acetyl-l-cysteine (CNAC) was synthesized and its synthesis confirmed using FT-IR and (1)H NMR. Chitosan-based nanoparticles composed of CNAC, CNAC/tripolyphosphate (CNAC/TPP), chitosan, chitosan/TPP (chit/TPP), or chit/TPP-hyaluronic acid (chit/TPP-HA) were incorporated in PLGA microparticles using a modified w/o/w double emulsion method. Nanoparticles and final nanoparticles-within-microparticles were characterized for their protein-nanoparticle interaction, size, zeta potential, morphology, protein loading, stability, in vitro release, in vivo antiangiogenic activity, and effects on cell viability. The prepared nanoparticles were 17-350 nm in size and had zeta potentials of -1.4 to +12 mV. Microscopic imaging revealed spherical nanoparticles on the surface of PLGA microparticles for preparations containing chit/TPP, CNAC, and CNAC/TPP. Ranibizumab entrapment efficiency in the preparations varied between 13 and 69% and was highest for the PLGA microparticles containing CNAC nanoparticles. This preparation also showed the slowest release with no initial burst release compared to all other preparations. Incorporation of TPP to this formulation increased the rate of protein release and reduced entrapment efficiency. PLGA microparticles containing chit/TPP-HA showed the fastest and near-complete release of ranibizumab. All of the prepared empty particles showed no effect on cell viability up to a concentration of 12.5 mg/mL. Ranibizumab released from all preparations maintained its structural integrity and in vitro activity. The chit/TPP-HA preparation enhanced antiangiogenic activity and may provide a potential biocompatible platform for enhanced antiangiogenic activity in combination with ranibizumab. In conclusion, the PLGA microparticles containing CNAC nanoparticles showed significantly improved ranibizumab loading and release profile. This novel drug delivery system may have potential for improved intravitreal delivery of therapeutic proteins, thereby reducing the frequency, risk, and cost of burdensome intravitreal injections."
CD005139,0,26039355,0,Treatment Satisfaction and Well-Being in Patients with Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization Treated with Ranibizumab in the REPAIR Study.,"The Ranibizumab for the Treatment of Choroidal Neovascularisation (CNV) Secondary to Pathological Myopia (PM): an Individualized Regimen (REPAIR) trial was a prospective study exploring the efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg using an individualized treatment regimen over 12 months. The current study investigated the impact of treatment with ranibizumab as needed (pro re nata [PRN]) on individuals with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in the REPAIR study, using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for treatment satisfaction and well-being. This study included 65 adults with mCNV and a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of 24-78 in the study eye. Patients completed the Macular Disease Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (MacTSQ) at months 1, 6 and 12, and the 12-item Well-Being Questionnaire (W-BQ12) at baseline and months 1, 6 and 12. Subgroup analyses investigated the relationship between PROM scores and treatment in the better- or worse-seeing eye (BSE/WSE), number of injections received, baseline BCVA, BCVA improvement and age. Pearson correlations between change in BCVA, MacTSQ scores and W-BQ12 scores were calculated. The main outcome measures were treatment satisfaction measured with the MacTSQ (score 0-72) and well-being measured with the W-BQ12 (score 0-36). Treatment satisfaction significantly increased over the study period (p = 0.0001). Mean MacTSQ scores increased by 9.7 and 10.0 in patients treated in their WSE and BSE, respectively. Treatment satisfaction was highest in individuals receiving only one injection at month 1; however, by month 12, scores were similar across injection subgroups. Patients aged 68 years or older had the highest MacTSQ scores. Well-being scores also significantly increased over the study period (p = 0.03). Mean W-BQ12 scores increased by 1.7 in patients treated in their WSE and by 2.1 in patients treated in their BSE. Individuals aged 40 years or younger had the greatest increases in general well-being. Patients who experienced stable or improved BCVA at month 12 had greater increases in W-BQ12 scores than those who experienced a decrease. Correlations between BCVA, MacTSQ scores and W-BQ12 scores were largely non-significant. In conclusion, treatment satisfaction and well-being increased during treatment with ranibizumab PRN. Although directly comparable data are limited for the MacTSQ and W-BQ12 in mCNV, these results complement PROM outcomes reported in related studies."

CD005139,0,18362932,0,Ranibizumab for macular edema due to retinal vein occlusions: implication of VEGF as a critical stimulator.,"Macular edema is a major cause of vision loss in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). It is not clear how much of the edema is due to hydrodynamic changes from the obstruction and how much is due to chemical mediators. Patients with macular edema due to CRVO (n = 20) or BRVO (n = 20) were randomized to receive three monthly injections of 0.3 or 0.5 mg of ranibizumab. At the primary endpoint, month 3, the median improvement in letters read at 4 m was 17 in the 0.3-mg group and 14 in the 0.5-mg group for CRVO, and 10 and 18, respectively for the BRVO group. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed that compared to injections of 0.3 mg, injections of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab tended to cause more rapid reductions of central retinal thickening that lasted longer between injections, but in 3 months, excess central retinal thickening which is a quantitative assessment of the macular edema, was reduced by approximately 90% in all four treatment groups. There was no correlation between the amount of improvement and duration of disease or patient age at baseline, but there was some correlation between the aqueous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level at baseline and amount of improvement. These data indicate that excess production of VEGF in the retinas of patients with CRVO or BRVO is a major contributor to macular edema and suggest that additional studies investigating the efficacy of intraocular injections of ranibizumab are needed."
CD005139,0,20408078,0,[Treatment of wet AMD with less than 12 injections of Ranibizumab per year].,"Treatment of acute wet AMD with Ranibizumab effectively stabilizes and improves visual function on a long-term follow-up basis. At present, one of the most important topics of scientific discussion is whether the functional gain in these patients can be achieved and maintained with less than 12 intravitreal injections of Ranibizumab per year. The data available so far is reviewed in this analysis. The present status can be summarized as follows: 1) It seems evident that monthly injections during the first 12 months are functionally more effective than approaches with a reduced number of treatments; 2) the gain obtained during the first three months of Ranibizumab treatment is partially lost towards the end of the year under reduced treatment frequencies; 3) fixed regimens of quarterly injections do not provide any advantage compared to individually indicated re-injections; 4) a trend towards low functional efficacy can be recognised when less than 5 treatments per year are applied; 5) individual loading at the beginning of the treatment does not provide any advantages compared to a fixed loading regimen of 3 injections."

CD005139,0,25993998,0,Identification of a Dual Inhibitor of SRPK1 and CK2 That Attenuates Pathological Angiogenesis of Macular Degeneration in Mice.,"Excessive angiogenesis contributes to numerous diseases, including cancer and blinding retinopathy. Antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been approved and are widely used in clinical treatment. Our previous studies using SRPIN340, a small molecule inhibitor of SRPK1 (serine-arginine protein kinase 1), demonstrated that SRPK1 is a potential target for the development of antiangiogenic drugs. In this study, we solved the structure of SRPK1 bound to SRPIN340 by X-ray crystallography. Using pharmacophore docking models followed by in vitro kinase assays, we screened a large-scale chemical library, and thus identified a new inhibitor of SRPK1. This inhibitor, SRPIN803, prevented VEGF production more effectively than SRPIN340 owing to the dual inhibition of SRPK1 and CK2 (casein kinase 2). In a mouse model of age-related macular degeneration, topical administration of eye ointment containing SRPIN803 significantly inhibited choroidal neovascularization, suggesting a clinical potential of SRPIN803 as a topical ointment for ocular neovascularization. Thus SRPIN803 merits further investigation as a novel inhibitor of VEGF."
CD005139,0,15994945,0,Antibody against junctional adhesion molecule-C inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth.,"The junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) was recently described as an adhesion molecule localized at interendothelial contacts and involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration. The protein JAM-C interacts with polarity complex molecules and regulates the activity of the small GTPase Cdc42. The angiogenesis process involves rearrangement of endothelial junctions and implicates modulation of cell polarity. We tested whether JAM-C plays a role in angiogenesis using tumor grafts and hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody directed against JAM-C reduces tumor growth and infiltration of macrophages into tumors. The antibody decreases angiogenesis in the model of hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization in vivo and vessel outgrowth from aortic rings in vitro. Importantly, the antibody does not induce pathologic side effects in vivo. These findings show for the first time a role for JAM-C in angiogenesis and define JAM-C as a valuable target for antitumor therapies."

CD005139,0,27918469,0,Dietary Compound Chrysin Inhibits Retinal Neovascularization with Abnormal Capillaries in db/db Mice.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) develops in a significant proportion of patients with chronic diabetes, characterized by retinal macular edema and abnormal retinal vessel outgrowth leading to vision loss. Chrysin, a naturally-occurring flavonoid found in herb and honeycomb, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. This study sought to determine the protective effects of chrysin on retinal neovascularization with abnormal vessels and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown in 33 mM glucose-exposed human retinal endothelial cells and in db/db mouse eyes. High glucose caused retinal endothelial apoptotic injury, which was inhibited by submicromolar chrysin. This compound diminished the enhanced induction of HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in high glucose-exposed retinal endothelial cells. Consistently, oral administration of 10 mg/kg chrysin reduced the induction of these proteins in db/db mouse eye tissues. In addition, chrysin restored the decrement of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 junction proteins and PECAM-1 in hyperglycemia-stimulated retinal endothelial cells and diabetic mouse retina, possibly maintaining tight cell-cell interactions of endothelial cells and pericytes. Anti-apoptotic chrysin reduced the up-regulation of Ang-1, Ang-2, and Tie-2 crucial to retinal capillary occlusion and BRB permeability. Furthermore, orally treating chrysin inhibited acellular capillary formation, neovascularization, and vascular leakage observed in diabetic retinas. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, that chrysin had a capability to encumber diabetes-associated retinal neovascularization with microvascular abnormalities and BRB breakdown."

CD005139,0,21295897,0,Systemic and kidney toxicity of intraocular administration of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors.,"Intravenous injection of angiogenesis-inhibitor drugs is used widely to treat cancers. Associated renal complications primarily involve proteinuria and hypertension, and thrombotic microangiopathies also have been described. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy currently is used by ophthalmologists to treat neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration. However, there is some evidence that intravitreal anti-VEGF injections may result in systemic absorption, with the potential for injury in organs that are reliant on VEGF, such as the kidney. We report the first case to our knowledge of a patient who developed an acute decrease in kidney function, nonimmune microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes, and thrombocytopenia after 4 intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy specimen showed segmental duplications of glomerular basement membranes with endothelial swelling and several recanalized arteriolar thrombi. Because of the increasing use of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, ophthalmologists and nephrologists should be aware of the associated risk of kidney disease.

Because of the complications associated with repeated intra-vitreal injections, there is considerable interest in developing a sustained delivery system. The purpose of this study was to examine the stability of both therapeutic proteins under physiological conditions as well as when incorporated into drug delivery systems (DDS). First, thermotropic properties in physiological conditions and at different pH values were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the protein denaturation temperature. Second, the effects of pH and incubation time on conformational changes and aggregation were evaluated by circular dichroism (CD), steady-state tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Also, the ability of both proteins to bind to VEGF was tested in the aforementioned experimental conditions for up to 30 days. Finally, we investigated the stability of both proteins after a rapid screening method that simulates the first homogenizing step during the protein microencapsulation process. This method allowed the development of stable ranibizumab and aflibercept formulations that may be useful to entrap these proteins into microparticles selecting the most convenient organic solvent and protein stabilizers."

It binds to the receptor-binding site of active forms of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, inhibiting its biological activity. In two large, well designed, phase III trials in patients with macular oedema following branch RVO (BRVO) or central RVO (CRVO), monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.5 mg were associated with significantly greater improvement from baseline in mean best-corrected visual acuity letter score (measured on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart) in the study eye at 6 months (primary endpoint) than sham injections. Moreover, ranibizumab was significantly more effective than sham injections with regard to improvements in central foveal thickness at 6 months, as well as several other visual acuity measures. Ranibizumab was generally well tolerated in patients with macular oedema following CRVO or BRVO. Overall, the most common adverse events with ranibizumab were consistent with the adverse event profile previously reported in patients with age-related macular degeneration."

CD005139,0,17531658,0,Elimination of neoangiogenesis for plaque stabilization: is there a role for local drug therapy?,"Emerging data suggest that intraplaque hemorrhage is critical in promoting atherosclerotic lesion instability. Because red blood cell membranes are a rich source of free cholesterol and accumulated red blood cells within plaques promote inflammation, intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with expansion of the necrotic core. Plaque hemorrhage results from the development of immature neointimal vasa vasorum. Therefore, it is proposed that molecular therapies designed to eliminate pathologic neovascularization within developing lesions will interrupt the process of hemorrhage and decrease the rate of necrotic core expansion. The elimination of intraplaque neovascularization would involve targeting of pre-existing and new vessel development. The concept of vascular regression has met some success in other neovascular-dependent diseases, including macular degeneration and malignancies. The efficacy of this novel approach is dependent on gaining critical knowledge of the environment required to support development and maturation of the vasa vasorum within varying plaque types. A multitargeted approach involving selective local antiangiogenic agents should contribute to prevention of plaque progression and its clinical consequences."

CD005139,0,26731212,0,Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Detecting Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to Choroidal Osteoma.,"Choroidal osteoma is an ossifying tumor that is found predominantly in the peripapillary and macular areas. It typically affects otherwise healthy females. Vision loss may occur secondary to the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Fluorescein angiography (FA) remains the gold standard for diagnosing CNV; however, the use of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) as an adjunct to FA is growing. In this report, a 16-year-old female with a large, unilateral peripapillary choroidal osteoma presented with blurred vision. Exam revealed scattered intraretinal hemorrhage, but FA was unable to detect CNV overlying the tumor. OCTA detected abnormal flow in the outer retina corresponding to a type 2 CNV. Following intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, the CNV regressed, the hemorrhage resolved, and there was less fluid. OCTA may be helpful in detecting CNV noninvasively in eyes in which FA is equivocal, such as those with choroidal osteoma."

Infectious agents associated with endophthalmitis following injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are typically Gram positive organisms with a predominance of Streptococcal and Staphylococcal microbiologic isolates. Patients with infectious endophthalmitis generally present within the first 72 hours following an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection with complaints of pain, redness, and decreased vision. Prompt treatment with a conventional endophthalmitis management approach may mitigate irreversible vision loss; however, poorer outcomes have been reported with more virulent organisms such as those associated with Streptococcal species. As the number of intravitreal injections performed each year continues to increase, ophthalmologists must maintain a rigorous approach to their injection technique and remain vigilant for the signs and symptoms of endophthalmitis."

Aflibercept has a significantly higher affinity for Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A compared with other monoclonal anti-VEGF antibodies. In addition to binding all VEGF-A isoforms, aflibercept also blocks other proangiogenic factors such as VEGF-B and placental growth factor. The VIEW 1 and 2 trials showed this drug achieves improved results in patients with exudative AMD similar to those obtained with monthly ranibizumab, using a bimonthly treatment regimen after a loading dose of three intravitreal injections, which translates to less use of healthcare resources. There is a subgroup of patients that present with persistent fluid after the loading dose that could benefit from monthly injections or personalized proactive treatment after the first year. In the second year of treatment, the Treat and Extend patterns can permit even more lengthening of the time between injections. More data are needed to confirm the optimal monitoring and retreatment dosing, to maintain long-term efficacy. Other preliminary data suggest that patients that do not respond to other anti-angiogenics and patients with special pathologies such as polypoidal choroidopathy or retinal angiomatous proliferation can improve upon switching to aflibercept. To date, the safety profile of aflibercept is excellent and is comparable to other anti-angiogenic treatments."

Neovascular AMD is a type of advanced AMD that is characterized by pathologic proliferation and leakage of abnormal blood vessels in the eye. While the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD is not completely known, one of the important milestones in neovascular AMD research was the identification of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a major stimulus of abnormal angiogenesis that can be targeted for intravitreal treatment. Anti-VEGF therapies that neutralize or block the induction of angiogenesis by VEGF have recently revolutionized the therapeutic approach to neovascular AMD. The scientific literature regarding the efficacy and safety of anti-VEGF treatment has been hugely enriched with results from various recent randomized clinical trials involving the three most commonly utilized anti-VEGF pharmacologic agents--ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept.

Ophthalmologists are using intra-ocular injections of Avastin (off-label) to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The off-label use of Avastin is controversial because there are anti-VEGF drugs on the market, authorized for AMD, such as Lucentis. Lucentis is however extremely expensive and costs approximately 50 times more than Avastin. Ophthalmologists did not have the backing of randomized controlled trials, or the blessing of the manufacturer of Avastin. In May 2011 the results from the first year of the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT), a large, randomized clinical trial comparing Lucentis and Avastin, were released. The two-year results were published in April 2012. Respecting efficacy, the results of the drugs were the same. The study was not statistically powerful enough to identify meaningful differences in systemic drug-related adverse events and long-term safety.

Prospective study included 36 patients (36 eyes) with ""wet' form of ARMD. All patients were over 60 year old (22 female, 14 male). Changes of macula included minimally classic CNV (choroidal neovascularisation) (24), occult subfoveal CNV (10) and first stage of cicatrial CNV (2). Bevacizumab 1.25 mg was administered intravitreally through pars plana using a 27-gauge needle. Patients had no previous eye treatment. Ophthalmic exam before and after the treatment included: Snellen VA (visual acuity) and examination including measurement of IOP (intraocular pressure), FA (fluorescein angiography) and interview with patients. After 4-6 weeks 28 (78%) patients had significant improvement of VA. Median VA improved from 0.083 to 0.200 (p<0.01). Eight patients (22%) had no significant improvement in VA but three of them reported to see more light. FA showed complete resolution of macular edema in 6 patients (17%), partially resolved in 23 patients (64%) and no change in 7 patients (19%). No systemic side-effect was found.

CD005139,0,20939800,0,Triamcinolone and intraocular sustained-release delivery systems in diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) still represents one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide. Since this condition affects the posterior segment of the eye, topical application of ophthalmic medicines is of limited benefit, considering that they seldom reach therapeutic levels in the affected tissues. Systemic medications can be insufficient due to the eye's immunoprivileged condition and existence of both inner and outer blood-retinal barriers, which place limitations on the potential role of this route of administration for retinal diseases. In this setting, intraocular therapies have emerged as novel and vital tools in the ophthalmologist's armamentarium against DR, allowing for maximization of drug efficacy and limited risk of systemic side effects. Intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide have been widely used for treating DR particularly in the 21(st) century. Other agents targeting molecules, such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, have also demonstrated a potential therapeutic role for treatment. Recent advances in ocular drug delivery methods have led to the development of intraocular implants, which help to provide prolonged treatment with controlled drug release. Moreover, they may add some potential advantages over traditional intraocular injections by delivering certain rates of drug directly to the site of action, amplifying the drug's half-life, contributing in the minimization of peak plasma levels of the drug, and avoiding the side effects associated with repeated intravitreal injections."

CD005139,0,21999177,0,Aflibercept (VEGF-TRAP): the next anti-VEGF drug.,"The inflammatory cytokine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plays a central role in human growth and development, and vascular maintenance. VEGF mediated angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth, as well as exudative age-related macular degeneration, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, all of which are characterized by abnormal neovascularization. Ischemia and inflammation also lead to VEGF-mediated breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, which causes vision diminishing macular edema. To combat these effects, anti-VEGF drugs (antibodies, aptamers, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors) have been developed for both systemic and local (intraocular) use. The next drug to receive regulatory approval will probably be aflibercept (VEGF-Trap), a fusion protein with high VEGF affinity attributed to binding sequences from the native receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Aflibercept monotherapy significantly reduces tumor growth and extends survival in several orthotropic animal models, and has both prevented and reduced the growth of experimental choroidal neovascularization. Ongoing phase III trials are evaluating the effectiveness of aflibercept combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced carcinomas. The phase III VELOUR trial determined that patients receiving aflibercept with irinotecan/5-FU as second line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer experienced extended progression free survival and overall survival. Intravitreal aflibercept improved visual acuity in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration and was non-inferior to standard therapy (ranibizumab). Ongoing phase III trials are investigating the use of aflibercept for retinal vein occlusions and diabetic macular edema. A regulatory approval application for use in exudative macular degeneration has been filed, with a decision expected by late 2011."
CD005139,0,21307302,0,5-Lipoxygenase metabolite 4-HDHA is a mediator of the antiangiogenic effect of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.,"Lipid signaling is dysregulated in many diseases with vascular pathology, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and age-related macular degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that diets enriched in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) effectively reduce pathological retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, in part through metabolic products that suppress microglial-derived tumor necrosis factor-α. To better understand the protective effects of ω-3 PUFAs, we examined the relative importance of major lipid metabolic pathways and their products in contributing to this effect. ω-3 PUFA diets were fed to four lines of mice deficient in each key lipid-processing enzyme (cyclooxygenase 1 or 2, or lipoxygenase 5 or 12/15), retinopathy was induced by oxygen exposure; only loss of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) abrogated the protection against retinopathy of dietary ω-3 PUFAs. This protective effect was due to 5-LOX oxidation of the ω-3 PUFA lipid docosahexaenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (4-HDHA). 4-HDHA directly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), independent of 4-HDHA's anti-inflammatory effects. Our study suggests that ω-3 PUFAs may be profitably used as an alternative or supplement to current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for proliferative retinopathy and points to the therapeutic potential of ω-3 PUFAs and metabolites in other diseases of vasoproliferation. It also suggests that cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin and ibuprofen (but not lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton) might be used without losing the beneficial effect of dietary ω-3 PUFA."

CD005139,0,17655610,0,Guidance for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is becoming an increasing socio-medical problem as the proportion of the aged population is continuously increasing. However, new insights in the pathogenesis of the disease offer the opportunity to develop targeted therapies that attack the disease process more successfully than ever. This review article will focus on summarizing the actual options in the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration and provide a short overview about recent therapeutic options in clinical and preclinical evaluation. The recent development of anti-VEGF substances for use in clinical routine has markedly improved the prognosis of patients with neovascular AMD. Intravitreal treatment with substances targeting all isotypes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), for the first time in the history of AMD treatments, results in a significant increase in visual acuity in patients with neovascular AMD. Overall, antiangiogenic approaches provide vision maintenance in over 90% and substantial improvement in 25-40% of patients. The combination with occlusive therapies like photodynamic therapy (PDT) potentially offers a reduction of re-treatment frequency and long-term maintenance of the treatment benefit. Further developments interacting with various steps in the angiogenic cascade are under clinical or preclinical evaluation and may soon become available. Nevertheless, the growing number of novel therapeutic options will have to provide proof of concept in randomized controlled clinical trials, a major challenge in view of the rapidly evolving field. For those therapies, which are already in clinical use, reasonable diagnostic tools for follow-up need to be developed, as the burden of continuous clinical monitoring of all patients and all indications is significant for patients and doctors. Ultimately, economic issues will be the limiting factor for the clinical availability of different treatment options."
CD005139,0,24993325,0,"25th RCOphth Congress, President's Session paper: 25 years of progress in medical retina.","The quarter century since the foundation of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists has coincided with immense change in the subspecialty of medical retina, which has moved from being the province of a few dedicated enthusiasts to being an integral, core part of ophthalmology in every eye department. In age-related macular degeneration, there has been a move away from targeted, destructive laser therapy, dependent on fluorescein angiography to intravitreal injection therapy of anti-growth factor agents, largely guided by optical coherence tomography. As a result of these changes, ophthalmologists have witnessed a marked improvement in visual outcomes for their patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), while at the same time developing and enacting entirely novel ways of delivering care. In the field of diabetic retinopathy, this period also saw advances in laser technology and a move away from highly destructive laser photocoagulation treatment to gentler retinal laser treatments. The introduction of intravitreal therapies, both steroids and anti-growth factor agents, has further advanced the treatment of diabetic macular oedema. This era has also seen in the United Kingdom the introduction of a coordinated national diabetic retinopathy screening programme, which offers an increasing hope that the burden of blindness from diabetic eye disease can be lessened. Exciting future advances in retinal imaging, genetics, and pharmacology will allow us to further improve outcomes for our patients and for ophthalmologists specialising in medical retina, the future looks very exciting but increasingly busy."

Neovascular (wet) AMD accounts for 90% of the visual loss associated with the disorder and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to play a major role in neovascularization and vascular permeability, the major causes of visual loss in AMD, making it an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. To utilize this strategy, pegaptanib, an aptamer that specifically binds to and blocks VEGF165, the VEGF isoform primarily responsible for abnormal vascular growth and permeability in AMD, was developed. Following encouraging preclinical trials, clinical trials showed that pegaptanib stabilized vision and reduced the risk of severe visual loss in the majority of patients with AMD, with some patients showing visual improvement. Pegaptanib has maintained a good safety profile with only occasional adverse effects. Even greater success was achieved when pegaptanib was used in combination with another therapeutic strategy, such as photodynamic therapy or bevacizumab, a pan isoform VEGF inhibitor. Further investigation of pegaptanib for the therapy of wet AMD, particularly in combination with other modes of therapy, should be encouraged."

CD005139,0,26673555,0,Role of leukotrienes in diabetic retinopathy.,"The pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy is highly complex and encompasses the detrimental roles of numerous factors/mediators in inducing various molecular pathological alterations. Although the roles of many inflammatory mediators, involved in the progression of this complication, have been thoroughly researched and studied, the part played by leukotrienes remains widely neglected. This review focuses on leukotrienes-induced mediation and aggravation of the pathological pathways, such as inflammation, oxidative stress and retinal angiogenesis, responsible for exhibition of various characteristic events including leukostasis, macular edema, retinal neovascularization and vitreous hemorrhages, hence, marking the advent of diabetic retinopathy. Acknowledging these roles, it might be possible to potentially utilize leukotrienes antagonists for suppressing or reducing the intensity of the mentioned pathological alterations. Hence, leukotrienes antagonists may act as an effective adjuvant therapy either along with other developing novel therapies (such as anti-VEGF or anti-TNF-α therapy), or with the established conventional laser photocoagulation treatment, to provide additional symptomatic relief or, possibly prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy."

CD005139,0,19422962,0,Cardiovascular risk and antiangiogenic therapy for age-related macular degeneration.,"The neovascular form of the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes most cases of severe blindness. Because vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a leading role in this disorder, several inhibitors of this molecule are being used in its treatment. However, VEGF has important functions in vascular pathophysiology. It enhances the development of collateral vessels that may supply blood to areas whose arteries are severely affected by atherosclerotic lesions. Additionally, it may promote restoration of the damaged endothelium, a vessel layer that protects against the development of atherothrombosis, and it has hypotensive effects. In contrast, VEGF may stimulate the formation of microvessels inside the atherosclerotic plaque. These vessels may become disrupted and cause intraplaque hemorrhage, stimulating disease progression. VEGF also has a role in thrombus formation. The effects of anti-VEGF therapy may therefore compromise patient safety. When administered systemically to cancer patients, the main cardiovascular adverse effects of these compounds have been thrombosis, hemorrhage and hypertension. As patients with AMD constitute a high-risk population for cardiovascular events, the safety of new anti-VEGF therapies must be assessed. In this review we analyze the effects of VEGF on atherosclerosis and the cardiovascular safety of anti-VEGF therapies in AMD."

While the first pharmacologic treatment, verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) slowed disease progression, newer anti-vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have also shown vision improvement in many patients. Combination therapies (PDT + steroid + anti-VEGF) have shown some promise, particularly in certain classes of disease. Genetic studies have identified common gene variants in the complement factor H gene that confers susceptibility to AMD, and treatments targeting the complement pathway are being explored. Another area of research is directed at the components of Bruch membrane; studies of changes in the elastic fibers and collagen within Bruch may yield drug targets for prevention and halting of disease progression. Finally, studies in photoreceptor apoptosis have identified the role of cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 1β, associated with photoreceptor cell death and should be pursued as potential therapies to improve vision outcomes in neovascular AMD. Today's research into the biology of AMD will lead us to better treatment and perhaps even preventive measures in the decades ahead."

Most of the important vascular growth factors have been identified in the space of a few years, as well as factors responsible for the diferentiation of arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels. The role of angiogenesis in tumor growth, exsudative retinopathies and some inflammatory diseases has been established in animal models and in the clinical setting Angiogenesis is necessary for oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues. Hypoxia is a major determinant of angiogenesis. During adult life the vascular network is remarkably stable and there is no active angiogenesis. The endothelium is quiescent, except in some physiological circumstances such as the female reproductive cycle and muscular exercise The same molecular and cellular mechanisms as those that occur during embryonic angiogenesis are involved in physiological and pathological neoangiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role, and VEGF inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach to some tumoral and ocular diseases."

The purpose of this work is to describe the long-term functional and morphological outcome of patients treated with intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Retrospective case series of 16 eyes treated with bevacizumab and 19 eyes treated with ranibizumab. All patients received initially three intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml) or ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) every 4 weeks. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 7 months after the third injection. Complete ophthalmologic examination including best-corrected visual acuity (VA), optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and in selected cases, indocyanine green angiography was performed. Triple intravitreal injections resulted in improvement of VA in bevacizumab-treated as well as in ranibizumab-treated patients; logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) 0.84 before treatment and 0.67 at month 9, and logMAR 0.75 before treatment and 0.59 at month 9, respectively. Central macular thickness (CMT) in the bevacizumab group improved from 363.67 ± 47.4 μm at baseline to 328 ± 49.77 μm at month 6 (p = 0.03) and 301 ± 129.69 at month 9 (p = 0.35). CMT in the ranibizumab group improved from 545.62 ± 167.39 μm at baseline to 395.88 ± 169.37 μm at month 6 and 411.83 ± 212.41 μm at month 9 (p = 0.03, p = 0.05, respectively). Patients with RAP might benefit from both intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab treatments with stabilization of VA over a longer period of time.

The OCT and FAG showed classic CNV. After one IVR, the visual acuity improved to 20/40 and the central foveal thickness was decreased. Visual acuity, FAG, ICG, OCT, serologic tests, and occurrence of ocular or systemic adverse events during follow-up were evaluated.

In this review we have analyzed the results of case series with at least 20 patients and a follow-up of ≥ 12 months. 18 case series were identified in Medline meeting these demands. The mean gain of visual acuity after 12 months was 2.2 ± 0.7 (mean ± 1 standard deviation, case number weighted: 2.0) lines with a mean of 3.0 ± 1.7 injections (case number weighted 2.7). There was no significant difference between bevacizumab and ranibizumab. The mean gain of visual acuity in the first year could be stabilized in the second year with a visual acuity of a mean of 2.2 ± 1.0 lines at the end of follow-up.

Ranibizumab (Lucentis) and VEGF-Trap (aflibercept) represent two different approaches to inhibiting angiogenesis by targeting VEGF family signaling. The former is a relatively short monoclonal antibody fragment, which binds VEGF-A on the basis of antigen recognition by the variable region of an antibody, while aflibercept is not an monoclonal antibody, but a decoy receptor, binding VEGF-A on the basis of the molecular interaction between the ligand (VEGF) and its cognate cellular receptor (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2). VEGF-Trap has therefore a broader specificity, recognizing and binding VEGF-B and PIGF in addition to VEGF-A, following the specificity of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. This broader specificity is considered as beneficial in cancer treatment and could be also beneficial in treatment of nAMD, this claim should, however, be backed by clinical studies. The presence of an Fc fragment in VEGF-Trap is also an important difference; even though this fragment does not participate in the recognition of the target molecule, it can influence the biological properties of the fusion protein. The relative merits of both approaches will become clear only after long-term laboratory and clinical testing, as their biological activity is also likely to differ. Given the clear differences in the mechanism of target molecule recognition, biochemical and biophysical properties (including molecular weight) and specificity, they cannot be considered as equivalent, unless extensive long-term clinical studies prove otherwise."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the main causes of deterioration of vision in adults in developed countries This review deals with resveratrol and ophthalmology by focusing on the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic effects of this molecule. The literature reports that resveratrol is able to act on various cell types of the eye by increasing the level of natural antioxidant enzymatic and molecular defenses. Resveratrol anti-inflammatory effects are due to its capacity to limit the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukins and prostaglandins, and also to decrease the chemo-attraction and recruitment of immune cells to the inflammatory site. In addition to this, resveratrol was shown to possess anti-VEGF effects and to inhibit the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells.

CD005139,0,27434329,0,Current advances in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of permanent central visual acuity loss in persons over 65 years of age in industrialized nations. Today, intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment worldwide. Areas covered: The following review covers the current treatments and challenges of wet AMD management. It also covers emerging therapies including radiation, latest generation anti-VEGF agents, and combination therapies. Expert opinion: Current neovascular AMD therapy is aimed at decreasing the VEGF effect at the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) complex. The most important existing challenges in the treatment of neovascular AMD are improving visual outcomes, decreasing the treatment burden, and minimizing geographic atrophy. Clinicians are using many treatment strategies to minimize intravitreal injections without sacrificing visual outcomes. Combination of anti-VEGF therapy with other previously available treatments that target a different pathophysiological mechanism may be a reasonable clinical strategy to minimize intravitreal injections. Many exciting novel drugs that target newly discovered pathways associated with CNV development and progression hold clinical promise. The results of ongoing randomized clinical trials will answer the important concerns surrounding new drugs and delivery devices: safety and visual outcomes."

Retinal vein occlusions are classified as either branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), or hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO) based on the specific occlusion site. The most common cause of decreased vision in patients afflicted with BRVO is the accumulation of fluid within the macula (macular edema). The Branch Vein Occlusion Study (BVOS) demonstrated the efficacy of grid laser photocoagulation in the treatment of BRVO-related macular edema. After publication of that report, grid laser became the standard of care for decreased vision due to BRVO-associated macular edema in patients similar to those enrolled in the BVOS. However, several recent major randomized, controlled clinical trials have investigated new therapeutic modalities for the treatment of decreased vision due to macular edema secondary to BRVO. This article aims to provide insight into current evidence-based approaches to management of macular edema secondary to BRVO.

Here we investigated whether the genotype of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) gene is associated with response to anti-VEGF therapy. 223 eyes with neovascular AMD were treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Responders were defined as patients who had an improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of at least 5 letters or one line on the EDTRS visual acuity chart along with resolution of intraretinal or subretinal fluid over 12 months. Patients who did not meet the definition of responders were classified as poor-responders. The vision of responders (n = 148) improved while the vision of poor-responders (n = 75) worsened (P<0.001). Responders on average had a decrease in central foveal thickness (CFT), while poor-responders had an increase in CFT (P <0.001). Compared with the responder group, the poor-responder group had a higher frequency of the risk (T) allele (Allelic P = 0.019) and TT genotype (P = 0.002 under a recessive model) for the VEGFA-rs943080 polymorphism. VEGFA expression was 1.8-fold higher in cells with the VEGFA rs943080 TT genotype than in cells with the VEGFA rs943080 CC genotype (P = 0.012). Age, gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension did not play a significant role in treatment response, but BMI was found to be significantly different between responders and poorresponders (P = 0.033).

A 39-year-old female patient with CNV secondary to AS had bilateral persistent intraretinal and subretinal fluid on the optical coherence tomography despite prior intravitreal 0.5 mg ranibizumab injections. The therapy was switched to intravitreal injection of aflibercept. The patient received a loading dose of three intravitreal 2 mg aflibercept injections at 4-week intervals for both eyes. Morphological and functional effects were observed as early as 1-week after the first injection. After the third aflibercept injection, her visual acuity improved, intraretinal and subretinal fluid resolved, and central macular thickness reduced in both eyes. This is an early, but encouraging and promising result indicating that aflibercept might be a good alternative management for CNV secondary to AS that is insufficiently responding to prior ranibizumab injections."

Ranibizumab has been shown to be effective in treatment of DMO in studies based on mainly Caucasian populations. This study reports the 12-month outcome in a cohort of South Asian subjects with DMO treated with ranibizumab.MethodsDMO in 51 eyes of 41 South Asian patients was treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg according to the modified DRCRnet protocol I. Visual acuity (VA) and central macular thickness (CMT) were recorded at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Results were compared for eyes with different baseline visual acuities and different baseline macular thicknesses.RESULTS Over the 12-month period, the mean ETDRS VA increased from 55.3±13.4 letters to 63.8±15.2 letters for all eyes. At 12 months, 70.6% eyes gained 5 or more letters acuity and 17.6% eyes gained 15 letters or more. During the same period, the mean CMT decreased from 532±129 to 318±136 μm. Eyes that had received previous laser treatments had a mean letter gain of 9.2 letters, compared with 8.5 for all eyes at 12 months.CONCLUSIONS Ranibizumab 0.5 mg is safe and effective at reversing vision loss due to DMO in patients of South Asian origin at 12 months. Ranibizumab treatment appears to be effective in patients with longstanding DMO who received prior laser treatments. Further studies are needed to define the long-term outcome in patients of different ethnicity and DMO."

CD005139,0,27636226,0,Doyne lecture 2016: intraocular health and the many faces of inflammation.,"Dogma for reasons of immune privilege including sequestration (sic) of ocular antigen, lack of lymphatic and immune competent cells in the vital tissues of the eye has long evaporated. Maintaining tissue and cellular health to preserve vision requires active immune responses to prevent damage and respond to danger. A priori the eye must contain immune competent cells, undergo immune surveillance to ensure homoeostasis as well as an ability to promote inflammation. By interrogating immune responses in non-infectious uveitis and compare with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), new concepts of intraocular immune health emerge. The role of macrophage polarisation in the two disorders is a tractable start. TNF-alpha regulation of macrophage responses in uveitis has a pivotal role, supported via experimental evidence and validated by recent trial data. Contrast this with the slow, insidious degeneration in atrophic AMD or in neovasular AMD, with the compelling genetic association with innate immunity and complement, highlights an ability to attenuate pathogenic immune responses and despite known inflammasome activation. Yolk sac-derived microglia maintains tissue immune health. The result of immune cell activation is environmentally dependent, for example, on retinal cell bioenergetics status, autophagy and oxidative stress, and alterations that skew interaction between macrophages and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). For example, dead RPE eliciting macrophage VEGF secretion but exogenous IL-4 liberates an anti-angiogenic macrophage sFLT-1 response. Impaired autophagy or oxidative stress drives inflammasome activation, increases cytotoxicity, and accentuation of neovascular responses, yet exogenous inflammasome-derived cytokines, such as IL-18 and IL-33, attenuate responses."

CD005139,0,20196722,0,Treatment of choroidal neovascularization in high myopia.,"High myopia affects approximately 2% of general population, and is a major cause of legal blindness in many developed countries. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the most common vision-threatening complication of high myopia. Different therapeutic approaches have been attempted such as thermal laser photocoagulation, surgery and photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT). The visual outcome of these therapies has been reported to be better than the natural history of the condition. However, the limited visual acuity improvement after PDT monotherapy and the appearance of subretinal fibrosis and chorioretinal atrophy prompted the association of other therapies. In the past few years a tremendous advance in the knowledge of the mechanisms underling CNV secondary to high myopia and age related macular degeneration has been achieved, leading to new therapeutic targets and novel drugs and combined therapies. These new therapeutic weapons have been designed to achieve a selective shut down of choroidal new vessels. Recent reviews have been published on the natural history and therapies for myopic CNV. Ohno-Matsui reported on the natural history of the condition as well as the outcome of laser photocoagulation, surgical extraction of CNV, foveal translocation and photodynamic therapy on myopic CNV in the short-term.

CD005139,0,17512238,0,Management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is becoming an increasing socio-medical problem as the proportion of the aged population is continuously increasing. However, new insights in the pathogenesis of the disease offer the opportunity to develop targeted therapies that attack the disease process more successfully than ever. This review article will focus on summarizing the actual options in the management of neovascular AMD and provide a short overview about recent therapeutic options in clinical and preclinical evaluation. The recent development of anti-VEGF substances for use in clinical routine has markedly improved the prognosis of patients with neovascular AMD. Intravitreal treatment with substances targeting all isotypes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), for the first time in the history of AMD treatments, results in a significant increase in visual acuity in patients with neovascular AMD. Overall, anti-angiogenic approaches provide vision maintenance in over 90% and substantial improvement in 25-40% of patients. The combination with occlusive therapies like photodynamic therapy (PDT) potentially offers a reduction of re-treatment frequency and long-term maintenance of the treatment benefit. Further developments interacting with various steps in the angiogenic cascade are under clinical or preclinical evaluation and may soon become available. Nevertheless, the growing number of novel therapeutic options will have to provide proof of concept in randomized controlled clinical trials, a major challenge in view of the rapidly evolving field. For those therapies, which are already in clinical use, reasonable diagnostic tools for follow-up need to be developed, as the burden of continuous clinical monitoring of all patients and all indications is significant for patients and doctors. Ultimately, economic issues will be the limiting factor for the clinical availability of different treatment options."

Intravitreal bevacizumab was injected in a patient with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. LSFG measures the relative velocity index of erythrocytes (mean blur rate) in a previously confirmed area, with neovascularization elsewhere (NVE), neovascularization of the disc (NVD), and without neovascularization. The authors compared mean blur rate before and after bevacizumab injection in each area. In LSFG images, regression of blood flow was observed at the area of neovascularization sequentially as the change of color pattern. Finally, decrease of the mean blur rate of an average 32.7% was observed in the NVE area. Similarly, a reduction of 31.9% of mean blur rate was observed in the NVD area. However, in the area of without neovascularization, reduction of mean blur rate was not observed. This suggested the useful possibility of measuring chorioretinal blood flow changes by drug intervention using LSFG analysis."

Using an angiogenesis assay in vitro, we detected the effects of CNMs on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and invasion. In addition, the expression levels of cytokines secreted from hypoxia-induced macrophages were assessed through cytokine array analysis. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factors-1α (HIF-1α), nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65), phospho-nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (phospho-NF-κB p65), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), phospho-p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and phospho-ERK1/2 was analyzed by western blotting. Activated macrophages were elicited through mineral oil lumbar injection, labeled with 1,19-dioctadecyl-3-3-39,39-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) and implanted into the corneal micro-pocket to induce CNV and to assess the antiangiogenic effect in rats. CNV was morphometrically analyzed using ImageJ software. Histopathological features were evaluated by immunofluorescence immunostaining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) on day 2 after surgery. In the present study, the results indicated that CNMs significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of HUVECs; remarkably attenuated the expression of VEGF, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1α, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 3, and MMP-9 protein; and downregulated ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, NF-κB activation, and HIF-1α expression in macrophages. The peritoneal cells elicited using mineral oil were highly purified macrophages, and the length and area of CNV were significantly decreased in the CNMs group compared with the control group. There was a significant reduction in the expression of VEGF and MMP-9 in activated macrophages and corneal tissue after pretreatment with CNMs in this model. In conclusion, CNMs potently suppressed macrophage-induced CNV via the inhibition of VEGF and MMP-9 expression. This effect might be mediated through attenuating macrophages via HIF-1α, MAPK, and NF-κB signaling pathways."

By intravitreal application of the drug, the dosage can be kept low while maximizing its effect on choroidal neovascularization and minimizing potential adverse systemic effects. However, the eye-blood barrier is often disrupted in ophthalmic neovascular disorders and the drugs can be detected in circulating blood despite being administered as an intraocular injection. As patients with AMD constitute a high-risk population for cardiovascular events, the safety of anti-VEGF therapies must be precisely and thoroughly assessed.

In patients with subfoveolar involvement, verteporfin photodynamic therapy slows the loss of visual acuity on the EDTRS scale in about 15% of patients after 2 years of follow-up. (2) Pegaptanib, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration. (3) Two double-blind placebo-controlled trials involved a total of 1208 patients. When pegaptanib was injected into the eye every 6 weeks, at a dose of 0.3 mg, visual loss measured one year after beginning treatment was slowed in about 15% more patients on pegaptanib than on placebo. Efficacy during the second year is uncertain. Pegaptanib has not been compared with other treatments, nor has it been assessed in combination with verteporfin. (4) A variety of ocular adverse events were reported during clinical trials, three of which were serious and each affected about 1% of patients: endophthalmia, retinal detachment, and cataracts. Transient ocular hypertension occurred in about 15% of patients. A few cases of retinal arterial and venous thrombosis have been described. No long-term adverse effects were reported after clinical trials, but hypersensitivity reactions were reported post-approval. (5) Treatment with pegaptanib involves an intraocular injection every 6 weeks under local anaesthesia and under conditions of surgical asepsis. (6) In practice, an indirect comparison suggests that intraocular pegaptanib is no more effective than verteporfin photodynamic therapy.

Given the high prevalence of AMD and retinal vascular diseases, anti-VEGF agents represent a large cost burden to the United States (US) healthcare system. Although ranibizumab and aflibercept are 30-fold more expensive per injection than bevacizumab, the two more costly medications are commonly used in the US, even though all three have been shown to be effective and safe for treatment of these retinal diseases. We investigated the availability and content of professional ophthalmic guidelines on cost consideration in the selection of anti-VEGF agents. We found that current professional guidelines were limited in availability and lacked specific guidance on cost-based anti-VEGF drug selection.

Rapamycin might therefore be a therapeutic option for CNV patients that do not respond sufficiently to the established anti-VEGF treatments."

CD005139,0,19112870,0,[Role of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME)].,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has recently been shown to be the most potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in the mammalian eye, suggesting that loss of PEDF is involved in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, a protective role for PEDF in pericyte loss requires elucidation. Present studies suggest that PEDF proteins could protect against advanced glycation end product (AGE), which induce injury in retinal pericytes. Substitution of PEDF proteins may be a promising strategy in the treatment of patients with early diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, injury of RPE is the basic condition, not only of the progress of neovascularization, but initiation of early diabetic microangiopathy and macular edema as well. Recently new intravitreal drugs being used in the treatment of eye diseases with increased level of VEGE. Intravitreally administered a human, monoclonal anti-VEGF agent acts only as symptomatic treatment. It does not eliminate hypoxia and requires repeated administration. It is worth emphasizing, that VEGF functions are not limited to active angiogenesis, but also seems to require the maintenance and differentiation of mature blood vessels, such as the choriocapillaris. Therefore, delivery of these anti-VEGF treatments needs to be specific to sites of neovascularization or limited to a short duration, to prevent disruption of the normal vasculature. The effective method, which preserves RPE, improves oxygenation and release traction on the macula, leading to decreased permeability with subsequent resolution in DME, is pars plana vitrectomy with ILM peeling. There are several investigations that support the theoretical value of vitrectomy for the treatment of DME. Intraoperative administration of anti-VEGF agent and corticosteroids may additionally improve results of operative treatment."

CD005139,0,28933517,0,New Treatment Modalities for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is considered one of the main causes of severe vision loss in older adults. The neovascular form (nAMD) is an advanced stage, which is responsible for the most severe vision loss. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is at present the main factor that leads to the development of a neovascular membrane and the increased leakage from the membrane to the retina. At present, anti-VEGF therapy is the only treatment that achieves vision gains in many patients and halts progression in most of them. VEGF blockade can be achieved with several molecules and various treatment regimens, which have been studied with excellent results. Unfortunately, real-world data has shown to be far less efficacious than clinical trials. This gap between clinical trials and real-world results is an unmet medical need that supports the necessity of new treatment modalities for nAMD. Of the various treatments being studied, anti-VEGFs of higher efficacy and longer durability are those more advanced in their development. Brolucizumab and abicipar pegol are 2 new anti-VEGF drugs that had positive results in phase 2 studies and are being tested in phase 3 trials at present. Other promising therapies are antiangiopoietin 2 molecules, which are in phase 2 development. At earlier stages of development but with promising results are squalamine, anti-VEGF-C and -D, and gene therapy. The future will give retina specialists a broad armamentarium with which patients may achieve high visual gains for the long term with a low treatment burden."

Genetic factors play a major role in this multifactorial and polygenic disease. Genomewide analysis identified two loci on 1q25-31 and 10q26 chromosomes associated with AMD, and association studies highlighted the implication of SNPs located in the complement H factor gene (CFH) on 1q25-31 and in PLEKHA1-HTRA1-LOC387715 on 10q26 in the disease. Homozygous carriers for the at-risk alleles of the CFH, HTRA1, and LOC387715 genes have an increased risk to develop exudative AMD with odds ratio of 6.2, 6.9, et 7.3 respectively. Moreover, other genes involved in the complement cascade, namely the genes of the C2, C3 component, and factor B, are associated to the disease. The SCARB1 gene has also recently been associated to AMD. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been performed in AMD patients and found that occult CNV are more often associated to CFH at-risk allele and classic CNV to HTRA1 at-risk allele.

Because renal function declines with age, pegaptanib exposure in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) may increase. Therefore, a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of pegaptanib was undertaken in Western and Asian AMD patients to determine the influence of renal function on apparent pegaptanib clearance (CL). Pegaptanib (0.3-3 mg per eye) was administered every 4 to 6 weeks to 262 AMD patients in 4 studies. Pegaptanib exposures (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] and maximum plasma concentration) after 8 doses were similar to exposures following the first dose, consistent with the absence of plasma accumulation. A 1-compartment model parameterized in terms of the absorption rate constant, apparent volume of distribution, and CL was used to describe the pegaptanib plasma concentration data. Creatinine clearance (CLCR), body weight (WT), and age influenced pegaptanib PK. Decreasing CLCR from 70 to 30 mL/min doubled AUC. After adjustment for CLCR, WT, and age, the model predicted no race differences in CL or AUC. Given that the therapeutic 0.3 mg per eye dose of pegaptanib results in exposures one-tenth of those observed following the well-tolerated 3-mg dose, these results suggest that no dose adjustment is warranted for AMD patients with moderate renal insufficiency (CLCR >30 mL/min)."

In contrast, bevacizumab was developed for the intravenous systemic treatment of colorectal cancer and is not formulated for intravitreal use, but is commonly used off-label in ophthalmology. European Union legislation permits the use of drugs outside the terms of their licence ('off-label') only under certain circumstances, such as during clinical trials, compassionate/named patient use in the absence of a licensed alternative, emergency scenarios (e.g., pandemics) or at the discretion of a treating physician. In such cases, patients should be fully informed regarding their treatment and any potential risks involved. Off-label drug use can be an important tool to provide patients with treatment in cases of unmet medical need.

CD005139,0,20887246,0,Clinical evidence of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in the management of age-related macular degeneration.,"Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is one of the first pharmacologic compounds evaluated for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The most important effects of TA consist in the stabilisation of the blood-retinal barrier and the down-regulation of inflammation. TA also has anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties. The peculiar characteristic of being well tolerated by ocular tissues and the capability to remain active for many months after a single intravitreal injection, make this drug a safe and effective alternative. In the past decade, intravitreal injection of TA (IVTA) has emerged as a useful treatment of several ocular diseases such as uveitis, macular edema secondary to retinal vasculature disease, neovascularisation and vitreoretinopathy. In this paper, we review all the available evidence of its use in AMD as mono-therapy or in combination with other treatments, and we discuss which role TA will play in the treatment of AMD in the future. The first experiences with IVTA as monotherapy for the treatment of exudative AMD reported a positive outcome in transiently reducing the leakage from CNV. However, in the long-term follow-up, IVTA as monotherapy had no effect on the risk of severe visual acuity loss, despite a significant anti-angiogenic effect found 3 months after the treatment. Consequently, studies using the combination of IVTA and photodynamic therapy (PDT), which acts synergistically, were performed. They reported to improve vision and to reduce the number of re-treatments with PDT. A large number of publications confirmed the positive synergic role of combining TA and PDT (therapies) for the treatment of all types of CNV: classic or predominantly classic, occult or minimally classic and RAP (Retinal Angiomatous Proliferation) lesions. The advantages registered with the use of IVTA plus PDT compared to PDT alone were partially limited by the side effects, such as the rapid evolution of cataract. Nevertheless, cataract surgery may stimulate the development of CNV (result in stimulating CNV). However, in large, randomized, clinical trials on combination therapy of TA and PDT, visual acuity failed to show an improvement, even though the lesion size and subretinal fluid had decreased, compared to controls treated with PDT alone. Some authors reported an increased risk of developing macular atrophy after the combination therapy with IVTA and PDT. Reduction of the PDT fluence rate in association with the use of steroids resulted in reducing the risk of macular atrophy and in a better visual acuity outcome. The introduction of anti-VEGF-based drugs has revolutionized the treatment of AMD and has replaced all the previous therapies used for CNV. Visual improvement becomes an expectation in a higher proportion of patients, previously limited to minimizing vision loss. Anti-VEGF therapy also resulted in superior visual improvement compared to all types of combination therapy with IVT and PDT. Nevertheless, anti-VEGF monotherapy also has many limitations due to the need of repetitive treatments, increased costs and tachyphylaxis. Treatment regimens involving TA in combination therapy with anti-VEGF and PDT may preserve benefits for substantially longer periods. A question remains open on whether a combination treatment with anti-VEGF, triamcinolone and/or PDT may be a treatment option in patients with exudative AMD, by offering, with one cycle of therapy, functional VA benefits comparable to those observed with continued monthly anti-VEGF therapy. Further trials, of higher scientific significance, are needed to study the potential of these treatment options."

CD005139,0,26113500,0,A review of therapies for diabetic macular oedema and rationale for combination therapy.,"Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is responsible for significant visual impairment in diabetic patients. The primary cause of DMO is fluid leakage resulting from increased vascular permeability through contributory anatomical and biochemical changes. These include endothelial cell (EC) death or dysfunction, pericyte loss or dysfunction, thickened basement membrane, loss or dysfunction of glial cells, and loss/change of EC Glycocalyx. The molecular changes include increased reactive oxygen species, pro-inflammatory changes: advanced glycation end products, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, Complement 5-9 deposition and cytokines, which result in increased paracellular permeability, tight junction disruption, and increased transcellular permeability. Laser photocoagulation has been the mainstay of treatment until recently when pharmacological treatments were introduced. The current treatments for DMO target reducing vascular leak in the macula once it has occurred, they do not attempt to treat the underlying pathology. These pharmacological treatments are aimed at antagonising vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or non-VEGF inflammatory pathways, and include intravitreal injections of anti-VEGFs (ranibizumab, aflibercept or bevacizumab) or steroids (fluocinolone, dexamethasone or triamcinolone) as single therapies. The available evidence suggests that each individual treatment modality in DMO does not result in a completely dry macula in most cases. The ideal treatment for DMO should improve vision and improve morphological changes in the macular (eg, reduce macular oedema) for a significant duration, reduced adverse events, reduced treatment burden and costs, and be well tolerated by patients. This review evaluates the individual treatments available as monotherapies, and discusses the rationale and potential for combination therapy in DMO. A comprehensive review of clinical trials related to DMO and their outcomes was completed. Where phase III randomised control trials were available, these were referenced, if not available, phase II trials have been included."

CD005139,0,22122463,0,APE1/Ref-1 role in redox signaling: translational applications of targeting the redox function of the DNA repair/redox protein APE1/Ref-1.,"The heterogeneity of most cancers diminishes the treatment effectiveness of many cancer-killing regimens. Thus, treatments that hold the most promise are ones that block multiple signaling pathways essential to cancer survival. One of the most promising proteins in that regard is APE1, whose reduction-oxidation activity influences multiple cancer survival mechanisms, including growth, proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and stress responses. With the continued research using APE1 redox specific inhibitors alone or coupled with developing APE1 DNA repair inhibitors it will now be possible to further delineate the role of APE1 redox, repair and protein-protein interactions. Previously, use of siRNA or over expression approaches, while valuable, do not give a clear picture of the two major functions of APE1 since both techniques severely alter the cellular milieu. Additionally, use of the redox-specific APE1 inhibitor, APX3330, now makes it possible to study how inhibition of APE1's redox signaling can affect multiple tumor pathways and can potentiate the effectiveness of existing cancer regimens. Because APE1 is an upstream effector of VEGF, as well as other molecules that relate to angiogenesis and the tumor microenvironment, it is also being studied as a possible treatment for agerelated macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. This paper reviews all of APE1's functions, while heavily focusing on its redox activities. It also discusses APE1's altered expression in many cancers and the therapeutic potential of selective inhibition of redox regulation, which is the subject of intense preclinical studies."

CD005139,0,20210371,0,Current status of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in age-related macular degeneration.,"Angiogenesis, the process by which new vessels are created from pre-existing vasculature, has become the subject of intense research in recent years. Increased rates of angiogenesis are associated with several disease states, including cancer, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important modulator of angiogenesis, and has been implicated in the pathology of a number of conditions, including AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and cancer. AMD is a progressive disease of the macula and the third major cause of blindness worldwide. If not treated appropriately, AMD can progress to involve both eyes. Until recently, the treatment options for AMD have been limited, with photodynamic therapy (PDT) the mainstay of treatment. Although PDT is effective at slowing disease progression, it rarely results in improved vision. Several therapies have been or are now being developed for neovascular AMD, with the goal of inhibiting VEGF. These VEGF inhibitors include the RNA aptamer pegaptanib, partial and full-length antibodies ranibizumab and bevacizumab, the VEGF receptor decoy aflibercept, small interfering RNA-based therapies bevasiranib and AGN 211745, sirolimus, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including vatalanib, pazopanib, TG 100801, TG 101095, AG 013958, and AL 39324. At present, established therapies have met with great success in reducing the vision loss associated with neovascular AMD, whereas those still under investigation offer the potential for further advances. In AMD patients, these therapies slow the rate of vision loss and in some cases increase visual acuity. Although VEGF-inhibitor therapies are a milestone in the treatment of these disease states, several concerns need to be addressed before their impact can be fully realized."

CD005139,0,28427069,0,Practical Lessons from Protocol I for the Management of Diabetic Macular Edema.,"Protocol I, a multicenter randomized clinical trial, compared the visual outcomes of patients treated with 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab with either prompt or deferred (by 24 weeks laser), 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone with prompt laser, or sham injection with prompt laser for the treatment of center-involving diabetic macular edema (DME). A total of 854 adult patients with type I or II diabetes and any level of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or proliferative retinopathy with adequate panretinal photocoagulation, with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 78 to 24 ETDRS letters (Snellen equivalent of 20/32 to 20/320) and visual loss attributed to macular edema, or retinal thickening with central subfield thickness of at least 250 µm by OCT were enrolled. The main outcomes relevant for practicing clinicians are as follows. (1) Intravitreal ranibizumab treatment provides superior visual outcomes compared to conventional laser treatment. (2) Adjunctive laser treatment does not appear to provide substantial visual benefit compared to ranibizumab treatment alone, but may reduce the number of injections required to resolve DME. Deferral of laser is likely beneficial in patients with worse initial visual acuity. (3) Intravitreal triamcinolone provides similar visual outcomes compared to intravitreal ranibizumab in pseudophakic patients but is associated with a clinically important increased risk of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), need for glaucoma medications, and need for glaucoma surgery. (4) Delayed initiation of intravitreal ranibizumab therapy provides improved visual outcome among patients initially treated with conventional laser photocoagulation or triamcinolone, but the magnitude of the benefit is not as great as is observed when ranibizumab treatment is initiated promptly. (5) The number of ranibizumab injections required to achieve the desired visual outcome decreases substantially after the first year, with the majority of patients not requiring further treatment after 3 years. (6) Patients who do not have a rapid response to ranibizumab still display long-term benefit to continued therapy, although perhaps less than those with immediate improvement. (7) Intravitreal ranibizumab is not only effective in reducing retinal edema and improving BCVA among patients with DME, it is also a disease modifying therapy and induces improvement of the diabetic retinopathy severity score by 2 or more steps in approximately one third of patients. Triamcinolone injection also induces improvement in diabetic retinopathy severity in DME patients, but perhaps to a lesser degree. (8) No increased risk of systemic adverse events was observed among patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab compared to sham-injected controls or triamcinolone-treated patients, but the low frequency of adverse events, restrictive enrollment criteria, and specific posology employed in this study limit the generalization of this conclusion to patients routinely encountered in clinical practice. (9) There was no clinically important increased risk of major ocular complications among patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab (including the risk of glaucoma), although endophthalmitis is a potentially devastating outcome should it occur. In addition to the risk of endophthalmitis, intravitreal triamcinolone injection was associated with clinically important increased risk of cataract progression and increased IOP."

No injection-related complications or significant alterations in intraocular pressure were observed in any of the study arms. In treatment-naive DME, superiority of IVB/D combination therapy over IVB monotherapy may exist; especially as regards anatomical features. In our therapeutic arsenal for DME, IVD can be added as an adjunct to Bevacizumab."

Eyes with MO secondary to CRVO that received a minimum of three intravitreal injections of bevacizumab or ranibizumab and were switched to intravitreal aflibercept for persistent or recurrent MO not responding to either bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab.ResultsIn all 42 eyes of 42 patients were included in the study. The median visual acuity before the switch was 20/126, 1 month after the first injection of aflibercept 20/89 (P=0.0191), and at the end of the follow-up 20/100 (P=0.2724). The median CRT before the switch was 536 μm, 1 month after the first injection of aflibercept 293.5 μm (P=0.0038), and at the end of the follow-up 279 μm (P=0.0013 compared to before the switch). The median number of weeks between injections before the switch was 5.6 and after the switch was 7.6 (P<0.0001).ConclusionConverting eyes with refractory MO due to CRVO to aflibercept can result in stabilization of the vision, improved macular anatomy, and extension of the injection interval."

CD005139,0,22702841,0,Proteomic analysis of the aqueous humor in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can lead to irreversible central vision loss in the elderly. Although large number of growth factor pathways, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD, no study has directly assessed the whole proteomic composition in the aqueous humor (AH) among AMD patients. The AH contains proteins secreted from the anterior segment tissue, and these proteins may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AMD. Thus, comparisons between the AH proteomic profiles of AMD patients and non-AMD controls may lead to the verification of novel pathogenic proteins useful as potential clinical biomarkers. In this study, we used discovery-based proteomics and Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS) to analyze AH from AMD patients and AH from controls who underwent cataract surgery. A total of 154 proteins with at least two unique peptides were identified in the AH. Of these 154 proteins identified by discovery-based proteomics, 10 AH proteins were novel identifications. The protein composition in the AH was different between AMD patients and non-AMD controls. Subsequently, a systematic MRM-MS assay was performed in seven highly abundant differentially expressed proteins from these groups. Differential expression of three proteins was observed in the AH of AMD patients compared with that of cataract controls (p<0.0312). Elucidation of the aqueous proteome will establish a foundation for protein function analysis and identify differentially expressed markers associated with AMD. This study demonstrates that integrated proteomic technologies can yield novel biomarkers to detect exudative AMD."

To evaluate the early response to intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) in two different phenotypes of age-related macular degenerations (AMD): typical neovascular AMD (tAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Methods. Sixty eyes from 60 patients (tAMD 28, PCV 32 eyes) were recruited. Three consecutive IVR treatments (0.5 mg) were performed every month. Change in the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) was then compared between the tAMD and PCV groups. Results. The mean BCVA logMAR was significantly improved at month 1 and month 3 after the initial IVR in the tAMD group, but there was no change in the PCV group. Both phenotypes showed significant improvements in the CRT during the 3 months after the initial IVR. There were no significant differences in the improvements of the CRT in the tAMD versus the PCV group. In the stepwise analysis, a worse pretreatment BCVA and tAMD lesions were significantly beneficial for a greater improvement of BCVA at 3 months after the initial IVR. Conclusions. The phenotype of tAMD showed a significantly better early response to IVR than PCV in terms of BCVA improvement."

In this study we investigated whether plasma VEGF levels are increased in patients with acromegaly, a disease in which plasma IGF-I levels are elevated, and whether plasma VEGF levels are correlated with plasma IGF-I levels in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed plasma samples from 13 active acromegalic patients (7 males and 6 females) aged 33 to 66 years, with a mean age of 52.3+/-10.8 years. The results were compared with plasma VEGF levels in 16 age- and sex-matched, healthy subjects (9 males and 7 females) aged 22 to 66 years, with a mean age of 52.4+/-11.5 years. Plasma VEGF levels were not higher in the acromegalic patients than in the healthy subjects (253+/-61 vs. 197+/-30 pg/mL, P= 0.39). In 5 patients plasma VEGF levels were rather slightly increased after pituitary adenomectomy while one patient showed a reduced plasma VEGF level. In addition there was no correlation between plasma VEGF and GH or IGF-I levels. These data indicate that plasma VEGF levels are not increased in patients with acromegaly and that serum VEGF may play a less important role in the neovascularization in the carcinogenesis and/or disturbances of the cardiovascular system in patients with acromegaly."

PRN protocols are based on regular patient follow-up and on retreatment when there is evidence of reactivation of the lesion, basically determined by loss of visual acuity and persistent or recurrent macular fluid on optical coherence tomography. Treat-and-extend or FUSION protocols are based on early retreatment of the lesion before reactivation occurs with the aim of avoiding the irreversible visual loss that can occur in disease recurrences. There is no ideal treatment and follow-up protocol that could be used as an alternative to the monthly regimen and be applied and reproduced in all patients.

CD005139,0,18354841,0,Ranibizumab: new drug. Macular degeneration: second-line use due to risks.,"(1) Due to a lack of any better alternatives, photodynamic therapy is the standard treatment for subfoveal lesions due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It consists of intravenous injection of a photosensitizer, verteporfin, followed by local red laser activation. This treatment, sometimes repeated every 3 months, stabilises the loss of visual acuity for 2 years in about 50% of patients. Adverse effects are generally acceptable. (2) Ranibizumab is an antibody fragment targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is implicated in the neovascularisation involved in age-related macular degeneration. Ranibizumab is injected into the vitreous in the same way as pegaptanib, the first VEGF antagonist to be approved for an ocular indication. (3) Clinical evaluation of ranibizumab includes 2 placebo-controlled trials (900 patients in total), a trial versus verteporfin (423 patients), and a trial testing ranibizumab in combination with verteporfin (162 patients). More than 90% of patients treated with ranibizumab in these two trials had no tangible loss of vision for one to two years, compared to about 68% of patients treated with verteporfin (statistically significant difference). These trials did not attempt to determine the optimal interval between intravitreal injections. (4) No trials have directly compared ranibizumab with pegaptanib; indirect comparisons suggest that ranibizumab is better than pegaptanib. (5) Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab can have local adverse effects, similar to pegaptanib. These include inflammatory reactions, infections, and elevated intraocular pressure. Arterial thromboses at distant sites, in particular strokes, have been reported with ranibizumab, at a higher frequency with 0.5 mg per infection (about 1%) than with 0.3 mg per injection. (6) When visual acuity continues to deteriorate in patients with age-related macular degeneration despite treatment with verteporfin, ranibizumab provides an effective alternative for patients with no particular risk factors for stroke."

Here, we demonstrated that Wnt5a antagonized β-catenin response transcription (CRT) induced with Wnt3a by promoting β-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 and its subsequent degradation in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Wnt5a decreased the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which was up-regulated by Wnt3a. Furthermore, Wnt5a increased E-cadherin expression and decreased cell migration by down-regulating Snail expression, thereby abrogating the Wnt3a-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human RPE cells. Our findings suggest that Wnt5a suppresses the pathogenic effects of canonical Wnt signaling in human RPE cells by promoting β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. Therefore, Wnt5a has significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of AMD."

CD005139,0,23830845,0,Arginase in retinopathy.,"Ischemic retinopathies, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity and retinal vein occlusion are a major cause of blindness in developed nations worldwide. Each of these conditions is associated with early neurovascular dysfunction. However, conventional therapies target clinically significant macula edema or neovascularization, which occur much later. Intra-ocular injections of anti-VEGF show promise in reducing retinal edema, but the effects are usually transient and the need for repeated injections increases the risk of intraocular infection. Laser photocoagulation can control pathological neovascularization, but may impair vision and in some patients the retinopathy continues to progress. Moreover, neither treatment targets early stage disease or promotes repair. This review examines the potential role of the ureahydrolase enzyme arginase as a therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic retinopathy. Arginase metabolizes l-arginine to form proline, polyamines and glutamate. Excessive arginase activity reduces the l-arginine supply for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), causing it to become uncoupled and produce superoxide and less NO. Superoxide and NO react and form the toxic oxidant peroxynitrite. The catabolic products of polyamine oxidation and glutamate can induce more oxidative stress and DNA damage, both of which can cause cellular injury. Studies indicate that neurovascular injury during retinopathy is associated with increased arginase expression/activity, decreased NO, polyamine oxidation, formation of superoxide and peroxynitrite and dysfunction and injury of both vascular and neural cells. Furthermore, data indicate that the cytosolic isoform arginase I (AI) is involved in hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction and injury of vascular endothelial cells whereas the mitochondrial isoform arginase II (AII) is involved in neurovascular dysfunction and death following hyperoxia exposure. Thus, we postulate that activation of the arginase pathway causes neurovascular injury by uncoupling NOS and inducing polyamine oxidation and glutamate formation, thereby reducing NO and increasing oxidative stress, all of which contribute to the retinopathic process."

Photodynamic therapies as well as intravitreal macromolecule injections (Macugen and Lucentis) require frequent, invasive administrations. Above all, only modest improvement in vision is achieved with any of the existing treatments. In order to overcome these limitations in the long run, this study investigated the antiangiogenic potential of AQ4, a low molecular weight anthracenedione. The results indicate that AQ4 enters the cell nucleus and inhibits proliferation of choroid-retina endothelial (RF/6A) cells and human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells under hypoxic (1% O(2)) as well as normoxic (21% O(2)) conditions. The IC(50) for these effects ranges from 5.5 to 6.9 muM. AQ4 does not affect the viability of non-dividing RF/6A or ARPE-19 cells up to 0.1 mM. Further, AQ4 (20 muM) reduces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein secretion by about 50% in ARPE-19 cells under normoxia as well as hypoxia, possibly by reducing VEGF transcription. AQ4 arrests the growth of endothelial cells in S phase, consistent with interference of AQ4 with DNA replication. These results for the first time suggest that AQ4 can potentially alleviate the neovascularization of choroid/retina by a dual mechanism of inhibiting the proliferation of endothelial cells and by reducing mitogenic VEGF stimulus from retinal pigment epithelial cells."

The benefit of intravitreal ranibizumab applies to all angiographic subtypes of neovascular AMD and across all lesion sizes. The two original phase III studies (ANCHOR and MARINA) demonstrated sustained visual acuity (VA) gains over a two-year monthly dosing schedule. Following these trials, several studies looked at ways to decrease the treatment burden while maintaining similar visual gains. These trials included PIER, PrONTO, EXCITE, SUSTAIN, HORIZON, and CATT. Visual acuity data shows that monthly dosing of ranibizumab produces superior vision outcomes compared to a less-frequent, fixed-dosing schedule. Intravitreal ranibizumab is well tolerated and shown to have a very low rate of adverse ocular or systemic side-effects."

However, 3 months later he developed increased intraocular pressure and a recurrence of the cystoid macular edema. Intravitreal bevacizumab was administered and optical coherence tomography revealed worsening of the cystoid macular edema 1 month after the injection. Chronic cystoid macular edema that does not respond to topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drops may resolve with intravitreal triamcinolone but not with bevacizumab. The current case demonstrates that some cystoid macular edema may not be responsive to vascular endothelial growth factor blockade alone. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenesis of cystoid macular edema and determine whether vascular endothelial growth factor blockade should be included in treatment modalities for this condition."
CD005139,0,26491243,0,Stereotactic radiotherapy for wet age-related macular degeneration: current perspectives.,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of blindness in the developed world. Currently, the treatment of choice is intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF medications. These require frequent dosing, up to monthly, and impose a substantial burden on patients and the health economy. Ionizing radiation was proposed as a possible treatment for age-related macular degeneration due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. Stereotactic radiotherapy is an outpatient-based radiotherapy platform that provides stereotactic application of low energy X-ray to the retina in three highly collimated beams that cross the inferior sclera to overlap at the macula. A randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled trial of 230 patients (INTREPID) showed that a single dose of stereotactic radiotherapy significantly reduces the number of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections needed over 2 years. A larger randomized controlled trial (STAR) is underway."

CD005139,0,23977149,0,VEGF receptor blockade markedly reduces retinal microglia/macrophage infiltration into laser-induced CNV.,"Although blocking VEGF has a positive effect in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the effect of blocking its receptors remains unclear. This was an investigation of the effect of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1 and/or 2 blockade on retinal microglia/macrophage infiltration in laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a model of wet AMD. CNV lesions were isolated by laser capture microdissection at 3, 7, and 14 days after laser and analyzed by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining for mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Neutralizing antibodies for VEGFR1 or R2 and the microglia inhibitor minocycline were injected intraperitoneally (IP). Anti-CD11b, CD45 and Iba1 antibodies were used to confirm the cell identity of retinal microglia/macrophage, in the RPE/choroidal flat mounts or retinal cross sections. CD11b(+), CD45(+) or Iba1(+) cells were counted. mRNA of VEGFR1 and its three ligands, PlGF, VEGF-A (VEGF) and VEGF-B, were expressed at all stages, but VEGFR2 were detected only in the late stage. PlGF and VEGF proteins were expressed at 3 and 7 days after laser. Anti-VEGFR1 (MF1) delivered IP 3 days after laser inhibited infiltration of leukocyte populations, largely retinal microglia/macrophage to CNV, while anti-VEGFR2 (DC101) had no effect. At 14 days after laser, both MF1 and DC101 antibodies markedly inhibited retinal microglia/macrophage infiltration into CNV. Therefore, VEGFR1 and R2 play differential roles in the pathogenesis of CNV: VEGFR1 plays a dominant role at 3 days after laser; but both receptors play pivotal roles at 14 days after laser. In vivo imaging demonstrated accumulation of GFP-expressing microglia into CNV in both CX3CR1(gfp/gfp) and CX3CR1(gfp/+) mice. Minocycline treatment caused a significant increase in lectin(+) cells in the sub-retinal space anterior to CNV and a decrease in dextran-perfused neovessels compared to controls. Targeting the chemoattractant molecules that regulate trafficking of retinal microglia/macrophage appears to be a compelling therapeutic strategy to control CNV and treat wet AMD."
CD005139,0,12840058,0,Selective stimulation of VEGFR-1 prevents oxygen-induced retinal vascular degeneration in retinopathy of prematurity.,"Oxygen administration to immature neonates suppresses VEGF-A expression in the retina, resulting in the catastrophic vessel loss that initiates retinopathy of prematurity. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for survival of blood vessels in the developing retina, we characterized two VEGF-A receptors, VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1, also known as Flt-1) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, also known as Flk-1). Surprisingly, these two VEGF-A receptors differed markedly during normal retinal development in mice. At 5 days postpartum (P5), VEGFR-1 protein was colocalized with retinal vessels, whereas VEGFR-2 was detected only in the neural retina. Real-time RT-PCR identified a 60-fold induction of VEGFR-1 mRNA in retina from P3 (early vascularization) to P26 (fully vascularized), and no significant change in VEGFR-2 mRNA expression. Placental growth factor-1 (PlGF-1), which exclusively binds VEGFR-1, decreased hyperoxia-induced retinal vaso-obliteration from 22.2% to 5.1%, whereas VEGF-E, which exclusively binds VEGFR-2, had no effect on blood vessel survival. Importantly, under the same conditions, PlGF-1 did not increase vasoproliferation during (a). normal vessel growth, (b). revascularization following hyperoxia-induced ischemia, or (c). the vasoproliferative phase, indicating a selective function supporting blood vessel survival. We conclude that VEGFR-1 is critical in maintaining the vasculature of the neonatal retina, and that activation of VEGFR-1 by PlGF-1 is a selective strategy for preventing oxygen-induced retinal ischemia without provoking retinal neovascularization."

CD005139,0,22898648,0,Evaluation of age-related macular degeneration with optical coherence tomography.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual loss in people aged 50 years or older in the developed world. In recent years, major advances have been made in the treatment of AMD, with the introduction of anti-angiogenic agents, offering the first hope of significant visual recovery for patients with neovascular AMD. In line with these advances, a new imaging modality-optical coherence tomography (OCT)-has emerged as an essential adjunct for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with AMD. The ability to accurately interpret OCT images is thus a prerequisite for both retina specialists and comprehensive ophthalmologists. Despite this, the relatively recent introduction of OCT and the absence of formal training, coupled with rapid evolution of the technology, may make such interpretation difficult. These problems are compounded by the phenotypically heterogeneous nature of AMD and its complex morphology as visualized using OCT. We address these issues by summarizing the current understanding of OCT image interpretation in patients with AMD and describe how OCT can best be applied in clinical practice."

CD005139,0,20887242,0,Retinal angiomatous proliferation.,"Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) is a distinct form of choroidal neovascularization which may complicate a wet age related macular degeneration (AMD). This exudative-AMD has a peculiar clinical history and prognosis. RAP accounts from 8% to 22% of newly diagnosed cases among patients previously diagnosed as exudative AMD, and up to 25% of the occult or minimally classic CNV. The disease is more prevalent in women (90% of cases) and in elderly patients (around 75 years), and is characterized by a very poor prognosis. The neovascular process, whose retinal or choroidal origin is still object of discussion, often hesitates in the formation of a disciform scar, that evolves into a severe loss of central vision. Treatment for RAP is not yet well established; herein are described the most used therapeutic strategies, starting from laser photocoagulation until the nearest anti VEGF.

Conventional treatment modalities for AMD are of limited success. Inhibition of new vessel formation and targeting of pathological vessels seem to be the best choice in AMD. A variety of animal models mimic the relevant aspects of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and allow for therapy screening. Preclinical and clinical studies show that a variety of different strategies are very promising. Stategies include inhibition or blocking of vascular endothelial growth factor, a key player in angiogenesis), blocking specific receptors, application of naturally occurring angiogenesis inhibitors and gene therapy. However, the multistep pathways involved in ocular angiogenesis suggest that a cocktail approach is required for effective long-term treatment and prevention of CNV."
CD005139,0,10720919,0,Oxygen-induced retinopathy in the newborn rat: morphological and immunohistological findings in animals treated with topical timolol maleate.,"Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) similar to that seen in premature infants can be produced in newborn rats by exposure to 80% oxygen for the first 5 days of life, with subsequent recovery for 7 days in a room air environment. Previous studies have shown that the latter phase is associated with degeneration of retinal astrocytes. In the absence of astrocytes, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is produced by the neurons of the inner retina. In this study, immunohistochemical methods were used to assess retinal expression of VEGF protein in ratlings exposed to the above protocol, with and without simultaneous treatment with topical timolol maleate. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and arterial pressure were measured. The severity of OIR was also evaluated in retinal flat mounts after India ink perfusion. The mean IOP was 8.25 +/- 0.32 mm Hg in untreated ratlings and 5.15 +/- 0.24 mm Hg in timolol-treated animals. OIR in retinas from the timolol group was less severe than that seen in untreated ratlings. VEGF protein expression was almost completely absent in the latter group. Retinas from timolol-treated animals expressed VEGF protein, though the level was inferior to that found in controls raised under room air conditions. In conclusion, these data seem to indicate that experimental OIR can be attenuated by a reduction of the IOP during and after oxygen supplementation. It is possible that these effects are due to improved ocular perfusion pressure, which would mitigate the hypoxic insult to the retina during the room air recovery period."

An 88-year-old woman, with past medical history significant for bilateral age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injections for 1 year, was referred to our department for bilateral vitritis diagnosed 10 days after the last anti-VEGF injection. A complete uveitis work-up including aqueous humour analysis, brain MRI and vitreous biopsy enabled us to confirm the diagnosis of primary intraocular CNS lymphoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the diagnosis of primary intraocular CNS lymphoma in a patient treated with anti-VEGF for AMD. The differential diagnosis of vitritis in elderly patients is relatively broad. Endophthalmitis and uveitis have been described after anti-VEGF injections. In such a situation, there is actually a risk of missing the diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma in the mistaken belief that the observed vitritis may be a reaction to administered anti-VEGFs. If no direct time-relationship with the anti-VEGF injections can be found, a classic vitritis work-up should be performed. Our observation suggests that ranibizumab, at the dosage used for AMD, does not impede the spread of CNS lymphoma in the eye nor interfere with cytological diagnosis."

Immunomodulatory derivative lenalidomide has more potent antitumour and anti-inflammatory effects. The molecular mechanisms of antitumour activity of lenalidomide have been extensively studied in multiple myeloma (MM). It directly induces growth arrest and/or apoptosis of even drug-resistant MM cells; inhibits binding of MM cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix proteins and stromal cells; modulates cytokine secretion and inhibits angiogenesis in the bone marrow milieu; and augments host antitumour immunity. Importantly, lenalidomide induces significant clinical responses even in patients with relapsed/refractory MM.

Here, an inhibitor responsible for the avascularity of these ocular compartments is identified as pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a protein previously shown to have neurotrophic activity. The amount of inhibitory PEDF produced by retinal cells was positively correlated with oxygen concentrations, suggesting that its loss plays a permissive role in ischemia-driven retinal neovascularization.

A distinction is made between proliferative and non-proliferative processes. The diabetic macular edema can manifest itself at any stage of the diabetic retinopathy and poses a serious threat to vision and quality of life. Evidence based therapy primarily focuses on laser coagulation. Laser coagulation suspends progression of the disease and is used particularly for extrafoveolar edema. Especially a pathological swelling, such as the cystoid edema, in this central part of the retina, can cause a rapid deterioration of vision. The treatment of cystoid macular edema with intravitreal application of drugs is a widespread therapeutical approach. Invasive therapeutical drug application into the vitreous cavity has to be sterile in order to prevent infection. The usage of VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) antagonists is an effective treatment for the diabetic macular edema. Several drugs are now available for intravitreal injection. Nevertheless a small number of medical drugs regularly administered to patients still have to be approved by the authorities (off-label use).

Infusions of antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) antibody and antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody have been shown to be at least partly effective in the treatment of diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Intravitreal therapy of diabetic macular edema by the anti-TNF-α antibody has been found to produce significant side effects and anti-VEGF therapy to be ineffective. Nevertheless, these studies have indicated that the suppression of TNF-α and other proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF could be of benefit in diabetic macular edema and retinopathy. The retina is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially in ω-3, and several studies have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent diabetic retinopathy. Lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins derived from various polyunsaturated fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory actions and suppress the production of interleukin-6, and TNF-α and VEGF have antiangiogenic actions.

CD005139,0,28724829,0,Case report of a secondary macular hole closure after intravitreal bevacizumab therapy in a patient with retinal pigment epithelial detachment.,"We describe a case of macular hole (MH) closure after intravitreal bevacizumab therapy for an underlying pigment epithelial detachment (PED) due to exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The 73-year-old Caucasian female presented with reduced visual acuity (20/80) of the left eye and metamorphopsia for approximately 6 months. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed a subfoveal PED due to AMD with an associated MH. To treat the exudative component of the pathology, we started intravitreal bevacizumab therapy, consecutively leading to reduction of the height of PED and allowing closure of the MH. Detachment recurred during further follow-up, but the MH remained closed. MHs and exudative AMD are common diseases, which rarely occur simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge (search via PubMed for ""MH,"" ""PED,"" ""age-related macular degeneration""), no other case with the persistent closure of an MH associated with PED during intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy and despite recurrent PED has been published to date."

A 25-year-old man had a 10-month history of bilateral proptosis and left sixth nerve paralysis was evaluated. Conjunctival vessels were markedly dilated, especially in the left eye. Clinical examination and fundus fluorescein angiography revealed disc neovascularisation in the left eye with subtle peripheral retinal ischaemia. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested a high-flow carotid cavernous fistula on the left side and this was confirmed by catheter angiography. A single dose of intravitreal ranibizumab was injected prior to neuro-intervention. The disc neovascularisation regressed completely three days later. The left direct carotid cavernous fistula was later treated successfully with coil embolisation. Optic disc neovascularisation is a very rare feature of carotid cavernous fistula and intravitreal ranibizumab may be a useful therapeutic adjunct prior to neuro-interventional techniques to reduce neovascularisation-induced haemorrhage following the intervention."

The ARMS2 gene has been found to be associated with AMD. Currently, intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) treatment is one of the widely used treatments for neovascular AMD. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the genotype of ARMS2 rs10490924 polymorphism and IVR treatment responsiveness in patients with neovascular AMD. The study included 39 patients with advanced neovascular AMD (patient group) and 250 healthy individuals with exome sequencing data (control group). The patient group was divided into three subgroups: GG (N = 10), TG (N = 14), and TT (N = 15). Before IVR treatment, all patients had intraretinal or subretinal fluid or both. They received three monthly IVR-injection treatments. One month after the third injection, the patients were evaluated as either ""responders"" or ""non-responders"" based on the presence or absence of intraretinal or subretinal fluid or both. The patient subgroups TG and TT had an 8.56- and 39-fold higher risk of AMD, respectively, than patient subgroup GG had. The allele frequency was 0.537 and 0.10 in the patient and control groups, respectively. Within the patient subgroup TT, there was a significant difference between the ""responders"" and ""non-responders"" (P = 0.025). In conclusion, in neovascular AMD patients undergoing IVR treatment, TT genotype tended to be a better predictor of good short-term treatment response, compared to the GG and TG genotypes. Further studies using confirmed genetic biomarkers for individualized optimal treatments are required."

Coli K5 Polysaccharide in Diabetic Retinopathy.","Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockers have been developed for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), the leading cause of visual impairments in the working-age population in the Western world. However, limitations to anti-VEGF therapies may exist because of the local production of other proangiogenic factors that may cause resistance to anti-VEGF interventions. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches targeting additional pathways are required. Here, we identified a sulfated derivative of the Escherichia coli polysaccharide K5 [K5-N,OS(H)] as a multitarget molecule highly effective in inhibiting VEGF-driven angiogenic responses in different in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays, including a murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Furthermore, K5-N,OS(H) binds a variety of heparin-binding angiogenic factors upregulated in PDR vitreous humor besides VEGF, thus inhibiting their biological activity. Finally, K5-N,OS(H) hampers the angiogenic activity exerted in vitro and in vivo by human vitreous fluid samples collected from patients with PDR. Together, the data provide compelling experimental evidence that K5-N,OS(H) represents an antiangiogenic multitarget molecule with potential implications for the therapy of pathologic neovessel formation in the retina of patients with PDR."

The range of subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), clinical features, and 3-month treatment response among three groups having different range of SFCT were investigated in PCV eyes. In 78 treatment-naïve eyes with PCV, SFCT was measured using optical coherence tomography. Eyes were classified into thin, medium, and thick groups, using mean and one standard deviation of SFCT. Clinical features and imaging findings were compared among the three groups. Some eyes were treated with three consecutive monthly injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an initial treatment. They were also classified into three thickness groups, and the short-term post-treatment improvement in visual acuity and central retinal thickness were compared among groups. The mean SFCT was 271.9 ± 135.6 μm. Twelve, 53, and 13 eyes were classified into thin (<136.3 μm), medium (136.3-407.5 μm), and thick (>407.5 μm) groups, respectively. The thin group showed older age, lower visual acuity, and a higher prevalence of fundus tessellation than the other two groups (P <0.05). In multiple linear regression analyses, baseline BCVA was correlated with baseline SFCT. Forty-six eyes completed three consecutive anti-VEGF treatments. The thin group showed no visual improvement after treatment (P = 0.141), unlike the other two groups showing visual improvement (P<0.05). Eyes with PCV have a broad range of SFCT, and PCV eyes with a thin choroid manifest worse visual function than eyes with a medium or thick choroid."

CD005139,0,24933041,0,The β-adrenergic system as a possible new target for pharmacologic treatment of neovascular retinal diseases.,"Retinal neovascular pathologies, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and age-related macular degeneration, may be treated with intravitreal injections of drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the main inducer of neoangiogenesis; however further improvements and alternative strategies are needed. In the last few years, an intense research activity has focused on the β-adrenergic system. The results indicate that, in different experimental models, a decrease of the β-adrenergic function may result either in reduction or in exacerbation of the vascular changes, thus suggesting possible dual effects of β-adrenoreceptor (β-AR) modulation depending on the experimental setting. In in vivo models of proliferative retinopathies, most of the data point to a strong inhibitory role against vascular changes exerted by the blockade of specific β-ARs. In particular, the β2-AR seems to be the mostly involved in these responses, and the β1-/β2-AR blocker propranolol results highly effective in inhibiting both the increase of VEGF expression caused by a hypoxic insult and the consequent neovascular response. These observations have prompted clinical trials in preterm infants with ROP, where oral administrations of propranolol produced positive results in terms of efficacy, although safety problems were also reported. In addition, the possibility of using topical propranolol administrations in the form of eye drops opens new potential routes of drug administration in humans. A further point that should be considered is that there are data demonstrating significant antiapoptotic effects exerted by β-ARs, therefore if β-AR blockers were used to inhibit aberrant neovascularization, there may be a burden to pay in terms of impaired neuronal viability."

CD005139,0,18484796,0,Neovascular age-related macular degeneration: potential therapies.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects an estimated 14 million people worldwide, and is the leading cause of severe, irreversible vision loss in individuals over the age of 50 years in Western societies. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the hallmark of 'wet', 'exudative' or 'neovascular' AMD, is responsible for approximately 90% of cases of severe vision loss due to AMD. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of CNV and vascular permeability. Ranibizumab, the current gold standard in the US for the treatment of neovascular AMD, exerts its effect through binding and inhibition of all isoforms of VEGF. Randomized controlled clinical trials have established ranibizumab as the first US FDA-approved therapy for neovascular AMD to result in improvement in visual acuity. Despite impressive outcomes, treatment with ranibizumab requires sustained treatment regimens and frequent intravitreal injections. In this review, we discuss promising emerging therapies for neovascular AMD that aim to improve outcomes, safety and treatment burden through novel mechanisms of action. Currently in phase III clinical trials, VEGF Trap is a receptor decoy that targets VEGF with higher affinity than ranibizumab and other currently available anti-VEGF agents. Another promising therapeutic strategy is the blockade of VEGF effects by inhibition of the tyrosine kinase cascade downstream from the VEGF receptor; such therapies currently in development include vatalanib, TG100801, pazopanib, AG013958 and AL39324. Small interfering RNA technology-based therapies have been designed to downregulate the production of VEGF (bevasiranib) or VEGF receptors (AGN211745) by degradation of specific messenger RNA. Other potential therapies include pigment epithelium-derived factor-based therapies, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, integrin antagonists and sirolimus."

To detect the effects of intravitreal ranibizumab injections on GCC in patients with wet AMD. Methods. 32 wet AMD eyes were selected and submitted at three ranibizumab injections. RTVue-OCT GCC and MM5 protocol were performed before treatment and twenty days after each injection. Results. At baseline mean GCC thickness was 93.9 ± 18.5 μm. Twenty days after each intravitreal injection it was, respectively, 85.8 ± 10.1, 86.5 ± 9.3, and 91.1 ± 11.5 μm, without statistical significance. A significant improvement in visual acuity (P = 0.031) and a reduction of mean foveal (P = 0.001) and macular thickness (P = 0.001) were observed. Conclusion. The clinical results confirm therapeutic efficacy of intravitreal injections of ranibizumab in wet AMD. A contemporary not statistically significant reduction of GCC thickness suggests that the loading phase of ranibizumab does not have any toxic effects on ganglion cell complex."

CD005139,0,16856623,0,Vascular ophthalmological side effects associated with antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C are related to vascular endothelial growth factor levels.,"We have screened for the incidence of vascular ophthalmological side effects (VOSE) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients undergoing pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) therapy and sought evidence for angiogenesis activation. Thirty-four CHC patients were prospectively evaluated (18 patients with 180 microg/week of peg-IFN-alpha2a plus 800mg/day of RBV and 16 with 1.5 microg/kg/week of peg-IFN-alpha2b plus 800-1,200mg/day of RBV). Complete ophthalmological evaluation and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were assessed before and at the end of therapy. Thirteen patients (38.2%) developed VOSE, eight (23.5%) featured subconjunctival haemorrhage, and five (14.7%) had evidence of retinopathy - all were unrelated to age, sex, genotype, the type of antiviral schedule used and response to therapy. At the end of treatment, the VOSE group had significantly higher serum VEGF levels than the group of patients without detectable side effects (median 281 [range 106-386] vs 117 [83-225] pg/ml, P=0.05). These differences increased when VEGF values were corrected by platelet count. In the VOSE group, baseline VEGF and VEGF/platelet values were also significantly higher (164 [55-260] vs 64 [21-172] pg/ml, P=0.046; and 0.920 [0.217-1.543] vs 0.320 [0.100-0.661] pg/10(6) platelets, P=0.024, respectively]. In a multivariate model VEGF/platelet values at end of treatment and hepatic fibrosis stage were the only predictors of VOSE development. In 3 out of 13 patients visual acuity was affected and 2 had residual lesions in the follow-up. In this exploratory study, antiviral therapy of CHC frequently induces VOSE, apparently through an activation of angiogenesis."

Intraocular injections of anti-VEGF drug are considered to be an effective treatment for macular edema after retinal vein occlusion, however, recurrent/persistent edema is common. The recent reports may lead to a shift in treatment paradigm for DME, from laser photocoagulation, to newer approaches using anti-VEGF drugs. There have been several well-publicized prospective, randomized studies that demonstrated the efficacy of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs for patients with AMD. Adjuvant bevacizumab for neovascular glaucoma may prevent further PAS formation, and it is likely to open up a therapeutic window for a panretinal photocoagulation and trabeculectomy. Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB) results in a substantial decrease in bleeding from the retinal vessels or new vessels during a standard vitrectomy. IVB has also been reported to be effective for inducing the regression of new vessels in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The use of bevacizumab in stage 4 or 5 retinopahty of permaturity (ROP) is to reduce the plus sign to help reduce hemorrhage during the subsequent vitrectomy. Some authors reported cases of resolution of stage 4 A ROP after bevacizumab injection."

The exponential growth that has occurred over the past decade in the retinal pharmacotherapy field has led to the development of several pharmacotherapies for retinal vascular diseases such as diabetic macular edema. Many of these agents, in the form of intravitreal injections or sustained delivery devices, have already undergone clinical trial testing for safety and efficacy and many others are currently being similarly evaluated. Some of these agents have proven to be more efficacious than traditional laser therapy, and it is possible that traditional laser therapy for diabetic macular edema may be abandoned altogether in the near future, especially with the introduction of the micropulse laser. However, more research and experience is still needed in order to determine the best treatment agent or combination of therapeutic modalities, as well as the best treatment regimen for a given patient.

Since that time, the number of intravitreal injections has considerably increased, because anti-VEGF drugs had been made available to ophthalmologists, and several teams have performed a large number of procedures, allowing them to better comprehend intravitreous injections. The present paper describes our current practice of intravitreous injections. Several specialists have exchanged their experiences and issued a common synthesis. Detailed modifications of the initial recommendations have been suggested, with such basic changes such as abandoning preoperative pupil dilatation and easing postsurgical monitoring. Follow-up examinations should be adapted to each patient rather than being systematic. The suggested modifications do not change the procedure of intravitreous injections substantially, but they simplify many steps and detail the various procedures when consensus is lacking."

CD005139,0,26957837,0,Clinical Trials in Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion.,"Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is the second most common retinal vascular disorder. The management of macular edema has changed considerably over time. The laser is considered the gold standard treatment for over two decades. However, visual recovery with laser is usually slow and incomplete. The advent of intravitreal agents, specifically anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) have heralded a new era which promises rapid recovery of vision and quality of vision. Randomized clinical trials have reported optimal results with anti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept) compared to laser therapy or steroids. However, nearly 50% of the patients require repeat intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy up to 4 years after initiating therapy to sustain the visual gains. The adverse events (systemic and ocular) of these agents are minimal. Monotherapy with anti-VEGF agents have been found to provide better results than any combination with laser.

CD005139,0,16013991,0,Pegaptanib: the first antiangiogenic agent approved for neovascular macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of irreversible visual loss in the industrialised world. Angiogenesis underlies the neovascularisation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenesis growth factor. In the VEGF Inhibition Study in Ocular Neovascularisation-1 (VISION-1) trial, pegaptanib (an aptamer inhibitor of VEGF) was tested in neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The 1186 patients received a sham injection or intravitreous injection of pegaptanib (0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mg) every 6 weeks over a period of 48 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who lost < 15 letters of visual acuity between baseline and 54 weeks, and this occurred in 164/296 patients (55%) who received the sham injection. A higher percentage of patients maintained this visual acuity if they were treated with pegaptanib 0.3 mg (54/206 patients, 70%). There was no evidence that pegaptanib 1 or 3 mg was more effective than 0.3 mg. There was no excess of systemic adverse effects with pegaptanib, but ocular adverse effects occurred more commonly with pegaptanib than with sham injection; vitreous floaters (33 versus 8%), vitreous opacities (18 versus 10%) and anterior chamber inflammation (14 versus 6%). Although these results represent a new, beneficial and relatively safe approach to age-related macular degeneration, the progression was not halted or reversed, and further improvement to treatment for this condition should be sought."

CD005139,0,16785756,0,Different plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide between patients with choroidal and retinal neovascularization.,"Because the blood flow is much more intense in the choroid than in the retina, it is interesting to explore whether choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is more influenced by plasma angiogenic factors than retinal neovascularization. The aim of this study was to investigate plasma profiles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) in patients with CNV due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and in those with retinal neovascularization due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Seventy-seven subjects with AMD, 22 with PDR, and 42 nondiabetic, non-AMD controls were enrolled in this comparative case series. AMD subjects were classified into three groups: dry type (dry AMD, n = 17), wet type with active CNV (CNV/AMD, n = 42), and disciform scar due to advanced wet AMD (scar/AMD, n = 18). Plasma VEGF and NO levels of each subject were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemiluminescence, respectively. Plasma VEGF level in CNV/AMD (median 256.0 pg/ml, interquartile range 146.4-375.3 pg/ml) was significantly higher than in PDR (124.8 pg/ml, 75.7-215.3 pg/ml; p = 0.004) and controls (120.3 pg/ml, 82.8-168.2 pg/ml, p =0.001). CNV/AMD also had the highest VEGF level among the AMD subgroups. Plasma NO level was significantly elevated in PDR (137.4 microM, 63.7-240.1 microM) when compared with CNV/AMD (71.8 microM, 42.4-113.3 microM; p = 0.004) and controls (62.6 microM, 39.0-114.9 microM; p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in NO levels among the AMD subgroups. No significant correlation between VEGF and NO levels was noted. These findings indicate that both circulating VEGF and NO may play different roles in the pathogenesis of retinal neovascularization and CNV."

Patients attending for management of neovascular age related macular degeneration (AMD) underwent multispectral imaging with a system comprising of a modified digital fundus camera coupled with a 250-W tungsten-halogen lamp and a liquid crystal fast-tuneable filter. Images were obtained at 8 wavelengths between 496 and 700 nm. Aligned images were used to generate a DLA (differential light absorption, a measure of spectral absorption properties) map of the macular area. DLA maps were generated for both eyes of 10 sequential patients attending for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections. Each of these patients had active leaking neovascular AMD in one eye and early ARM or milder disease in the fellow eye. Eyes with neovascular AMD demonstrated lower average levels of DLA compared with their fellow eyes with early ARM (p=0.037, t test). The significant difference in DLA demonstrates the potential of multispectral imaging for differentiating the two pathologies non-invasively."

CD005139,0,23380435,0,[Ranibizumab versus bevacizumab. Pharmacological considerations].,"Bevacizumab is able to cross ocular barriers when administered through the intravitreal route and to generate plasma concentrations with an inhibitory effect on plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Consequently, systemic effects cannot be ruled out. The fact that bevacizumab is a full-length IgG explains this phenomenon through the participation of FcRn receptors, whose binding-like that of all IgGs-implies their internalization, transfer to the cell membrane, and externalization to the intracellular space and blood. This process occurs in all tissues with cells expressing this type of receptor, such as the eye. Moreover, because of the absence of a specific formulation for intravitreal administration, an intravenous formulation must be manipulated, generating large-sized aggregates, leading to potential problems of the solution's sterility and reducing the pharmacological effect. Ranibizumab is not a full-length IgG but is rather a variable IgG fraction with anti-VEGF activity. Because of the absence of a constant fraction in its structure, this drug cannot bind to the FcRn receptor and, as a result, cannot be transported to the blood. Consequently, its systemic bioavailability after intravitreal administration is nil, thus avoiding effects in parts of the body other than the eye. Moreover, the formulation is specifically prepared for intraocular administration, avoiding problems due to manipulation. The experience gained with these drugs allows the differences in their efficacy and tolerability to be transferred to daily practice."

These membranes usually occur subfoveally and are a major complication of PM, developing in approximately 5-10% of such eyes. PM is the second most common cause of choroidal neovascularization after age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and accounts for nearly 60% of CNVM cases in patients younger than age 50. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A has been implicated as the major angiogenic stimulus responsible for choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD and several major studies have proved the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment for AMD-related CNVM. Benefits have also been observed in a number of prospective and retrospective studies evaluating PM CNVM. Despite the small differences in molecular properties of ranibizumab and bevacizumab, both drugs showed similar therapeutic effects for CNVM associated with PM. Many studies also highlighted that patient age, previous photodynamic therapy treatment, axial length, and visual acuity prior to treatment may affect treatment prognosis. Although there is a paucity of large randomized controlled trials, this systematic review highlights the large numbers of individual trials that demonstrate a significant improvement in VA. The inferior long-term results of alternative therapies, combined with an excellent safety profile from anti-VEGF treatment, make anti-VEGF the current recommended first-line therapy."

Forty patients treated with a single intravitreal injection of 4 mg triamcinolone acetonide (triamcinolone group) were compared with 40 patients treated with three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg bevacizumab (bevacizumab group). The triamcinolone group showed a significant decrease in mean central retinal thickness (CRT) from 472.5 μm ± 120.35 to 374.0 μm ± 152.31 after 3 months (p < 0.001). The bevacizumab group also showed a significant reduction in CRT from 464.5 μm ± 115.3 to 370.0 μm ± 142.31 (p < 0.001). The triamcinolone group displayed an increase in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) following a single intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection from a mean of +0.70 ± 0.17 logMAR to a mean of +0.54 ± 0.38 logMAR after 3 months (p < 0.05).

Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between both groups at 3 months. Our study showed that a single intravitreal injection of triamcinolone is as effective as three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of bevacizumab for treatment of DME with regard to BCVA and CRT measured by optical coherence tomography. Despite the recent popularity of bevacizumab, three injections are no more effective than a single injection of triamcinolone for the treatment of DME."
CD005139,0,17672180,0,Clinical and fundamental aspects of angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis.,"Insight into the fundamental physiological mechanisms of blood vessel development and neoformation has led to the discovery of multiple angiogenic growth factors and inhibitors. To date, at least 5 angiogenesis inhibitors are readily available for clinical use, mainly in the treatment of cancers and age-related macular degeneration. More inhibitors are yet to come and the indications for their clinical use are expected to broaden. Conversely, the use of angiogenic stimulators, although initially promising in animal models and in small uncontrolled pilot studies in patients with ischaemic heart disease or peripheral arterial occlusive disease, could thus far not show any convincing therapeutic improvement. Challenges still remain as to which angiogenic factor or combination of factors should be administered and in which form (protein versus gene), and what route and duration of administration should be used. Further clinical perspective might come from the recent identification of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a modifier of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and as a promising therapy in the treatment of ALS in preclinical animal models. This review discusses the different clinical trials of angiogenic inhibitors and stimulators, preceded by some fundamental aspects of angiogenesis, giving the clinician a brief overview of the most relevant angiogenic topics."

CD005139,0,26501828,0,Treatment for Macular Telangiectasia Type 2.,"Macular telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 is a bilateral disease of unknown cause with localized retinal degeneration and characteristic changes of the retinal vasculature. Funduscopic findings include reduced retinal transparency, crystalline deposits, ectatic capillaries, blunted venules, retinal pigment plaques, foveal atrophy and neovascular complexes. Leakage of telangiectatic macular capillaries is a characteristic finding on fluorescein angiography, and neurosensory atrophy may be present on optical coherence tomography images. Furthermore, there is a specific depletion of macular pigment in the central retina. Depending on the development of neovascular membranes, a nonproliferative and a proliferative (neovascular) disease stage may be distinguished. To date, there is no evidence for an effective treatment of nonproliferative MacTel type 2. Patients with proliferative MacTel type 2 and hence decreasing visual function may benefit from intravitreal application of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. Early treatment and a small size of the neovascular membrane might be predictive factors for visual function outcome."
CD005139,0,26959125,0,The Role of Plasma Kallikrein-Kinin Pathway in the Development of Diabetic Retinopathy: Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Approaches.,"Diabetic retinal disease is characterized by a series of retinal microvascular changes and increases in retinal vascular permeability that lead to development of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), respectively. Current treatment strategies for DR and DME are mostly limited to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors and laser photocoagulation. These treatment modalities are not universally effective in all patients, and potential side effects persist in a significant portion of patients. The plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is one of the pathways that has been identified in the vitreous in proliferative DR and DME. Preclinical studies have shown that the activation of intraocular KKS induces retinal vascular permeability, vasodilation, and retinal thickening. Proteomic analysis from vitreous of eyes with DME has shown that KKS and VEGF pathways are potentially independent biologic pathways. Furthermore, proteins associated with DME in the vitreous were significantly more correlated with the KKS pathway compared to VEGF pathway. Preclinical experiments on diabetic animals showed that inhibition of KKS components was found to be an effective approach to decrease retinal vascular permeability. An initial phase I human trial of a novel plasma kallikrein inhibitor for the treatment of DME is currently ongoing to test the safety of this approach and serves as an initial step in the translation of basic science discovery into an innovative clinical intervention."

CD005139,0,25882328,0,Defining response to anti-VEGF therapies in neovascular AMD.,"The introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) has made significant impact on the reduction of the visual loss due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (n-AMD). There are significant inter-individual differences in response to an anti-VEGF agent, made more complex by the availability of multiple anti-VEGF agents with different molecular configurations. The response to anti-VEGF therapy have been found to be dependent on a variety of factors including patient's age, lesion characteristics, lesion duration, baseline visual acuity (VA) and the presence of particular genotype risk alleles. Furthermore, a proportion of eyes with n-AMD show a decline in acuity or morphology, despite therapy or require very frequent re-treatment. There is currently no consensus as to how to classify optimal response, or lack of it, with these therapies. There is, in particular, confusion over terms such as 'responder status' after treatment for n-AMD, 'tachyphylaxis' and 'recalcitrant' n-AMD. This document aims to provide a consensus on definition/categorisation of the response of n-AMD to anti-VEGF therapies and on the time points at which response to treatment should be determined. Primary response is best determined at 1 month following the last initiation dose, while maintained treatment (secondary) response is determined any time after the 4th visit. In a particular eye, secondary responses do not mirror and cannot be predicted from that in the primary phase. Morphological and functional responses to anti-VEGF treatments, do not necessarily correlate, and may be dissociated in an individual eye. Furthermore, there is a ceiling effect that can negate the currently used functional metrics such as >5 letters improvement when the baseline VA is good (ETDRS>70 letters). It is therefore important to use a combination of both the parameters in determining the response.The following are proposed definitions: optimal (good) response is defined as when there is resolution of fluid (intraretinal fluid; IRF, subretinal fluid; SRF and retinal thickening), and/or improvement of >5 letters, subject to the ceiling effect of good starting VA. Poor response is defined as <25% reduction from the baseline in the central retinal thickness (CRT), with persistent or new IRF, SRF or minimal or change in VA (that is, change in VA of 0+4 letters). Non-response is defined as an increase in fluid (IRF, SRF and CRT), or increasing haemorrhage compared with the baseline and/or loss of >5 letters compared with the baseline or best corrected vision subsequently. Poor or non-response to anti-VEGF may be due to clinical factors including suboptimal dosing than that required by a particular patient, increased dosing intervals, treatment initiation when disease is already at an advanced or chronic stage), cellular mechanisms, lesion type, genetic variation and potential tachyphylaxis); non-clinical factors including poor access to clinics or delayed appointments may also result in poor treatment outcomes. In eyes classified as good responders, treatment should be continued with the same agent when disease activity is present or reactivation occurs following temporary dose holding. In eyes that show partial response, treatment may be continued, although re-evaluation with further imaging may be required to exclude confounding factors. Where there is persistent, unchanging accumulated fluid following three consecutive injections at monthly intervals, treatment may be withheld temporarily, but recommenced with the same or alternative anti-VEGF if the fluid subsequently increases (lesion considered active). Poor or non-response to anti-VEGF treatments requires re-evaluation of diagnosis and if necessary switch to alternative therapies including other anti-VEGF agents and/or with photodynamic therapy (PDT). Idiopathic polypoidal choroidopathy may require treatment with PDT monotherapy or combination with anti-VEGF. A committee comprised of retinal specialists with experience of managing patients with n-AMD similar to that which developed the Royal College of Ophthalmologists Guidelines to Ranibizumab was assembled. Individual aspects of the guidelines were proposed by the committee lead (WMA) based on relevant reference to published evidence base following a search of Medline and circulated to all committee members for discussion before approval or modification. Each draft was modified according to feedback from committee members until unanimous approval was obtained in the final draft. A system for categorising the range of responsiveness of n-AMD lesions to anti-VEGF therapy is proposed. The proposal is based primarily on morphological criteria but functional criteria have been included. Recommendations have been made on when to consider discontinuation of therapy either because of success or futility. These guidelines should help clinical decision-making and may prevent over and/or undertreatment with anti-VEGF therapy."

CD005139,0,23766636,0,Long-term effectiveness of ranibizumab for age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are major causes of visual impairment in the elderly population worldwide. With the aging population, the prevalence of neovascular AMD and DME has increased substantially over the recent years. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated as playing an important role in the pathogenesis of both neovascular AMD and DME. Since its introduction in 2006, ranibizumab, a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody fragment against all isoforms of VEGF-A, has revolutionized the treatment of neovascular AMD and DME. The efficacy and safety of ranibizumab in neovascular AMD has been demonstrated in the ANCHOR and MARINA trials. Further studies including the PIER, PrONTO, and SUSTAIN trials have also evaluated the optimal dosing regimen of ranibizumab in neovascular AMD. The CATT and IVAN trials compared the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab with off-label use of bevacizumab. Studies such as SUSTAIN and HORIZON have shown that ranibizumab has a good safety profile and is well tolerated for over 4 years with very few serious ocular and systemic adverse events. For DME, Phase II RESOLVE study and Phase III RISE and RIDE studies have demonstrated superiority of ranibizumab treatment in improving vision over placebo controls. Phase II READ and Phase III RESOLVE and REVEAL studies have shown that ranibizumab is more effective both as monotherapy and in combination with laser compared with laser monotherapy. The 3-year results from the DRCRnet protocol I study found that ranibizumab with deferred laser resulted in better long-term visual outcome compared with ranibizumab with prompt laser.

These landmark studies have provided the scientific community with powerful data regarding the ability of laser photocoagulation, verteporfin therapy, pegaptanib sodium and submacular surgery to treat particular choroidal neovascular lesion types. Accurate interpretation of data from these trials is essential to enable clinicians to make informed decisions about therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, several new treatment options are likely to become available in the next few years and clinicians will have to decide how effective these therapies may be, and how (or if) they should be used in clinical practice. It is therefore timely to review the strengths and weaknesses of the body of evidence for the currently available therapeutic options for patients with choroidal neovascularization due to AMD. Evaluation of the quality of reporting in past clinical trials will also enable critical review of new studies that will be published in the future. This review summarizes the design, reporting and results of key randomized clinical trials, in addition to evaluating the available evidence for new therapies and identifying the important issues that need to be considered when evaluating their efficacy."

Among various treatment modalities, previous studies have described intravitreal injections of bevacizumab to suppress tumor vascularity. Because of its smaller molecular size, compared to bevacizumab, ranibizumab may offer better tissue penetration and be more efficient in suppressing neovascularization in choroidal lesions. This report presents two cases of choroidal metastases from bronchial and nasopharyngeal carcinoma that were treated as a series of three intravitreal ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg each), showing definite signs of regression.

Patients with less than 6 months follow-up were excluded. OCT was performed at baseline and at monthly intervals for induction therapy. Injections were given monthly until no improvement was observed between successive OCTs. In the maintenance period, reinjections were performed for any recurrence of macular fluid on OCT. Main outcome measures were visual acuity and number of injections given. Twenty-five eyes of 22 patients with mean follow-up of 16 months [standard deviation (SD) = 3.7 months] had mean improvement of 1.6 lines of Snellen visual acuity (SD 2.9, 95% confidence interval 0.48-2.9, P = 0.008). Visual acuity was stable (< or =3 lines of visual acuity lost) in 22 eyes (88%). Nine eyes (36%) gained > or =3 lines. Three eyes (12%) lost > or =3 lines. A mean of 6.0 (SD 2.7) injections were given over a follow-up period ranging from 8 to 21 months.

CD005139,0,19553794,0,Combination angiostatic therapies: targeting multiple angiogenic pathways.,"The multiplicity of signaling pathways for new blood vessel formation is suggested by the modest antiangiogenic effects achieved when any single pathway or molecular step is blocked. In an experimental model of neovascularization in newborn mice, highly significant improvements in an antiangiogenic effect are achieved when inhibitors of different pathways of new vessel formation are combined. In this model, neovascularization can be completely inhibited in the majority of animals when at least three pathways are inhibited. When only two pathways are blocked, complete inhibition of neovascularization is less commonly observed but still far more common than when a single pathway is inhibited. For the prevention of new blood vessel formation in neovascular eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration, the experimental evidence supports combination therapies that inhibit more than one molecular pathway."

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Cochrane Library databases were searched for all wet AMD health technology assessments (HTAs). Overall, 44 publications were evaluated in full and included in this review. A broad range of cost-effectiveness analyses were identified for the most commonly used therapies for wet AMD (pegaptanib, ranibizumab and photodynamic therapy [PDT] with verteporfin). Three studies evaluated the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab in wet AMD. A small number of analyses of other treatments, such as laser photocoagulation and antioxidant vitamins, were also found. Ranibizumab was consistently shown to be cost effective for wet AMD in comparison with all the approved wet AMD therapies (four of the five studies identified showed ranibizumab was cost effective vs usual care, PDT or pegaptanib); however, there was considerable variation in the methodology for cost-effectiveness modelling between studies. Findings from the HTAs supported those from the PubMed and EMBASE searches; of the seven HTAs that included ranibizumab, six (including HTAs for Australia, Canada and the UK) concluded that ranibizumab was cost effective for the treatment of wet AMD; most compared ranibizumab with PDT and/or pegaptanib. By contrast, HTAs at best generally recommended pegaptanib or PDT for restricted use in subsets of patients with wet AMD. In the literature analyses, pegaptanib was found to be cost effective versus usual/best supportive care (including PDT) or no treatment in one of five studies; the other four studies found pegaptanib was of borderline cost effectiveness depending on the stage of disease and time horizon. PDT was shown to be cost effective versus usual/best supportive care or no treatment in five of nine studies; two studies showed that PDT was of borderline cost effectiveness depending on baseline visual acuity, and two showed that PDT was not cost effective. We identified no robust studies that properly evaluated the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab in wet AMD."

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was confirmed in her left eye. On optical coherence tomography, both eyes showed diffuse intraretinal cystic spaces, thickening and separation of the photoreceptor layer from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), subretinal fluid, and focal thickening at the level of the RPE at the fovea. A diagnosis of autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy was confirmed by electrodiagnostic and molecular genetics testing. The CNV responded well to intravitreal ranibizumab therapy, and visual acuity in the left eye improved and stabilized; however, retinoschisis due to fluctuations in intraretinal fluid persisted. This case highlights the fact that current optical coherence tomography-driven protocols used widely to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration may not be appropriate for CNV associated with other retinal diseases."

CD005139,0,16652370,0,Anti-angiogenic drugs: from bench to clinical trials.,"Angiogenesis, the generation of new capillaries through a process of pre-existing microvessel sprouting, is under stringent control and normally occurs only during embryonic and post-embryonic development, reproductive cycle, and wound repair. However, in many pathological conditions (solid tumor progression, metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, hemangioma, arthritis, psoriasis and atherosclerosis among others), the disease appears to be associated with persistent upregulated angiogenesis. The development of specific anti-angiogenic agents arises as an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer and other angiogenesis-dependent diseases. The formation of new blood vessels is a complex multi-step process. Endothelial cells resting in the parent vessels are activated by an angiogenic signal and stimulated to synthesize and release degradative enzymes allowing endothelial cells to migrate, proliferate and finally differentiate to give rise to capillary tubules. Any of these steps may be a potential target for pharmacological intervention. In spite of the disappointing results obtained initially in clinical trials with anti-angiogenic drugs, recent reports with positive results in phases II and III trials encourage expectations in their therapeutic potential. This review discusses the current approaches for the discovery of new compounds that inhibit angiogenesis, with emphasis on the clinical developmental status of anti-angiogenic drugs."

These patients with vascularized PEDs are at a higher risk of experiencing severe vision loss. This case report demonstrates the use of a new spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) algorithm to measure the area and volume of PEDs. When this algorithm was applied to the scans from a patient with a vascularized PED who developed a large submacular hemorrhage while undergoing ranibizumab therapy, the authors found that the algorithm measured an increase in the area and volume of the PED that preceded the macular hemorrhage. Although further studies are needed, the increase in the volume of a PED may serve as a useful predictor of disease progression and the need for more aggressive anti-VEGF therapy."

CD005139,0,23285156,0,Macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) deficiency mitigates retinal inflammation and pathological angiogenesis in ischemic retinopathy.,"Pathological angiogenesis is a major cause of vision loss in ischemic and inflammatory retinal diseases. Recent evidence implicates macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12), a macrophage-derived elastinolytic protease in inflammation, tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. However, little is known about the role of MMP-12 in retinal pathophysiology. The present study aims to explore the enzyme's contributions to retinal angiogenesis in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) using MMP-12 knockout (KO) mice. We find that MMP-12 expression was upregulated in OIR, accompanied by elevated macrophage infiltration and increased inflammatory markers. Compared to wildtype mice, MMP-12 KO mice had decreased levels of adhesion molecule and inflammatory cytokines and reduced vascular leakage in OIR. Concomitantly, these mice had markedly reduced macrophage content in the retina with impaired macrophage migratory capacity. Significantly, loss of MMP-12 attenuated retinal capillary dropout in early OIR and mitigated pathological retinal neovascularization (NV). Similar results were observed in the study using MMP408, a pharmacological inhibitor of MMP-12. Intriguingly, in contrast to reducing pathological angiogenesis, lack of MMP-12 accelerated revascularization of avascular retina in OIR. Taken together, we conclude that MMP-12 is a key regulator of macrophage infiltration and inflammation, contributing to retinal vascular dysfunction and pathological angiogenesis."

CD005139,0,22071973,0,Gene transfer for ocular neovascularization and macular edema.,"Diseases complicated by abnormal growth of vessels or excessive leakage are the most prevalent cause of moderate or severe vision loss in developed countries. Recent progress unraveling the molecular pathogenesis of several of these disease processes has led to new drug therapies that have provided major benefits to patients. However, those treatments often require frequent intraocular injections, and despite monthly injections, some patients have a suboptimal response. Gene transfer of antiangiogenic proteins is an alternative approach that has the potential to provide long-term suppression of neovascularization (NV) and/or excessive vascular leakage in the eye. Studies in animal models of ocular NV have demonstrated impressive results with a number of transgenes, and a clinical trial in patients with advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration has provided proof-of-concept. Two ongoing clinical trials, one using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to express a vascular endothelial growth factor-binding protein and another using a lentiviral vector to express endostatin and angiostatin, will provide valuable information that should help to inform future trials and provide a foundation on which to build."

Thirty-five eyes of 35 patients with diabetes were treated with 2.5 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab injection as the primary therapy for CSME. The main outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity, fundus fluorescein angiography, and P(50) amplitudes of pattern electroretinogram (PERG) before and after intravitreal injection. Mean visual acuity improved significantly from a mean LogMAR value of 1.1 +/- 0.2 at baseline to a maximum of 0.7 +/- 0.3 after a mean follow-up time of 6.4 months. The mean baseline P(50) and N(95) amplitudes of PERG before intravitreal injection were 1.4 +/- 0.7 and 2.4 +/- 0.8 microV, respectively. After the treatment, the mean P(50) amplitude of PERG was 2.4 +/- 0.9 microV at 1-month, 2.3 +/- 0.8 microV at 3-month, and 2.2 +/- 0.8 microV at the last visit, and the mean N(95) amplitude of PERG was 3.4 +/- 1.05 microV at 1-month, 3.3 +/- 0.9 microV at 3-month, and 3.2 +/- 0.9 microV at the last visit, and the mean P(50) and N(95) amplitudes were significantly higher when compared with baseline values (for each, P < .001). Mild anterior chamber inflammation in four eyes was controlled with topical corticosteroids.

Intraocular injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF or VEGF-A)-neutralizing proteins provide substantial benefit, but frequent, long-term injections are needed. In addition, many patients experience initial visual gains that are ultimately lost due to subretinal fibrosis. Preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials suggest that combined suppression of VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) provides better outcomes than suppression of VEGF alone, due to more frequent regression of neovascularization (NV) and suppression of subretinal fibrosis. We generated a dual variable domain immunoglobulin molecule, ABBV642 that specifically and potently binds and neutralizes VEGF and PDGF-BB. ABBV642 has been optimized for treatment of exudative AMD based on the following design characteristics: 1) high affinity binding to all VEGF-A isoforms and both soluble and extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated PDGF-BB; 2) potential for extended residence time in the vitreous cavity to decrease the frequency of intraocular injections; 3) rapid clearance from systemic circulation compared with molecules with wild type Fc region for normal FcRn binding, which may reduce the risk of systemic complications; and 4) low risk of potential effector function. The bispecificity of ABBV642 allows for a single injection of a single therapeutic agent, and thus a more streamlined development and regulatory path compared with combination products. In a mouse model of exudative AMD, ABBV642 was observed to be more effective than aflibercept. ABBV642 has potential to improve efficacy with reduced injection frequency in patients with exudative AMD, thereby reducing the enormous disease burden for patients and society."

Inhibition of this interaction is proving of value in moderating the neovascularization accompanying age-related macular degeneration and in the treatment of cancer. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) has been shown to be a natural VEGFR-2 specific antagonist-an activity that is independent of its ability to inhibit metalloproteinases. In this investigation we localize this activity to the C-terminal domain of the TIMP-3 molecule and characterize a short peptide, corresponding to part of this domain, that not only inhibits all three VEGF-family receptors, but also fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. This multiple-receptor inhibition may explain why the peptide was also seen to be a powerful inhibitor of tumour growth and also a partial inhibitor of arthritic joint inflammation in vivo."
CD005139,0,17914929,0,Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive, degenerative disease of the macula that threatens central vision. It initially occurs in a ""dry"" form, and can progress to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or geographic atrophy. It is the leading cause of blindness among European-descended people older than 65 years, with a prevalence of 1.5%. The treatment of CNV in developed nations in 2007 is substantially different than it was in 1997. Focal, photocoagulating, laser therapy was replaced by intravenous verteporfin and then by intravitreal pegaptanib, which is now being replaced by intravitreal ranibizumab and off-label use of bevacizumab. Other than a ranibizumab versus verteporfin trial, there are no published comparative studies of the three approved pharmacological treatments for CNV. Although frequent intravitreal injections are accepted as a current standard of care, their use is still far from ideal. Thus, there is an opportunity for improving therapy of CNV with respect to mechanism-targeted treatments, efficacy, and route of administration."

AMD often results in profound disability due to the disease destroying the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central visual acuity and color vision. Risk factors for AMD include age greater than 50, female gender, Caucasian race, cigarette smoking, and family history of AMD. African Americans and other racial or ethnic groups can be affected by AMD. Although there is no cure for AMD, early diagnosis and treatment may slow disease progression and minimize irreversible visual dysfunction. Individuals suffering from central vision loss from AMD often retain peripheral vision. These affected individuals can benefit from low vision therapy, visual rehabilitation, or both to maintain or enhance activities of daily living."

Fifty-five years old female patient with RPE ablation as a sign of exsudative ARMD and central visual acuity 79 letters of the EDTRS chart in the left eye was treated by 5 intravitreal injections of sodium pegaptanib. The treatment was not sufficiently effective according to the fluorescein angiography (FAG) and optic coherence tomography (OCT) findings and was accompanied by further decrease of the visual acuity to 55 letters of the EDTRS chart. After the medication was switched to ranibizumab with 3 intravitreal applications, the RPE ablation flattened according to the OCT findings and the fluorescein leakage during the FAG markedly decreased. The central visual acuity improved to 63 letters of the EDTRS chart. The decreased activity of the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is observed during the following 4 months after the last intravitreal application of ranibizumab. Ranibizumab seems to be more effective drug comparing to the sodium pegaptanib in patients with the RPE ablation, but it is necessary to consider the increased probability of the RPE rupture risk."

CD005139,0,24451141,0,Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and CTGF shRNA improves retinal gene expression and microvessel ultrastructure in a rodent model of diabetes.,"Therapeutic modalities targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been used to treat neovascularization and macular edema. However, anti-VEGF treatment alone may cause up-regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the retina, increasing the risk of fibrosis and tractional retinal detachment. Therefore, in this study, we employ a novel dual-target intervention that involves intravitreal injection of the VEGF inhibitor ranibizumab and a transfection reagent-treated non-viral vector carrying anti-CTGF short hairpin RNA (shRNA) driven by human RNA polymerase III promoter U6. The effects of the dual-target intervention on the expression of VEGF and CTGF and on microvessel ultrastructure were examined in retina of streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. CTGF was significantly up-regulated at week 8 after diabetic induction, whereas VEGF was not up-regulated until week 10. The high expression of both genes was maintained at week 12. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed progressive exacerbation of microvessel ultrastructure during the same period. In addition, ranibizumab significantly lowered VEGF but elevated CTGF mRNA, whereas CTGF shRNA significantly reduced the mRNA levels of both CTGF and VEGF in diabetic retinas. Importantly, dual-target intervention normalized the transcript levels of both target genes and ameliorated retinal microvessel ultrastructural damage better than either single-target intervention. These results suggest the advantages of dual-target over single-target interventions in diabetic retina and reveal a novel therapeutic modality for diabetic retinopathy."
CD005139,0,23190105,0,Connection of pericyte-angiopoietin-Tie-2 system in diabetic retinopathy: friend or foe?,"Pericytes are distinctive regulators of vascular morphologenesis and function during vascular development and homeostasis. Pericytes have recently come into focus as implications of aberrant interactions between pericytes and endothelial cells in number of pathological angiogenesis conditions, including diabetic retinopathy and tumor angiogenesis. Pericyte dropout is a hallmark of early diabetic retinopathy. Abnormal angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie-2 signaling is one principal system participating in pericyte/endothelial cell dissociation during early stages of diabetic retinopathy. Angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) is among the relevant growth factors induced by hypoxia and plays an important role in the initiation of retinal neovascularization and cause pericyte loss. Furthermore, high levels of VEGF synergize Ang-Tie-2 signaling during the development of diabetic retinopathy. An accelerated rate of clinical development Ang-Tie-2-manipulating drugs requests a better mechanistic understanding the connection between pericytes and Ang-Tie-2 systems both under normal and disease conditions. We summarize recent advances in pericyte study in conjunction with Ang-Tie-2 signaling and also discuss possible therapeutic strategies for diabetic retinopathy by targeting pericytes through manipulating Ang-Tie-2 signaling."

Patients underwent an aflibercept intravitreal injection (IVI) (0.05 ml) with a 30.5-gauge needle and an antireflux system. IOP was assessed before injection (T0), immediately after (T1), and 5 min (T5), 15 min (T15), and 45 min (T45) after the IVI. Before the IVI and immediately after the T1 measurement, a PENTACAM® acquisition was used to evaluate the anterior chamber parameters (anterior chamber volume, depth and measure of the iridocorneal angle). At T0, IOP was 12.9 ± 1.3 mm Hg. IOP significantly increased after IVI (42.7 ± 3 mm Hg, p < 0.001). IOP returned to baseline at T45 (13.0 ± 1.2 mm Hg, p = 0.877). Anterior chamber volume decreased after IVI (160.6 vs. 168.3 mm3, p = 0.002). No significant changes were found for iridocorneal angle and anterior chamber depth.

It is well established that oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis play critical roles in pathogenesis of AMD. In advanced wet AMD, although, most of the severe vision loss is due to bleeding and exudation of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and it is well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in the growth of the abnormal blood vessels. VEGF suppression therapy improves visual acuity in AMD patients. However, there are unresolved issues, including safety and cost. Here we show that mice lacking c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) exhibit decreased inflammation, reduced CNV, lower levels of choroidal VEGF, and impaired choroidal macrophage recruitment in a murine model of wet AMD (laser-induced CNV). Interestingly, we also detected a substantial reduction in choroidal apoptosis of JNK1-deficient mice. Intravitreal injection of a pan-caspase inhibitor reduced neovascularization in the laser-induced CNV model, suggesting that apoptosis plays a role in laser-induced pathological angiogenesis. Intravitreal injection of a specific JNK inhibitor decreased choroidal VEGF expression and reduced pathological CNV. These results suggest that JNK1 plays a key role in linking oxidative stress, inflammation, macrophage recruitment apoptosis, and VEGF production in wet AMD and pharmacological JNK inhibition offers a unique and alternative avenue for prevention and treatment of AMD."
CD005139,0,24574826,0,Antiangiogenesis therapy: an update after the first decade.,"Angiogenesis is a complex biological phenomenon that forms new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature. Aberrant angiogenesis has been implicated in a variety of diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, arthritis, obesity, pulmonary hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. These conditions collectively affect nearly 10% of the global population. Much effort has focused on identifying new therapeutic agents that inhibit pathological angiogenesis since 1971, when Judah Folkman published the hypothesis that tumor growth is angiogenesis-dependent and that its inhibition may be therapeutic. In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first antiangiogenic drug for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer, bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech). This drug is a humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the vascular endothelial growth factor. It is used in combination with chemotherapy, and its use began the era of antiangiogenesis therapy. Several new therapeutic agents have been added to the list of approved drugs, and clinical trials of new therapeutic options and antiangiogenic agents are ongoing. This review describes the progress made in the first decade of antiangiogenesis therapy, and addresses both validated and possible targets for future drug development."

CD005139,0,21284527,0,Vascular endothelial growth factors in retinal and choroidal neovascular diseases.,"Angiogenesis, or neovascularization, refers to development of new vessels from pre-existing vasculature. Retinal and choroidal neovascularization leads to oedema, haemorrhages, and fibrosis, causing visual impairment and blindness. In multiple studies, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be the most important factor in ocular angiogenesis. Recently discovered anti-VEGF treatments have revolutionized the therapy of neovascular diseases in the eye. These agents have been shown not just to stop the angiogenic process and maintain visual acuity but also improve vision in a great proportion of patients at least during a 2-year follow-up. However, there are also problems with these agents and their delivery regimens, and new therapeutic strategies are needed. This review summarizes the most important growth factors participating in the angiogenic process in the retina and the choroid, diseases where angiogenesis plays the most devastating part causing visual impairment, as well as current antiangiogenic treatments for these diseases."

CD005139,0,17133346,0,Molecular targets for retinal vascular diseases.,"The elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of a disease in animal models provides candidate targets for treatment. As specific antagonists for a target are developed and tested in clinical trials, if benefit is achieved, the candidate becomes a validated target. Validated targets stimulate additional research to identify optimal ways of attacking the target and studies in related disease processes to determine if the molecule is also a target in that context. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a validated target for several retinal vascular diseases. This has led to a flurry of activity resulting in beneficial treatments for patients and intensification of the search for other targets. This review summarizes preclinical and clinical trial results obtained with VEGF antagonists and describes evidence supporting the candidacy of other molecules currently being tested or soon to be tested for target status."

We reviewed the English literature to examine the association between the polymorphism rs1061170/Y402H of the CFH gene and responsiveness to treatment with anti-VEGF drugs in AMD patients. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was also performed. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Stata V.12.0. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using Q-statistic testing. Fourteen relevant studies including a total of 2963 AMD patients were eligible. In AMD patients without a treatment history, individuals carrying the rs1061170/Y402H TT genotype were more likely to achieve a better outcome (OR = 1.932, 95% CI = 1.125-3.317, p = 0.017) than those carrying the CC genotype. The polymorphism rs1061170/Y402H might be a genetic predictor of treatment response to anti-VEGF therapy in AMD patients.

This article will review the indications, techniques, and outcomes of vitrectomy surgery to treat these conditions. A careful assessment of the surgical anatomy, with particular attention to the configuration of vitreoretinal attachments, is important when determining the precise surgical procedure required. The surgical outcome after diabetic vitrectomy has steadily improved with advances in vitreoretinal surgical instrumentation and technique. Significant post-operative complications may, however, occur including cataract formation, recurrent vitreous cavity haemorrhage (early or delayed), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma. Most patients will regain or retain useful vision after diabetic vitrectomy, although the visual outcome does remain unpredictable. The development of adjunctive pharmacotherapy should enable further improvements in visual outcome in the future."

CD005139,0,12778170,0,Imaging of angiogenesis: from microscope to clinic.,"Advances in imaging are transforming our understanding of angiogenesis and the evaluation of drugs that stimulate or inhibit angiogenesis in preclinical models and human disease. Vascular imaging makes it possible to quantify the number and spacing of blood vessels, measure blood flow and vascular permeability, and analyze cellular and molecular abnormalities in blood vessel walls. Microscopic methods ranging from fluorescence, confocal and multiphoton microscopy to electron microscopic imaging are particularly useful for elucidating structural and functional abnormalities of angiogenic blood vessels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasonography and optical imaging provide noninvasive, functionally relevant images of angiogenesis in animals and humans. An ongoing dilemma is, however, that microscopic methods provide their highest resolution on preserved tissue specimens, whereas clinical methods give images of living tissues deep within the body but at much lower resolution and specificity and generally cannot resolve vessels of the microcirculation. Future challenges include developing new imaging methods that can bridge this resolution gap and specifically identify angiogenic vessels. Another goal is to determine which microscopic techniques are the best benchmarks for interpreting clinical images. The importance of angiogenesis in cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, age-related macular degeneration and reversal of ischemic heart and limb disease provides incentive for meeting these challenges."
