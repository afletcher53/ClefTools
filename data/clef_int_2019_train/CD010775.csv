CD010775,0,20878991,0,A recommended scale for cognitive screening in clinical trials of Parkinson's disease.,"Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). There is a critical need for a brief, standard cognitive screening measure for use in PD trials whose primary focus is not on cognition. The Parkinson Study Group (PSG) Cognitive/Psychiatric Working Group formed a Task Force to make recommendations for a cognitive scale that could screen for dementia and mild cognitive impairment in clinical trials of PD where cognition is not the primary outcome. This Task Force conducted a systematic literature search for cognitive assessments previously used in a PD population. Scales were then evaluated for their appropriateness to screen for cognitive deficits in clinical trials, including brief administration time (<15 minutes), assessment of the major cognitive domains, and potential to detect subtle cognitive impairment in PD. Five scales of global cognition met the predetermined screening criteria and were considered for review. Based on the Task Force's evaluation criteria the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), appeared to be the most suitable measure. This Task Force recommends consideration of the MoCA as a minimum cognitive screening measure in clinical trials of PD where cognitive performance is not the primary outcome measure. The MoCA still requires further study of its diagnostic utility in PD populations but appears to be the most appropriate measure among the currently available brief cognitive assessments. Widespread adoption of a single instrument such as the MoCA in clinical trials can improve comparability between research studies on PD."

CD010775,0,12793731,0,Modeling the response of thermoluminescence detectors exposed to low- and high-LET radiation fields.,"Lithium fluoride thermoluminescence (TL) detectors, with different Li composition (Li-6 and Li-7) and various activators (LiF:Mg,Ti, LiF:Mg,Cu,P), are widely used for dosimetry in space. The primary radiation field in space is composed of fast electrons, protons and heavy charged particles (HCP). By its interaction with the structures of the spacecraft, this field may be modified inside the crew cabin. Therefore, calibration of TL detectors against a dose of gamma-rays is not sufficient for relating the TL readout to absorbed dose or to quantities relevant in radiation protection, without suitable correction. We introduce and calculate the detection efficiency, eta, relative to gamma-ray dose, of lithium fluoride detectors after proton and heavy charged particle (HCP) irradiation. We calculate eta for MCP-N (LiF:Mg,Cu,P) and for MTS-N (LiF:Mg,Ti) using microdosimetric models. The microdosimetric distributions used in these models (for HCP of charges between Z=1 to Z=8 and in the energy range between 0.3 MeV/amu and 20 MeV/amu) are calculated using an analytical model, based on the results of Monte Carlo simulated charged particle tracks using the MOCA-14 code. The ratio etaMCP-N/etaMTS-N for protons of stopping power (in water) below 10 keV/microm lies in the range between 0.65 and 1.0 and for HCP with Z>1--between 0.3 and 0.6. The stopping power of the particle is found not to be a unique parameter to scale the response of TL detectors. The combination of response of LiF:Mg,Cu,P and LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors can be more suitable for a dose correction in space radiation fields."
CD010775,0,9805393,0,A model for the catabolism of rhizopine in Rhizobium leguminosarum involves a ferredoxin oxygenase complex and the inositol degradative pathway.,"Rhizopines are nodule-specific compounds that confer an intraspecies competitive nodulation advantage to strains that can catabolize them. The rhizopine (3-O-methyl-scyllo-inosamine, 3-O-MSI) catabolic moc gene cluster mocCABRDE(F) in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae strain 1a is located on the Sym plasmid. MocCABR are homologous to the mocCABR gene products from Sinorhizobium meliloti. MocD and MocE contain motifs corresponding to a TOL-like oxygenase and a [2Fe-2S] Rieske-like ferredoxin, respectively. The mocF gene encodes a ferredoxin reductase that would complete the oxygenase system, but is not essential for rhizopine catabolism. We propose a rhizopine catabolic model whereby MocB transports rhizopine into the cell and MocDE and MocF (or a similar protein elsewhere in the genome), under the regulation of MocR, act in concert to form a ferredoxin oxygenase system that demethylates 3-O-MSI to form scyllo-inosamine (SI). MocA, an NAD(H)-dependent dehydrogenase, and MocC continue the catabolic process. Compounds formed then enter the inositol catabolic pathway."
CD010775,0,512554,0,Determination of the tumorigenic potential of methylene-bis-orthochloroaniline.,"Methylene-bis-orthochloroaniline (MOCA) induced a wide spectrum of neoplasms in male rats fed either a protein-adequate (27 percent casein) or a protein-deficient (8 percent casein) diet. The concentrations of MOCA used were 125, 250, 500 and 1000 ppm. Increasing doses of MOCA in either diet resulted in decreased survival times. MOCA induced pulmonary adenomas, adenocarcinomas, mammary gland adenocarcinomas, Zymbal gland carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and hemangiosarcomas. In both diet groups the lungs were the most sensitive organs to the induction of neoplasms by MOCA. The incidence of primary pulmonary neoplasms in the lowest dose tested (125 ppm) was 6 percent (p less than or equal to 0.01), while in the highest dose (1000 ppm) it was 70 percent (p less than or equal to 0.01). The hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in rats fed a protein-deficient diet with 500 ppm MOCA was 18 percent, whereas in rats fed a protein-adequate diet with the same MOCA concentration this incidence was only 4 percent. The mean urinary concentration of MOCA in the group of rats fed the lowest dose (125 ppm-PD) was 0.63 ppm, a concentration comparable to that measured in the urine of workers exposed to MOCA."

CD010775,0,19260980,0,Montreal Cognitive Assessment Arabic version: reliability and validity prevalence of mild cognitive impairment among elderly attending geriatric clubs in Cairo.,Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical label which includes elderly subjects with memory impairment and with no significant daily functional disability. MCI is an important target for Alzheimer's dementia prevention studies. Data on the prevalence and incidence of MCI varies greatly according to cultural difference. The first aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Arabic version in MCI detection. The second was to determine the prevalence of MCI among apparently healthy elderly people attending geriatric clubs in Cairo.
CD010775,0,16690349,0,Correlation between induction of DNA fragmentation in lung cells from rats and humans and carcinogenic activity.,"Six chemicals, known to induce lung tumors in rats, were examined for their ability to induce DNA fragmentation in primary cultures of rat and human lung cells, and in the lung of intact rats. Significant dose-dependent increases in the frequency of DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites, as measured by the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay, were obtained in primary lung cells from male rats with the following, minimally toxic, concentrations of the six test compounds: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA; 2.5-10 mM), hydrazine (HZ; 0.5-4 mM), cadmium sulfate (CD; 31.2 and 62.5 μM), 4,4'-methylene bis (2-chloroaniline) (MOCA; 31.2-125 μM), isobutyl nitrite (IBN; 7.8-31.2 μM) and tetranitromethane (TNM; 1.9-15.6 μM). Similar degrees of DNA fragmentation were obtained in primary human lung cells; however, due to inter-donor differences, the minimum effective concentrations were in some donors lower and in others higher than in rats, and IBN induced DNA damage only in one of three donors. The DNA-damaging potency of HZ was higher in rats than in humans, and the opposite was true for MOCA. In agreement with these findings, statistically significant increases in the average frequency of DNA breaks were obtained in the lung of rats given a single oral dose (1/2 LD50) of the six test compounds. These findings give evidence that genotoxic lung carcinogens may be identified by use of the DNA fragmentation/Comet assay on rat lung cells as targets cells, and show that the six compounds tested produce in primary cultures of lung cells from human donors DNA-damaging effects substantially similar to those observed in rats."

CD010775,0,18716063,0,A novel functional screen in human cells identifies MOCA as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling.,"Aberrant Wnt signal transduction is involved in many human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The key effector protein of the canonical Wnt pathway is beta-catenin, which functions with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) to activate gene transcription that leads to expression of Wnt target genes. In this study we provide results obtained from a novel functional screen of a human brain cDNA library used to identify 63 genes that are putative negative Wnt regulators. These genes were divided into eight functional groups that include known canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathway components and genes that had not yet been assigned to the Wnt pathway. One of the groups, the presenilin-binding proteins, contains the modifier of cell adhesion (MOCA) gene. We show that MOCA is a novel inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. MOCA forms a complex with beta-catenin and inhibits transcription of known Wnt target genes. Epistasis experiments indicate that MOCA acts to reduce the levels of nuclear beta-catenin, increase the levels of membrane-bound beta-catenin, and enhances cell-cell adhesion. Therefore, our data indicate that MOCA is a novel Wnt negative regulator and demonstrate that this screening approach can be a rapid means for isolation of new Wnt regulators."

CD010775,0,22483886,0,"New approaches to extraction techniques in determination of 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) in air and water solutions.","Extraction techniques for 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) in air samples and water solutions were developed and compared. Classic techniques for air sampling of MOCA were enhanced by incorporating a derivatization step (3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride solution in toluene), thus increasing the limit of detection and limit of quantification. Sampling of MOCA from water solution was performed using novel nanoporous polymeric (polypyrrole and polythiophene) fiber coatings and solid phase microextraction. Samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a UV detector. Using the modified method for air sampling of MOCA, we found that the limit of detection was 7.90 ng m(-3) and the limit of quantification was 23.8 ng m(-3). In contrast, the limit of detection for MOCA in water samples was 11.26 ng mL(-1) (polypyrrole) and 84.62 ng mL(-1) (polythiophene) and the limit of quantification for MOCA was from 33.78 (polypyrrole) and 253.86 ng mL(-1) (polythiophene). Correlation coefficients were 0.9997 for air and 0.8790-0.9852 for water samples, respectively. The techniques presented provide alternative methods for the determination of MOCA in air samples and in water solutions that are more sensitive, quicker and less expensive than previously established procedures."

As predicted from the sequence and shown by the structure, AFR can be assigned to the GFO/IDH/MocA protein family. AFR consists of two domains. The N-terminal domain displays a Rossmann fold and contains the cofactor binding site. The intact crystals contain the oxidized cofactor NADP(+), whose attachment to the cofactor binding site is similar to that of NADP(+) in glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (GFOR) from Zymomonas mobilis. Due to variations in length and sequence within loop regions L3 and L5, respectively, the adenine moiety of NADP(+) adopts a different orientation in AFR caused by residue Arg38 forming hydrogen bonds with the 2'-phosphate moiety of NADP(+) and cation-pi stacking interactions with the adenine ring. Amino acid replacements in AFR (S10G, A13G, and S33D) showed that Ala13 is crucial for the discrimination between NADPH and NADH and yielded the A13G variant with dual cosubstrate specificity. The C-terminal domain contains the putative substrate binding site that was occupied by an acetate ion. As determined by analogy to GFOR and by site-directed mutagenesis of K94G, D176A, and H180A, residues Lys94, Asp176, and His180 are most likely involved in substrate binding and catalysis, as substitution of any of these residues resulted in a significant decrease in k(cat) for 1,5-AF. In this context, His180 might serve as a general acid-base catalyst by polarizing the carbonyl function of 1,5-AF to enable the transfer of the hydride from NADPH to the substrate. Here we present the first structure of an AFR enzyme catalyzing the stereoselective reduction of 1,5-AF to 1,5-anhydro-d-mannitol, the final step of a modified anhydrofructose pathway in S. morelense S-30.7.5. We also emphasize the importance of the A13G variant in biocatalysis for the synthesis of 1,5-AM and related derivatives."
CD010775,0,7768814,0,"Requirements for strand- and site-specific cleavage within the oriT region of Tn4399, a mobilizing transposon from Bacteroides fragilis.","Replicons that contain Tn4399, a conjugal mobilizing transposon isolated from Bacteroides fragilis, can be mobilized in the presence of broad-host-range IncP plasmids RP4 and R751 in Escherichia coli to B. fragilis or E. coli recipients (C. G. Murphy and M. H. Malamy, J. Bacteriol. 175:5814-5823, 1993). To identify the initial DNA processing events involved in Tn4399-mediated mobilization in E. coli, plasmid DNA from pCGM328 (a pUC7 vector that contains the mobilization region of Tn4399) was isolated from donor cells following the release of plasmid DNA from the relaxation complex. Site- and strand-specific cleavage within the oriT region of Tn4399 was detected by denaturing gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization analysis of this DNA in the presence or absence of IncP plasmids. Mutations in either mocA or mocB, two genes which are encoded by Tn4399 and are required for mobilization, significantly decrease the amount of specifically nicked DNA detected. These results suggest roles for the MocA and MocB gene products in specific processing of Tn4399-containing plasmid DNA prior to mobilization. By isolation of the nicked strand and primer extension of this template, we mapped the precise 5' end of the single-stranded cleavage reaction. The nucleotide position of nicTn4399 is adjacent to two sets of inverted repeats, a genetic arrangement similar to those of previously characterized oriT regions. Two site-directed mutations which remove nicTn4399 (oriT delta 1 and oriT delta 2) cannot be mobilized to recipients when they are present in trans along with functional MocA and MocB proteins and an IncP mobilizing plasmid; they are cis-dominant loss-of-function mutations."

CD010775,0,15016823,0,The human nuclear SRcyp is a cell cycle-regulated cyclophilin.,"Cyclophilins of the Moca family (Cavarec, L., Kamphausen, T., Dubourg, B., Callebaut, I., Lemeunier, F., Metivier, D., Feunteun, J., Fischer, G., and Modjtahedi, N. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 41171-41182) are found only in organisms of the animal kingdom and share several structural and enzymatic features. The presence of serine/arginine (S/R) dipeptide repeats in their C-terminal tail suggests that these enzymes belong to the SR protein family involved in the regulation of gene expression. The function of this group of cyclophilins is currently unknown. However, their C-terminal tails contain a highly conserved polypeptide signature segment (the moca domain), which may well be involved in the functional regulation of these proteins. We report here the identification of five Cdc2-type phosphorylation sites gathered in and around the moca domain of SRcyp, a human cyclophilin belonging to the Moca family. The segment of SRcyp containing the identified sites is specifically phosphorylated in mitotic cells. This mitosis-specific phosphorylation was inhibited by treatment of the cells with roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, suggesting that the unknown activity of the moca domain of SRcyp requires mitotic regulation by the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase complex. The Cdc2-cyclin B complex was found to phosphorylate four of the five identified phosphorylation sites in vitro, providing further support for this possibility. Like many factors stored in nuclear speckles and involved in the regulation of gene expression, this nuclear cyclophilin displays a predominantly diffuse cytoplasmic distribution at the onset of mitosis. Only in late telophase is SRcyp recruited to the newly formed nuclei. The transit of SRcyp through mitotic interchromatin granule clusters, before re-entering the nucleus, suggests that the timing of the appearance of this cyclophilin in the telophasic nuclei is tightly coordinated with post-mitotic events. Human SRcyp is the first cell cycle-regulated cyclophilin to be described."
CD010775,0,3550964,0,[Prevention of occupational carcinogens: perspectives opened by the evaluation of risks and preventive actions].,"The first part of the review deals with the present situation in terms of prevention against potential carcinogenic substances in France. A significant effort should be devoted to the measurement of contaminants--not only carcinogenic substances--in the workplace. This is a prerequisite for setting a data base in terms of potential occupational risk. Moreover gaps exist also as far as the definition of the technical means aimed at the reduction of risk is concerned. These conclusions put into light the importance of the contribution that ""industrial hygienists"" would bring in France. In the second part of the review, the methodological content of the risk assessment and risk management procedures is described and illustrated. Risk assessment of carcinogens deals: with the identification of potential carcinogens through epidemiology, animal bio-assays and short term tests; with the quantitative estimation of the magnitude of the potential carcinogenic risk among the exposed workers. It appears necessary to carry out systematic surveys of the number of workers exposed to the carcinogenic substances. The risk assessment procedure is applied to 5 substances BCME, MOCA, Acrylonitrile, Chromium, Nickel and some compounds of these metals. The number of potential excess cancers related to a unit lifelong exposure to Nickel compounds is estimated. This requires exposure-response models which are critically analysed. Risk management is devoted to the choice of primary health care policies. The methodology of risk management consists of: identifying various control policies; quantitative estimation of their efficiency--indicators of the efficiency are discussed--and of their cost; choice among these policies with the help of a cost-effectiveness analysis when necessary. The procedure is illustrated in the case of Acrylonitrile control in a facility."

After a brief study on rats to determine some peculiarities in ""MOCA"" urinary excretion, this method was used to assess occupational exposure in French industrial firms. Both the manufacture of ""MOCA"" and its use as a curing agent in the production of polyurethane elastomers were surveyed. ""MOCA"" excretion levels were distributed from non-detectable (less than 0.5 microgram/l) up to 1600 microgram/l. Concentrations of N-acetyl metabolites, when present, were largely lower than ""MOCA"" levels. The results seemed to reflect workers' overall exposure fairly. Preventive measures following analytical determinations often led to an obvious lowering of excretion levels."
CD010775,0,10503898,0,Detoxification of carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines by enzymatic reduction of the N-hydroxy derivative.,"The metabolic activation pathways associated with carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines have long been known to involve N-oxidation, catalyzed primarily by cytochrome P4501A2, and subsequent O-esterification, often catalyzed by acetyltransferases (NATs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs). We have found a new enzymatic mechanism of carcinogen detoxification: a microsomal NADH-dependent reductase that rapidly converts the N-hydroxy arylamine back to the parent amine. The following N-OH-arylamines and N-OH-heterocyclic amines were rapidly reduced by both human and rat liver microsomes: NOH-4-aminoazobenzene, N-OH-4-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-ABP), N-OH-aniline, N-OH-2-naphthylamine, N-OH-2-aminofluorene, N-OH-4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (N-OH-MOCA), N-OH-1-naphthyamine, N-OH-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-OH-PhIP), N-OH-2-amino-alpha-carboline (N-OH-AalphaC), N-OH-2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (N-OH-MeIQx), and N-OH-2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (N-OH-IQ). In addition, primary rat hepatocytes and human HepG2 cells efficiently reduced N-OH-PhIP to PhIP. This previously unrecognized detoxification pathway may limit the bioavailability of carcinogenic N-OH heterocyclic and aromatic amines for further activation, DNA adduct formation, and carcinogenesis."

We propose a general model free method to decompose such a subspace into contributions from distinct sources. This unique decomposition can be achieved by first finding the respective subspace in source space using a linear inverse method and then finding the linear transformation such that the source distributions are mutually orthogonal and have a minimum overlap. The corresponding algorithm is a generalization of the recently presented 'Minimum Overlap Component Analysis' (MOCA) to more than two sources. The computational cost is negligible and the algorithm is almost never trapped in local minima. The method is illustrated with results for alpha rhythm.

The most commonly used cognitive screen, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), though convenient, is not sensitive in these patients. More sensitive tools are less convenient and, therefore, uncommonly used. Therefore, a practical and sensitive tool is needed. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a good candidate, shown to be sensitive in detecting mild cognitive impairment in the pre-dementia setting. This study is the first to explore the MoCA in cancer patients and is aimed at determining the feasibility of administering the MoCA in brain tumor patients.

The average plasma glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activity of the dogs fed MOCA was higher than that of the controls during the first and last two years on test. During the eighth and ninth years the urine sediment from MOCA dogs contained excessive numbers of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and epithelial cells. Some epithelial cells contained abnormalities that suggested neoplasia in the genitourinary tract. One MOCA dog, sacrificed after 8.3 years on test was found to have a papillary transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Of four MOCA dogs sacrificed after 9.0 years on test, three were found to have papillary transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder and one had a combined transitional cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the urethra. The urethral tumor had metastasized to the liver, but the papillary transitional cell carcinomas found in the other four dogs did not invade the muscle layers of the bladder wall and did not metastasize. Since no urinary bladder tumors were found in the six control dogs, MOCA was considered to be carcinogenic for the urinary bladder of dogs under the conditions employed (p less than 0.025, Fisher's Exact Test, one tail). Three of five MOCA dogs contained hyperplastic nodules in the liver with no such nodules in six control dogs (p greater than 0.05, Fisher's Exact Test, one tail).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brainstem function of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) by the R1 latency (R1). BR was evoked by the percutaneous stimulation of supraorbital nerve. And R1 was measured by the action potential of orbucularis oculi muscle. Direct response was recorded by the percutaneous stimulation of facial nerve to determine the terminal latency of facial nerve (D). By these methods R1, D, R1/D and difference between at right and left side of these data (delta R1, delta D, delta R1/D) were measured in 21 normal subjects (57.7 +/- 10.1 ys.) and 28 cases of SCD (56.6 +/- 8.2 ys.), including 12 cases of sporadic type olivopontocerebellar atrophy (SOPCA), 4 of Menzel type olivopontocerebellar atrophy (MOPCA), 6 of late cortical cerebellar atrophy (LCCA) and 6 of Holmes type cortical cerebellar atrophy (HCCA). There was no difference between all types of SCD and normal subject at D, but significant difference of R1 and R1/d was observed between at MOPCA and normal subject. Concerning the difference between right and left side delta R1 and delta R1/D showed the significant difference with MOCA and SOPCA, but delta D showed no difference. Elongation of R1 and R1/D without the delay of facial nerve and the significant difference of R1 and R1/d between at right and left side suggested the synaptic transmission disorder form trigeminal nerve to facial nerve at brainstem of MOCA."

CD010775,0,17328916,0,Mild cognitive impairment in symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease.,"We tried to evaluate and to compare usefulness of two brief cognitive tests in early detection of cognitive decline in subjects with increased cerebrovascular (CV) risk. As CV risk factors are recognised as important in etiology of dementia, we also aimed to determine the possible associations of specific CV risk factors and cognitive results. Patients (PGs) with first-ever stroke or TIA (N=110) and CV symptoms-free controls (CGs) with CV risk factors present (N=45) matched for age, gender and education level were tested using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on admission, at three- and six-month points. In all subjects, detailed CV risk factors profile was assessed. We observed the decrement in cognitive performance during the six-month study period in both groups, more evident if MoCA (p<0.001) than if MMSE was used (p=0.022). Six months after first stroke/TIA 83.6% PGs scored below normal range on MoCA. In PGs, positive associations for cognitive decrement and multiple CV risk factors (>2) were found (p=0.034 for MMSE; p=0.002 for MoCA). In CGs, positive associations were found for cognitive decrement and arterial hypertension with increased IMT values (p<0.001 for MMSE) and for multiple CV risk factors and arterial hypertension (p=0.003 for MoCA). The use of MoCA could aid to early recognition of cognitive deficits in persons with increased CV risk. Individuals with multiple CV risk factors seem to have increased risk of cognitive decline."

SV-HUC cells were exposed in vitro to varying concentrations of N-OH-MOCA, N-OH-OT, N-OH-ABP and PBQ that caused approximately 25% and 75% cytotoxicity. The carcinogen treated cells were propagated in culture for about six weeks and subsequently injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. Two of the fourteen different groups of SV-HUC.PC treated with different concentrations of N-OH-MOCA, and one of the three groups exposed to N-OH-ABP, formed carcinomas in athymic nude mice. 32P-postlabeling analyses of DNA isolated from SV-HUC.PC after exposure to N-OH-MOCA revealed one major and one minor adduct. The major adduct has been identified as the N-(deoxyadenosin-3',5'-bisphospho-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorob enz yl alcohol (pdAp-ACBA) and the minor adduct as N-(deoxyadenosin-3',5'-bisphospho-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorot oluene (pdApACT). Furthermore, SV-HUC.PC cytosols catalyzed the binding of N-OH-MOCA to DNA, in the presence of acetyl-CoA, to yield similar adducts. The same adducts were also formed by chemical interaction of N-OH-MOCA with calf thymus DNA, suggesting that the aryl nitrenium ion may be the ultimate reactive species responsible for DNA binding. The tumorigenic activity of N-OH-MOCA in this highly relevant in vitro transformation model, coupled with the findings that SV-HUC.PC cells formed DNA-adducts in vitro and contained enzyme systems that activated N-OH-MOCA to reactive electrophilic species that bound to DNA, strongly suggest that MOCA could be a human bladder carcinogen. These findings are consistent with the International Agency for Research on Cancer's classification of MOCA as a probable human carcinogen."
CD010775,0,21520004,0,Prospective comparison of two cognitive screening tests: diagnostic accuracy and correlation with community integration and quality of life.,"Cognitive screening tests are frequently used in brain tumor clinics. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly used, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is an alternative. This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of both screening tests. Fifty-eight patients with brain tumors were prospectively accrued and administered the MMSE and MoCA, 67% of who completed a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation as a gold standard comparison. Quality of life and community integration were measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) and Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ), respectively. At the pre-defined cut-off scores, the MoCA had superior sensitivity (61.9% vs. 19.0%, P < 0.005) and the MMSE had superior specificity (94.4% vs. 55.6%, P < 0.017). The areas under the ROC curve for the MMSE (0.615, standard error = 0.091) and MoCA (0.606, standard error = 0.092) were poor, indicating that at no single cut-off score is either test both sensitive and specific. Neither the MMSE (ρ = 0.12; P < 0.444) nor MoCA (ρ = 0.24; P < 0.108) were significantly correlated with the FACT-Br. The MoCA was modestly correlated with the CIQ (ρ = 0.35; P < 0.017), but the MMSE was not (ρ = 0.14; P < 0.359). The MMSE has extremely poor sensitivity. Using this test in clinical practice, research, and clinical trials will result in failing to detect cognitive impairment in a substantial percentage of patients. The MoCA has superior sensitivity, and is better correlated with self reported measures of community integration, and therefore should be preferentially chosen in practice and clinical trials."
CD010775,0,15358154,0,"Over-expression of SR-cyclophilin, an interaction partner of nuclear pinin, releases SR family splicing factors from nuclear speckles.","Pre-mRNA splicing takes place within a dynamic ribonucleoprotein particle called the spliceosome and occurs in an ordered pathway. Although it is known that spliceosome consists of five small nuclear RNAs and at least 50 proteins, little is known about how the interaction among the proteins changes during splicing. Here we identify that SR-cyp, a Moca family of nuclear cyclophilin, interacts and colocalizes with nuclear pinin (pnn), a SR-related protein involving in pre-mRNA splicing. Nuclear pnn interacts with SR-cyp via its C-terminal RS domain. Upon SR-cyp over-expression, however, the subnuclear distribution of nuclear pnn is altered, resulting in its redistribution from nuclear speckles to a diffuse nucleoplasmic form. The diffuse subnuclear distribution of nuclear pnn is not due to epitope masking, accelerated protein turnover or post-translational modification. Furthermore, we find that SR-cyp regulates the subnuclear distribution of other SR family proteins, including SC35 and SRm300, in a similar manner as it does on nuclear pnn. This result is significant because it suggests that SR-cyp plays a general role in modulating the distribution pattern of SR-like and SR proteins, similar to that of Clk (cdc2-like kinase)/STY on SR family splicing factors. SR-cyp might direct its effect via either alteration of protein folding/conformation or of protein-protein interaction and thus may add another control level of regulation of SR family proteins and modification of their functions."

Our reasoning for this query is that the MoCA includes a broader range of test items and an additional assessment of executive functioning and attention compared with the MMSE. Using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to examine performance of HD and control groups on both tests on overall scores and scores from various subdomains (i.e., visuospatial abilities) revealed that the MoCA achieved higher sensitivity without sacrificing specificity in many domains relative to the MMSE."

This explains the perfect homoeostasis of the energetic intermediate PCr (phosphocreatine) in heart. When using drugs specifically stimulating either supply or demand activities, MoCA helped reveal the very specific mode of regulation of heart contraction energetics. Only activation of myofibrils activity (demand), either by increasing intracellular Ca(2+) concentration or myofibrils sensitivity to Ca(2+), triggers activation of contractile activity. In contrast, the activation of mitochondrial activity (supply) has strictly no effect on contraction, either directly or through PCr changes (intermediate)."

Although all tested models showed a good fit, the six-factor model based on the conceptual model proposed by the MoCA's authors showed a significantly better fit. The results allowed us to establish the factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity of this six-dimensional structure. An overall psychometric adequacy of the items, and a good reliability were also found. This study contributes to overcome an important gap in the construct related validity of this instrument. The present findings corroborate the six-dimensional structure of the MoCA and provide good evidence of the construct related validity. The MoCA has proved to be an appropriate measure for cognitive screening taking into account different cognitive domains, which will enable clinicians and researchers to use this test and its six latent dimensions to achieve a better understanding of the individuals' cognitive profile."

The 32P postlabeling assay, utilizing the nuclease P1 enhancement procedure, was used to evaluate MOCA-DNA adduct formation in target tissues. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different dosing regimens of MOCA, and DNA was isolated from the liver. Additionally, a human uroepithelial cell (HUC) line was treated with N-hydroxy-MOCA for 24 hr, cells were harvested, and DNA was isolated. DNA was analyzed for MOCA-DNA adduct formation by the 32P postlabeling assay. Five MOCA adducts were detected in rat liver DNA. Adduct A, which corresponded to N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol, was the major adduct in rat liver DNA appearing in all treatment groups. Levels of adduct A were higher when MOCA was administered by ip injection versus oral gavage. Phenobarbital pretreatment increased the amount of adduct A approximately 12-fold. The pathway leading to the formation of adduct A in DNA from HUC appeared to be saturated at the concentrations used: 2.5, 5, and 10 microM. However, an additional adduct (E) was observed at the 10 microM treatment level only. A major DNA adduct was detected in the target tissue of rats and target human cells for MOCA-induced carcinogenesis, thus making it useful as a biomarker of exposure. Other DNA adducts were also observed with the different doses and routes of exposure investigated."

To characterize regions of Tn4399 involved in mobilization, we have isolated and analyzed subcloned fragments of Tn4399 in E. coli, as well as mutations within the element. We have identified a ""mobilization cassette"" within a 2.8-kb region of Tn4399 which, when cloned into mobilization-deficient plasmids, allows these plasmids to be mobilized in trans by the IncP plasmids pRK231 and R751. The 2.8-kb region has been sequenced, and several open reading frames have been identified. Mutants defective in two genes, designated mocA and mocB, coding for deduced products of 36.4 and 16.4 kDa, respectively, cannot be mobilized by either IncP plasmid; these mutants can be complemented in the presence of the respective wild-type genes in trans. This suggests that the putative MocA and MocB proteins have a role in the mobilization process. The 36.4-kDa MocA protein contains a 14-amino-acid sequence which is closely related to a highly conserved motif within DNA relaxases encoded by a wide variety of conjugal or mobilizable plasmids. Subcloning experiments also lead to the localization of an oriT region within a 199-bp fragment, internal to the mobilization cassette."

We report the characterization of a novel cyclophilin (Moca-cyp) isolated from Drosophila melanogaster. The single-copy Moca-cyp gene, which is localized on chromosome 3R, was cloned and sequenced. The sequence alignment of the gene against Moca-cyp cDNA allowed us to define its intron/exon structure and to identify a variant cDNA corresponding to an alternatively spliced mRNA. By embryo in situ RNA hybridization and immunostaining, we show that the expression of Moca-cyp is regulated during embryogenesis of Drosophila. The 120-kDa nuclear Moca-cyp protein belongs to a subfamily of large cyclophilins sharing structural and enzymatic features: their highly conserved N-terminal PPIase domain is extended by a positively charged and divergent C-terminal tail. Compared with cyclophilin 18, the enzymatic activity carried by the PPIase domain of Moca-cyp is low, exhibits characteristic substrate specificity, and shows a reduced sensitivity to the drug cyclosporin A (CsA). The reduced affinity for CsA is one of the typical features linking members of this subfamily and is probably the consequence of two amino acid substitutions within their active site. Another structural feature shared by members of this subfamily is a conserved polypeptidic segment (""moca"" domain) that we report for the first time. The moca domain is located within the C-terminal tail and is the exclusive hallmark of a group of large cyclophilins found in multicellular organisms of the animal kingdom."

In this study the effects of in vitro exposure to MOCA and dapsone (over a dose range of 1-200 microM on spleen and liver immune cell functions were investigated. MOCA exposure caused a dose-dependent inhibition of natural immune activities (i.e. natural killer, NK and natural P815 killer, NPK) and mitogen-stimulated proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes, with 50% inhibition (IC50) of splenic-cell activities occurring at 145, 85, 21 and 31 microM, respectively. Liver NK and NPK activities were less sensitive to MOCA exposure and exhibited higher IC50's of 165 and 160 microM, respectively. Dapsone exposure slightly enhanced both T- and B-cell mitogenesis at low doses (1 microM) but decreased B-cell mitogenesis at high doses (IC50 = 130 microM). Natural tumouricidal activities were generally unaffected by dapsone, whilst natural cytotoxic (NC) activity was unaffected by both compounds. These results indicate that MOCA is generally immunotoxic in vitro, and may have the potential to enhance the carcinogenic effects of its genotoxic metabolite by inhibiting the tumour surveillance activities of the immune system. The relationship between immune effects and the carcinogenicity of dapsone remains unclear."

Since metabolic activation and formation of DNA adducts are believed to be important for the induction of these effects, DNA was treated in vitro with radiolabeled N-hydroxy-MOCA, the presumed proximate carcinogenic metabolite formed in vivo. Two major radioactive peaks were observed after HPLC separation of enzymatic hydrolysates. The two products were analyzed by MS and characterized as N-(deoxyadenosine-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol and N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorotoluene. The same adducts were also the major adducts formed in DNA of tissues from rats treated with radiolabeled MOCA. They were eliminated from rat liver with non-linear kinetics, in agreement with observations made for other carcinogens. The selective reaction of N-hydroxy-MOCA with DNA-adenine and the formation of single arylamine ring adducts suggest a substitution mechanism involving an intermediate with strong SN1 character, aided by the negative inductive effect of the ortho-chlorine. Due to tautomer formation, the initial adduct may be inherently unstable and undergo cleavage at the 1'-carbon-methylene bond to yield the observed adducts."

Metabolic activation and formation of DNA adducts are considered to be critical steps in this process; and two major C8-adenine adducts have been shown to be formed in vitro by reaction with the proximate carcinogenic metabolite N-hydroxy-MOCA. MOCA-DNA adducts have also been detected in vivo in treated rats and in exfoliated urothelium of a worker accidentally exposed to MOCA. Thus, the aim of this study was to detect and quantify DNA adducts in the urinary bladder of dogs exposed to MOCA and thereby provide data that could be useful for risk assessment after human exposure to MOCA. Beagle dogs were treated with single and multiple doses of MOCA and DNA adduct levels were determined in liver and bladder epithelium. After a single dose, adduct levels in the liver were 1.5-fold higher than that in the bladder epithelium. Adduct levels in these two organs increased 3- to 5-fold after 10 doses and adducts in the liver were then 2.8-fold higher than that in the bladder epithelium. The levels found in these two organs after single exposures were compared, per unit exposure dose, with that reported for other carcinogenic aromatic amines. The comparison showed that MOCA was as effective in DNA adduct formation as most other potent urinary bladder carcinogens. These results suggest that MOCA may have high carcinogenic potential in humans and are consistent with the recent classification of MOCA as a probable human carcinogen."

The protein, named MocA, shows 22% amino acid sequence identity to E. coli MobA, the specific GTP:molybdopterin guanylyltransferase for molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide biosynthesis. MocA is essential for the activity of the MCD-containing enzymes aldehyde oxidoreductase YagTSR and the xanthine dehydrogenases XdhABC and XdhD. Using a fully defined in vitro assay, we showed that MocA, Mo-MPT, CTP, and MgCl2 are required and sufficient for MCD biosynthesis in vitro. The activity of MocA is specific for CTP; other nucleotides such as ATP and GTP were not utilized. In the defined in vitro system a turnover number of 0.37+/-0.01 min(-1) was obtained. A 1:1 binding ratio of MocA to Mo-MPT and CTP was determined to monomeric MocA with dissociation constants of 0.23+/-0.02 microm for CTP and 1.17+/-0.18 microm for Mo-MPT. We showed that MocA was also able to convert MPT to MCD in the absence of molybdate, however, with only one catalytic turnover. The addition of molybdate after one turnover gave rise to a higher MCD production, revealing that MCD remains bound to MocA in the absence of molybdate.

The determination of the covalently bound reaction products to hemoglobin (Hb) has been investigated as a biomonitoring method for occupational exposure to this potential human carcinogen. Initial studies using the 14C-ring-labeled MOCA showed that 24 hr after a single IP dosage to rats (3.74 mumole/kg), 0.08% of the administered dose was adducted to the Hb, and base hydrolysis liberated 38% of the bound radioactivity. The only product released on hydrolysis was the parent diamine. A specific and sensitive assay procedure using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been developed for determining the base-released MOCA adduct down to levels of 20 pmole/g Hb. This method has been used to establish a linear dose-response relationship in IP dosed rats between production of the adduct and dose of MOCA (3.74-44.94 mumole/kg). It is proposed to use analysis of the Hb adduct as a dosimeter for industrial workers exposed to MOCA."

The combination of CI and HF is associated with increased mortality, repeat hospitalization, and poor quality of life. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the presence of CI in older patients with HF using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief screening instrument for CI. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study using the MoCA in outpatients with HF who were ≥ 65 years of age. Forty-four patients (mean ± SD 76 ± 6.6 years of age) completed the MoCA. More than 70% of patients scored below the MoCA cutoff score of 26, suggesting the presence of CI. However, 91% of patients with New York Heart Association classes III to IV versus 52% of patients with classes I to II had a MoCA score < 26 (p = 0.004). Patients with a recent hospital admission were more likely to have a MoCA score < 26 versus patients without a recent hospital admission (89% vs 62%, respectively, p < 0.045). Cognitive domain subscores showing significant differences (p <0.01) were short-term memory, visuospatial function, executive function, and language. In conclusion, this study sample represented a group of older patients with HF and no suspected or documented CI, but screening with the MoCA detected CI in >70% of the sample. The presence of CI was significantly more common in patients with advanced HF symptoms or a recent hospitalization. Future studies need to determine if the MoCA can identify the presence of CI that is predictive of adverse clinical outcomes in the HF population."
CD010775,0,9503288,0,Occupational applications of a human cancer research model.,"Many bladder cancers are indolent, and since there are no biomarkers to predict progression, the prognosis is problematic. Utilizing an in vitro/in vivo human uroepithelial cell (SV-HUC.PC) transformation system, we investigated several molecular events occurring along the continuum of exposure to disease outcome as potential biomarkers for occupational carcinogenesis. The model also served to generate information on the occupational carcinogenicity of N-hydroxy-4,4'-methylene bis(2-chloroaniline) [N-OH-MOCA]. Two of 14 groups of SV-HUC.PC treated with various concentrations of N-OH-MOCA formed carcinomas in athymic nude mice. Each of the biomarkers investigated demonstrated potential for interventions/prevention applications of occupational bladder cancers but will require validation and further evaluation.

The MoCA norms were established considering significant influential factors. The optimal cutoff points were 13/14 for illiterate individuals, 19/20 for individuals with 1 to 6 years of education, and 24/25 for individuals with 7 or more years of education. With the optimal cutoffs, the sensitivity of the MoCA was 83.8% for all cognitive impairments, 80.5% for MCI and 96.9% for dementia, and the specificity for identifying CN was 82.5%.

Of these, the vast majority of FAD-linked mutations are within PS1. There has been an extensive effort to identify proteins that functionally interact with PS1 and PS2 because of their clear roles in FAD. The goal of this review is to describe these proteins and to discuss in more detail the probable biological functions of a subset of the better-studied interacting proteins. In particular, the review examines APP, Notch, nicastrin, modifier of cellular adhesion (MOCA), beta-catenin, and the group of proteins involved in cell death, calcium metabolism and cell adhesion. We argue that, although a few of the interacting proteins are unambiguously involved in well-studied cellular pathways, their exact roles within these pathways have not been clearly defined, and indeed might vary between cell types. We also question the physiological relevance of some of the work linking PS to cell death pathways. Finally, we point out the value of using flies and worms to sort out the often contradictory work in the PS field, and we mention how knowledge of PS-interacting pathways will contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies in AD."
CD010775,0,3365833,0,"Metabolism of 4,4'-methylene-bis-2-chloroaniline (MOCA) by rats in vivo and formation of N-hydroxy MOCA by rat and human liver microsomes.","The metabolism of 4,4'-methylene-bis-2-chloroaniline (MOCA) was investigated because it is an animal carcinogen to which humans have been exposed. In CD rats, where MOCA is a hepatocarcinogen, less than or equal to 0.2% of an oral dose of [14C]MOCA was recovered unchanged in the urine; enzymatic hydrolysis and extraction of urinary radioactivity indicated the presence of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In rat bile, the predominant metabolite was N-glucuronyl MOCA. Liver microsomes from male CD rats or human males (surgical specimens) were incubated in vitro with [14C] MOCA. Metabolite formation, which was dependent upon reduced pyridine nucleotides and intact microsomes, was quantitated by TLC and HPLC using appropriate chemically synthesized standards. N-Hydroxylation of MOCA occurred at a rate of 335 +/- 119 pmol/min/mg rat microsomal protein (n = 3) versus 230 or 765 (n = 2) with microsomes from humans; the product was identified by isotopic dilution for both species. The rates of 5-hydroxy-MOCA (o-aminophenol) formation were 92 +/- 33 (rats) and 7, 35 (human); rates for the benzhydrol derivative were 82 +/- 12 (rats) and 60, 160 (human). In rats, all three rates were elevated 4- to 8-fold by pretreatment with phenobarbital, which also enhanced the formation of partially characterized polar derivatives that appeared to result from oxidation and cleavage at the methylene carbon. The latter pathway typically amounted to 50-100% of the 4,4'-diamino-3,3'-dichlorobenzhydrol value in control or pretreated animals. Thus, rats metabolize MOCA extensively and the pathways include N-hydroxlation, which is regarded as an obligatory step in metabolic activation of arylamines. The presence of MOCA N-hydroxylase in human liver supports the hypothesis that exposure of humans to MOCA entails a carcinogenic risk."

The hCOX isozymes activated all substrates tested, activation varied from barely detectable for IQ (0.76 and 1.52 pmol bound/mg DNA for COX-1 and -2, respectively) to a high of 65 and 117 pmol bound/mg DNA for COX-1 and -2, respectively, for the activation of MOCA. BZ, which is an excellent peroxidase substrate, did not exhibit high DNA binding levels in hCOX assays and this phenomenon was found to be due to high levels of binding to protein, which effectively competed with the DNA for binding in the assay. The demonstrated ability of the COX enzymes to activate a variety of environmental and dietary carcinogens indicates a potential role for COX in the activation pathway of aromatic and heterocyclic amines and polycyclic hydrocarbons at extra-hepatic sites during early or late stages of carcinogenesis."

To further our understanding of DNA transfer in B. fragilis, we isolated and characterized a new transfer factor, cLV25. cLV25 was isolated from B. fragilis LV25 by its capture on the nonmobilizable Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vector pGAT400DeltaBglII. Similar to other Bacteroides sp. transfer factors, cLV25 was mobilized in E. coli by the conjugative plasmid R751. Using Tn1000 mutagenesis and deletion analysis of cLV25, two mobilization genes, bmgA and bmgB, were identified, whose predicted proteins have similarity to DNA relaxases and mobilization proteins, respectively. In particular, BmgA and BmgB were homologous to MocA and MocB, respectively, the two mobilization proteins of the B. fragilis mobilizable transposon Tn4399. A cis-acting origin of transfer (oriT) was localized to a 353-bp region that included nearly all of the intergenic region between bmgB and orf22 and overlapped with the 3' end of orf22. This oriT contained a putative nic site sequence but showed no significant similarity to the oriT regions of other transfer factors, including Tn4399. Despite the lack of sequence similarity between the oriTs of cLV25 and Tn4399, a mutation in the cLV25 putative DNA relaxase, bmgA, was partially complemented by Tn4399. In addition to the functional cross-reaction with Tn4399, a second distinguishing feature of cLV25 is that predicted proteins have similarity to proteins encoded not only by Tn4399 but by several Bacteroides sp. transfer factors, including NBU1, NBU2, CTnDOT, Tn4555, and Tn5520."

This study aimed to assess occupational exposure to MOCA using as indices: (1) the post-work urinary output of MOCA; (2) urinary thioethers, assuming that conjugation with glutathione might be a significant pathway for the elimination of putative electrophilic metabolites of MOCA; and (3) sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) frequency in peripheral lymphocytes as an indicator of genetic damage. Process workers at a polyurethane production unit were found to have up to 38 mumol MOCA mol-1 creatinine in their urine at the end of a work shift. Smaller quantities were found in the urine of laboratory and supervisory staff, but none was detected in the urine of a group of office and sales staff from an unrelated industry, who served as unexposed controls. There was no evidence of MOCA-related urinary thioether output. There was a graded increase in SCE frequency from controls to process workers, consistent with their apparent exposure to MOCA. Administration of MOCA to rats (5 daily i.p. injections of 125 or 250 mg kg-1 resulted in dose-related increases in MOCA excretion and in lymphocyte SCE frequency, but there was no change in thioether output. These results indicate that urinary thioether excretion is inappropriate for monitoring MOCA exposure, but that where MOCA exposure can be demonstrated, by the presence of MOCA in urine, this is associated with genetic damage in both man and in the rat."

In this study, a liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for determination of amines in biological samples as perfluorofatty amides derivatives is presented. The method enables determination of diamines such as methylene diamine (MDA), toluene diamine (TDA), naphthalene diamine (NDA), hexamethylene diamine (HDA), isophorone diamine (IPDA), methylenedi(cyclohexylamine)(HMDA) and 4,4'-methylene-(2-chloroaniline)(MOCA) in human urine and plasma. The work-up procedure included hydrolysis of the biological samples with 3 M H(2)SO(4) at 100 degrees C for 16 h and extraction of the amines into toluene, where derivatisation of the amines with perfluorofatty acid anhydride was performed. Following removal of excess reagent and the acid formed and an exchange of solvent, the derivatives were analysed using gradient elution with an acetonitrile/water mobile phase composition and electrospray ionisation (ESI) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of [M - H](-)-->[M - H - 120](-) or [119](-). Several perfluorofatty acid anhydrides were evaluated as derivatisation reagents, but the LC chromatographic properties of the pentafluoropropionic acid anhydride (PFPA) derivatives were favourable. Quantification of amine-PFPA derivatives was performed using deuterium labelled amine-PFPA derivatives as internals standards with good precision and linearity in the investigated range of 0-20 ng ml(-1) urine. The instrumental detection limits for the amine-PFPA derivatives were 0.2-3 fmol for MRM of [M - H](-)-->[119](-) and 0.3-8 fmol for [M - H](-)-->[M - H - 120](-). In 10 urine and 6 plasma samples from workers exposed to isocyanates, determination of TDA and MDA as PFPA derivatives was performed using LC-MS/MS and a reference GC-MS method.

DHGN was shown to chelate nickel by atomic absorption spectrometry, and DHGN-containing monolayers specifically bound gold conjugates of His-tagged proteins. Using PC + DHGN monolayers, we examined membrane-bound arrays of an N-terminal His-tagged Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) capsid (CA) protein, His-MoCA, and in vivo studies suggest that in vitro-derived His-MoCA arrays reflect some of the Gag protein interactions which occur in assembling virus particles. The His-MoCA proteins formed extensive two-dimensional (2D) protein crystals, with reflections out to 9.5 A resolution. The image-analyzed 2D projection of His-MoCA arrays revealed a distinct cage-like network. The asymmetry of the individual building blocks of the network led to the formation of two types of hexamer rings, surrounding protein-free cage holes. These results predict that Gag hexamers constitute a retrovirus core substructure, and that cage hole sizes define an exclusion limit for entry of retrovirus envelope proteins, or other plasma membrane proteins, into virus particles. We believe that the 2D crystallization method will permit the detailed analysis of retroviral Gag proteins and other His-tagged proteins."

Tilted and untilted micrographs from crystals formed by purified his-MoCA proteins incubated beneath lipid monolayers containing nickel-chelating lipids were used in 3D reconstructions. The 2D crystals had unit cell dimensions of a=72.6 A, b=72.5 A and gamma=119.5 degrees, but appeared to have no intrinsic symmetry (p1) in 3D, in contrast to the trigonal or hexagonal appearance of their 2D projections. Membrane-bound his-MoCA proteins showed a strand-like organization, apparently with dimer building blocks. Membrane-proximal regions, or putative N-terminal domains (NTDs), dimerized with different partners than the membrane-distal putative C-terminal domains (CTDs). Evidence also suggests that CTDs can adopt alternate orientations relative to their NTDs, forming interstrand connections. Our results are consistent with helical-spiral models for retrovirus particle assembly, but are not easily reconcilable with icosahedral models."

Three discrete adducts were eluted on HPLC following enzymic hydrolysis to the nucleoside level. Three adducts, with the same retention times on HPLC, were present after i.p. injection of the N-acetyl derivative of MOCA tritiated in the benzene rings. Only two of these adducts were found when the N-acetyl derivative, tritiated on the acetyl group, was used. Thus, at least one of the adducts formed by MOCA is not acetylated. The N-hydroxy derivative of MOCA was synthesised and reacted with DNA in vitro. Following enzymic hydrolysis of this DNA, the major product was shown to co-elute with the radiolabelled non-acetylated adduct produced in the liver DNA of animals injected with [ring-3H]MOCA. This same compound was also isolated following the reaction of N-hydroxy-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol with DNA, and subsequent enzymic hydrolysis. The NMR and mass spectra of the synthetic adduct were consistent with N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol. Thus, the major adduct formed in vivo has involved cleavage of the bond between the methylene bridge and one of the aromatic nuclei of MOCA."

Especially in the latter case, it is important not only to quantify target cell death as an endpoint, but also to observe the interaction and to recover effectors and targets for further analysis. We present a new method that offers considerable improvements for both types of applications, in comparison with the standard radioactivity release assays used today. The morphometric cytotoxicity assay (Mo.C.A.) estimates the extent of target cell lysis by measuring the openings that appear in a confluent monolayer of adherent cells as killed cells detach from the plastic on which they were spread. Two hours after the inoculation of the effector cells, nonadherent killer and dead target cells are washed off and the remaining monolayer is fixed and stained with Coomassie blue. Elementary computer-assisted image analysis allows then to calculate the percentage of open space, which is a parameter for the extent of lysis. As the Mo.C.A. is easy, and does not rely on the use of radioactive compounds or sophisticated equipment, we provide evidence that it should be valuable for the routine analysis of cytotoxicity in various cell samples. In addition, the method offers great flexibility in the choice of target cells and allows for continuous microscopic observation of the live cultures. The interaction can also be stopped at any time, and the effector and (unlabeled) target cells can be recovered separately. Therefore, the method should also offer new possibilities for the basic study of killer cell biology."

As many as 28 consecutive daily doses of [14C]MOCA at 28.1 mumol/kg body wt (5 microCi/day) were administered and rats were euthanized at weekly intervals for 7 weeks. MOCA adduct formation for globin and serum albumin was evaluated by determination of [14C]MOCA covalent binding. The covalent binding associated with globin showed a linear increase over the 28-day exposure period with 342 fmol/mg globin 24 hr after the final dose. More extensive covalent binding was detected for albumin with 443 fmol/mg albumin after the final dose, but increases were not linear. After cessation of dosing, the albumin adduct levels decreased rapidly (t1/2 = 4.6 days) in relation to globin adduct levels (t1/2 = 16.1 days). The MOCA-globin adduct t1/2 is consistent with that determined after a single 281 mumol/kg oral dose of MOCA. Significant differences related to route of administration were detected for 24-hr globin covalent binding with ip greater than po greater than dermal. Distribution of undifferentiated [14C]MOCA was highest in the liver at 24 hr with tissue levels for liver greater than kidney greater than lung greater than spleen greater than testes greater than urinary bladder. Induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes by administration of phenobarbital (100 mg/kg/day/3 days) resulted in a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in MOCA-globin adduct formation detected with 33.5 pmol/mg globin for induced rats versus 13.6 pmol/mg globin for control rats.

In addition, prophylactic cranial irradiation was administered concurrently with thoracic irradiation to 194 patients receiving CAML-HC, VCAM, or MOCA. Seventy-two patients had disease confined to the chest (Stage IIIM0), 30 patients had disease in the chest plus ipsilateral supraclavicular nodal involvement (Stage IIIM0SCN+), and 138 patients had distant metastatic disease (Stage IIIM1); the median survivals were 15.2 months, 12.6 months, and 8.4 months, respectively. The overall complete response rate was 30% and the overall response rate (complete and partial) was 76%. The overall response rates by stage were 86% for Stage IIIM0, 90% for Stage IIIM0SCN+, and 67% for Stage IIIM1. Eight patients (3%) were alive and free of disease at 24 months. Due to continued disease relapse in this group (four of eight patients), long-term survivors should not be identified for a minimum of 3.5 years from the time of initial therapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) effectively reduced the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapse in patients with a complete response to therapy (44% relapse without PCI versus 13% relapse with PCI, P less than 0.01). More effective chemotherapy is required for the successful treatment and improved long-term survival of patients with SCLC."

The authors examined the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the MoCA (MoCA-K) in elderly outpatients. The MoCA-K, a Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and neuropsychological batteries were administered to 196 elderly persons (mild Alzheimer's disease [AD] = 44, MCI = 37, normal controls [NC] = 115). MoCA-K scores were highly correlated with those of MMSE and CDR. Using a cutoff score of 22/23, the MoCA-K had an excellent sensitivity of 89% and a good specificity of 84% for screening MCI. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were good. The results obtained show that the MoCA-K is brief, reliable, and suitable for use as a screening tool to screen MCI patients in elderly outpatient clinic settings."

Rhizobium strains that are capable of utilizing certain inositol derivatives are better colonizers of their host plants. We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the myo-inositol dehydrogenase gene (idhA) of Sinorhizobium fredii USDA191, the first enzyme responsible for inositol catabolism. The deduced IdhA protein has a molecular mass of 34,648 Da and shows significant sequence similarity with protein sequences of Sinorhizobium meliloti IdhA and MocA; Bacillus subtilis IolG, YrbE, and YucG; and Streptomyces griseus StrI. S. fredii USDA191 idhA mutants revealed no detectable myo-inositol dehydrogenase activity and failed to grow on myo-inositol as a sole carbon source. Northern blot analysis and idhA-lacZ fusion expression studies indicate that idhA is inducible by myo-inositol. S. fredii USDA191 idhA mutant was drastically affected in its ability to reduce nitrogen and revealed deteriorating bacteroids inside the nodules. The number of bacteria recovered from such nodules was about threefold lower than the number of bacteria isolated from nodules initiated by S. fredii USDA191. In addition, the idhA mutant was also severely affected in its ability to compete with the wild-type strain in nodulating soybean. Under competitive conditions, nodules induced on soybean roots were predominantly occupied by the parent strain, even when the idhA mutant was applied at a 10-fold numerical advantage. Thus, we conclude that a functional idhA gene is required for efficient nitrogen fixation and for competitive nodulation of soybeans by S. fredii USDA191."

Most patients have only minor complaints of cognitive dysfunction and assessment with usual tests is not sensitive enough. The study included 26 stroke-free patients (15 male and 11 female), mean age 66.3 +/- 8.7 years, with advanced internal carotid artery stenosis or/and occlusion (ICAs/o). Left ICAs/o was present in 11, right ICAs/o in eight, and bilateral ICAs/o in seven patients. History was taken and assessment of risk factors, brain CT scan and neurologic examination were performed. Cognitive functions were tested by use of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). All patients were asymptomatic, except for two patients that presented with repeated transient ischemic attack (TIA). In all subjects median MMSE scores were within the normal range (27.5; IQ range 25-29), while mean MoCA scores were abnormal (22.6 +/- 3.4). Patients with left ICAs/o scored slightly better on MoCA (22.9 +/- 3.3) than patients with right ICAs/o (22.4 +/- 4.0). Delayed recall MoCA subtest was impaired in 22/26 patients and visuospatial subtest in 23/26 patients; however, there was no statistically significant difference according to the side of ICAs/o. Patients with the presence of one or two risk factors scored lower on visuospatial/executive MoCA subtests (P = 0.018) as compared with patients with multiple risk factors. MoCA proved to be a sensitive tool for assessment of mild cognitive changes in stroke-free patients with advanced ICAs/o.

We included 60 volunteers divided into 3 groups according to age and presence of cognitive impairment (healthy subjects 30-40 years old, controls 60-70 years old and subjects with mild cognitive impairment 60-70 years old). We excluded individuals with moderate and severe carotid stenosis. There was a decreasing trend in the mean blood flow velocities of the intracranial blood vessels due to age increase, but it was not statistically significant. BHI values were 1.66±0.20 in the first group, 1.35±0.31 in the second and 0.69±0.30 in the third group. There was a statistically significant difference between the first two groups and the group with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score (29±1, 27±1 and 19±1 respectively), no statistically significant difference was found in Mini mental state exam (MMSE) score (29±1, 28±1, and 28±1 respectively). After regressing out age and conventional vascular risk factors, we found a good correlation between the decreasing trend in BHI values and MoCA score, and no statistically significant correlation between the BHI values and MMSE score. Results of our study show that BHI test as a parameter of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (intracranial small vessel wall dysfunction) might differentiate individuals with early cognitive decline from healthy subjects."
CD010775,0,19937448,0,Validation studies of the Portuguese experimental version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): confirmatory factor analysis.,"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening instrument created with the purpose of overcoming some of the insufficiencies of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MoCA evaluates more cognitive areas and is comprised of more complex tasks as compared with the MMSE, which makes it a more sensitive instrument in the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a state that often progresses to dementia. In this study we performed an analysis of the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Portuguese experimental version of the MoCA in a clinical sample of 212 subjects with MCI and several dementia subtypes in a memory clinic setting. Additionally, we performed a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess the MoCA's latent factorial structure. In a clinical population, the MoCA is a valid and reliable instrument with good psychometric properties, revealing high sensitivity in identifying MCI and dementia patients who generally score within the normal range on the MMSE. By using the parcels method, CFA results showed very good/excellent adjustment indexes. The practical implications of this CFA study allow us to propose a two factor model factorial structure for the MoCA: a first factor designated Memory, which includes memory, language and orientation subtests (the latter being closely correlated with the former), and a second factor designated Attention/Executive Functions, comprised of attention, executive functions and visuospacial abilities tasks."

The investigation was carried out in a Portuguese community-based sample of 650 cognitively healthy adults, who were representative of the distribution observed in the Portuguese population. Educational level and age significantly contributed to the prediction of the MoCA scores, explaining 49% of the variance.

When a second plasmid encoding a dedicated transport system for MOP was introduced, these cells grew well with both AGR and MOP. Transposon insertion mutagenesis and subcloning identified a 5.7-kb region of BamHI fragment 4 that encodes functions required for the degradation of MOP. DNA sequence analysis revealed seven putative genes in this region: mocD (moc for mannityl opine catabolism) and mocE, oriented from right to left, and mocRCBAS, oriented from left to right. Significant identities exist at the nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence levels between these moc genes and the mas genes that are responsible for opine biosynthesis in crown gall tumors. MocD is a homolog of Mas2, the anabolic conjugase encoded by mas2'. MocE and MocC are related to the amino half and the carboxyl half, respectively, of Mas1 (MOP reductase), the second enzyme for MOP biosynthesis. These results indicate that the moc and mas genes evolved from a common origin. MocR and MocS are related to each other and to a putative repressor for the AGR degradation system encoded by the rhizogenic plasmid pRiA4. MocB and MocA are homologs of 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. Mutations in mocD and mocE, but not mocC, are suppressed by functions encoded by the chromosome or the 450-kb megaplasmid present in many Agrobacterium isolates. We propose that moc genes derived from genes located elsewhere in the bacterial genome and that the tumor-expressed mas genes evolved from the bacterial moc genes."

It is therefore of interest to identify the human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes involved in MOCA N-oxidation, the primary reaction involved in the formation of an electrophilic product. Human liver microsomes were fractionated and MOCA N-oxidation activity was monitored through the procedure. The most active enzyme fraction corresponded to P450 3A4, as determined by immunochemical assays and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Yeast recombinant P450 3A4 also had MOCA N-oxidation activity. Purified human liver P450 2A6 showed catalytic activity; however, anti-P450 2A6 inhibited less than 20% of the microsomal activity while anti-P450 3A4 inhibited up to 75%. Levels of marker activities of both P450 3A4 (nifedipine oxidation) and P450 2A6 (coumarin 7-hydroxylation) were measured in a set of human liver microsomes and both were correlated with MOCA N-oxidation rates. Gestodene and troleandomycin inhibited up to half of the microsomal MOCA N-hydroxylation activity but 7,8-benzoflavone showed only slight inhibition. Anti-P450 3A4 inhibited (up to 80% of) the microsomal transformation of MOCA to a product genotoxic as judged by bacterial SOS response. The work indicates that P450 3A4 makes a major contribution to human liver microsomal MOCA N-oxidation, and P450 2A6 has a minor role. P450 1A2, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of many arylamines, does not contribute to a great extent."

The results revealed significant correlations between the total score on the MoCA and total score on the RBANS and MMSE, though the strength of the correlations was more robust between the MoCA and the RBANS. Modest correlations between individual subscales of the MoCA and neuroimaging variables were evident, but no patterns of shared variance emerged between the MoCA total score and neuroimaging indices. In contrast, total brain volume correlated significantly with total score on the RBANS. These results suggest that additional studies are needed to define the significance of MoCA scores relative to brain integrity among an older population."

CD010775,0,7845353,0,Molecular and genetic characterization of the rhizopine catabolism (mocABRC) genes of Rhizobium meliloti L5-30.,"Rhizopine (L-3-O-methyl-scyllo-inosamine, 3-O-MSI) is a symbiosis-specific compound, which is synthesized in nitrogen-fixing nodules of Medicago sativa induced by Rhizobium meliloti strain L5-30. 3-O-MSI is thought to function as an unusual growth substrate for R. meliloti L5-30, which carries a locus (mos) responsible for its synthesis closely linked to a locus (moc) responsible for its degradation. Here, the essential moc genes were delimited by Tn5 mutagenesis and shown to be organized into two regions, separated by 3 kb of DNA. The DNA sequence of a 9-kb fragment spanning the two moc regions was determined, and four genes were identified that play an essential role in rhizopine catabolism (mocABC and mocR). The analysis of the DNA sequence and the amino acid sequence of the deduced protein products revealed that MocA resembles NADH-dependent dehydrogenases. MocB exhibits characteristic features of periplasmic-binding proteins that are components of high-affinity transport systems. MocC does not share significant homology with any protein in the database. MocR shows homology with the GntR class of bacterial regulator proteins. These results suggest that the mocABC genes are involved in the uptake and subsequent degradation of rhizopine, whereas mocR is likely to play a regulatory role."
CD010775,0,8749062,0,The quality of DNA double-strand breaks: a Monte Carlo simulation of the end-structure of strand breaks produced by protons and alpha particles.,"The quality of DNA damage induced by protons and alpha-particles of various linear energy transfer (LET) was studied. The aim was to single out specific lesions in the DNA molecule that might lead to biological endpoints such as inactivation. A DNA model coupled with a track structure code (MOCA-15) were used to simulate the lesions induced on the two helixes. Four categories of DNA breaks were considered: single-strand breaks (ssb), blunt-ended double-strand breaks (dsb, with no or few overlapping bases), sticky-ended double-strand breaks (with cohesive free ends of many bases), and deletions (complex lesions which involve at least two dsb within a small number of base pairs). Calculations were carried out assuming various sets of parameters characterizing the production of these different DNA breaks. No large variations in the yields of ssb and blunt- or sticky-ended dsb were found in the LET range between 10 and 200 keV/mu m. On the other hand, the yield of deletions increases up to about 100 keV/mu m and seems to reach a plateau at higher LET values. In the LET interval from 30 to 60 keV/mu m, protons proved to be more efficient than alpha-particles in inducing deletions. The induction of these complex lesions is thus dependent not simply on LET but also on the characteristics of the track structure. Comparison with RBE values for cell killing shows that this special class of dsb might play an important role in radiation-induced cell inactivation."

CD010775,0,22649062,0,Brain metabolite alterations and cognitive dysfunction in early Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early cognitive decline that progresses at later stages to dementia and severe movement disorder. HD is caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine triplet-repeat expansion mutation in the Huntingtin gene, allowing early diagnosis by genetic testing. This study aimed to identify the relationship of N-acetylaspartate and other brain metabolites to cognitive function in HD-mutation carriers by using high-field-strength magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 7 Tesla. Twelve individuals with the HD mutation in premanifest or early-stage disease versus 12 healthy controls underwent (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (7.2 mL voxel in the posterior cingulate cortex) at 7 Tesla, and also T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging. All participants received standardized tests of cognitive functioning including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and standardized quantified neurological examination within an hour before scanning. Individuals with the HD mutation had significantly lower posterior cingulate cortex N-acetylaspartate (-9.6%, P = .02) and glutamate (-10.1%, P = .02) levels than did controls. In contrast, in this small group, measures of brain morphology including striatal and ventricle volumes did not differ significantly. Linear regression with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores revealed significant correlations with N-acetylaspartate (r(2) = 0.50, P = .01) and glutamate (NAA) (r(2) = 0.64, P = .002) in HD subjects. Our data suggest a relationship between reduced N-acetylaspartate and glutamate levels in the posterior cingulate cortex with cognitive decline in the early stages of HD. N-acetylaspartate and glutamate magnetic resonance spectroscopy signals of the posterior cingulate cortex region may serve as potential biomarkers of disease progression or treatment outcome in HD and other neurodegenerative disorders with early cognitive dysfunction, when structural brain changes are still minor."

CD010775,0,20971862,0,"Inositol catabolism, a key pathway in sinorhizobium meliloti for competitive host nodulation.","The nitrogen-fixing symbiont of alfalfa, Sinorhizobium meliloti, is able to use myo-inositol as the sole carbon source. Putative inositol catabolism genes (iolA and iolRCDEB) have been identified in the S. meliloti genome based on their similarities with the Bacillus subtilis iol genes. In this study, functional mutational analysis revealed that the iolA and iolCDEB genes are required for growth not only with the myo-isomer but also for growth with scyllo- and d-chiro-inositol as the sole carbon source. An additional, hypothetical dehydrogenase of the IdhA/MocA/GFO family encoded by the smc01163 gene was found to be essential for growth with scyllo-inositol, whereas the idhA-encoded myo-inositol dehydrogenase was responsible for the oxidation of d-chiro-inositol. The putative regulatory iolR gene, located upstream of iolCDEB, encodes a repressor of the iol genes, negatively regulating the activity of the myo- and the scyllo-inositol dehydrogenases. Mutants with insertions in the iolA, smc01163, and individual iolRCDE genes could not compete against the wild type in a nodule occupancy assay on alfalfa plants. Thus, a functional inositol catabolic pathway and its proper regulation are important nutritional or signaling factors in the S. meliloti-alfalfa symbiosis."
CD010775,0,21340519,0,Loss of callosal fibre integrity in healthy elderly with age-related white matter changes.,"Age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) appear to correspond to a continuum from normal functioning to clinically overt neurological syndromes. Disturbance of the structural integrity of cerebral fibre tracts-the so-called cerebral network-by ARWMC might be one explanation for this development. From 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 34 healthy elderly subjects (60-82 years) we calculated the lesion volume of ARWMC and the area of the corpus callosum (CC). Gait, balance and cognition were assessed. We compared these findings in those with mild (n = 22) and advanced (n = 12) ARWMC and performed tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to analyze white matter structural integrity. In subjects with advanced ARWMC, TBSS showed a significant decrease of fractional anisotropy (FA) in several large tracts of the white matter including the CC; total CC, CC2 and CC5 areas were significantly smaller. Despite these morphological changes, tests of gait, balance and cognition as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were in the normal range for both groups; only the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) detected executive and language dysfunction in those with advanced ARWMC. Loss of tissue integrity and atrophy of the CC secondary to spatially remote lesions in the peri- and paraventricular white matter in ARWMC appear to be already detectable in healthy elderly individuals."

Exposure of AHH-1 cells to the putative carcinogenic metabolite of MOCA, N-OH-MOCA, induced a 6-fold increase in mutant frequency and resulted in base pair substitutions primarily at A:T base pairs. In contrast, exposure to PBQ did not result in an increased mutant frequency although this compound was significantly more cytotoxic than N-OH-MOCA at equimolar doses. The induction of mutations at A:T sites by N-OH-MOCA is consistent with the type of DNA damage known to be produced by MOCA and provides a specific marker of genotoxic damage for exposed populations."
CD010775,0,20592177,0,Absence of mitochondrial activation during levosimendan inotropic action in perfused paced guinea pig hearts as demonstrated by modular control analysis.,"Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer developed for the treatment of heart failure. It increases contractile force by enhancing the sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium. Besides this sensitizing effect, the drug has also been reported to show some inhibitory action on phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). The inotropic effects of levosimendan have been studied on guinea pig paced perfused hearts by using modular control analysis (MoCA) (Diolez P, Deschodt-Arsac V, Raffard G, Simon C, Santos PD, Thiaudiere E, Arsac L, Franconi JM. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 293: R13-R19, 2007.), an integrative approach of heart energetics using noninvasive (31)P NMR. The aim was to evaluate quantitatively the respective effects of this drug on energy supply and demand modules. Under our experimental conditions, 0.7 muM levosimendan induced a 45% increase in paced heart output associated with a 7% decrease in phosphocreatine and a negligible increase in oxygen consumption. Because MoCA allows in situ study of the internal regulations in intact beating heart energetics, it was applied to describe quantitatively by which routes levosimendan exerts its inotropic action. MoCA demonstrated the absence of any significant effect of the drug on the supply module, which is responsible for the lower increase in oxygen consumption, compared with epinephrine, which increases the ratio between myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac contraction. This result evidences that, under our conditions, a possible effect of levosimendan on PDE3 activity and/or intracellular calcium remains very low on mitochondrial activity and insignificant on integrated cardiac energetics. Thus, levosimendan inotropic effect on guinea pig heart depends almost entirely on the calcium-sensitizing properties leading to myofilament activation and the concomitant activation of energy supply by the decrease in PCr, therefore improving energetic efficiency of contraction."
CD010775,0,2618080,0,Effects of mutagenic and non-mutagenic aniline derivatives on rat liver drug-metabolizing enzymes.,"1. The effect of 4,4'-methylene bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), 4,4'-methylene dianiline (MDA) and 4,4'-sulphonyldianiline (Dapsone) in vivo on xenobiotic biotransformation in male rat liver was studied. 2. Treatment with MOCA or MDA but not Dapsone caused a dose-dependent increase in ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and a concomitant decrease in aldrin epoxidase activity in male rats. 3. Treatment with MOCA or MDA resulted in dose-dependent increases in ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation and epoxide hydrolation, while only MOCA induced cytosolic glutathione S-transferase activity. 4. Treatment with Dapsone resulted in no changes in xenobiotic biotransformation except for the induction of aniline hydroxylation. 5. The results are consistent with the contention that there is a relationship between carcinogenic chemicals and particular alterations in the activities of biotransformation enzymes."

CD010775,0,20615057,0,Utility of the NeuroTrax computerized battery for cognitive screening in Parkinson's disease: comparison with the MMSE and the MoCA.,"To determine the utility of a computerized assessment in Parkinson's disease (PD), we compared the cognitive performance of 50 PD patients on the NeuroTrax computerized battery relative to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The results revealed fair agreement between impairment on the NeuroTrax and the MMSE (kappa=.291, p=.031) but only slight agreement between the NeuroTrax and the MoCA (kappa=.138, p = .054) and between the MoCA and the MMSE (kappa = .168, p = .069). The NeuroTrax identified 52% of the sample as average or above, 40% as below average, and 8% as impaired. The MoCA identified 54% of the sample as impaired (28% average or above and 18% below average), while the MMSE identified 66% as average or above (20% below average and 14% impaired). Several stepwise regressions revealed that executive and verbal functions were the best predictors of cognitive functioning on the NeuroTrax, while memory recall, serial sevens, naming, and abstraction were the best predictors on the MoCA. These results suggest that although the NeuroTrax may be useful in identifying executive cognitive deficits in PD, similar to the MMSE the NeuroTrax may lack optimal sensitivity. While the MoCA is sensitive, it may be too stringent in overclassifying PD patients as impaired."
CD010775,0,1305676,0,New opportunities for screening and early detection of bladder cancer.,"In the United States, over 51,000 new cases of urinary bladder tumors are diagnosed annually. Approximately 75-85% of all newly diagnosed cases are superficial transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs). Incidence is highest (80% of the cases) in the 50-79 year age group. Recent studies have reported that 21-25% of risk for bladder cancer among United States white males is due to occupational exposure. The DuPont Chambers Works in Deepwater, New Jersey, was a major producer of two chemicals now known to be human bladder carcinogens (beta-naphthylamine and benzidine) as well as two suspected human bladder carcinogens [ortho-toluidine and 4,4'-methylene- bis,2-chloroaniline (MOCA)]. Between 1954 and 1982, DuPont screened 1723 exposed employees annually at the Chambers Works using the Papanicolaou test for urinary cytology and microscopic urinalysis. A review of the prior screening program found that employees who developed bladder cancer during this time period were approximately twice as likely to have had hematuria than those comparably exposed who did not develop bladder cancer. Building on this finding, a three-year screening study evaluated a home self-test for microscopic hematuria to aid early detection of treatable urologic conditions among exposed workers at this chemical plant. Every six months, subjects tested their urine at home for 14 consecutive days, for the presence of blood. A high degree of adherence to our protocol (over 92% completed and returned the self-testing record) as well as high compliance with repeat screening (85% returned for screening in subsequent quarters) demonstrated good acceptance and performance of the recommended schedule of self-testing. Through the first 7 periods of screening, two new cases and one recurrence of TCC of the bladder were detected."
CD010775,0,9498898,0,Aromatic amines and cancer.,"Epidemiological evidence on the relation between aromatic amines and cancer risk is reviewed. In particular, cancer risk in humans resulting from exposure to aromatic amines from occupational sources and tobacco smoking is assessed with reference to ecologic, cohort, and case-control studies. Seven arylamines have been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer: benzidine-based dyes and MOCA (4,4'-methylene bis 2-choloroaniline) were considered 'probably' carcinogenic, Group 2A, because of a high level of evidence in experimental animals; two occupational chemicals (2-naphthylamine and benzidine), one drug (Chlornaphazine), and two manufacturing processes (manufacture of auramine and magenta) were included in Group 1 on the basis of 'sufficient' evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. Occupational exposures to aromatic amines explain up to 25 percent of bladder cancers in some areas of Western countries; these estimates might be higher in limited areas of developing countries. Aromatic amines contaminate the ambient air as a component of environmental tobacco smoke. There is increasing evidence that the excess of bladder cancer in smokers is attributable to aromatic amines rather than to other contaminants of tobacco smoke such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). A modulating role in the risk of bladder cancer associated with exposure to aromatic amines is played by metabolic polymorphisms, such as the N-acetyltransferase genotype, raising important social and ethical issues. The consistent observation of a difference between men and women in bladder cancer risk, after allowing for known risk factors, suggests consideration of gender-related biological determinants for future investigation."

CD010775,0,10620301,0,Atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy analysis of retrovirus Gag proteins assembled in vitro on lipid bilayers.,"We have used an in vitro system that mimics the assembly of immature Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) particles to examine how viral structural (Gag) proteins oligomerize at membrane interfaces. Ordered arrays of histidine-tagged Moloney capsid protein (his-MoCA) were obtained on membrane bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and the nickel-chelating lipid 1, 2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-(1'-2""-R-hydroxy-3'N-(5-amino-1-carboxy pentyl)iminodiacetic acid)propyl ether (DHGN). The membrane-bound arrays were analyzed by electron microscopy (EM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Two-dimensional projection images obtained by EM showed that bilayer-bound his-MoCA proteins formed cages surrounding different types of protein-free cage holes with similar cage holes spaced at 81.5-A distances and distances between dissimilar cage holes of 45.5 A. AFM images, showing topological features viewed near the membrane-proximal domain of the his-MoCA protein, revealed a cage network of only symmetrical hexamers spaced at 79-A distances. These results are consistent with a model in which dimers constitute structural building blocks and where membrane-proximal and distal his-MoCA regions interact with different partners in membrane-bound arrays."

The purpose of this study was to assess the possible formation of DNA adducts, by RF and ADCP, in the nasal mucosa, liver and testes of male rats using the 32P-postlabeling assay. For comparison, rats were exposed to the DNA-reactive carcinogens 2,6-dimethylaniline (DMA), also known as 2,6-xylidine, a nasal carcinogen, and the aromatic amine carcinogens 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), which yields monocyclic DNA adducts, and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF). In the case of RF, possible sources of DNA adducts include the parent molecule and its ADCP moiety by enzymatic N-hydroxylation and sulfation, reactions typical of carcinogenic aromatic amines. 4-Acetoxylamino-3,5-dichloropyridine (N-acetoxy-ADCP), a chemically activated derivative of ADCP, was prepared and used to modify DNA which was then used to establish the chromatographic conditions with which to reliably detect whether or not such adducts were formed metabolically from RF and ADCP. Similarly, a standard N-hydroxy-DMA was prepared, but the corresponding N-acetoxy derivative was unstable and decomposed during synthesis. Both N-hydroxy-DMA and N-acetoxy-ADCP were mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium Ames assay using strain TA100 without an exogenous bioactivation system, with the former being more potent. N-hydroxy-ADCP was essentially inactive in this assay. For the 32P-postlabeling assay, male Wistar rats were exposed to the test substances and carrier control compounds by intragastric instillation at the selected dose levels for 7 days. Subsequently, the nasal mucosa, liver, and testes of the rats exposed to the test or control compounds were extirpated, the DNA extracted and the samples postlabeled. The patterns of adducts formed with the test compounds were compared to those formed in N-acetoxy-ADCP- and N-hydroxy-DMA-adducted DNA, which were assayed by both nuclease P1 and butanol enhancement methods. Based upon the similarity of results from the two enhancement methods, only the former was used for the in vivo studies. No evidence was obtained for the formation of DNA adducts from RF or its metabolites, specifically ADCP, under the conditions of these assays despite the ability to detect adducts from DNA modified chemically with N-acetoxy-ADCP and DNA adducts from the other compounds in their target organs. In the absence of a pattern of compound-related spots, we conclude that RF does not form DNA adducts having the potential to initiate neoplasia in these three tissues."
CD010775,0,9585478,0,Hemoglobin binding of bicyclic aromatic amines.,"Aromatic diamino compounds, e.g., 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) and 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA), are used as curing agents in the production of elastomers. Since MOCA and MDA are mutagenic and carcinogenic, substitutes are of great commercial interest. For benzidine it has been shown that ortho substitution with methyl groups yields the nonmutagenic 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. Therefore, MDA analogues with large substituents in the ortho position have been synthesized. The substituents are supposed to inhibit the formation of the N-hydroxyarylamines which are the putative genotoxic intermediates. We investigated the biological availability of the N-hydroxylamines of ortho-substituted diamines and of known carcinogenic diamines in female Wistar rats, by determining hemoglobin (Hb) adducts. Hb from rats dosed with 0.5 mmol/kg diamine and from controls was isolated and hydrolyzed in base. The released diamine and monoacetyldiamine were quantified by HPLC with electrochemical detection and/or GC/MS. MDA, 4,4'-oxydianiline (ODA), 4,4'-ethylenedianiline, and 4,4'-thiodianiline (TDA) bound to hemoglobin as diamine and as monoacetyl-diamine. 4,4'-Methylenebis(2,6-dimethylaniline), 4,4'-methylenebis(2,6-diethylaniline), MOCA, and 4,4'-sulfonyldianiline (dapsone) bound only as diamine to Hb. 4,4'-Methylenebis(2,6-dichloroaniline) did not bind to Hb. Thus, the presence of two substituents in the ortho position and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups in the para position to the amino group drastically reduced the formation of Hb adducts. The amount of hemoglobin adducts was compared to their carcinogenic potency. The extent of hemoglobin binding of the bicyclic diamines (dapsone, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, MDA, MOCA, TDA, ODA, and benzidine) increases with their carcinogenic potency."
CD010775,0,12093789,0,A novel mechanism for the regulation of amyloid precursor protein metabolism.,"Modifier of cell adhesion protein (MOCA; previously called presenilin [PS] binding protein) is a DOCK180-related molecule, which interacts with PS1 and PS2, is localized to brain areas involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and is lost from the soluble fraction of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Because PS1 has been associated with gamma-secretase activity, MOCA may be involved in the regulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Here we show that the expression of MOCA decreases both APP and amyloid beta-peptide secretion and lowers the rate of cell-substratum adhesion. In contrast, MOCA does not lower the secretion of amyloid precursor-like protein (APLP) or several additional type 1 membrane proteins. The phenotypic changes caused by MOCA are due to an acceleration in the rate of intracellular APP degradation. The effect of MOCA expression on the secretion of APP and cellular adhesion is reversed by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that MOCA directs nascent APP to proteasomes for destruction. It is concluded that MOCA plays a major role in APP metabolism and that the effect of MOCA on APP secretion and cell adhesion is a downstream consequence of MOCA-directed APP catabolism. This is a new mechanism by which the expression of APP is regulated."

The DNA binding of MOCA in both human and dog bladder explants increased with the concentration of MOCA in the medium. In both species, there appeared to be a population with high DNA binding activity and another with low DNA binding activity. Furthermore, the binding of MOCA to human bladder DNA appeared to be higher than to dog bladder DNA. The results indicate the potential of MOCA to induce genetic damage in human bladder and suggest caution in the occupational exposure of humans to this chemical."
CD010775,0,15647471,0,Modifier of cell adhesion regulates N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth.,"Modifier of cell adhesion (MOCA) is a member of the dedicator of cytokinesis 180 family of proteins and is highly expressed in CNS neurons. MOCA is associated with Alzheimer's disease tangles and regulates the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid. Here, we report that MOCA modulates cell-cell adhesion and morphology. MOCA increases the accumulation of adherens junction proteins, including N-cadherin and beta-catenin, whereas reducing endogenous MOCA expression lowers cell-cell aggregation and N-cadherin expression. MOCA colocalizes with N-cadherin and actin in areas of cell-cell and cell substratum contact and is expressed in neuronal processes. MOCA accumulates during neuronal differentiation, and its expression enhances NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and morphological complexity. We conclude that MOCA regulates N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth."

This strain metabolized AF by a novel pathway involving its reduction to 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol (AM) and the further conversion of AM to D-mannose by C-1 oxygenation. Growth studies showed that the AF metabolizing capability is not confined to S. morelense S-30.7.5 but is a more common feature among the Rhizobiaceae. The AF reducing enzyme was purified and characterized as a new NADPH-dependent monomeric reductase (AFR, EC 1.1.1.-) of 35.1 kDa. It catalyzed the stereoselective reduction of AF to AM and also the conversion of a number of 2-keto aldoses (osones) to the corresponding manno-configurated aldoses. In contrast, common aldoses and ketoses, as well as nonsugar aldehydes and ketones, were not reduced. A database search using the N-terminal AFR sequence retrieved a putative 35-kDa oxidoreductase encoded by the open reading frame Smc04400 localized on the chromosome of Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021. Based on sequence information for this locus, the afr gene was cloned from S. morelense S-30.7.5 and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. In addition to the oxidoreductase of S. meliloti 1021, AFR showed high sequence similarities to putative oxidoreductases of Mesorhizobium loti, Brucella suis, and B. melitensis but not to any oxidoreductase with known functions.

CD010775,0,9101589,0,Characterization of 1-hydroxypyrene as a novel marker substrate of 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible phenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase(s).,"Rats were treated with acetone, pyrazole, phenobarbital, 4,4'-methylenebis-(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), 3-methylcholanthrene, creosote oil, or a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (Aroclor 1254) to study the inducibility and enzyme kinetics of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases towards 1-hydroxypyrene, which is a human metabolite and a urinary biomarker of exposure to pyrene. The rate of 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronidation was analyzed in rat liver microsomes by a fluorometric HPLC assay of the formed glucuronide. The apparent K(m) and Vmax values in untreated controls (K(m) = 0.27 mM; Vmax = 31 nmol/min./mg protein) did not differ markedly from those in rats treated with acetone, pyrazole or phenobarbital, whereas the significantly decreased K(m) and increased Vmax values of the rats treated with the carcinogenic chemicals, MOCA (0.11; 51), creosote (0.06; 137), 3-methylcholanthrene (0.07; 141) or the Aroclor-1254 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture (0.08; 226), implicated major changes in the hepatic expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. 1-Hydroxypyrene proved to be a high affinity substrate and a sensitive marker of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolizing UDP-glucuronosyltransferase(s). Catalytically, the most efficient isoforms were induced in creosote, 3-methylcholanthrene and PCB-treated rats showing Vmax/K(m) ratios which were 22-27 times greater than in untreated controls. Our findings suggest the existence of a 3-methylcholanthrene type inducible and a functionally efficient low-K(m)/ high-Vmax form(s) of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase(s) that detoxify 1-hydroxypyrene and probably other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well."

CD010775,0,21790967,0,Cognitive impairment in patients with advanced heart failure and its implications on decision-making capacity.,"Cognitive impairment (CI) is a multifaceted entity that entails more than just memory loss. Deficits in other domains, most importantly executive function, can have profound effects on health outcomes in afflicted patients. The prevalence of CI among the heart failure population is exceedingly high, and even higher so among patients with advanced heart failure (AHF). These patients display consistent declines in memory, attention, psychomotor abilities, and executive function. Such deficits interfere with patients' abilities to recognize worsening symptoms, adhere to complex medication regimens, and make sound decisions pertaining to medical care. Regular evaluation of cognitive status using instruments such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a fast, reliable method that allows physicians who treat patients with AHF to anticipate these obstacles to treatment and act accordingly. Referral for more comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation should be considered for patients with unexplained declines from baseline, legal determination of competence, and for heart transplant or ventricular assist device placement candidates."

Rats were euthanized 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 29 days after a single 281 mumol/kg body wt dose of [14C]MOCA (oral, 213 muCi/kg; dermal, 904 muCi/kg). DNA from various tissues and hemoglobin were isolated for determination of the time course of MOCA macromolecular binding. After oral administration adduct formation was rapid with maximum levels appearing at 24 hr. The 24-hr covalent binding associated with the globin was 7.84 pmol/mg globin (t1/2 = 14.3 days). More extensive 24-hr covalent binding was detected for liver DNA with 49.11 pmol/mg DNA (t1/2 = 11.1 days). After dermal administration of MOCA the major portion of the dose, 86.2%, remained at the application site throughout the study. For these rats the 24-hr covalent binding determined for liver DNA was 0.38 pmol/mg DNA (t1/2 = 15.6 days). Although lower levels were detected after dermal application, similar stability of MOCA-DNA adducts indicates that quantification of such MOCA adducts may be useful for the long-term industrial biomonitoring of MOCA exposure and for the evaluation of human DNA-MOCA adduct formation, a lesion thought to be associated with the production of cancer."
CD010775,0,19803633,0,Rapid cognitive screening of patients with substance use disorders.,"To date, there has not been a time-efficient and resource-conscious way to identify cognitive impairment in patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). In this study, we assessed the validity, accuracy, and clinical utility of a brief (10-min) screening instrument, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in identifying cognitive impairment among patients with SUDs. The Neuropsychological Assessment Battery-Screening Module, a 45-min battery with known sensitivity to the mild to moderate deficits observed in patients with SUDs, was used as the reference criterion for determining agreement, rates of correct and incorrect decision classifications, and criterion-related validity for the MoCA. Classification accuracy of the MoCA, based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, was strong, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.86, 95% confidence interval [0.75, 0.97]. The MoCA also showed acceptable sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (72.9%) for the identification of cognitive impairment. Using a cutoff of 25 on the MoCA, the overall agreement was 75.0%; chance-corrected agreement (kappa) was 41.9%. These findings indicate that the MoCA provides a time-efficient and resource-conscious way to identify patients with SUDs and neuropsychological impairment, thus addressing a critical need in the addiction treatment research community."

According to the Bagshawe-Score, 29 patients were at low-risk, 10 patients were assigned to the high-risk category. Among 29 metastatic cases, 5 patients had brain metastasis. In 33 patients, treatment started from the time of diagnosis. In 25 cases, treatment was initiated at other hospitals and patients were referred only after various unsatisfactory treatment measures. Low-risk patients were mainly subjected to methotrexate and folinic acid. Patients at medium-risk received a sequential chemotherapy. In high-risk patients we preferred the CHA-MOCA- or the EMA/CO-regimen. Treatment was successful in 91.4% of patients including all cases of low- and medium-risk. Five patients with brain metastases received systemic chemotherapy combined with intrathecal application of methotrexate and radiotherapy. Three of them could be cured. Patients taken from other hospitals more often underwent primary hysterectomies prior to systemic chemotherapy (40% versus 3%) and more often developed drug resistant tumors due to inadequate primary treatment. Five patients (8.6%) died from their disease, but only one of them received primary treatment in our department. Thus, the outcome (1/33 compared to 4/25) was significantly better for patients treated primarily at specialized centers."

The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered at study admission followed by a second screening within two weeks using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool. Individual scores for the MMSE and MoCA were compared. Results demonstrated that the majority (90%) of participants scored in the normal range (> or = 26) on the MMSE (m = 27.9 sd 2.15). However, more than half (55%) of participants had some degree of cognitive impairment based on MoCA scores of < 26 (m = 23.65 sd = 4.082). MoCA scores demonstrated a wider range (Range = 16) compared to the range of MMSE scores (Range = 8). MoCA scores were significantly (p = < 0.05) lower than the MMSE scores. Findings from this pilot study suggest that the MoCA test will identify more deficits in cognition among SPC clients diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease. Further investigation is underway to determine the implications of these deficits on SPC clients' abilities to follow medication and other treatment regimens."

Treatment with MOCA and MDA caused a dose dependent increase in ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and concomitant decrease in aldrin epoxidase activity. Treatment with MOCA and MDA also resulted in increases in ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation and epoxide hydrolation while only MOCA induced cytosolic glutathione S-transferase activity. Treatment with Dapsone resulted in no changes in xenobiotic biotransformation except for the induction of aniline hydroxylation.

We conducted a pilot study of 47 healthy subjects 55-67 years of age to examine associations between bone lead levels and 4 tests sensitive to the natural history of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These include three subtests of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (delayed match-to-sample, paired associates learning and spatial recognition memory) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test. Bone lead concentrations were measured at the mid-shaft of the tibia and the calcaneus with K X-ray fluorescence. Higher tibial and calcaneal bone lead values were significantly (p<0.05) associated with lower performance levels on delayed match-to-sample and paired associates learning in unadjusted analyses with Spearman rank correlation coefficients of about 0.4. Multiple linear regression analyses (i.e., least-squares means of cognitive test scores across tertiles of lead exposure) adjusted for age, education and smoking status continued to show an association of higher calcaneal lead levels with increasing memory impairments on delayed match-to-sample (p=0.07). As might be expected, additional adjustment for history of hypertension reduced the strength of this association (p=0.19). Given the demonstrated impact of lead exposure on hypertension and the vascular etiology of certain dementias, we speculate that hypertension could play a mediating role in the association between lead exposure and memory impairment."

We tested our hypothesis that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and associated patient correlation factors might be increased (score < 26) according to the MoCA, in spite of a normal MMSE score, and that cognitive impairment might occur in a range of domains of the MoCA. Eighty-five patients participated in this study. The mean MoCA score was 22.44 (± 4.32). In spite of a normal MMSE score, which was an inclusion criterion, cognitive impairment was detected in 60% patients based on the MoCA score. The variable that correlated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment was the number of antiepileptic drugs (polytherapy: OR 2.71; CI 1.03-7.15). The mean scores of visuospatial and executive function, naming ability, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation among patients with mild cognitive impairment were significantly lower than those of patients with normal cognitive function. These findings suggest that mild cognitive impairment in cryptogenic epileptic patients is common. We suggest using MoCA as a screening test for patients with epilepsy."
CD010775,0,21081498,0,Molybdopterin dinucleotide biosynthesis in Escherichia coli: identification of amino acid residues of molybdopterin dinucleotide transferases that determine specificity for binding of guanine or cytosine nucleotides.,"The molybdenum cofactor is modified by the addition of GMP or CMP to the C4' phosphate of molybdopterin forming the molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide or molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide cofactor, respectively. The two reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes as follows: the GTP:molybdopterin guanylyltransferase MobA and the CTP:molybdopterin cytidylyltransferase MocA. Both enzymes show 22% amino acid sequence identity and are specific for their respective nucleotides. Crystal structure analysis of MobA revealed two conserved motifs in the N-terminal domain of the protein involved in binding of the guanine base. Based on these motifs, we performed site-directed mutagenesis studies to exchange the amino acids to the sequence found in the paralogue MocA. Using a fully defined in vitro system, we showed that the exchange of five amino acids was enough to obtain activity with both GTP and CTP in either MocA or MobA. Exchange of the complete N-terminal domain of each protein resulted in the total inversion of nucleotide specificity activity, showing that the N-terminal domain determines nucleotide recognition and binding. Analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that the C-terminal domain of either MocA or MobA determines the specific binding to the respective acceptor protein."
CD010775,0,11814229,0,Microdosimetric properties of ionizing electrons in water: a test of the PENELOPE code system.,"The ability to simulate the tortuous path of very low-energy electrons in condensed matter is important for a variety of applications in radiobiology. Event-by-event Monte Carlo codes such as OREC, MOCA and PITS represent the preferred method of computing distributions of microdosimetric quantities. However, event-by-event Monte Carlo is computationally expensive, and the cross sections needed to transport simulations to this level of detail are usually only available for water. In the recently developed PENELOPE code system, 'hard' electron and positron interactions are simulated in a detailed way while soft' interactions are treated using multiple scattering theory. Using this mixed simulation algorithm, electrons and positrons can be transported down to energies as low as 100 eV. To our knowledge, PENELOPE is the first widely available, general purpose Monte Carlo code system capable of transporting electrons and positrons in arbitrary media down to such low energies. The ability to transport electrons and positrons to such low energies opens up the possibility of using a general purpose Monte Carlo code system for microdosimetry. This paper presents the results of a code intercomparison study designed to test the applicability of the PENELOPE code system for microdosimetry applications. For sites comparable in size to a mammalian cell or cell nucleus, single-event distributions, site-hit probabilities and the frequency-mean specific energy per event are in reasonable agreement with those predicted using event-by-event Monte Carlo. Site-hit probabilities and the mean specific energy per event can be estimated to within about 1-10% of those predicted using event-by-event Monte Carlo. However, for some combinations of site size and source-target geometry, site-hit probabilities and the mean specific energy per event may only agree to within 25-60%. The most problematic source-target geometry is one in which the emitted electrons are very close to the tally site (e.g., a point source on the surface of a cell). Although event-by-event Monte Carlo will continue to be the method of choice for microdosimetry, PENELOPE is a useful, computationally efficient tool for some classes of microdosimetry problem. PENELOPE may prove particularly useful for applications that involve radiation transport through materials other than water or for applications that are too computationally intensive for event-by-event Monte Carlo, such as in vivo microdosimetry of spatially complex distributions of radioisotopes inside the human body."

MOCA and its metabolite, N-acetyl 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (acetyl-MOCA), are analyzed using methods either limited by sensitivity or sample preparation. Therefore, a solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method was developed to simultaneously analyze MOCA and acetyl-MOCA in urine to serve as biomarkers for MOCA exposure. Protein was precipitated by using acetonitrile, and SPE were applied to clean up samples to eliminate the matrix effect and to improve the recovery. The limit of quantitation of this method was at 1.0 ng/mL for MOCA and 0.03 ng/mL for acetyl-MOCA (signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio = 10). Urinary MOCA and acetyl-MOCA levels in MOCA-exposed workers were analyzed and quantitated to be 191.9 +/- 373.2 (mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) and 11.79 +/- 23.8 ng/mL (N = 54) with the median values 38.6 and 1.8 ng/mL, respectively. MOCA concentrations are significantly correlated with their corresponding acetyl-MOCA levels in urine (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.916, p < 0.001). These results show that this method has been successfully developed and provides high-throughput potential to analyze MOCA and acetyl-MOCA to serve as exposure biomarkers for future study of the potential health effects associated with MOCA exposures."

Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 293: R13-R19, 2007) was applied here on perfused hearts to describe the modifications of the regulation of heart energetics induced in mice exposed to 3-wk chronic hypoxia. MoCA combines 31P-NMR spectroscopy and modular (top down) control analysis to describe the integrative regulation of energy metabolism in the intact beating heart, on the basis of two modules [ATP/phosphocreatine (PCr) production and ATP/PCr consumption] connected by the energetic intermediates. In contrast with previous results in rat heart, in which all control of contraction was on ATP demand, mouse heart energetics presented a shared control of contraction between ATP/PCr-producing and -consuming modules. In chronic hypoxic mice, the decrease in heart contractile activity and PCr-to-ATP ratio was surprisingly associated with an important and significant higher response of ATP/PCr production (elasticity) to PCr changes compared with control hearts (-10.4 vs. -2.46). By contrast, no changes were observed in ATP/PCr consumption since comparable elasticities were observed. Since elasticities determine the regulation of energetics of heart contraction, the present results show that this new parameter may be used to uncover the origin of the observed dysfunctions under chronic hypoxia conditions. Considering the decrease in mitochondrial content reported after exposure to chronic hypoxia, it appears that the improvement of ATP/PCr production response to ATP demand may be viewed as a positive adaptative mechanism. It now appears crucial to understand the very processes responsible for ATP/PCr producer elasticity toward the energetic intermediates, as well as their regulation."

The MoCA, a tool used widely in clinical geriatric practice to detect and quantify cognitive impairment, was administered to three diverse samples to assess the psychometric properties of the instrument. Participants were 482 healthy persons seen in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS), 1923 healthy volunteers evaluated by the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a population-based sample of Dallas County residents and 69 persons with known or suspected brain pathology, seen for clinical evaluation. The standard deviations in the CCLS and DHS groups were small (2.81, 3.87) and moderate in the clinical group (5.22). The corresponding raw coefficients alpha were. 50,. 63, and. 75. Thus, variability and internal consistency were associated. MoCA scores generally did not correlate with gender and correlated with age only in the clinical group. However, there were moderately strong positive correlations between MoCA scores and education in all three samples. The reliability of the MoCA was extremely low in the two non-clinical groups, but was high in the clinical group. Although useful in large non-clinical studies, the MoCA is best suited to detect and quantify cognitive impairment in clinical patients."

Two arylamines with known human exposure, 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) and 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), have been examined as substrates for 10 different purified rat hepatic cytochromes P-450 and for human liver microsomal preparations from 22 individuals. Metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and flow scintillation techniques. As reported for certain other carcinogenic arylamines, the isosafrole-inducible isozyme, P-450ISF-G, had the highest catalytic activity for ABP N-oxidation (13.6 nmol/min/nmol P-450), but P-450BNF-B, P-450UT-A, P-450UT-F, and P-450PB-B also showed appreciable activity. Ring-oxidation of ABP occurred only to a minor extent. In contrast, N-oxidation of MOCA was preferentially catalyzed by the phenobarbital-inducible enzymes, P-450PB-B and P-450PB-D (9.0 and 6.6 nmol/min/nmol P-450, respectively). MOCA ring-oxidation and methylene carbon oxidation showed varied cytochrome P-450 selectivity and accounted for 14 to 79% of total oxidation products. There was a 44-fold variation in rates of ABP N-oxidation in the 22 human liver microsomal preparations, while rates of N-oxidation of MOCA varied only 8-fold. Ring/methylene carbon-oxidation of MOCA accounted for 6-19% of total oxidation products in the case of the human microsomal preparations, whereas ring-oxidation of ABP accounted for less than 7% of total oxidation. In addition, there was a strong correlation (R = 0.90) between rates of ABP N-oxidation and phenacetin O-deethylation, which is considered a human genetic polymorphism. Moreover, both the ABP N-oxidation and phenacetin O-deethylation activities of human liver microsomes showed a good correlation (R = 0.72) with the levels of cytochrome P-450 immunochemically related to rat P-450ISF-G. These data indicate that specific inducible and constitutive cytochromes P-450 are involved in the metabolic activation and detoxification of the carcinogens ABP and MOCA. Therefore, individual profiles of cytochromes P-450, affected by both environmental and genetic factors, may be significant determinants of individual susceptibility to arylamine carcinogenesis."

CD010775,0,18498244,0,In vivo modular control analysis of energy metabolism in contracting skeletal muscle.,"We used (31)P MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) measurements of energetic intermediates [ATP, P(i) and PCr (phosphocreatine)] in combination with the analytical tools of metabolic control analysis to study in vivo energy metabolism in the contracting skeletal muscle of anaesthetized rats over a broad range of workload. According to our recent MoCA (modular control analysis) used to describe regulatory mechanisms in beating heart, we defined the energetic system of muscle contraction as two modules (PCr-Producer and PCr-Consumer) connected by the energetic intermediates. Hypoxia and electrical stimulation were used in this in vivo study as reasonably selective modulations of Producer and Consumer respectively. As quantified by elasticity coefficients, the sensitivities of each module to PCr determine the control of steady-state contractile activity and metabolite concentrations. The magnitude of the elasticity of the producer was high (4.3+/-0.6) at low workloads and decreased 5-fold (to 0.9+/-0.2) at high workloads. By contrast, the elasticity of the consumer remained low (0.5-1.2) over the range of metabolic rates studied. The control exerted by each module over contraction was calculated from these elasticities. The control of contraction was found on the consumer at low workloads and then swung to the producer, due to the workload-dependent decrease in the elasticity of producer. The workload-dependent elasticity and control pattern of energy production in muscle is a major difference from heart. Since module rate and elasticity depend on the concentrations of substrates and products, the absence of homoeostasis of the energetic intermediates in muscle, by contrast with heart, is probably the origin of the workload-dependent elasticity of the producer module."

CD010775,0,20310038,0,The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: a screening tool for mild cognitive impairment in REM sleep behavior disorder.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a frequent feature in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a sleep disturbance that can be a preclinical stage of Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of two brief screening tools, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), in detecting MCI in idiopathic RBD. Thirty-eight idiopathic RBD patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, including the MoCA and the MMSE. Receiver operating characteristic curves were created for the MoCA and the MMSE to assess their ability to identify MCI in idiopathic RBD patients, with neuropsychological assessment as the gold standard. For the MoCA, a normality cutoff of 26 yielded the best balance between sensitivity (76%) and specificity (85%) with a correct classification of 79%. For the MMSE, the optimal normality cutoff was 30, with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 54% and a correct classification of 74%. The MoCA is superior to the MMSE in detecting MCI in idiopathic RBD patients, showing good sensitivity and very good specificity."

CD010775,0,22298886,0,Evaluating cognitive impairment in the clinical setting: practical screening and assessment tools.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain a substantial problem in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy. Neither the Mini Mental State Exam nor the HIV Dementia Scale is sufficiently sensitive for HAND. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment shows promise, but current data suggest that adding an additional test will be needed to improve sensitivity for the clinical setting. Patient reporting of symptoms is insensitive as most cases of HAND are asymptomatic. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sometimes warranted in select patients to evaluate for CSF HIV RNA detectability. CSF escape of virus, when CSF HIV RNA is detectable but plasma HIV RNA is not, appears to be a relatively uncommon event in the clinical setting where the level of detectability for typical clinical assays is around 50 copies/mL. In cases of CSF escape, cognitive improvement has been linked to changes in antiretroviral regimens that are aimed at either overcoming antiretroviral resistance or improving central nervous system (CNS) penetration-effectiveness. Currently, for most patients with HAND in the absence of unusual features, there are insufficient data for a recommendation to routinely intensify therapy with a neurointensive antiretroviral regimen; however, there is considerable uncertainty given emerging data and variability in approach among experts in the field. This article summarizes a case-based presentation by Victor G. Valcour, MD, at the 14th Annual Clinical Conference for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program held in Tampa, Florida, in June 2011. The Clinical Conference is sponsored by the IAS-USA under the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) contract number HHSH250200900010C."
CD010775,0,16815085,0,FTIR spectroscopic characterization of polyurethane-urea model hard segments (PUUMHS) based on three diamine chain extenders.,"Six polyurethane-urea model hard segments (PUUMHS) were prepared by a solution method based, respectively, on two isocyanates: 4,4'-methylene-diphenyl-diisocyanate (MDI), 4,4'-methylene-dicyclohexyl diisocyanate (HMDI) and three amine chain extenders: ethylene diamine (EDA), methylene-bis-ortho-chloroaniline (MOCA), 2,4-diamino-3,5-dimethylsuphylchlorobenzene (DDSCB). FTIR was used to study their spectroscopic characterization. The main FTIR bands of the six samples were assigned and compared. It was found that most of N-H and C=O are H-bonded in these PUUMHS. However, the N-H in three MDI based PUUMHS is all in the stronger H-bond state than that in their corresponding HMDI based while the C=O in three HMDI based PUUMHS is all in the stronger H-bond state than that in their corresponding MDI based, respectively. In addition, the order of the H-bond strength in HMDI based PUUMHS is MOCA, DDSCB and EDA whether according to nuN-H or nuC=O band wavenumbers, which is, however, different from that in MDI based PUUMHS. Moreover, the HMDI based PUUMHS shows obvious double amide III bands while the MDI based has only prominent one. The results are discussed according mainly to the different characteristics of the three chain extenders as well as the structure difference between MDI and HMDI."

The IARC classifies MOCA as a probable human carcinogen. Suggested changes to guidelines for health surveillance of MOCA-exposed workers in Australia include a reduction in acceptable levels of urinary MOCA to below 15 mumol/mol creatinine. Twelve male workers aged 24 and 42 years were recruited into this study from four work locations where MOCA is used. Exfoliated urothelial cells from prework urine samples on a midweek work day were assessed for micronucleus (MN) frequencies. Postwork urine samples were analysed for total MOCA. Blood samples collected on the same day were cultured for 96 h and cytochalasin-B-blocked cells were scored for MN. Eighteen male control subjects (23-59 years) provided corresponding urine and blood samples. Median urinary MOCA concentrations were 6.5 mumol/mol creatinine (range 0.4-48.6 mumol/mol creatinine) in postwork samples of MOCA-exposed workers. MOCA was not detected in urine of control workers. Mean MN frequencies were higher in urothelial cells and lymphocytes of MOCA workers (14.27 +/- 0.56 and 13.25 +/- 0.48 MN/1000 cells) than in controls (6.90 +/- 0.18 and 9.24 +/- 0.29 MN/1000 cells). The mean number of micronucleate cells was also higher in both tissues of exposed workers (9.69 +/- 0.32 and 8.54 +/- 0.14 MN cells/1000 cells) than in controls (5.18 +/- 0.11 and 5.93 +/- 0.13 MN cells/1000). There was no correlation between postwork urinary MOCA concentrations and MN frequencies in either tissue. This study suggests that exposures to MOCA in South Australia are similar to those of a decade ago and are at levels similar to those currently acceptable in Australia. These are associated with genotoxic effects in urothelial cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. It may be prudent to reduce MOCA exposures in line with proposed guidance values."

CD010775,0,18539485,0,Understanding brain connectivity from EEG data by identifying systems composed of interacting sources.,"In understanding and modeling brain functioning by EEG/MEG, it is not only important to be able to identify active areas but also to understand interference among different areas. The EEG/MEG signals result from the superimposition of underlying brain source activities volume conducted through the head. The effects of volume conduction produce spurious interactions in the measured signals. It is fundamental to separate true source interactions from noise and to unmix the contribution of different systems composed by interacting sources in order to understand interference mechanisms. As a prerequisite, we consider the problem of unmixing the contribution of uncorrelated sources to a measured field. This problem is equivalent to the problem of unmixing the contribution of different uncorrelated compound systems composed by interacting sources. To this end, we develop a principal component analysis-based method, namely, the source principal component analysis (sPCA), which exploits the underlying assumption of orthogonality for sources, estimated from linear inverse methods, for the extraction of essential features in signal space. We then consider the problem of demixing the contribution of correlated sources that comprise each of the compound systems identified by using sPCA. While the sPCA orthogonality assumption is sufficient to separate uncorrelated systems, it cannot separate the individual components within each system. To address that problem, we introduce the Minimum Overlap Component Analysis (MOCA), employing a pure spatial criterion to unmix pairs of correlates (or coherent) sources. The proposed methods are tested in simulations and applied to EEG data from human micro and alpha rhythms."

CD010775,0,2494442,0,Genotoxicity of aniline derivatives in various short-term tests.,"Various substituted aniline derivatives were tested for genotoxicity in several short-term tests in order to examine the hypothesis that a substitution at both ortho positions (2,6-disubstitution) could prevent genotoxicity due to steric hindrance of an enzymatic activation to electrophilic intermediates. In the Salmonella/microsome assay, 2,6-dialkylsubstituted anilines and 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (2,4,6-TMA) were weakly mutagenic in strain TA100 when 20% S9 mix was used, although effects were small compared to those of 2,4-dimethylaniline and 2,4,5-trimethylaniline (2,4,5-TMA). In Drosophila melanogaster, however, 2,4,6-TMA and 2,4,6-trichloroaniline (TCA) were mutagenic in the wing spot test at 2-3 times lower doses than 2,4,5-TMA. In the 6-thioguanine resistance test in cultured fibroblasts, 2,4,6-TMA was again mutagenic at lower doses than 2,4,5-TMA. Two methylene-bis-aniline derivatives were also tested with the above methods: 4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) was moderately genotoxic in all 3 test systems whereas 4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-ethyl-6-methylaniline) (MMEA) showed no genotoxicity at all. DNA binding studies in rats, however, revealed that both MOCA and MMEA produced DNA adducts in the liver at levels typically found for moderately strong genotoxic carcinogens. These results indicate that the predictive value of the in vitro test systems and particularly the Salmonella/microsome assay is inadequate to detect genotoxicity in aromatic amines. Genotoxicity seems to be a general property of aniline derivatives and does not seem to be greatly influenced by substitution at both ortho positions."
CD010775,0,16489254,0,RANTES and chemotactic activity in synovial fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.,"A massive accumulation of inflammatory cells in synovial tissues is a major pathological feature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Neutrophiles dominate synovial fluid while rheumatoid synovium is infiltrated with mononuclear cells. Mechanisms regulating influx of particular subpopulations of leukocytes into articular cavity and synovium compartment are not completely defined. An increasing amount of data supports a crucial role of a C-C chemokine RANTES in the RA pathogenesis. Our objective is to evaluate chemotactic activity for neutrophils (NCA), lymphocytes (LCA), and monocytes (MoCA) in SFs obtained from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). We also aimed to characterise the relation between chemotactic activity, RANTES, and percentage distribution of leukocytes in SF. SFs from 11 patients with RA and 6 with OA were included in the study. Modified microchamber Boyden method was employed to assess chemotactic activity. Cytological and biochemical analysis of SF was performed. RANTES was measured with ELISA. Rheumatoid SFs were rich in cells with predominance of neutrophiles while osteoarthritic fluids were lymphocytic. RA SFs were also characterised by increased lactoferrin level. Both NCA and LCA were higher in SF from patients with RA (62 +/- 12 and 24 +/- 6 cells/HPF, resp) as compared to patients with OA (23 +/- 6; P < .05 and 6 +/- 2 cells/HPF; P < 0.05). The chemoattractive effect of RA SF was more pronounced on neutrophiles than on lymphocytes. RA SF expressed high RANTES levels (145+/- 36 pg/mL), while OA SF was characterised by only trace amount of this chemokine (2 +/- 1 pg/mL). We found positive correlation of RANTES with chemotactic activity for mononuclear cells (LCA + MoCA; R = 0.61; P < .05). Surprisingly, RANTES correlated also positively with neutrophiles number (R = 0.77; P < 0.001). Rheumatoid SF possesses strong chemotactic potency for leukocytes. RANTES is overexpressed in RA SF and is a potential mediator influencing intensity and composition of cellular infiltration in joints affected with inflammatory arthritis."
CD010775,0,2995481,0,Comparative usefulness of tissue fixatives for in situ viral nucleic acid hybridization.,"Traditionally tissues for in situ hybridization of viral nucleic acid have been small pieces obtained from laboratory rodents, and fixatives that are designed for electron microscopy, such as periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) can handle them adequately. However, these fixatives have limited penetrating ability and may produce no appreciable hardening, so alternative fixation methods were evaluated. The intention was to determine whether fixatives adequate for bulky tissues such as whole or halved pig and cow brains would also be compatible with in situ hybridization. Various fixatives were evaluated using a system of intracranial inoculation of BALB/c mice with pseudorabies virus (PRV) followed by in situ hybridization of brain tissue sections with a 35S-labeled PRV DNA probe. Loss of tissue sections was a major problem, particularly with PLP and formalin, but positive results were obtained with five fixatives tested. Cellular morphology was especially good with PLP and with a modification of Carnoy's fluid, MOCA fixative. An incidental but important observation was that formalin is compatible with in situ hybridization. Retroactive studies of viral diseases using routinely processed blocks of tissue (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) are therefore conceivable."

We recruited 196 individuals in Shanghai of China and divided them into 2 groups: the SCI group including 112 individuals (45 men and 67 women; aged from 43 to 70 years old) and the control group including 84 individuals (43 men and 41 women; aged from 42 to 79 years old). We collected information including participants' gender, age, blood glucose, kidney function, blood lipids, blood pressure, Electrocardiogram (ECG), carotid artery ultrasound, MMSE score, and MoCA score. SAS software (version 9.1) was used to perform statistical analysis on physical examinations outcomes from 196 participants. Furthermore, multiple logistic regression model was built up to screen out the independent risk factors of SCI. Besides, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis was also used. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that abnormal ECG and existence of carotid artery plaques were independent risk factors of SCI occurrence, while MoCA scores was negatively associated with SCI risk. Moreover, MoCA might be more valuable in predicting vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) than MMSE (0.667 vs 0.626). We found that the MMSE was generally insensitive to detect cognitive impairment; but the MoCA has a good balance of sensitivity and specificity at the cut-score of 26. We found that the patients with SCI might accompany with VCI and the MoCA appeared to be an excellent screening test for patients with SCI, worthy of being promoted in the clinical practitioning on Chinese population."
CD010775,0,20822854,0,Reasonable neuropsychological battery to identify mild cognitive impairment.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was popular studied while the neuropsychological tests to evaluate and identify MCI patients were not standard used. So there is a need to develop objective, cost-effective and normative screening tests which can evaluate cognitive problems for older individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to lots of valuable research results, we hypothesize that a neuropsychological battery containing MMSE, AVLT, and MoCA could successfully identify MCI from other cognitive impairment. And CDT in MoCA should not only be scored by a 3-point scoring method but for the second time in qualitative assessments and quantitative analysis independently. This battery measures almost the broadest aspects of cognition in relatively short time to avoid lacking of concentration due to long time. Of course, general physical examinations and a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan should be performed before neuropsychological tests to exclude neurologic diseases which would affect cognition."

CD010775,0,19129390,0,Loss of modifier of cell adhesion reveals a pathway leading to axonal degeneration.,"Axonal dysfunction is the major phenotypic change in many neurodegenerative diseases, but the processes underlying this impairment are not clear. Modifier of cell adhesion (MOCA) is a presenilin binding protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1. The loss of MOCA in mice leads to axonal degeneration and causes sensorimotor impairments by decreasing cofilin phosphorylation and altering its upstream signaling partners LIM kinase and p21-activated kinase, an enzyme directly downstream of Rac1. The dystrophic axons found in MOCA-deficient mice are associated with abnormal aggregates of neurofilament protein, the disorganization of the axonal cytoskeleton, and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and polyubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, MOCA deficiency causes an alteration in the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of cofilin-containing rod-like structures. The dystrophic axons show functional abnormalities, including impaired axonal transport. These findings demonstrate that MOCA is required for maintaining the functional integrity of axons and define a model for the steps leading to axonal degeneration."

Occupationally, exposure may occur through inhalation and ingestion, but skin absorption is the main route by which this compound gains entry into the body. Because of the justified concern about the continued use of MOCA, a number of substitutes have been proposed, including 1,2-bis(2-aminophenylthio)ethane (Cyanacure), Conacure, trimethylene glycol di-p-aminobenzoate (Polacure 740M) and 3,5-dimethylthio-2,4-toluenediamine/3,5-dimethylthio-2,6-tol uenediamine (Ethacure 300). There is very little information available about these substances, but they share the property of belonging to the same class (aromatic amines) as MOCA. Furthermore, at least two (Ethacure 300 and Cyanacure) are mutagenic in Salmonella. This study was undertaken to investigate if MOCA and substitutes, Polacure 740M, Ethacure 300, Cyanacure and Conacure have the potential to cause papillomas in a two stage initiation/promotion protocol in HRA/Skh hairless mice. When a maximum dose of 100 mg of substance was applied to the dorsal skin of these mice, Ethacure 300 and Cyanacure were markedly toxic. All of the compounds had little or no effect on skin tumor initiating activity following 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) promotion. One experiment with MOCA suggested that, at lower and less toxic dose, this substance may have promotional activity. Therefore, caution should still be exercised when using these compounds and it cannot be excluded that they may be active in other strains of mice or other laboratory animal species."

CD010775,0,8420614,0,"4,4'-Methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline)-DNA adduct analysis in human exfoliated urothelial cells by 32P-postlabeling.","4,4'-Methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) is an aromatic amine used widely in industry, and human exposure to this compound is well documented. MOCA induces lung and liver tumors in rodents and urinary bladder tumors in dogs, and it is regarded as a suspect urinary bladder carcinogen in humans. In this pilot study, we investigated the occurrence of MOCA-DNA adducts in exfoliated urothelial cells of a MOCA-exposed worker by 32P-postlabeling analysis. Urine samples were collected from the worker at various times after accidental acute exposure to MOCA. DNA isolated from exfoliated urothelial cells collected from each urine sample was enzymatically digested and postlabeled with excess [32P]ATP. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the labeled digests revealed the presence of a single, major DNA adduct that cochromatographed with the major N-hydroxy-MOCA-DNA adduct, N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol, formed in vitro. The MOCA-DNA adduct was detected in samples obtained between 4 and 98 h after initial exposure but not in samples collected at later times. The level of DNA adducts 4 h after exposure was determined to be 516 adducts/10(8) nucleotides. A 5-fold decrease in adduct level was observed 14 h later, followed by a gradual decrease over subsequent days. The results indicate that MOCA is potentially genotoxic to human urinary bladder in vivo and that 32P-postlabeling analysis of exfoliated urothelial cells provides a noninvasive means for biomonitoring the formation of MOCA-DNA adducts resulting from occupational exposure."
CD010775,0,15167984,0,Embryonic turkey liver: activities of biotransformation enzymes and activation of DNA-reactive carcinogens.,"Avian embryos are a potential alternative model for chemical toxicity and carcinogenicity research. Because the toxic and carcinogenic effects of some chemicals depend on bioactivation, activities of biotransformation enzymes and formation of DNA adducts in embryonic turkey liver were examined. Biochemical analyses of 22-day in ovo turkey liver post-mitochondrial fractions revealed activities of the biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxycoumarin de-ethylase (ECOD), 7-ethoxyresorufin de-ethylase (EROD), aldrin epoxidase (ALD), epoxide hydrolase (EH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (GLUT). Following the administration of phenobarbital (24 mg/egg) on day 21, enzyme activities of ECOD, EROD, ALD, EH and GLUT, but not of GST, were increased by two-fold or higher levels by day 22. In contrast, acute administration of 3-methylcholanthrene (5 mg/egg) induced only ECOD and EROD activities. Bioactivation of structurally diverse pro-carcinogens was also examined using (32)P-postlabeling for DNA adducts. In ovo exposure of turkey embryos on day 20 of gestation to 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5- f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) resulted in the formation of DNA adducts in livers collected by day 21. Some of the DNA adducts had (32)P-postlabeling chromatographic migration patterns similar to DNA adducts found in livers from Fischer F344 rats exposed to the same pro-carcinogens. We conclude that 21-day embryonic turkey liver is capable of chemical biotransformation and activation of genotoxic carcinogens to form DNA adducts. Thus, turkey embryos could be utilized to investigate potential chemical toxicity and carcinogenicity."
CD010775,0,17011020,0,Manganese-oxide-coated alumina: a promising sorbent for defluoridation of water.,"In this study, adsorption potential of a new sorbent manganese-oxide-coated alumina (MOCA) was investigated for defluoridation of drinking water using batch and continuous mode experiments. The effects of different parameters such as pH, initial fluoride concentration and co-existing ions (usually present in groundwater sample) were studied to understand the adsorption behavior of the sorbent under various conditions. Optimum removal of fluoride ions occurred in a pH range of 4-7. Results of the present study indicate that fluoride adsorption rate and adsorption capacity of MOCA are far superior to that of activated alumina (AA), which was used as the base material for MOCA preparation. The MOCA can be effectively regenerated using 2.5% NaOH as eluent. The Langmuir equilibrium model was found to be suitable for describing the fluoride sorption on AA and MOCA. The maximum fluoride uptake capacity for MOCA and AA was found to be 2.85 and 1.08 mg g(-1), respectively. The kinetic results showed that the fluoride sorption to MOCA followed pseudo--second-order kinetics with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.98. The fluoride sorption capacity at breakthrough point for both the adsorbents was greatly influenced by bed depth. A bed depth service time (BDST) approach was adopted to describe the continuous flow system. The batch and column studies demonstrated the superiority of MOCA over AA in removing fluoride from the drinking water system."

It is not clear if this is a result of motor or cognitive impairments. We examined the effects of explicit prioritization of walking or the cognitive task on gait speed (GS) and variability in 20 patients (Hoehn & Yahr stage: 2.3 ± 0.5) and 20 healthy older adults during usual-walking and under three DT (verbal-fluency) conditions: (1) no instruction for prioritization, (2) specific attention to the walking pattern (gait prioritization), and (3) specific attention to the cognitive task (prioritization of verbal-fluency). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Frontal Assessment Battery, and the Trail Making Tests assessed cognitive status. The two groups did not differ on these cognitive tests. Compared to usual-walking, all subjects reduced their GS in the un-instructed DT condition. Compared to the un-instructed DT condition, both groups significantly (p < 0.001) increased GS when prioritizing walking and maintained about the same GS when prioritizing the cognitive task (p > 0.155). All three DT conditions increased gait variability in both groups (p < 0.001 usual-walking compared to uninstructed DT). Verbal-fluency tended (p = 0.073) to be influenced by prioritization in both groups. Task prioritization abilities were similar in the patients and controls, even though the patients generally walked more slowly. PD patients without cognitive impairment apparently utilize their cognitive resources in the same manner as healthy older adults. Both groups, however, use some form of the posture second strategy and naturally focus on the cognitive task."
CD010775,0,16335575,0,"Differential induction of micronuclei in peripheral lymphocytes and exfoliated urothelial cells of workers exposed to 4,4'-methylenebis-(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) and bitumen fumes.","Cytogenetic end-points used to estimate risk of genotoxic events in workers include the measurement of micronuclei (MN) in exfoliated cells, lymphocytes, and other tissues. Micronuclei are chromatin-containing bodies outside the cell nucleus resulting from contaminant-induced DNA damage. A review of 71 reports of human genotoxic responses to chemical or physical agents published between 1999 and 2001 revealed that 14% of such studies measured genotoxicity endpoints in specific target tissues relevant to the site of disease for the agent examined; 18% used endpoints in surrogate or non-target tissues but considered the relations between endpoints in surrogate and disease target tissues, and 68% measured genotoxicity endpoints in accessible tissues without reference to specific targets for disease. Methylenebis-(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), used in polyurethane manufacture, is a suspected bladder carcinogen. Bitumen, used in road surfacing, contains skin and lung carcinogens. In this study, we aimed to compare genotoxicity in urothelial cells and in lymphocytes of workers exposed to these materials. Twelve men employed in polyurethane manufacture, twelve bitumen road layers, and eighteen hospital stores personnel (controls) were recruited and all provided blood and urine samples on the same day. Blood cultures were prepared using a cytochalasin B-block method. Exfoliated urothelial cells were collected from urine and stained for light microscopy. The number of MN in urothelial cells was higher in MOCA-exposed (14.27 +/- 0.56 MN/1000, 9.69 +/- 0.32 MN cells/1000) than in bitumen exposed workers (11.99 +/- 0.65 MN/1000, 8.66 +/- 0.46 MN cells/1000) or in control subjects (6.88 +/- 0.18 MN/1000, 5.17 +/- 0.11 MN cells/1000). Conversely, in lymphocytes, MN were higher in bitumen-exposed (16.24 +/- 0.63 MN/1000, 10.65 +/- 0.24 MN cells/1000) than in MOCA-exposed workers (13.25 +/- 0.48 MN/1000, 8.54 +/- 0.14 MN cells/1000) or in control subjects (9.24 +/- 0.29 MN/ 1000, 5.93 +/- 0.13 MN cells/1000). The results of this study suggest that genotoxins can cause different rates of micronuclei formation in different tissues. Thus, the sensitivity and relevance to cancer risk may be greater if the tissues selected for genotoxicity studies reflect the target tissue for the chemicals concerned."
CD010775,0,22581594,1,Clinical application of the Polish adaptation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test in screening for cognitive impairment.,"A group of 115 subjects (36 meeting DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 1], 42 meeting Petersen's criteria for MCI [CDR = 0.5], and 37 cognitively intact controls [CDR = 0]) was recruited for the study in the university-based Alzheimer out-patient clinic. All participants underwent general medical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations. The MoCA, the MMSE, CDR and the short (15-item) version of the Geriatric Depression Scale were also applied."
CD010775,0,21156989,0,Validity of the montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) as a screening test for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a cardiovascular population.,"While rates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are relatively high in populations with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, screening tests for MCI have not been evaluated in this patient group. This study investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool for detecting MCI in 110 patients (mean age 67.9 + 11.7 years; 60% female) recruited from hospital cardiovascular outpatient clinics. Mean MoCA performance was relatively low (22.8 + 3.8) in this group, with 72.1% of participants scoring below the recommended cutoff for cognitive impairment (<26). The presence of MCI was determined using the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Screening Module (NAB-SM). Both amnestic MCI and multiple-domain MCI were identified. The optimum MoCA cutoff for detecting MCI in this group was <24. At this cutoff, the MoCA's sensitivity for detecting amnestic MCI was 100% and for multiple-domain MCI it was 83.3%. Specificity rates for amnestic MCI and multiple-domain MCI were 50.0% and 52% respectively. The poor specificity of the MoCA suggests that it will have limited value as a screening test for MCI in settings where the overall prevalence of MCI is low."
CD010775,0,22115042,0,MOCA is an integrator of the neuronal death signals that are activated by familial Alzheimer's disease-related mutants of amyloid β precursor protein and presenilins.,"The death of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions is linked to irreversible dementia relevant to AD (Alzheimer's disease). Although multiple studies have shown that expression of a FAD (familial AD)-linked APP (amyloid β precursor protein) or a PS (presenilin) mutant, but not that of wild-type APP or PS, induced neuronal death by activating intracellular death signals, it remains to be addressed how these signals are interrelated and what the key molecule involved in this process is. In the present study, we show that the PS1-mediated (or possibly the PS2-mediated) signal is essential for the APP-mediated death in a γ-secretase-independent manner and vice versa. MOCA (modifier of cell adhesion), which was originally identified as being a PS- and Rac1-binding protein, is a common downstream constituent of these neuronal death signals. Detailed molecular analysis indicates that MOCA is a key molecule of the AD-relevant neuronal death signals that links the PS-mediated death signal with the APP-mediated death signal at a point between Rac1 [or Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42)] and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1)."

CD010775,0,14718541,0,MOCA induces membrane spreading by activating Rac1.,"The modifier of cell adhesion protein (MOCA), or Dock3, initially identified as presenilin-binding protein (PBP), belongs to the Dock180 family of proteins and is localized specifically in neurons. Here we demonstrate that MOCA binds to Rac1 and enhances its activity, which leads to the activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and causes changes in cell morphology. Farnesylated MOCA, which is localized in the plasma membrane, enhances the activation of Rac1 and JNK more markedly than wild-type MOCA, and cells expressing farnesylated MOCA show flattened morphology similar to those expressing a constitutive active mutant of Rac1, Rac1Q61L. On poly-d-lysine-coated dishes, endogenous MOCA is concentrated on the leading edge of broad membrane protrusions (lamellipodia) where actin filaments are co-localized. MOCA is also concentrated with actin on the growth cone in primary cultures of cortical neurons. These observations suggest that MOCA may induce cytoskeletal reorganization and changes in cell adhesion by regulating the activity of Rac1."
CD010775,0,20437313,0,Improving sleep: initial headache treatment in OIF/OEF veterans with blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury.,"This was an observational study of a cohort of 126 veterans with mild traumatic brain injury caused by an explosion during deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF); 74 of the 126 veterans had comorbidities including frequent, severe headaches and residual deficits on neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, or both. Of these veterans, 71 had posttraumatic stress disorder and only 5 had restful sleep. We examined whether treatment with sleep hygiene counseling and oral prazosin would improve sleep, headaches, and cognitive performance. Nine weeks after providing sleep counseling and initiating an increasing dosage schedule of prazosin at bedtime, 65 veterans reported restful sleep. Peak headache pain (0-10 scale) decreased from 7.28 +/- 0.27 to 4.08 +/- 0.19 (values presented as mean +/- standard deviation). The number of headaches per month decreased from 12.40 +/- 0.94 to 4.77 +/- 0.34. Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores improved from 24.50 +/- 0.49 to 28.60 +/- 0.59. We found these gains maintained 6 months later. This pilot study suggests that addressing sleep is a good first step in treating posttraumatic headaches in OIF/OEF veterans."
CD010775,0,12799051,0,Morphometric analysis of cytolysis in cultured cell monolayers: a simple and versatile method for the evaluation of the lytic activity and the fate of LAK cells.,"The assessment of cytolytic activity of killer cells may not only be useful to improve routine analysis, e.g., in clinical settings, but may also offer new opportunities for the fundamental analysis of the mutual interaction between cytotoxic cells and their targets. We have developed a morphometric method to estimate cytolytic activity of activated natural killer (NK) cells by measuring the clearance of a precultured confluent monolayer of adherent target cells, e.g., immortalized fibroblasts. Cytotoxic cells are inoculated on top of confluent monolayers of target cells and after 2 h, nonadherent cells are washed off and intact adherent cells are fixed and stained with a Coomassie blue solution. Elementary computer-assisted analysis of the resulting microscopic images and measurement of the cleared area provide us with a sensitive and reproducible parameter of target cell lysis. We found that the assay can be used with targets of very different origin, as long as they form confluent monolayers, and with different populations of killer cells. The morphometric cytotoxicity assay (MoCA) offers several advantages: storage of samples for postponed analysis, increased sensitivity as compared to radioactive assays, continuous visualization during assay, availability of targets and effectors for subsequent analysis after interaction."

CD010775,0,8738022,0,"Monitoring for occupational exposure to 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of haemoglobin adducts, blood, plasma and urine.","The feasibility of using plasma, blood and haemoglobin adducts for monitoring occupational exposure to the suspected human carcinogen 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) was investigated. A method utilising capillary gas chromatography-negative-ion chemical-ionisation mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the determination of pentafluoropropionyl (PFP) derivatives of MOCA, released by alkaline hydrolysis from protein adducts and conjugates, was both sensitive and selective. When selected ion monitoring was used, sub-femtomole amounts of PFP-MOCA could be measured. The detection limit for haemoglobin adducts of MOCA was below 10 fmol/g Hb, well below the levels found for occupationally exposed individuals. Capillary GC with electron-capture detection also had the required sensitivity for the determination of MOCA in blood samples, however, the presence of interfering compounds in some samples limited its use. The levels of MOCA in the blood and urine of five individuals who were exposed to MOCA during the manufacture of polyurethane elastomers were determined by the GC-MS method. The MOCA concentrations for the various blood fractions and urine were within the following ranges: haemoglobin adducts, 0.73-43.3 pmol MOCA/g Hb; plasma alkaline hydrolysate, 0.05-22.0 nmol/l; whole blood, 0.13-17.4 nmol/l; urine, 4.5-2390 nmol/l. Because the products of MOCA in the blood reflect metabolic activation of MOCA and integrate exposure over a period of weeks, the use of blood samples for monitoring exposure to MOCA offers advantages over the currently used urinary MOCA measurements."

CD010775,0,1944238,0,Purification and characterization of human liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 2A6.,"Cytochrome P-450 (P-450) 2A6 was purified by chromatography of human liver microsomes. The final preparation was electrophoretically homogeneous and contained 16 nmol of P-450/mg of protein. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein (first 13 residues) matched that of the reported cDNA exactly. The UV-visible spectrum indicated that the isolated hemoprotein was in the low-spin form. The protein was recognized by rabbit antibodies raised against rat P-450 2A1, and a rabbit antiserum against the P-450 2A6 preparation was also prepared. With these antibodies, it was estimated that P-450 2A6 accounted for a maximum of 1% of the total P-450 present in the human liver microsomes; the level varied greater than 100-fold among the 20 samples examined. Purified P-450 2A6 catalyzed coumarin 7-hydroxylation and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation at rates similar to those measured in the human liver sample used to prepare P-450 2A6, and these two microsomal activities were strongly inhibited by the antibodies. The purified P-450 2A6 enzyme also catalyzed low levels of 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) N-oxidation and activation of aflatoxin B1, 6-aminochrysene, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, and 2-amino-3,5-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline to genotoxic products; the antibody inhibited the activity of purified P-450 2A6 towards aflatoxin B1 and 6-aminochrysene but did not inhibit these reactions in human liver microsomes (MOCA N-oxidation was inhibited approximately 20%). Human P-450 2A6 did not catalyze testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylation, a characteristic activity of the related rat P-450 2A1 protein. These results emphasize the need to characterize individual P-450 enzymes in order to understand their functions in the context of more complex systems."

CD010775,0,12194333,0,Microdosimetric one hit detector model for calculation of dose and energy response of some solid state detectors.,"A microdosimetric one hit detector model has been applied to calculate dose response, energy response and relative efficiency of thermoluminescent LiF:Mg,Cu,P (MCP-N), CaF2:Tm (TLD-300) and ESR alanine detectors on radiation of different qualities. For each detector type two model parameters, the target size and the saturation parameter, alpha, have been derived. Using those parameters and the microdosimetric distributions in nanometre size targets calculated using Monte Carlo track structure codes TRION and MOCA-14 it was possible to predict a great variety of experimental data for photons, X rays, beta electrons, protons, alpha particles and heavy ions. Due to a good reproducibility of experimental data some solid state detectors might be useful to test biophysical models of radiation action. Furthermore, these models can give some insight into the physics of radiation action in solid state detectors such as the range of charge interaction, energy levels etc."
