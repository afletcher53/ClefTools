CD010896,0,21896306,0,Imaging biomarkers in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons associated with intracellular Lewy inclusion bodies. The result is poverty of movement, increased muscle rigidity, and tremor at rest and on posture. Midbrain/nigral structural abnormalities can be demonstrated in vivo with both transcranial sonography (TCS) and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) while positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ligands exist to demonstrate dopamine terminal dysfunction. These radiotracers are markers of dopamine storage capacity, vesicular monoamine and dopamine transporter availability. While loss of putamen dopaminergic function leads to motor disability, Lewy bodies not only target dopamine neurons but have also been observed in serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons. As a consequence, non-dopaminergic neurotransmission is also impaired resulting in non-motor symptoms including sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, dementia, and autonomic dysfunction. PET and SPECT ligands exist to interrogate the function of monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons. Cortical and limbic Lewy body disease is seen in more advanced PD and this can be detected with FDG PET as abnormal covariance between levels of resting brain metabolism in these regions. Additionally, widespread microglial activation can be detected in PD with PET. This review discusses the role of structural and functional imaging for understanding parkinsonian syndromes and aiding in their diagnosis and management."
CD010896,0,22252239,0,Stem cell therapy for cerebral ischemia: from basic science to clinical applications.,"Recent stem cell technology provides a strong therapeutic potential not only for acute ischemic stroke but also for chronic progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with neuroregenerative neural cell replenishment and replacement. In addition to resident neural stem cell activation in the brain by neurotrophic factors, bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) can be mobilized by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor for homing into the brain for both neurorepair and neuroregeneration in acute stroke and neurodegenerative diseases in both basic science and clinical settings. Exogenous stem cell transplantation is also emerging into a clinical scene from bench side experiments. Early clinical trials of intravenous transplantation of autologous BMSCs are showing safe and effective results in stroke patients. Further basic sciences of stem cell therapy on a neurovascular unit and neuroregeneration, and further clinical advancements on scaffold technology for supporting stem cells and stem cell tracking technology such as magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission tomography or optical imaging with near-infrared could allow stem cell therapy to be applied in daily clinical applications in the near future."
CD010896,0,22994619,0,Classification of delusions in Alzheimer's disease and their neural correlates.,"Previous findings on neural correlates of delusion in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been inconsistent because of methodological issues, such as treating multiple delusions as a single entity. In this retrospective study, we classified AD delusions and investigated their neural correlates by using single-photon emission computed tomography data."

CD010896,0,22531416,0,Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease with early frontal lobe involvement associated with the Met239Ile mutation of Presenilin 2 gene.,"Mutations in the Presenilin 2 gene (PSEN2) represent the less frequent genetic cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Only eight PSEN2 mutations, reported in approximately 27 families, satisfied strict criteria of pathogenicity. We reported a patient with early-onset FAD and the PSEN2 p.Met239Ile mutation, presenting with severe executive dysfunction and myoclonic tremor, associated with memory loss. Brain SPECT study showed an early hypoperfusion of the frontal cortex. We confirmed the pathogenicity of PSEN2 p.Met239Ile mutation and its heterogeneous phenotypic expression. The modulating effect of the Apolipoprotein E and Prion Protein gene polymorphisms on the phenotypic variability was not confirmed."
CD010896,0,23254635,0,Low-abundant cerebrospinal fluid proteome alterations in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and shares multiple clinical and neuropathological parallels with Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A variety of clinical signs are suggestive for the diagnosis, and imaging (Î²CIT SPECT) contributes substantially to the diagnosis. The study reported here was performed in search for a biomarker in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these patients. We applied 2D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to analyze the CSF proteome pattern of DLB patients after depleting twelve high-abundant proteins. The densitometric analysis of 2D gels showed the up- or down-regulation of 44 protein spots. Subsequently, 23 different proteins were identified. The majority is involved in acute phase and immune response. Many of these proteins were previously reported before as being associated with AD or PD, which strongly suggests a molecular cross-talk and may explain clinical and pathological overlap of these disease entities. Among the identified proteins are two highly upregulated proteins-inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain (ITIH4) and calsyntenin 1-that may have the potential to serve as molecular biomarkers specific for DLB. The identification of DLB-associated proteome changes will help to further understand pathological processes occurring in DLB and may provide future prospects to diagnostic and therapeutic options."

We investigated the effects of cilostazol, an antiplatelet agent and cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, on cognition and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in elderly patients with AD and cerebrovascular disease (CVD)."
CD010896,0,22704835,0,Low-dose cerebral CT perfusion imaging (CTPI) of senile dementia: diagnostic performance.,"To evaluate the clinical value of low-dose cerebral CTPI in the diagnosis of senile dementia, as an attempt to develop a new imaging method to diagnose this disease and measure its severity. 95 patients of senile dementia (52 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 43 with vascular dementia (VD)) and 30 healthy subjects (control group) were underwent low-dose cerebral CTPI examinations with multi-slices spiral CT. The CTPI images were analyzed using perfusion software. Derived perfusion parameters including cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP) were measured. Diagnostic value of perfusion parameters was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The CBV and CBF of both of frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus and basal ganglial area in the patients with senile dementia were much lower than those in the healthy group. And MTT and TTP of the areas above-mentioned in the senile dementia group were higher than those in the control group. There was statistically significant difference between them (p<0.05). The areas under ROC curves of perfusion parameters left temporal lobe MTT, left the basal ganglia MTT and left the hippocampus MTT to diagnose senile dementia were 0.959, 0.920, 0.916, and diagnostic accuracy rate is higher. The areas under ROC curve of the left frontal MTT, the left basal ganglia CBV were 0.867 and 0.819, diagnosis accuracy medium. The results showed that cerebral CTPI is valuable for the diagnosis of senile dementia."

CD010896,0,22135130,0,Imaging approaches for dementia.,"Brain imaging has progressed from exclusion of rare treatable mass lesions to a specific antemortem diagnosis. MR imaging-derived hippocampal atrophy and WMH are regarded as imaging biomarkers of AD and CVD respectively. Abnormal FP-CIT SPECT or cardiac iodobenzamide SPECT is a useful supportive imaging feature in the diagnosis of DLB. Frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy and anterior defects on molecular imaging with FDG-PET or perfusion SPECT are characteristic of FTDs. Whole-body FDG-PET may be helpful in patients with rapidly progressing ""autoimmune dementias,"" and FLAIR and DWI are indicated in suspected CJD. A major role of imaging is in the development of new drugs and less costly biomarkers."

CD010896,0,22050286,0,Glucose metabolism in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: a statistical parametric mapping analysis of (18) F-FDG PET.,"Reports describing functional neuroimaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) have consistently suggested that these tools are sensitive for the identification of areas of hypoperfusion or hypometabolism, even in the early stages of sCJD. However, there are few reports on the use of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET in sCJD, and most of them are single case reports. Only two small cohort studies based on visual inspection or a region of interest method have been published to date. Using a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis of (18) F-FDG PET, we investigated whether there are brain regions preferentially affected in sCJD."
CD010896,0,23429844,0,New molecular targets for PET and SPECT imaging in neurodegenerative diseases.,"The pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases (ND) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has not yet been completely elucidated. However, in the past few years, there have been great knowledge advances about intra-and extracellular proteins that may display impaired function or expression in AD, PD and other ND, such as amyloid beta (AÎ²), Î±-synuclein, tau protein and neuroinflammatory markers. Recent developments in the imaging techniques of positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) now allow the non-invasive tracking of such molecular targets of known relevance to ND in vivo. This article summarizes recent findings of PET and SPECT studies using these novel methods, and discusses their potential role in the field of drug development for ND as well as future clinical applications in regard to differential diagnosis of ND and monitoring of disease progression."
CD010896,0,23224109,0,Multivariate classification of patients with Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies using high-dimensional cortical thickness measurements: an MRI surface-based morphometric study.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the most common neurodegenerative dementia types. It is important to differentiate between them because of the differences in prognosis and treatment approaches.
CD010896,0,21590591,0,[A case of affective disorder with psychotic symptoms as late manifestation of Huntington's Chorea].,"We report about a woman of 60 years who received psychiatric inpatient treatment for an affective disorder with psychotic symptoms on several occasions. As time elapsed symptoms of dementia became more and more obvious. Despite a comprehensive workup with neuroimaging methods (SPECT, PET) the correct diagnosis of Huntington's Chorea was not attained until the characteristic movements appeared. Up till then pathologic movements had hardly occurred and there were no known cases of Huntington's Chorea in the family. This case is remarkable as the patient was not only treated with different antidepressants and antipsychotics but with a course of ECT too. Beyond this it shows the enormous stress this illness imposes on patients and their caregivers."
CD010896,0,22377781,1,Is long-term prognosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration predictable by neuroimaging? Evidence from a single-subject functional brain study.,"Prediction of survival in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is guesswork. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether SPECT scan may be useful to predict prognosis of long term survival in FTLD patients. A cohort of 125 patients with FTLD who underwent brain SPECT scan at the time of enrollment and who were further followed up for at least one year were considered. In each subject, volume of interests (VOIs) covering frontotemporal and parietal regions, bilaterally, were drawn. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on VOIs, and a Cox regression model was carried out to find out best predictors of survival. A two-pattern PCA solution was chosen, explaining more than 70% of variance, and ""frontal"" PC1 and ""temporal"" PC2 components were identified. The frontal PC1 was associated with higher rate of faster progression (HR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.23-3.44, p = 0.006 for univariate model, and HR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.04-3.28, p = 0.03 for multivariate model). In particular, right orbitofrontal cortex showed the higher loadings in PC1; the worse the scores of this region the shorter the survival was reported. We suggest that SPECT imaging, beyond a helpful tool in diagnostic assessment, may be an easily and accessible marker of disease outcome in FTLD. Further studies considering structural neuroimaging are warranted."
CD010896,0,22773150,0,Correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and regional cerebral blood flow in degenerative dementia.,"Chronic low serum vitamin D concentrations are common among the elderly. Recent studies have suggested that its metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), might be important for preserving cognitive functions through specific brain protective effects. However, this hypothesis is still under discussion. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between serum 25-OHD concentrations and regional cerebral blood flow in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia of Lewy bodies (DLB)."
CD010896,0,21411339,0,Prognosis of vascular mild cognitive impairment includes vascular dementia onset and death by cardiovascular disease: reanalysis from the Osaki-Tajiri project.,"The relationship of predementia stage with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) has not been fully clarified. Following our Prevalence Study 1998 in Tajiri, Japan, Incidence Study 2003 disclosed that 17.9% of subjects developed vascular dementia (VaD). Some cases developed after stroke (type I), whereas others already met the criteria for subcortical VaD (SVD) despite very mild stage (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0.5) and progressed to mild stage (CDR 1) (type II). We hypothesized that prognosis of vascular mild cognitive impairment (MCI) included type II VaD or death due to causes associated with vascular risk factors. Prevalence Study 1998 included 497 randomly selected participants, including 346 with a CDR of 0, 119 with a CDR of 0.5, and 32 with a CDR of 1+. The first 2 groups were targeted for Incidence Study 2003. Based on the database, we reanalyzed the ratio of SVD in the subjects with CDR 0.5 and VaD, prognosis with or without CVD, and 2 types of VaD onset. The criteria for SVD were achieved by 67% of those with VaD and by 7% of those with vascular MCI (ie, CDR 0.5). In the CDR 0 group, CVD had no affect on prognosis; however, in the CDR 0.5 group, CVD had an affect on death by cardiovascular disease. The majority of subjects in the CDR 0 and CDR 0.5-CVD (-) groups were classified as type I, whereas all subjects in the CDR 0.5-CVD (+) group were type II. Although vascular MCI is treatable, it may progress to death as well as apparent dementia. Individuals with this ""buried under the community"" phenomenon of SVD should be targeted for secondary prevention interventions."

CD010896,0,23186984,0,Clinical observational research on Alzheimer's disease: what clinical trial registries can tell.,"This study describes the main characteristics of ongoing observational studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) to help identify any important research gaps. A search through the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and on the Primary Registries was conducted on 9 June 2012. The descriptors 'recruiting' or 'open' were used to describe a study's recruitment status. 62 studies are being conducted in 18 countries (Australia, Far-East, Middle-East, North America, and Western Europe). The US and France are involved in 55% of these studies. The studies aimed to recruit 20 to 10,000 participants, lasting 8 months to 24 years; 46% are case-control, whereas 44% are cohort studies; 60% and 34% are longitudinal and cross-sectional, respectively. The majority are sponsored by hospitals, universities, medical centers, or public health systems (63%), and are conducted in single centers (55%). 37 use imaging (MRI, PET, SPECT), 18 conduct lumbar puncture, 21 collect DNA and/or RNA, and 15 collect ApoE genotyping. 17 studies are medium-term prospective disease progression studies, the majority to assess mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or/and AD progression; only 3 are on cognitively normal older people at risk (2 studies, n = 180) or not (1 study, n < 200) of developing MCI. Observational studies are being conducted in few countries, with very few in low and middle-income countries where the majority of AD patients live. There is a remarkable interest in disease progression studies; however, longitudinal, long-term studies, on cognitively normal middle-age individuals, of key importance to try to fully understand the preclinical phase of AD, are lacking."
CD010896,0,21987568,0,[A clinicopathological study of young-onset dementia: report of 2 autopsied cases].,"We retrospectively examined the clinical features and the neuroradiological findings on autopsy of 2 cases of young-onset dementia. The patient in case 1 was a 43-year-old woman who was unable to determine the time on the clock and who made frivolous remarks. Neuropsychological test batteries demonstrated memory impairment and frontal lobe dysfunction. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed abnormal high-intensity signals around the lateral ventricles and thinning of the corpus callosum. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed patchy reduction in the accumulation of tracers in both the frontal lobes. Her neurological condition gradually deteriorated, and she died 13 years after the onset of the disease. She was clinically diagnosed with atypical Alzheimer's disease on the basis of visual cognitive impairment and memory impairment observed in the initial phase. However, the neuropathological diagnosis was adult-onset leukodystrophy with axonal spheroids. The patient in case 2 was a 43-year-old man who had gradually started behaving selfishly and had become ill-tempered and apathetic. He was admitted to a hospital. He was anosognosic and showed frontal lobe dysfunction. T2-weighted MRI scan of the brain showed abnormal high-intensity signals around the lateral ventricles; atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, hippocampus, and brainstem; and thinning of the corpus callosum. SPECT revealed patchy reduction in the accumulation of tracers in both the frontal lobes and the cerebellum. His neurological condition gradually deteriorated, and he died after being clinically ill for 7 years. The patient was clinically diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia on the basis of the clinical features and MRI findings. However, the neuropathological diagnosis was chronic meningoencephalitis. The frequency of neurological metabolic and inflammatory diseases is significantly high although it is not as high as that of degenerative diseases in young-onset dementia. Since such diseases may respond to therapy, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of young-onset dementia, especially in patients presenting with atypical clinical features. Neuroradiological examination may contribute to the differential diagnosis of atypical dementia at young age."

CD010896,0,21779719,0,Neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease: current role in clinical practice and potential future applications.,"'Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and its prevalence is expected to increase in the coming years. Therefore, accurate diagnosis is crucial for patients, clinicians and researchers. Neuroimaging techniques have provided invaluable information about Alzheimer's disease and, owing to recent advances, these methods will have an increasingly important role in research and clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to review recent neuroimaging studies of Alzheimer's disease that provide relevant information to clinical practice, including a new modality: in vivo amyloid imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission computed tomography and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography are currently available for clinical use. Patients with suspected Alzheimer's disease are commonly investigated with magnetic resonance imaging because it provides detailed images of brain structure and allows the identification of supportive features for the diagnosis. Neurofunctional techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography can also be used to complement the diagnostic investigation in cases of uncertainty. Amyloid imaging is a non-invasive technique that uses positron emission tomography technology to investigate the accumulation of the Î²-amyloid peptide in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. This is a promising test but currently its use is restricted to very few specialized research centers in the world. Technological innovations will probably increase its availability and reliability, which are the necessary steps to achieve robust clinical applicability. Thus, in the future it is likely that amyloid imaging techniques will be used in the clinical evaluation of patients with Alzheimer's disease."
CD010896,0,21920750,0,A dual fluorinated and iodinated radiotracer for PET and SPECT imaging of Î²-amyloid plaques in the brain.,"We report a fluorinated and iodinated radiotracer as a probe for PET/SPECT to detect of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We successfully designed and synthesized the fluorinated and iodinated aurone derivative (3) and its radiolabels ([(125)I]3 and [(18)F]3). In binding experiments in vitro, 3 showed high affinity for AÎ² aggregates (K(i)=6.81nM). In brain sections of AD model mice, 3 intensely stained AÎ² plaques. Furthermore, a specific plaque labeling signal was observed on the autoradiography of postmortem AD brain sections using [(125)I]3. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, [(125)I]3 and [(18)F]3 displayed good uptake into and a rapid washout from the brain, properties highly desirable for AÎ² imaging agents. These results suggest that 3 may function as a PET/SPECT dual imaging agent for detecting AÎ² plaques in AD brains."

CD010896,0,21959363,0,Regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities associated with apathy and depression in Alzheimer disease.,"The aim of this study was to identify brain areas related to apathy or depression in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Eighty-one AD patients were enrolled in this prospective study. (99m)Tc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography was performed to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). According to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory subscores of apathy and depression, 9 patients were classified as clinically significant (cs) depressed and non-cs-apathetic (D+) groups and 9 were classified as cs-apathetic and non-cs-depressed (A+) groups. In addition, 18 patients were classified as age-matched and Mini-Mental State Examination-matched disease control groups (D-, A-). The significance of rCBF differences between groups and the correlation between rCBF and subscores in 81 AD patients were estimated by SPM (uncorrected P < 0.005) analysis. D+ patients had significantly lower perfusion in the right orbitofrontal and inferior frontal gyri than D- patients, whereas A+ patients had this in the right amygdala, temporal, posterior cingulate, right superior frontal, postcentral, and left superior temporal gyri than A- patients. The negatively correlated areas with depression subscores included the left inferior frontal and the right middle frontal gyri and those with apathy subscores included the right temporal and right medial frontal gyri. We suggest that this finding may indicate that apathy and depression in AD patients involve distinct functional circuits."

To illustrate MUBADA we analyzed data from 104 participants comprising Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, and elderly normal controls. Brain images were analyzed via 28 ROIs (59,845 voxels) selected for clinical relevance. This is a discriminant analysis (DA) question with several blocks (one per ROI) and with more variables than observations, a configuration that precludes using DA. MUBADA revealed two factors explaining 74% and 26% of the total variance: Factor 1 isolated FTD, and Factor 2 isolated AD. A random effects model correctly classified 64% (chance = 33%) of ""new"" participants (p < 0.0001). MUBADA identified ROIs that best discriminated groups: ROIs separating FTD were bilateral inferior, middle frontal, left inferior, and middle temporal gyri, while ROIs separating AD were bilateral thalamus, inferior parietal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, left precuneus, middle frontal, and middle temporal gyri. MUBADA classified participants at levels comparable to standard methods (i.e., SVM, PCA-LDA, and PLS-DA) but provided information (e.g., discriminative ROIs and voxels) not easily accessible to these methods."

CD010896,0,21434859,0,PET and SPECT radiotracers to assess function and expression of ABC transporters in vivo.,"Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) are expressed in high concentrations at various physiological barriers (e.g. blood-brain barrier, blood-testis barrier, blood-tumor barrier), where they impede the tissue accumulation of various drugs by active efflux transport. Changes in ABC transporter expression and function are thought to be implicated in various diseases, such as cancer, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The availability of a non-invasive imaging method which allows for measuring ABC transporter function or expression in vivo would be of great clinical use in that it could facilitate the identification of those patients that would benefit from treatment with ABC transporter modulating drugs. To date three different kinds of imaging probes have been described to measure ABC transporters in vivo: i) radiolabelled transporter substrates ii) radiolabelled transporter inhibitors and iii) radiolabelled prodrugs which are enzymatically converted into transporter substrates in the organ of interest (e.g. brain). The design of new imaging probes to visualize efflux transporters is inter alia complicated by the overlapping substrate recognition pattern of different ABC transporter types. The present article will describe currently available ABC transporter radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and critically discuss strengths and limitations of individual probes and their potential clinical applications."

He experienced three episodes of delusional ideas; the first two occurred after loss of consciousness and the third after delirium at night. MRI findings of left caudate head infarction were the same for all three episodes. An unstable cerebral perfusion may have caused problems in the cerebral network between the caudate head and cerebral cortex. Decreased cerebral blood flow in the frontal lobe was noted particularly in the second and third episodes, supporting the neurological background of disinhibition of emotional behaviour. Antipsychotic drugs and a small dose of risperidone were effective in controlling the patient's delusional ideas."

Description of the psychopathology is illustrated with examples of patient's writings in order to demonstrate cognitive abilities at different stages. The diagnosis is supported by MRI and SPECT scans. The authors discuss the difficulties in differentiating the clinical presentation of chronic BPAD and FTD and examine the evidence for two important questions: Is there a relationship between BPAD and FTD and is there a relationship between lithium and risk of dementia? This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported SPECT scan finding in a case of frontotemporal dementia following chronic bipolar affective disorder."
CD010896,0,22460160,0,Cognitive impairment in degenerative parkinsonisms: role of radionuclide brain imaging.,"Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes is gaining increased clinical significance. The neurochemical and neuropathological basis in the various parkinsonian forms and even in an individual patient are not fully elucidated yet and could be heterogeneous. Loss of dopaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic innervation has been suggested to be the underlying neurochemical deficits for cognitive impairment and dementia in PD, but the onset of cognitive impairment and the progression to dementia may not share the same underlying neurochemical basis. Similarly, pathological evidence is also heterogeneous, ranging from subcortical pathology, limbic or cortical Lewy body type degeneration, and Alzheimer's type pathology that can be found even in the same patient with PD dementia (PDD). Typically, the prototype of early cognitive deficit in PD is a dysexecutive syndrome, but other cognitive domains are more involved when dementia develops, mainly including visuospatial, language and memory dysfunction. Functional radionuclide neuroimaging, by means of single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography, are contributing to characterize the topographic cortical pattern of cognitive impairment, as well as to define the underlying neurochemical deficit. Lastly, the advent of amyloid PET may help clarifying the meaning of amyloid load in diffuse Lewy body disease and PDD. Knowing the neurochemical and pathophysiological substrate of cognitive deficit in patients with PD or other degenerative Parkinsonisms may help the clinician in understanding the clinical condition of an individual patient in order to plan pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention. The introduction of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for therapy of PDD is an example of information integration between clinical-neuropsychological and pathophysiological-neurochemical aspects obtained also with the key contribution of functional neuroimaging."
CD010896,0,23777101,0,[The biomarker and treatment in Hashimoto's encephalopahty].,"Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is a treatable disease based on autoimmune mechanisms associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. We recently discovered the serum autoantibodies (Abs) against the NH2-terminal of alpha-enolase (NAE) as a diagnostic biomarker for HE. The serum anti-NAE Abs are not detected in normal individuals and other disorders such as infections, collagen diseases, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions. The specificity of the serum anti-NAE Abs is 91% for HE whereas the sensitivity is 50%. In our clinical study of 80 cases of HE with anti-NAE Abs, the acute encephalopathic form was the most common clinical feature, and followed by chronic psychiatric form and progressive ataxia form. The common neuropsychiatric features were consciousness disturbance, psychosis (especially delirium and hallucination), seizures and dementia. Abnormalities on EEG and decreased blood flow on SPECT were common while abnormalities on brain MRI were rare. The early diagnosis and treatment for HE could lead to good recovery from the disease. Taken together, the serum anti-NAE Abs are a useful diagnostic biomarker for HE."
CD010896,0,21729421,0,Perfusion SPECT and FDG-PET.,"Both perfusion SPECT and FDG-PET provide images that closely reflect neuronal activity. There is a characteristic regional impairment in Alzheimerâs disease (AD) that involves mainly the temporo-parietal association cortices, mesial temporal structures and to a more variable degree also the frontal association cortex. This pattern of functional impairment can provide a biomarker for diagnosis of AD and other neurodegenerative dementias at the clinical stage of mild cognitive impairment, and for monitoring of progression. FDG-PET is quantitatively more accurate and thus better suited to multicenter studies than perfusion SPECT. Regional metabolic and blood flow changes are closely related to clinical symptoms, and most areas involved in these changes will also develop significant cortical atrophy. FDG-PET is complementary to amyloid PET, which targets a molecular marker that does not have a close relation to current symptoms. Current restrictions in the availability and cost of FDG-PET are being reduced, as oncological FDG-PET is being adopted as a standard clinical service in most countries. Limitations in the availability of trained staff should be overcome by training programs set up by professional organizations. Against the background of the development of new criteria for diagnosing AD before the onset of dementia, FDG-PET is expected to play an increasing role in diagnosing patients at an early stage of AD and in clinical trials of drugs aimed at preventing or delaying the onset of dementia."

Clinical diagnosis of DLB has high specificity but low sensitivity. Clinical trials of [(123)I]N-Ï-fluoropropyl-2Î²-carbomethoxy-3Î²-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography ([(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT) indicate high positive and negative percent agreement with reference to clinical diagnosis, and high sensitivity and specificity in patients with neuropathologically confirmed diagnoses of DLB. An abnormal [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT image in patients fulfilling criteria for possible DLB advances the certainty of a diagnosis to probable DLB. [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT, by identifying the striatal dopaminergic deficit, can be a valuable diagnostic aid and can provide support to a clinical diagnosis of DLB in patients with dementia. The technique is likely to be of particular utility in patients with dementia with an uncertain diagnosis."
CD010896,0,21694448,0,Review and meta-analysis of biomarkers and diagnostic imaging in Alzheimer's disease.,"Mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often difficult to differentiate from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or non-AD dementias. A multitude of diagnostic biomarkers and advanced imaging strategies have been developed to aid in the diagnosis and management of AD. We sought to review and analyze the published evidence on key test characteristics of major diagnostic strategies to formulate best estimates of sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP). A systematic review was undertaken to locate and abstract all studies of biomarkers or diagnostic imaging for AD published in English from January 1990 to March 2010 that provided estimates of SN and SP. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate mixed-effects binary regression model. We calculated -SN, SP, and area under the receiver operating curves (AUROC), with confidence and prediction contours. Of 1,840 unique studies identified, 119 presented primary data sufficient for analysis. SN and SP were calculated against non-demented controls, non-AD dementias with and without MCI, if available. Compared to non-demented controls, FDG-PET demonstrated the highest AUROC (0.96), with 90% SN (95%CI 84% to 94%), and 89% SP (95% CI 81% to 94%). FDG-PET also was most accurate in discriminating AD from demented controls (including MCI) with AUROC 0.91, and 92% SN (95%CI 84% to 96%) and 78% SP (95% CI 69% to 85%). For discrimination of AD from non-AD dementias (excluding MCI), CSF Ptau, and SPECT produced identical AUROC (0.86). Diagnostic strategies for AD show wide variation in test characteristics and some show promise for use in clinical practice."

CD010896,0,23660005,0,Functional activity maps based on significance measures and Independent Component Analysis.,"The use of functional imaging has been proven very helpful for the process of diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In many cases, the analysis of these images is performed by manual reorientation and visual interpretation. Therefore, new statistical techniques to perform a more quantitative analysis are needed. In this work, a new statistical approximation to the analysis of functional images, based on significance measures and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is presented. After the images preprocessing, voxels that allow better separation of the two classes are extracted, using significance measures such as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U-Test (MWW) and Relative Entropy (RE). After this feature selection step, the voxels vector is modelled by means of ICA, extracting a few independent components which will be used as an input to the classifier. Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used in this work. The proposed system has been applied to two different databases. A 96-subjects Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) database from the ""Virgen de las Nieves"" Hospital in Granada, Spain, and a 196-subjects Positron Emission Tomography (PET) database from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Values of accuracy up to 96.9% and 91.3% for SPECT and PET databases are achieved by the proposed system, which has yielded many benefits over methods proposed on recent works."
CD010896,0,23209065,0,[Depression and dementia: perspectives from clinical studies].,"In this review, we present an overview of clinical studies that addressed the relationship between depression and dementia or cognitive decline. Cross-sectional studies and meta-analyses have repeatedly shown an association between late-life depression (LLD) and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia; however, the findings of cohort studies have been inconsistent. Furthermore, studies on the association between depression with a younger age of onset and dementia have yielded inconsistent results. Regarding cognitive decline associated with LLD, several studies have reported an association between LLD and mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that depression itself can cause persistent cognitive impairment. Other studies have compared the cognitive profile between LLD and depression with a younger age of onset, but their results have been inconclusive, especially regarding the association between memory impairment and the age of onset of depression. LLD is associated with vascular change and white matter degeneration of the brain, as shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, several studies reported an association between gray matter change and LLD. Studies currently in progress employ functional brain imaging methods such as single-photon emission computed tomography, functional MRI, and positron emission tomography. Clinically, it is important to understand how subtypes of depression can be defined in terms of risk of developing dementia, and to devise effective treatments. One paper explored the possibility of detecting depression associated with AD by measuring the blood AÎ²40/AÎ²42 levels, and other studies have suggested that symptoms of apathy and loss of interest are associated with conversion of depression to AD. Unfortunately, current antidepressants may have limited efficacy on depression with dementia; therefore, further investigation for devising methods of predicting conversion of depression to dementia and subsequent treatment is required."

CD010896,0,22791632,0,Brain perfusion anomalies in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder with mild cognitive impairment.,"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is an important risk factor for Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Approximately 50% of patients with REM sleep behavior disorder have mild cognitive impairment. Our objective was to investigate brain perfusion changes associated with mild cognitive impairment in REM sleep behavior disorder. Twenty patients with REM sleep behavior disorder, including 10 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 10 patients without mild cognitive impairment, and 20 healthy controls underwent a complete neuropsychological assessment and single-photon emission computerized tomography using (99mc) Tc-Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer. Compared with controls, both REM sleep behavior disorder groups had hypoperfusion in the frontal regions. In addition, patients with REM sleep behavior disorder and mild cognitive impairment showed cortical hypoperfusion in the occipital, temporal, and parietal regions compared with controls and patients with REM sleep behavior disorder without mild cognitive impairment. Both REM sleep behavior disorder groups had hyperperfusion in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri. However, patients with REM sleep behavior disorder and mild cognitive impairment showed more pronounced anomalies in the right hippocampus and had increased perfusion in the putamen and the left paracentral gyrus. This study showed specific patterns of posterior cortical hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion in some brain areas in patients with REM sleep behavior disorder and mild cognitive impairment, similar to those found in Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. This suggests the presence of an identifiable neuroimaging marker of synucleinopathy in REM sleep behavior disorder with mild cognitive impairment. Â© 2012 Movement Disorder Society."

CD010896,0,23026363,0,Neuronuclear imaging in the evaluation of dementia and mild decline in cognition.,"Recently, the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association identified specific structural and functional neuroimaging findings as valuable markers of biological processes occurring in the human brain, especially processes that herald impending dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its prodromal form. In particular, the imaging modalities of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) were singled out, along with certain biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, to serve this purpose. We review the clinical tests available for neuropsychologic evaluation and in cases when the differential diagnosis for the causes of cognitive impairment is difficult to make, we consider biomarkers, beginning with cerebrospinal fluid, for assessment of cognitive decline. For more direct information on dementia-related pathologic changes in brain tissue, structural features observed in magnetic resonance imaging scans are regarded. We next discuss the use of single-photon emission computed tomography for evaluating functional changes. Then, pertinent to the recent National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association's consensus statement on the diagnosis of prodromal AD, we focus on assessing the cerebral metabolic changes associated with neurodegenerative diseases that are identified with fluorodeoxyglucose PET, as well as consider the most appropriate roles for amyloid imaging based on recent studies examining the use of PET with tracers having higher retention in brain tissue-harboring plaques composed of insoluble beta-amyloid. We also consider the leading causes for the current underuse of neuronuclear imaging in evaluating patients with cognitive problems, along with strategies for combating them. Finally, we suggest an overall diagnostic algorithm to guide optimal use of all the neuroimaging tools in assessing patients with cognitive decline."
CD010896,0,21971457,0,Effects of hypoperfusion in Alzheimer's disease.,"The role of hypoperfusion in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a vital component to understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. Disrupted perfusion is not only evident throughout disease manifestation, it is also demonstrated during the pre-clinical phase of AD (i.e., mild cognitive impairment) as well as in cognitively healthy persons at high-risk for developing AD due to family history or genetic factors. Studies have used a variety of imaging modalities (e.g., SPECT, MRI, PET) to investigate AD, but with its recent technological advancements and non-invasive use of blood water as an endogenous tracer, arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI has become an imaging technique of growing popularity. Through numerous ASL studies, it is now known that AD is associated with both global and regional cerebral hypoperfusion and that there is considerable overlap between the regions implicated in the disease state (consistently reported in precuneus/posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortex) and those implicated in disease risk. Debate exists as to whether decreased blood flow in AD is a cause or consequence of the disease. Nonetheless, hypoperfusion in AD is associated with both structural and functional changes in the brain and offers a promising putative biomarker that could potentially identify AD in its pre-clinical state and be used to explore treatments to prevent, or at least slow, the progression of the disease. Finally, given that perfusion is a vascular phenomenon, we provide insights from a vascular lesion model (i.e., stroke) and illustrate the influence of disrupted perfusion on brain structure and function and, ultimately, cognition in AD."
CD010896,0,21971454,0,Nuclear medicine diagnostic techniques in the era of pathophysiology-based CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.,"Nuclear medicine techniques were the first functional imaging techniques used to support the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Perfusion-SPECT allows registration of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) which is altered in a characteristic temporal-parietal pattern in AD. Numerous studies have shown the diagnostic value of reduced CBF and metabolic changes using perfusion-SPECT and FDG-PET in AD diagnosis as well as in differential diagnosis against frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy-Bodies (DLB), and vascular cognitive disorders. This renders perfusion-SPECT an important piece of the puzzle (together with other diagnostic tests) by the clinician is often faced when making a final etiologic dementia diagnosis especially between AD and FTD. A similar diagnostic value can be expected when arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI sequence is used, but the diagnostic value has yet to be confirmed in lager studies. Recently, more pathophysiology-based biomarkers in CSF and Amyloid-PET tracers have been developed that probably have a higher diagnostic accuracy than the more indirect rCBF changes seen in perfusion-SPECT. In the current review, we describe recent advances in AD biomarkers as well as improvements in the SPECT technique."
CD010896,0,22735052,0,Amyloid plaque imaging from IMPY/SPECT to AV-45/PET.,"The formation and deposition of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques are the earliest pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular imaging of AÎ² plaques could serve as a surrogate marker in early diagnosis and neuropathogenesis studies of AD. Several radionuclide labeled ligands have recently been developed for noninvasive visualization of AÎ² plaques in the brains of AD patients using single photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography (PET). There has been rapid progress in the field of imaging for plaque pathology. AV-45 was the first plaque imaging agent to enter multi-center, investigational new drug clinical trials in the US, and has now been studied in dozens of trials with more than 1,000 subjects ranging from cognitively normal individuals to those with AD dementia. ""Imaging to autopsy"" phase III studies further confirmed and validated the specific imaging signal correlated to the plaque burden in living subjects. With these promising and confirmed characteristics of AV-45, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) under common consensus decided on AV-45 as the emerging standard PET imaging agent for evaluating the progression of plaque pathology in patients with AD or mild cognition impairment, and even healthy controls. With the wide availability of AV-45 for plaque imaging, the ultimate goal of the ADNI is global clinical trials for disease detection and progression.

Most patients diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy will finally develop a typical Alzheimer's disease. However, there are a variety of neuropathological processes, which could lead towards a clinical presentation of posterior cortical atrophy. Mutations in the presenilin 1 gene, affecting the function of Î³-secretase, are the most common genetic cause of familial, early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Here we present a patient with a clinical diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy who harbors a novel Presenilin 1 mutation (I211M). In silico analysis predicts that the mutation could influence the interaction between presenilin 1 and presenilin1 enhancer-2 protein, a protein partner within the Î³-secretase complex.

These Re complexes were designed and synthesized via the integrated approach, so their (99m)Tc analogs would have a greater chance of crossing the blood-brain barrier.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and PRNP 129 codon status have been demonstrated to increase the risk of PPA, but with contrasting results. In the present study, we have evaluated the impact of FOXP2, APOE and PRNP genetic variations as risk factors and/or disease-modulators in PPA. 94 PPA patients and 200 age-matched healthy controls were considered and FOXP2 polymorphisms (rs1456031, rs17137124), APOE genotype, and PRNP codon 129 polymorphism analyzed. In 34 PPA patients, SPECT imaging data were analyzed by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8). Genetic distributions and allele frequencies of FOXP2 and PRNP polymorphisms did not differ between groups while APOE Îµ4 was more represented in PPA as compared to controls. PPA patients carrying at-risk FOXP2 polymorphisms (rs1456031 and/or rs17137124) showed greater hypoperfusion in the frontal areas, namely the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right cingulated gyrus compared to non-carriers (p < 0.005). PPA patients carrying at least one Îµ4 allele had greater hypoperfusion in orbitofrontal regions (superior frontal gyrus and orbital gyrus) as compared to non-carriers Îµ4 (p < 0.005). PRNP codon 129 homozigosity correlated with left frontotemporal hypoperfusion (p < 0.005).

The mean age at onset of prion disease is late 60s while the range is fairly wide. Brain MRIs and increase of CSF 14-3-3 and tau protein levels are very characteristic. Classical sporadic CJD could show completely normal T1WI with patchy high signals in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia on DWI. In Japan, classical sporadic CJD (MM1) is most popular but there are some rare atypical subtypes. Among them, MM2-thalamic CJD is hardest to diagnose because it shows no high intensity signals on DWI, in addition to frequent absence of CSF and EEG characteristics. In this case, CBF decrease in the thalamus on SPECT is very helpful. Genetic prion diseases in Japan are quite distinct from those in Europe. V180I and M232R mutations are unique to Japan and show sporadic CJD phenotype. Dura graft-associated CJD (dCJD) are composed of 67% of classical sporadic CJD phenotype and 33% of atypical phenotype showing slower progression with amyloid plaques. Trace-back experiments suggested the PrP(sc) of the atypical dCJD was likely to be modified from infection of abnormal VV2 protein. Although there are some atypical forms of prion diseases as mentioned above, almost all prion cases could be diagnosed with EEG, MRI, genetic test, CSF test and SPECT. We also have some incidents in which brain surgery was done before the diagnosis of prion disease and many other patients were operated using the same operating instruments before their sterilization against prion disease had been done. The explanation of possibility of prion disease infection to the patients and their follow-up was started by the incident committee. It is very important for all the nations to cooperate with each other in order to overcome this intractable disease."

CD010896,0,23568100,0,Overlap between frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease: cerebrospinal fluid pattern and neuroimaging study.,Differential diagnosis between frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often challenging. Autopsy series have identified AD pathology in a consistent percentage of patients clinically diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It has been demonstrated that the levels of tau and AÎ²42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are a reliable marker for AD.
CD010896,0,21729418,0,Amyloid imaging.,"Molecular neuroimaging techniques such as PET are proving valuable in the early and differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).With the advent of new therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) burden in the brain to potentially prevent or delay functional and irreversible cognitive loss, there is increased interest in developing agents that allow assessment of AÎ² burden in vivo. Amyloid imaging with PET has proven useful in the discrimination of dementias, showing significantly higher AÎ² burden in the gray matter of AD patients when compared with healthy controls or patients with frontotemporal dementia. ApoE Îµ4 carriers, independent of diagnosis or disease severity, present with higher AÎ² burden than non-Îµ4 carriers. Amyloid imaging matches histopathological reports in aging and dementia, reflecting the true regional density of AÎ² plaques in cortical areas. It also appears to be more sensitive than FDG-PET for the diagnosis of AD. In healthy older people there is an increasing prevalence of amyloid positive scans with age, rising from 20% in the seventh decade to 60% in the ninth decade. Of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 40-60% present with detectable cortical AÎ² deposition. In both groups, AÎ² deposition is associated with a higher risk for cognitive decline and dementia due to AD. These observations suggest that AÎ² deposition is not part of normal aging, supporting the hypothesis that it occurs well before the onset of symptoms and is likely to represent preclinical AD in asymptomatic persons and prodromal AD in MCI. Further longitudinal observations, coupled with different disease-specific tracers and biomarkers, are required to confirm this hypothesis and further elucidate the precise role of AÎ² deposition in the course of AD."

On neurologic examination, he had ideomotor apraxia and incomplete Gerstmann syndrome that was characterized by acalculia, agraphia, and finger agnosia. On imaging, multiple cystic lesions reported as ""unusually dilated perivascular spaces"" were observed along the medullary arteries in the left hemisphere; some of them had adjacent hyperintense areas in fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. We assumed that the multiple cystic lesions caused his higher cerebral dysfunction, because ideomotor apraxia and Gerstmann syndrome are usually indicative of a left parietal lobe lesion. MR spectroscopy in the lesion site revealed increased lactate. On MR angiography, the left middle cerebral artery and the left posterior cerebral artery were poorly visualized without localized stenosis. Technetium-99 bicisate single-photon emission computed tomography showed severely decreased cerebral blood flow in the left hemisphere. Electroencephalography showed slow waves in the left hemisphere."

CD010896,0,21863316,0,Symmetrical corticobasal syndrome caused by a novel C.314dup progranulin mutation.,"Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is characterised by asymmetrical parkinsonism and cognitive impairment. The underlying pathology varies between corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration sometimes in association with GRN mutations. A 61-year-old male underwent neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, MRI, and HMPAO-SPECT at our medical centre. After his death at the age of 63, brain autopsy, genetic screening and mRNA expression analysis were performed. The patient presented with slow progressive walking disabilities, non-fluent language problems, behavioural changes and forgetfulness. His family history was negative. He had primitive reflexes, rigidity of his arms and postural instability. Later in the disease course he developed dystonia of his left leg, pathological crying, mutism and dysphagia. Neuropsychological assessment revealed prominent ideomotor and ideational apraxia, executive dysfunction, non-fluent aphasia and memory deficits. Neuroimaging showed symmetrical predominant frontoparietal atrophy and hypoperfusion. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-TDP type 3 pathology was found at autopsy. GRN sequencing revealed a novel frameshift mutation c.314dup, p.Cys105fs and GRN mRNA levels showed a 50% decrease. We found a novel GRN mutation in a patient with an atypical (CBS) presentation with symmetric neuroimaging findings. GRN mutations are an important cause of CBS associated with FTLD-TDP type 3 pathology, sometimes in sporadic cases. Screening for GRN mutations should also be considered in CBS patients without a positive family history."
CD010896,0,22941841,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of mixed dementia].,"Vascular dementia (VaD)--secondary to cerebrovascular disease (CVD)--has been traditionally distinguished from Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a purely neurodegenerative form of dementia. However, CVDs such as lacunes and white matter lesions are common in patients with AD, whereas certain pathological changes of AD, including senile plaques and tangles, are observed in elderly patients with VaD. These findings indicate that mixed vascular-degenerative dementia (MD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. In the treatment and prevention of dementia, the accurate diagnosis of each individual type of dementia is vital. However, recognizing the distinction between these diseases can be difficult in clinical practice. This article provides an overview of MD, including the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment. In particular, we emphasize that functional brain imaging, including perfusion single photon emission computed tomography and benzodiazepine receptor binding measurement, in combination with morphological imaging (such as magnetic resonance imaging) is useful for distinguishing AD, VaD and MD. In addition to antiplatelet medications, cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonists may be effective in treating MD. Moreover the vascular risk factors also should be treated appropriately. The article describes the need for further studies to develop a better understanding of MD."

CD010896,0,22366793,1,Characterization of frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated with the GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72.,"Numerous kindreds with familial frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been linked to chromosome 9, and an expansion of the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the non-coding region of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 has recently been identified as the pathogenic mechanism. We describe the key characteristics in the probands and their affected relatives who have been evaluated at Mayo Clinic Rochester or Mayo Clinic Florida in whom the hexanucleotide repeat expansion were found. Forty-three probands and 10 of their affected relatives with DNA available (total 53 subjects) were shown to carry the hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Thirty-six (84%) of the 43 probands had a familial disorder, whereas seven (16%) appeared to be sporadic. Among examined subjects from the 43 families (n = 63), the age of onset ranged from 33 to 72 years (median 52 years) and survival ranged from 1 to 17 years, with the age of onset <40 years in six (10%) and >60 in 19 (30%). Clinical diagnoses among examined subjects included behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia with or without parkinsonism (n = 30), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 18), frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with or without parkinsonism (n = 12), and other various syndromes (n = 3). Parkinsonism was present in 35% of examined subjects, all of whom had behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia or frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as the dominant clinical phenotype. No subject with a diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia was identified with this mutation. Incomplete penetrance was suggested in two kindreds, and the youngest generation had significantly earlier age of onset (>10 years) compared with the next oldest generation in 11 kindreds. Neuropsychological testing showed a profile of slowed processing speed, complex attention/executive dysfunction, and impairment in rapid word retrieval. Neuroimaging studies showed bilateral frontal abnormalities most consistently, with more variable degrees of parietal with or without temporal changes; no case had strikingly focal or asymmetric findings. Neuropathological examination of 14 patients revealed a range of transactive response DNA binding protein molecular weight 43 pathology (10 type A and four type B), as well as ubiquitin-positive cerebellar granular neuron inclusions in all but one case. Motor neuron degeneration was detected in nine patients, including five patients without ante-mortem signs of motor neuron disease. While variability exists, most cases with this mutation have a characteristic spectrum of demographic, clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging and especially neuropathological findings."
CD010896,0,22703622,0,Neuroimaging of delusions in Alzheimer's disease.,"MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO were searched using the keywords ""imaging"", ""neuroimaging"", ""CT"", ""MRI"", ""PET"", ""SPECT"", ""Alzheimer's"", ""dementia"", ""delusions"" and ""psychosis"" to find studies specifically assessing or reporting on neuroimaging of delusions in Alzheimer's Dementia (AD), separate from hallucinations or psychosis in general in AD. Twenty-five studies were found meeting criteria and are included in this review which reports on structural, regional perfusion, metabolic and receptor binding imaging modalities assessing delusions as a whole, as well as persecutory and misidentification delusional subtypes. The majority of studies implicate right-sided pathology, primarily frontal lobe. Left-frontal predominance and release, secondary to right-sided pathology, may create a hyperinferential state resulting in the formation of delusions. This perturbation and imbalance of normal networks is associated with delusional phenomenology. Temporal lobe structures are also important in misidentification syndromes, which have a different natural history than paranoid delusions. Consistent with the neuropathological and genetic literature, neuroimaging has shown that paranoid versus misidentification delusions are associated with different phenomenology and different neural substrates. Delusional subtype is an important factor in understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of delusions in dementia. We also discuss methodological issues related to neuroimaging of delusions in AD."

His mother and older sister had similar disorders. On initial examination, he was awake, apathetic, and disoriented but had no focal neurological deficits. Electroencephalography showed diffuse background slowing with neither periodic discharge nor sleeping activity. A single-photon emission CT scan showed significantly reduced cerebral perfusion in bilateral thalami, basal ganglia, and limbic cortices. In the late stage of his illness, he developed sphincter dysfunction. Laboratory studies showed increased T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes and reduced cortisol level. Cerebrospinal fluid 14-3-3 protein was absent. Genetic evaluations failed to show the aspartate to asparagine point mutation at codon 178 but disclosed an asparagine to serine substitution at codon 171 in one allele and a deletion of 24 base pairs in the other allele in the human prion protein gene. These findings led to a diagnosis of sporadic fatal insomnia, which is a recently described prion disease."

The patient's chief complaints were that she could not drive a car safely and had caused numerous traffic accidents. Construction apraxia and unilateral spatial agnosia were detected by neuropsychological tests. The patient could not write a coherent the letter even though she was well educated. In addition, she demonstrated slight memory disturbance and she needed her sister's support in daily life. Magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography examinations confirmed bilateral posterior atrophy and significant hypoperfusion in the occipital regions. The neuropathological background of PCA remains unclear. Therefore, the concept of PCA should be validated by the accumulation of information from more cases."

Voxel SCA was simultaneously applied to a set of preprocessed images (AD, n=40; DLB, n=26), generating a series of eigenimages representing common intercorrelated voxels in AD and DLB. Linear regression derived a spatial covariance pattern (SCP) that discriminated DLB from AD. To investigate the diagnostic value of the model SCP, the SCP was validated by applying it to a second, independent, AD and DLB cohort (AD, n=34; DLB, n=29). Mean SCP expressions differed between AD and DLB (F(1,64)=36.2, P<0.001) with good diagnostic accuracy (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area 0.87, sensitivity 81%, specificity 88%). Forward application of the model SCP to the independent cohort revealed similar differences between groups (F(1,61)=38.4, P<0.001), also with good diagnostic accuracy (ROC 0.86, sensitivity 80%, specificity 80%). Multivariate analysis of blood flow SPECT data appears to be robust and shows good diagnostic accuracy in two independent cohorts for distinguishing DLB from AD."

The CAD tool is designed for the study and classification of functional brain images. For this purpose, two different brain image databases are selected: a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) database and positron emission tomography (PET) images, both of them containing data for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls as a reference. These databases are analyzed by applying the Fisher discriminant ratio (FDR) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for feature selection and extraction of the most relevant features. The resulting NMF-transformed sets of data, which contain a reduced number of features, are classified by means of a SVM-based classifier with bounds of confidence for decision. The proposed NMF-SVM method yields up to 91% classification accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity rates (upper than 90%). This NMF-SVM CAD tool becomes an accurate method for SPECT and PET AD image classification."

We hypothesized that the hemodynamic parameters monitoring cerebrovascular integrity, i.e., cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterial blood volume (aBV), and arterial transit time (aTT), would be affected. 13 AD patients and 15 healthy control (HC) subjects underwent 3T MRI scanning. Two separate blood flow acquisitions were obtained with 1 slice overlap for whole brain coverage. CBF, aBV, and aTT maps were calculated using in-house software. Preprocessing and statistical analyses were performed on SPM5. Region-of-interest (ROI) studies of ten selected cerebral regions were also conducted. There were significant differences in mini mental status exam (MMSE) (AD: 16.3 Â± 4.55, HC: 28.5 Â± 2.00) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores (AD: 25.25 Â± 9.64, HC: 5.51 Â± 2.62) between the 2 groups (p < 0.001) but none in age (p = 0.068). CBF decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in AD compared to controls in the right middle cingulate, left cuneus, left inferior and middle frontal, right superior frontal, left inferior parietal, and right supramarginal gyri. ROI studies confirmed significant hemodynamic impairments in AD compared to HC (p < 0.05): CBF in middle and posterior cingulate, aBV in left superior temporal, right inferior parietal, and posterior cingulate, and aTT in left inferior frontal and middle cingulate gyri. CBF correlated positively while aTT correlated negatively to MMSE, and vice versa for ADAS-cog. Using QUASAR ASL, we found patterns of regional hemodynamic impairment typical of moderate AD, suggesting underlying vascular abnormality. As potential biomarkers, these hemodynamic parameters could differentiate patients from volunteers, and possibly indicate the conversion from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment to AD."

Postmortem brains of AD patients reveal neuropathologic features, in particular the presence of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which contain Î²-amyloid peptides and highly phosphorylated tau proteins. Currently, AD can only be definitively confirmed by postmortem histopathologic examination of SPs and NFTs in the brain. Therefore, SPs and NFTs in the brain may be useful as biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of AD; the detection of individual SPs and NFTs in vivo by positron-emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) should improve diagnosis and also accelerate discovery of effective therapeutic agents for AD. Many PET/SPECT imaging probes for SPs have already been developed. Several of the PET probes have been shown in clinical trials to be useful for the imaging of Î²-amyloid plaques in living brain tissue. More recently, the development of PET/SPECT probes for in vivo imaging of NFTs is an active area of study in the field of molecular imaging because the appearance of NFT pathology correlates well with clinical severity of dementia. We will review current research on the development of PET/SPECT imaging probes for in vivo detection of SPs and NFTs and their application to diagnosis and therapy of AD."

Eighty (64%) of the patients with EOAD had a nonamnestic presentation, compared with only 7 (12.5%) of the patients with LOAD. Compared with LOAD, the patients with EOAD had a shorter duration with lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The neuroimaging reports among the patients with EOAD showed more hippocampal atrophy with an amnestic presentation, more left parietal changes with impaired language presentations, and more right parietal and occipital changes with impaired visuospatial presentations.

The objectives of this study were to analyze progression of 15-OT performance in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and its correlates with cognition and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), as well as to examine neuropsychological and SPECT differences between the MCI patients who developed AD and those who did not. From the initial 126 participants (42/group), 38 AD, 39 MCI, and 38 elderly controls (EC) were reassessed (SPECT: 35 AD, 33 MCI, 35 EC) after two years. The progression of cognitive and SPECT scores during this period was compared between groups, and baseline data between converters and non-converters. The 15-OT was the only measure of progression that differed between the three groups; worsening scores on 15-OT were associated with worsening in verbal and visual retention, and decreased perfusion on left postsubicular area. In the MCI patients, cerebral perfusion fell over the two years in medial-posterior cingulate and fronto-temporo-parietal regions; AD showed extensive changes involving almost all cerebral regions. No SPECT changes were detected in controls. At baseline, the MCI patients who developed AD differed from non-converters in verbal recognition memory, but not in SPECT perfusion. In conclusion, SPECT and 15-OT appear to provide a potential measure to differentiate between normal aging, MCI, and AD. Worsening on 15-OT was related to decreased perfusion in postsubicular area; but further longitudinal studies are needed to determine the contribution of 15-OT as a predictor of AD from MCI."

CD010896,0,22868886,0,[An autopsied case of corticobasal degeneration with onset of nonfluent aphasia revealing symmetrical cerebral involvement].,"Herein we describe a patient with established corticobasal degeneration with onset of nonfluent aphasia and showing symmetrical cerebral involvement. A 64-year-old man with a speech disorder for 2 years visited our hospital. He had nonfluent aphasia (reduced spontaneous speech, loss of intonation, anomia, repetition disorder, and difficulty in speaking short sentences). He also showed right-sided motor neglect, hypertonus of the left lower limb, a mask-like facial expression, and difficulty in closing his eyes. He was restless and walked around even during examination, suggesting frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed symmetrical reduction of cerebral blood flow in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal lobes. His neurological condition deteriorated gradually and a year later he could not speak comprehensive sentences. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head at age 70 showed symmetrical atrophy of the bilateral fronto-temporal lobes. He died of respiratory failure after clinical problems lasting ten years. On pathological examination, the fixed brain weighed 1,010 g and showed bilateral symmetrical atrophy of the frontal lobes. Histopathological examination revealed neuronal loss and gliosis in the frontal lobes, especially in the frontal convexity, superior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus. Gallyas-Braak silver staining showed astrocytic plaques, argyrophilic threads and coiled bodies mainly in the frontal lobes. The substantia nigra showed severe neuronal loss on both sides and presence of free melanin. Pathological diagnosis was corticobasal degeneration (CBD). We believe that the patient had nonfluent aphasia and FTD reflected in bilateral degeneration of the frontal lobes. Some cases of CBD may present with symmetrical degeneration of the brain, even though left-hemisphere symptoms such as aphasia reveal themselves at an early stage."

CD010896,0,22915704,0,[Operative neurosurgery: Personal view and historical backgrounds. (10) Microneurosurgery and PET scan: clinical experience of a neurosurgeon].,"During the author's clinical activity at three institutes : Kyoto University Hospital (Kyoto 1965-1969, 1977-1985), National Cardiovascular Center NCVC (Osaka 1986-1992) and Zurich University Hospital (Zurich 1970-1976, 1993-2007), He has experienced (underlined periods) working with PET scan and SPECT in relation to microsurgical treatment. The following describes how and for what the author has been engaged in this regard. 1. As preparation for the work with PET, SPECT with a rotating gamma camera was used to know blood distribution with the use of Kr-81m infusion from a selectively located catheter in the ICA, ECA or VA, e.g. to know the flow distribution of a newly constructed EC-IC bypass, which was quite separated from and not mixed up with that of already functioning inherent collaterals (Fig. 1). 2. With the use of inhalation PET scan (15O labelled CO2 and O2 inhalation and 15O CO inhalation) basic knowledge of hemodynamics of MMD was acquired (Fig. 2) 3. With the use of H215 O-PET scan with DiamoxR loading, indication for and effectiveness of EC-IC bypass surgery for occlusive cerebrovascular disease (atherosclerosis (anterior circulation (Fig. 5), posterior circulation (Fig. 6, 7)), MMD (Fig. 9), congenital disease (Fig. 8) have been settled or demonstrated. 4. In epileptic seizures, interictally or intraictally, the active locus has been identified by the use of FDG-PET, flumazenil-PET, H 2 15 O or 13 NH 3-PET respectively (Fig. 12). In this relation, selective Wada test with the use of Tc-99 m-ECD selective infusion together with Amytal R through a catheter inserted selectively into the anterior choroidal artery is an important preoperative test for the SAHE (Fig. 13). 5. FDG-PET and/or tyrosine PET supply important clues concerning appropriate surgical treatment strategy, and also for intractable glioblastoma or high grade glioma, so that in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy one may expect more excellent long term outcome with good quality of life (Fig. 16, 17). Furthermore, there must be cases with dementia in which some revascularization procedure might be of help, for which FDG-and H 2 15O-PET could be helpful for differential diagnosis and indication of surgery (Fig. 18)."

Afterwards, each developed a corticobasal syndrome (CBS) with alien limb phenomenon and a multi-domain cognitive impairment. Regional cerebral perfusion (rCBF) study using 99mTc-ECD single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed hypoperfusion patterns consistent with these aphasia types and with the presence of limb apraxia. We report two cases of PPA variants associated with CBS and we suggest that SPECT rCBF correlates can be useful in making a differential diagnosis within the PPA spectrum."
CD010896,0,22354229,0,[FTDP-17 presenting amnestic MCI as an initial symptom: case report].,"A 46-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for examination of her amnesia. Psychiatric examinations revealed that her recent memory was moderately disturbed despite well-preserved general cognitive function. Brain MRI and I-IMP SPECT (eZIS) revealed mild brain atrophy and hypoperfusion localized to the hippocampus, superior parietal lobule, and posterior cingulate gyrus. She was diagnosed with amnestic MCI at that time. However, five years later, she developed personality changes, parkinsonism and dementia. Investigation of her family medical history revealed that the patient's two sisters are demented and under the medical care. DNA analysis revealed an intronic mutation IVS10 C>T in the MAPT gene. Although her two sisters also have the same mutation, her elder sister has typical FTD without parkinsonism. Approximately 10% of patients with amnestic MCI develop Alzheimer's disease each year. Thus, amnestic MCI has been usually considered to be an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly our patient having a MAPT gene mutation started to develop amnestic MCI as an initial symptom. Therefore because of the diversity in early clinical features of FTDP-17, aggressive DNA analysis is necessary for accurate diagnosis."

CD010896,0,23300102,0,[Neuroimaging in corticobasal syndrome].,"Recently, several attempts have been made to characterize the clinical symptoms and brain atrophy patterns in pathology-proven corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) with known histopathology. CBS is a term which was proposed to characterize the constellation of clinical features initially considered the defining characteristics of CBD. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses of MRI revealed that frontal lobe involvement is characteristic of CBD. The pathologic substrates for clinical CBS were found to be CBD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP) inclusions. CBS was associated with perirolandic atrophy, irrespective of underlying pathology. In CBS due to FTLD, atrophy extended into the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and brainstem, whereas in CBS due to AD, atrophy extended into the temporoparietal cortex and precuneus. No functional imaging studies in pathology-proven CBD or CBS with known histopathology have yet been published. PET and SPECT studies have demonstrated decreased glucose metabolism and cerebral blood flow in the fronto-parietal cortex, particularly contralateral to the dominant symptoms in CBS patients. A PET study showed decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the fronto-parietal cortex, as well as a correlation between cortical AChE activity and mini-mental state examination score in CBS patients, suggesting that cholinergic stimulant therapy may be effective for dementia in CBS. Additionally, [18F] 6-fluorodopa PET and dopamine transporter SPECT studies have demonstrated nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction in CBS. Antemortem prediction of CBD will remain challenging until sensitive, specific biomarkers are identified."
CD010896,0,21762928,0,Radionuclide brain imaging correlates of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD).,"A subtle cognitive impairment can be detected early in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). Executive, memory and visuospatial functions are specifically affected, but the underlying pathophysiological basis is not well elucidated yet and may be heterogeneous. The recent identification of a PD-related cognitive metabolic pattern (PDCP), including hypometabolism in associative frontal, parietal and posterior limbic structures, has integrated the classical notion of a striato-frontal syndrome at the basis of cognitive dys-function. Recent evidence suggests that whilst executive dys-function is seen in virtually all PD patients, visuospatial and memory impairment may share a higher risk for the subsequent development of dementia. By means of perfusion SPECT and [18F]FDG-PET, cortical dys-function may be highlighted since the early stages, it is more evident in PD patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and reaches the maximum in PD dementia (PDD). Posterior temporo-parieto-occipital dys-function in associative and limbic cortex, closely resembling that found in Alzheimer's disease patients, is found in PDD, with a more severe occipital hypometabolism and a relatively milder hypometabolism in medial temporal lobe structures. Furthermore, deficit of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) can be found by means of [11C]MP4A-PET already in early stage of PD, especially in posterior regions, then becoming more severe in PDD and in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Administration of AchE inhibitors to PDD patients increased brain metabolism in bilateral frontal and left parietal regions, and left posterior cingulate. Finally, the recent availability of radiopharmaceuticals able to disclose amyloid brain deposition has allowed to demonstrate amyloid load in a part of patients with PDD, possibly due to diffuse rather than neuritic plaques. Brain PET and SPECT have strongly contributed to the understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in PD and may serve as probes to monitor the effects of therapeutic interventions."

The presence of visual cortical symptoms, neuroimaging findings and clinical evolution led to the diagnosis 1-5 years after the onset of visual symptoms. Age of onset ranged from 50-66 years. In 3 cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated predominantly right posterior cortical atrophy. The other 2 patients had nonspecific MRI findings but the diagnosis was established given the findings on clinical examination and positron emission tomography (PET). All progressed to global dementia and an autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in one patient. The possibility of PCA should be considered when a patient presents with complex visual symptoms in the absence of ocular pathology. Early neurological assessment may avoid diagnostic delay."

CD010896,0,22596272,0,The brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism is associated with reduced hippocampus perfusion in frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes several functions in neurons and modulates neurotransmissions, especially in hippocampal regions. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) has a strong genetic background, but genetic risk factors associated with sporadic disease are unknown. Hippocampal involvement is frequently observed in FTLD. The aims of this study were: i) to evaluate if BDNF genetic variations are associated with an increased risk of developing FTLD; and ii) to assess the neuroimaging profiles associated with BDNF polymorphisms. Ninety-one FTLD patients who underwent SPECT imaging and blood sampling entered the study, and clinical, cognitive, and behavioral examinations were performed. A larger group of FTLD patients (n = 194) and controls (n = 396; 162 healthy subjects and 234 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients) underwent genetic analyses, considering BDNF polymorphisms (Val66Met, rs2049045 C/G, G11757C). A significant different distribution of G11757C genotype in FTLD (GG 53.1%, GC 42.8%, CC 4.1%) compared to controls (G/G 55.6%, G/C 34.6%, C/C 9.8%, p = 0.020) was found. No other significant differences in genotype and allele distributions were detected. The effect of BDNF polymorphisms on brain perfusion was analyzed. BDNF Val66Met A* carriers (A/A or G/A) showed a significant greater hypoperfusion parahippocampal regions as compared to G/G carriers (p < 0.005). No effect of G11757C polymorphism on brain perfusion was found. rs2049045 C/G was not considered as in linkage disequilibrium with Val66Met polymorphism. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may play a role as a modulator of the FTLD expression and may drive a selective damage in specific brain region affected by the disease."

In 121 AD patients, cerebral perfusion, using single-photon emission computed tomography, in 13 bilateral regions of interest (ROI) and the perfusion correlates of IADL subcomponents, rated on the Disability Assessment in Dementia scale, were explored. Significant correlations were observed between IADL initiation and multiple bilateral prefrontal-striatal-anterior cingulate ROI (p < 0.01), IADL planning and right occipital ROI (p < 0.05), and IADL performance and right parietal ROI (p < 0.05). Multiple regression, accounting for age, cognitive impairment, and depression severity, revealed significant relationship between right basal ganglia perfusion and IADL-initiation (R = 0.6, R(2) = 0.39, F(4,117) = 17.8, SE = 1.56; p < 0.001) and right occipital perfusion and IADL-planning (R = 0.6, R(2) = 0.34, F(4,117) = 19.5, SE = 1.47; p < 0.001).

CD010896,0,22166447,0,Parkinson's disease: diagnosis.,"In established PD the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria applied by experts show 90% sensitivity and specificity for the presence of midbrain Lewy bodies. However, in early disease clinical diagnosis is less straightforward. PD diagnosis made in the community by non-experts is associated with a 25% error rate. Nigral abnormalities can now be detected in vivo with 7 tesla MRI and diffusion tensor MRI. Magnetisation transfer can demonstrate melanin loss in the substantia nigra. Transcranial sonography (TCS) detects midbrain hyperechogenicity in both sporadic and genetic PD. PET and SPECT ligands can demonstrate the presence of dopamine terminal dysfunction in early and preclinical disease and an abnormal covariance pattern between levels of resting brain blood flow metabolism in cortical and subcortical regions. In the atypical parkinsonian syndrome multiple system atrophy (MSA) T2-weighted MRI can reveal characteristic changes including reduced putmen signal due to iron deposition and the pontine 'hot cross bun' sign as transverse fibres become visible. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is associated with midbrain atrophy and 3(rd) ventricular widening. In both these conditions diffusion weighted MRI shows increased striatal water diffusivity but the middle cerebellar peduncle is targeted in MSA and the superior peduncle in PSP. In this review the role of structural and functional imaging for supporting the differential diagnosis of the various degenerative parkinsonian syndromes will be discussed."
CD010896,0,22495081,0,Brain perfusion SPECT imaging and acetazolamide challenge in vascular cognitive impairment.,"Cerebrovascular disease is recognized as a common cause of cognitive impairment and dementia, alone or coexisting with other neurodegenerative diseases, mostly Alzheimer's disease. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a part of the heterogenous disorders group related to cerebral vessel disease. Although age is one of the most important risk factors for VCI, other common cardiovascular risk factors are also involved. By investigating these risk factors, a high proportion of these cognitive disorders can be prevented and/or delayed. Until now, only treatment of midlife arterial hypertension has been recognized as a preventing factor of vascular dementia. Brain MRI is becoming the method of choice to investigate cerebral vascular pathologies. However, this form of morphological imaging remains inadequate and does not provide useful functional information during VCI exploration, despite which functional imaging such as brain perfusion single-photon computed tomography, performed in baseline conditions and/or after an acetazolamide challenge, is underutilized in VCI exploration. The common strategies for VCI screening have not been standardized until now, and therefore further long-term imaging studies are needed to establish early diagnostic protocols. The present review summarizes the potential benefits of brain perfusion single-photon computed tomography imaging and possible scintigraphic quantification of cerebral hemodynamic reserves in investigation of VCI."

Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide accurate demonstration of the location and rate of progression of atrophic changes affecting the brain in AD and the different types of vascular lesions observed in mixed dementias and in pure VaD. Quantification of cortical thickness allows early diagnosis and rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. White matter involvement can also be quantified with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional methods including fMRI, functional connectivity, and MR spectroscopy (MRS). Isotope-based techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) allow measurement of regional cerebral glucose metabolism using (18)F-2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). Cerebral blood flow can be measured using PET with H(2)(15)O or withÂ single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) with technetium ((99m)Tc-HMPAO) or, more recently, arterial spin label (ASL) imaging. There are isotope markers for amyloid-beta ((11)O-PIB, (18)F-florbetapir), tau ((18)FDDNP) and activated microglia ((11)C-PK11195).

CD010896,0,22460325,1,Contribution of single photon emission computed tomography to the differential diagnosis of dementia in a memory clinic.,"To evaluate the contribution of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to the differential diagnosis of dementia, we studied 48 consecutive patients (median age: 63) with a degenerative or vascular dementia, a 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT imaging, and a diagnostic confirmation (autopsy or genetic mutation). The SPECT scans were visually rated by two nuclear medicine physicians (first blinded to the clinical data, then with the data). Comparisons between clinical diagnoses and/or SPECT imaging and neuropathology were performed. At the time of SPECT was performed, the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) sensitivity was 83%, specificity was 76%, and diagnostic accuracy was 79%. The blinded SPECT sensitivity was 57%, specificity 92%, and diagnostic accuracy 75%. The SPECT associated with clinical data sensitivity was 65%, specificity 84%, and accuracy 75%. The clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal-lobar degeneration (FTLD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDs) sensitivity was 83%, specificity 87%, and accuracy 85%. The blinded SPECT sensitivity was 50%, specificity 97%, and accuracy 79%. The SPECT associated with clinical data sensitivity was 61%, specificity was 93%, and accuracy 81%. Whenever the blinded SPECT interpretation agreed with the clinical diagnosis of AD and FTLD/PSP/CBDs, the condition was confirmed by neuropathological assessment in all cases. Compared with clinical diagnosis alone, SPECT imaging improved the specificity of the etiological diagnosis in degenerative dementia, although its sensitivity was not as good as that of clinical diagnosis. For AD and FTLD/PSP/CBDs, agreement between the clinical and SPECT-based diagnoses was always confirmed by neuropathological assessment."

The endpoint was clinical diagnosis at follow-up of 24 months based upon existing criteria. Medial temporal lobe atrophy score on MRI, distinctive patterns on 99 mTc-HMPAO-SPECT, and CSF levels of amyloid-Î² peptide, total tau protein, and P-tau181P were used together with neuropsychological testing to assess Se (sensitivity) and Sp (specificity) of separate and combined markers. 60 patients reached the endpoint. A definite diagnosis was achieved in 48 patients. CSF biomarkers had a Sp of 71% and a Se of 100% for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Sp increased to 88% and 93% when MRI and MRI + SPECT were combined, at the expense of Se. CSF biomarkers levels also provided clues to frontotemporal (FTD) or vascular dementias (VaD) diagnosis when situated in an intermediate range between normal and pathological values. MRI and SPECT contributed mostly to the diagnosis of VaD (Se 88%, Sp 75%) and FTD (Se 73%, Sp 78%), respectively. Initial neuropsychological testing had a poor diagnostic accuracy, except for a neuropsychiatric inventory score >40 for the diagnosis of FTD (Se 73%, Sp 84%). Independent of the clinical diagnosis, medial temporal lobe atrophy and total-tau were best correlated with cognitive decline at 2 years. In conclusion, CSF biomarkers efficiently predict evolution toward an AD phenotype in CAD. Imaging biomarkers mostly contribute to the differential diagnosis between non-AD dementias. Initial neuropsychological testing was poorly contributive in CAD diagnosis."

CD010896,0,21418722,0,Late-onset-psychosis: cognition.,The objectives of the study were to characterize and compare the cognitive profile and natural evolution of patients presenting late-onset psychotic symptoms (LOPS: onset â¥ 50 years old) to those of elderly patients (â¥ 50 years old) with life-long/early-onset schizophrenia (EOS: onset <40 years old).
CD010896,0,22939818,0,Cognitive disconnective syndrome by single strategic strokes in vascular dementia.,"Strategic regions correspond to associative, limbic and paralimbic structures and related circuits, that underpin cognitive/behavioral functions. Strokes in these eloquent sites produce pictures of vascular dementia with syndromic features due to specific site lesion and/or interruption of their interconnections. This study aims at analysing subcortical strategic strokes that express similar cognitive/behavioral elements, by sharing common pathways. Patients (n=6) who attended in specialized ambulatory, were submitted to neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessments through MRI (GE Signa Horizon 1.5T) and brain SPECT (Millennium MG, ECD [TC-99m]). Stroke locations and respective main symptoms were: 1. anteromedian thalamus [L]: anterograde and retrograde amnesia (ARA), expression aphasia (EA), executive dysfunction (ED), apathy, and depression; 2. anterior thalamus [R]: ARA, inattention, apathy, and aggressiveness; 3. dorsomedian thalamus [L]: inattention, ED, anosognosia, and aggressiveness; 4. central paramedian thalamus [R]: EA, visual perception deficits (VPD), ED, infantility, and personality disorder; 5. caudate nucleus (ventral-head) [L]: VPD, ED, delirium, visual hallucinations, and personality disorder; and 6. anterior capsule [L]: VPD, ED, apathy, and depression. Vascular strategic syndromes connote the predominantly impaired cognitive/behavioral symptom of each site. Temporal and frontal disconnection symptoms were produced by disrupted MTT/hippocampal and IML/amygdala circuits expressing amnesic syndrome associated with heterogeneous dysexecutive syndrome, in all the cases, by disrupting frontal-basal ganglia-thalamus-cortical net, in three different levels of their pathway."
CD010896,0,22961551,0,Neuropathological correlates of dopaminergic imaging in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementias.,"Investigation of dopaminergic transporter loss in vivo using (123)I-N-fluoropropyl-2Î²-carbomethoxy-3Î²-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane single photon emission computed tomography has been widely used as a diagnostic aid in Lewy body disease. However, it is not clear whether the pathological basis for the imaging changes observed reflects loss of dopaminergic transporter expressing neurons because of cell death or dysfunctional neurons due to possible nigral and/or striatal neurodegenerative pathology. We aimed to investigate the influence of nigral neuronal loss as well as nigral (Î±-synuclein, tau) and striatal (Î±-synuclein, tau, amyloid Î²) pathology on striatal uptake in a cohort of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease (n = 4), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 7) and Parkinson's disease dementia (n = 12) cases. Subjects underwent ante-mortem dopaminergic scanning and post-mortem assessments (mean interval 3.7 years). Striatal binding (caudate, anterior and posterior putamen) was estimated using region of interest procedures while quantitative neuropathological measurements of Î±-synuclein, tau and amyloid Î² were carried out. Similarly, nigral neuronal density was assessed quantitatively. Stepwise linear regression was performed to identify significant pathological predictors of striatal binding. In all striatal regions, image uptake was associated with nigral dopaminergic neuronal density (P â¤ 0.04) but not Î±-synuclein (P â¥ 0.46), tau (P â¥ 0.18) or amyloid Î² (P â¥ 0.22) burden. The results suggest that reduced uptake in vivo may be influenced considerably by neuronal loss rather than the presence of pathological lesions, in particular those related to Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementias. However, dysfunctional nigral neurons may have an additional effect on striatal uptake in vivo but their respective role remains to be elucidated."

CD010896,0,21721045,0,Biomarkers in dementia with Lewy bodies: a review.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) shares common clinical, neuropsychological and pathological features with other dementia subtypes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), making it difficult to differentiate in clinical practice. Despite the development of consensus diagnostic criteria, many cases are missed, and biomarkers to assist with diagnosis would represent important advances. Our aim was to review the literature to identify potential biomarkers that may distinguish DLB from other dementia subtypes, especially AD."
CD010896,0,23016870,1,Episodic memory impairment in frontotemporal dementia; a â¹â¹mTc- HMPAO SPECT study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the most common types of dementia in the presenile population. Episodic memory impairment, the clinical hallmark of AD, can also be encountered in patients with FTD, complicating accurate diagnosis. Several studies in FTD have correlated memory deficits with neuroimaging findings, but lacked to compare neuroimaging results in FTD patients with and without memory impairment, while this latter analysis may give us insight into the underlying mechanisms of memory impairment in FTD. The aim of the present study was to compare (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT hypoperfusion patterns between FTD with episodic memory impairment (n = 13), FTD patients without episodic memory impairment (n = 10) as well as early onset (< 70 yrs) AD patients (n = 13), and controls (n = 15). We performed our analyses by means of Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM5), and showed that FTD patients with episodic memory impairment had lower perfusion in the right temporal lobe compared with FTD patients without memory impairment. Lower perfusion in this region correlated with worse memory performance on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale in FTD patients. With equal performances on memory tests, patients with early onset AD showed posterior temporal and parietal lobe hypoperfusion in comparison with patients with FTD and memory impairment, while vice versa hypoperfusion in the anterior frontotemporal regions was found in FTD patients with memory impairment in comparison with AD."

CD010896,0,22980226,0,Regional cerebral blood flow differences in patients with mild cognitive impairment between those who did and did not develop Alzheimer's disease.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. This study aimed to identify areas of initial hypoperfusion in MCI conversion to AD using technetium (Tc-99m) hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (TC-99m HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to compare baseline cerebral hypoperfusion in converted MCI and non-converted MCI patients and normal controls. Forty-nine MCI patients were recruited for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), detailed neuropsychological testing, Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT, and 1- to 2-year periodic follow-up to monitor progression to dementia status. We processed SPECT images with Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) software and performed voxel-based statistical parametric mapping analysis. Thirty-nine of 49 MCI patients were included in our analysis. Nine patients were diagnosed with conversion to AD, on average 19.0Â±6.6 months after initial assessment. Compared with normal controls, converted MCI patients demonstrated perfusion deficits in both parahippocampal gyri and right precuneus, and non-converted MCI patients demonstrated hypoperfusion in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Compared with non-converted MCI patients, converted MCI patients demonstrated significant hypoperfusion in both cingulate gyri and right precuneus. Our study suggests that using brain SPECT to identify initial hypoperfusion in patients with MCI may be helpful for predicting MCI patients likely to develop AD."

CD010896,0,22460159,0,Identification of biomarkers in Lewy-body disorders.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) may account for up to 30% of all dementia cases. The symptoms of DLB can be difficult to disentangle from other dementia subtypes, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD and DLB pathologies often overlap within individuals. Like DLB, Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) also shares common features with DLB. Currently, whether an individual is diagnosed with PDD or DLB depends solely on the timing of symptom onset. Early, accurate diagnosis is needed for optimal management and treatment. It is hoped that the development of existing and new Lewy body disorders biomarkers will facilitate more accurate diagnosis. Reduced dopamine transporter levels in DLB as shown with [123I]FP-CIT-SPECT currently appears to be the most reliable and valid biomarker, although other (predominantly imaging-based) methods also appear to have the high sensitivity and specificity required for a good biomarker. This includes (in DLB compared to AD) reduced cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake, occipital hypometabolism on FDG-PET and preservation of medial temporal lobe structures on CT/MRI. Perfusion SPECT, cerebrospinal fluid protein levels (amyloid, tau and Î±-synuclein), electroencephalography, saccadic eye movement tracking and 11C-PiB amyloid imaging also hold promise as biomarkers in terms of differentiating DLB, AD, PDD and other neurodegenerative disorders, although findings are less consistent. Studies utilising a combination approach in which two or more potential biomarkers are compared seem to provide very good sensitivity and specificity. In general, longitudinal studies, pathological confirmation of diagnosis and the combined approach may hold the most promise for the identification of biomarkers."

CD010896,0,22849990,0,[Remission of lymphomatosis cerebri induced by corticosteroid and high-doses intravenous methotrexate].,"Lymphomatosis cerebri (LC) is a rare form of primary central nervous system lymphoma characterized by subacute progressive dementia and unsteady gait. MRI study of LC typically reveals diffuse leukoencephalopathy without contrast enhancement. The clinical presentation and MRI features of LC can resemble infectious, inflammatory, toxic or vascular leukoencephalopathy. Hence diagnosis of LC is easily mistaken for other, more common diseases. In this report, we present a case of a 55-year-old man presenting with subacute progressive dementia and ataxic gait. Brain MRI showed diffuse hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter of both hemispheres, left amygdala, brainstem and cerebellar peduncles on FLAIR image. No contrast-enhanced lesion was observed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed elevated levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and Î²2-microglobulin. Based on MRI findings and 123I-IMP SPECT, stereotactic biopsy targeting white matter of the left medial temporal lobe was performed (day 0). On the day after the brain biopsy, corticosteroid therapy was initiated and improved the patient's cognitive function and gait disturbance. Pathological diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma was obtained on day 9. High-dose intravenous methotrexate chemotherapy was started on day 14 and led to complete remission by day 52. This case highlighted the importance of brain biopsy for diagnosis of LC. This report raises a possibility that timely and proper treatment leads to a favorable outcome of LC that has been regarded as an intractable disease with poor prognosis."

CD010896,0,22929226,0,The diagnosis and evaluation of dementia and mild cognitive impairment with emphasis on SPECT perfusion neuroimaging.,"As the world population ages, the incidence of dementing illnesses will dramatically increase. The number of people afflicted with dementia is expected to quadruple in the next 50 years. Since the neuropathology of the dementias precedes clinical symptoms often by several years, earlier detection and intervention could be key steps to mitigating the progression and burden of these diseases. This review will explore methods of evaluating, differentiating, and diagnosing the multiple forms of dementia. Particular emphasis will be placed on the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment-the precursor to dementia. Anatomical imaging; cerebrospinal fluid markers; functional neuroimaging, such as positron emission tomography and single photon emission tomography; and molecular imaging, such as amyloid marker imaging, will be assessed in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Cost will also be a consideration, as the growing population afflicted with dementia represents an increasingly large financial encumbrance to the healthcare systems of every nation. In the face of expensive new markers and limited availability of cyclotrons, single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) provides relatively high sensitivity and specificity at a comparatively low overall cost."

CD010896,0,21810889,0,The role of dopaminergic imaging in patients with symptoms of dopaminergic system neurodegeneration.,"Diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with disturbances of dopaminergic functioning can be challenging, especially in the early stages, and may be assisted with biomarkers such as dopamine system imaging. Distinguishing between Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies is a major diagnostic challenge. Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is straightforward with classic presentation, but accurate distinction among Parkinsonian variants may be difficult; non-Parkinson's disease conditions are commonly misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and ~20% of patients with Parkinson's disease are not clinically diagnosed despite coming to medical attention. Early and accurate diagnosis is desirable to improve management. Imaging of the dopamine transporter using single-photon emission computed tomography may be of particular utility in this regard. Abnormal imaging indicates underlying nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, supportive of a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism or dementia with Lewy bodies, and identifies patient groups in whom dopaminergic therapy may be beneficial. Normal imaging supports diagnosis of a condition not involving nigrostriatal neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease, essential tremor or drug-induced parkinsonism and hence a different therapeutic approach. In patients in whom there was diagnostic uncertainty between degenerative parkinsonism and non-degenerative tremor disorders, baseline imaging with the dopamine transporter ligand [(123)I]ioflupane (DaTscanâ¢) has shown 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity with reference to clinical diagnosis at 3 years, versus 93% and 46%, respectively, for baseline clinical diagnosis. In a Phase III trial of [(123)I]ioflupane in patients with initial clinical diagnosis of probable or possible dementia with Lewy bodies or non-Lewy body dementia, mean specificity for excluding non-Lewy body dementia (predominantly Alzheimer's disease) was 90.4%. Using clinical diagnosis as a reference against which to assess sensitivity and specificity of dopamine transporter imaging is a limitation, but definitive diagnosis via pathological confirmation is generally not feasible. In a series of patients with post-mortem brain examination, imaging using [(123)I]ioflupane has demonstrated higher sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%) for differentiating dementia with Lewy bodies from non-Lewy body dementia than clinical diagnosis (75% and 42%, respectively). Dopaminergic system imaging may be particularly valuable in patients with clinically inconclusive parkinsonism or a clinical diagnosis of possible dementia with Lewy bodies; it is not helpful in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism, although postsynaptic dopaminergic imaging may be of utility. Other potential uses of dopamine transporter imaging include identification of patients with premotor Parkinson's disease, monitoring disease progression in testing novel therapeutics, and as an inclusion criterion for entry into clinical trials."
