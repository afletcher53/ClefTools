CD012164,0,7976095,1,Vein surgery with or without skin grafting versus conservative treatment for leg ulcers. A randomized prospective study.,"In order for us to evaluate the efficiency of perforator vein surgery and skin grafting in leg ulcer patients, 47 patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups (group A: surgery for incompetent perforators, group B: surgery for incompetent perforators and ulcer excision followed by grafting, group C: control group). All the patients were treated with a compression bandage. When cellulitis was observed, a systemic antibiotic was given; eczema was treated with a steroid ointment. Fourty patients were evaluated regularly during one year after entry. There were no differences between the 3 treatment groups considering base-line characteristics, median ulcer size at entry and after one year. According to a review of the initial phlebograms, the occurrence of post-thrombotic changes in the deep veins were recorded in the majority of the legs. Our results suggest that ligation of incompetent perforators and skin grafting, as used in the present study, may not offer an additional advantage for venous ulcer patients with insufficiency of the deep veins when compared to conservative treatment. However, the removal of insufficient superficial veins was not studied."

CD012164,0,22160028,0,Endovascular procedures in the management of DVT.,"The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) develops in 25%-50% of patients with proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite the use of standard anticoagulant therapy and elastic compression stockings. PTS is a major cause of quality of life impairment in DVT patients and often leads to limiting venous claudication, work disability, and venous ulcers. Endovascular thrombolytic procedures that eliminate venous thrombus, restore venous flow, and show strong potential to prevent PTS are now under study in multicenter randomized clinical trials. In addition, endovascular procedures can be used to treat valvular reflux and venous obstruction and thereby provide symptom improvement to patients with chronic established PTS."
CD012164,0,18992425,0,The present status of surgery of the superficial venous system in the management of venous ulcer and the evidence for the role of perforator interruption.,"Superficial venous hypertension has been cited as the putative etiologic factor in advanced chronic venous insufficiency with venous ulcer (CEAP C 5/6). For over a century, influenced by this belief, surgeons have ablated the superficial venous system as a treatment for venous ulcer. Incompetent perforating veins (ICPVs) have become a particular focus of this therapeutic strategy. This review examines the evidence for the surgical approach. A MEDLINE search of the literature identified only four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directed at the surgical reduction of superficial venous hypertension. Risk ratios for ulcer healing and prevention of recurrence were calculated to determine benefits for these four RCTs, while mortality and morbidity, where available, was used to determine risk from the procedure. In addition, the quality of the trials (design and outcomes) was assessed. While two trials compared ICPV ligation to compression, the great saphenous vein (GSV) was also treated in many of these limbs, which confounds the results. By contrast, two RCTs, which compared treatment of the GSV alone to compression, demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of ulcer recurrence. Case series that employed hemodynamic or surrogate outcomes showed little effect on the addition of ICPV treatment to GSV stripping, while GSV ablation alone was associated with a reduction in the number of ICPVs in several studies. This review suggests a grade 1A recommendation for the treatment of venous ulcer by GSV ablation to reduce ulcer recurrence. The role of ICPV ablation alone or concomitant with GSV treatment awaits results of properly conducted RCTs."
CD012164,0,18802884,0,Comprehensive management for venous stasis ulcers.,"Traditional treatment of venous stasis ulceration has focused on compression therapy, debridement, and topical wound management. Prospective randomized studies have shown that only two additional treatment modalities are effective in healing venous ulceration: pentoxyphylline and bilayered living-cell therapy. Although initial healing rates of up to 75% can be accomplished, there is an unacceptably high recurrence rate that is thought to be due to patient noncompliance. However, recurrence of venous stasis ulceration is more likely secondary to uncorrected venous hypertension, a disease whose causes have been largely ignored in wound treatment. Few previous studies show improved healing rates of ulcers after surgical correction of venous hypertension with saphenous stripping. Venous pathology responsible for venous hypertension can now be easily corrected with new minimally invasive techniques. The purpose of this chapter is to define venous hypertension in patients with ulceration, and provide evidence that surgical treatment to eliminate venous hypertension combined with evidence-based treatment strategies will not only improve short-term outcomes but will also prevent recurrent ulceration."

For postoperative wound complications, endoscopic techniques are more common than open subfascial division of incompetent perforating veins (Linton procedure). We investigated the long-term results of ulcer healing and recurrence rates and compared them with preoperative and postoperative duplex findings."
CD012164,0,24371974,0,[Prevention of diabetic foot].,"Diabetic foot (DF) is the most common chronic complication, which depends mostly on the duration and successful treatment of diabetes mellitus. Based on epidemiological studies, it is estimated that 25% of persons with diabetes mellitus (PwDM) will develop the problems with DF during lifetime, while 5% do 15% will be treated for foot or leg amputation. The treatment is prolonged and expensive, while the results are uncertain. The changes in DF are influenced by different factors usually connected with the duration and regulation of diabetes mellitus. The first problems with DF are the result of misbalance between nutritional, defensive and reparatory mechanisms on the one hand and the intensity of damaging factors against DF on the other hand. Diabetes mellitus is a state of chronic hyperglycemia, consisting of changes in carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism. As a consequence of the long duration of diabetes mellitus, late complications can develop. Foot is in its structure very complex, combined with many large and small bones connected with ligaments, directed by many small and large muscles, interconnected with many small and large blood vessels and nerves. Every of these structures can be changed by nutritional, defensive and reparatory mechanisms with consequential DE Primary prevention of DF includes all measures involved in appropriate maintenance of nutrition, defense and reparatory mechanisms.First, it is necessary to identify the high-risk population for DF, in particular for macrovascular, microvascular and neural complications. The high-risk population of PwDM should be identified during regular examination and appropriate education should be performed. In this group, it is necessary to include more frequent and intensified empowerment for lifestyle changes, appropriate diet, regular exercise (including frequent breaks for short exercise during sedentary work), regular self control of body weight, quit smoking, and appropriate treatment of glycemia, lipid disorders (treatment with fenofibrate reduces the incidence of DF amputations (EBM-Ib/A), hypertension, hyperuricemia, neuropathy, and angiopathy (surgical reconstructive bypass) or endovascular (percutaneous transluminar angioplasty). In the low-risk group of PwDM, no particular results can be achieved, in contrast to the high-risk groups of PwDM where patient and professional education has shown significant achievement (EBM-IV/C). In secondary prevention of DF, it is necessary to perform patient and professional education how to avoid most of external influences for DE Patient education should include all topics from primary prevention, danger of neural analgesia (no cooling or warming the foot), careful selection of shoes, daily observation of foot, early detection all foot changes or small wounds, daily hygiene of foot skin, which has to be clean and moist, regular self measurements of skin temperature between the two feet (EBM-Ib/A), prevention of self treatment of foot deformities, changing wrong habits (walking footless), medical consultation for even small foot changes (EBM-Ib/A) and consultation by multidisciplinary team (EBM-IIb/B). Tertiary DF prevention includes ulcer treatment, prevention of amputation and level of amputation. In spite of the primary and secondary prevention measures, DF ulcers develop very often. Because of different etiologic reasons as well as different principles of treatment which are at the same time prevention of the level of amputation, the approach to PwDF has to be multidisciplinary. A high place in the treatment of DF ulcers, especially neuropathic ulcers, have the off-loading principles (EBM-Ib/A), even instead of surgical treatment (EBM-Ib/A). Necrectomy, taking samples for analysis from the deep of ulcer, together with x-ray diagnostics (in particular NMR), the size of the changes can be detected, together with appropriate antibiotic use and indication for major surgical treatment. The patient has to be instructed to the involved DF with off-loading (EBM-IIb/A). Negative pressure wound therapy can accelerate the closure of complex diabetic foot wounds (EBM- Ib/A). DF local treatment as well as ulcer covering for detritus absorption has not been EBM approved, although covering can diminish secondary infection. Skin or surrogate transplantations looks rationale but very expensive in comparison to off-loading. Randomized clinical trials do not prove usefulness of antibiotic treatment or surgical intervention in uninfected ulcer (EBM-IV/C), but the decision is left to the experienced physician. Evidence of osteomyelitis together with infected DF ulcer changes the prognosis of treatment, increasing the importance of antibiotic or surgical treatment (EBM-IIIB/B). Treatment with hyperbaric oxygen can help in wound healing, but without any influence on revascularization (EBM-Ib/A). At the end, the decision for the level of amputation has to be made. Charcot neuroarthropathy is still not clearly defined, so the randomized controlled trials are rare; thus, there are many new ways of treatment but the basics belongs to off-loading in simple changes through surgical treatment in more complex changes (EBM-IV/C)(rbn1). All available methods for detecting the level of vascularization, angioplasties, and oxymetry have to be used to decide on the minimal level of amputation."

Treatment modalities are conservative or surgical. Subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) combined with superficial vein ligation is performed in many centers to address vein incompetence in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers. Several reports describe good healing and low recurrence rates, although a randomized trial to compare surgical treatment including SEPS and treatment of the superficial venous system to conservative modalities has never been performed. Therefore, a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted to study whether ambulatory compression therapy with venous surgery is a better treatment than just ambulatory compression therapy in venous leg ulcer patients."
CD012164,0,11840425,0,Subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery: who benefits?,"The advent of minimally invasive endoscopic surgery has rekindled interest in perforator vein ligation. Subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery (SEPS) utilizes techniques to interrupt incompetent perforators under direct vision using an endoscopic videocamera and instrumentation placed through small ports remote from the active ulcer or area of diseased skin. The safety and early efficacy of SEPS has been established in several studies, and it yields lower wound complication rates than observed with open surgical techniques such as the Linton procedure. Available results confirm the superiority of SEPS over open perforator ligation, but do not address the its role in the surgical treatment of advanced chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and venous ulceration. Ablation of superficial reflux by high ligation and stripping of the greater saphenous vein with avulsion of branch varicosities is concomitantly performed in the majority of patients undergoing SEPS. The clinical and hemodynamic improvements attributable to SEPS thus are difficult to ascertain. As with open perforator ligation, clinical and hemodynamic results are better in patients with primary valvular incompetence (PVI) than in those with the postthrombotic (PT) syndrome. Until prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trials are carried out to answer lingering questions regarding the efficacy of SEPS, the procedure is recommended in patients with advanced CVI secondary to PVI of superficial and perforating veins, with or without deep venous incompetence. The performance of SEPS in patients with PT syndrome remains controversial."
CD012164,0,10173073,0,Cost-effective management of diabetic foot ulcers. A review.,"Foot lesions are common and serious complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. In recent years, several authors have, in addition to the medical aspects, focused on the high costs for treatment of this complication. However, few studies have performed a complete health-economic comparison and analysis of different treatments. This is probably related to the complexity of the problem and ethical difficulties in performing randomised clinical trials on these patients. Despite the lack of comparative health-economic studies, most authors conclude that amputations should be avoided if there is any possibility of saving the limb. This is not only because of the economic consequences-high costs for repeated hospitalisations, rehabilitation, home care and social-service support-associated with amputations, but also the quality-of-life aspects. Alternative treatment options might seem costly in the short term, but most cost-effectiveness analyses that also consider the long term perspective have concluded that treatment alternatives in which the limb is saved are more cost effective. Methodological aspects, such as the perspective of a study, may cause difficulties in comparing results between countries and settings. By using the societal perspective in economic studies, incentives to push costs from one sector to another might be avoided."

CD012164,0,24796914,0,Management of peripheral arterial disease and the diabetic foot.,"The management of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is complex and there is a lack of robust evidence to guide definitive treatment strategies. Due to the distinct differences in etiology, disease distribution and treatment outcomes patients with diabetes, PAD and foot ulceration should be considered separately from those without diabetes. There is no randomized trial data to compare angioplasty and surgical bypass for revascularization in patients with DFU and PAD and the decision of whether, and how, to revascularize should be taken by experienced surgeons, in a multidisciplinary setting. Revascularization is only part of a treatment regimen which includes aggressive management of infection, neuropathy, foot deformity and cardiovascular risk. The burden and challenge of DFU in the context of PAD is continuing to increase and new research studies should be targeted specifically towards this ever-expanding group of patients."

CD012164,0,23992895,0,Interventional radiology in the diabetic lower extremity.,"Most of what we know today for interventional techniques for revascularization in patients with DF disease is derived from our knowledge on CLI in patients with PAD. There are today no dedicated randomized controlled trials on interventional treatment of DF. It is, however, clear that huge progress in interventional techniques has been obtained during the past decade. In most institutions, the nonsurgical option is the current first choice. As the aim of treatment is ulcer healing through temporary increase in blood flow, it is still unclear what the contribution of new stent and drug-eluting technologies will have on the clinical outcome of DF treatment. Long-term follow-up studies, dedicated to patients with an arterial DF problem, have to be performed before we can evaluate all these new technologies."
CD012164,0,10192031,0,[Leg perforating veins].,"Our knowledge of the so-called incompetent leg perforating veins remains questionable. Anatomic and hemodynamic studies show that perforators in a healthy subject do not always convey inward flowing blood. Are incompetent perforating veins more frequent with increasing severity of chronic venous disease? Answering this question is difficult as no consensus has been established on how to assess incompetent leg perforating veins and we have no gold standard to refer to. The number of incompetent leg perforating veins is generally greater in severe chronic venous disease although their frequency in clinical stage 4 to 6 (CEAP classification) is not statistically different. This means that incompetent leg perforating veins are not markers of severity of chronic venous insufficiency. When analyzing published series which take into account etiology (primary or secondary venous diseases) the frequency of incompetent perforating veins is variable. Is surgical management required when incompetent leg perforating veins are present? Angiologists and surgeons have not come to an agreement on this point. What can be recommended today? It is generally accepted that the more severe the disease the more worthwhile surgical treatment. Technically speaking, subfascial endoscopic ligature is a promising new method although long-term results are still lacking. We must watch carefully the prospective and randomized studies which have been started in different countries. A lot of questions, only a few reliable answers."

CD012164,0,10512597,1,Subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery: indications and results.,"Subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) is a new, minimally invasive technique performed in patients with advanced chronic venous insufficiency. The objective of the operation is to interrupt incompetent medial calf perforating veins to decrease venous reflux and reduce ambulatory venous hypertension in critical areas above the ankle where venous ulcers most frequently develop. Patients with stasis skin changes and healed or active venous ulcerations are potential candidates for the operation. Preoperative evaluation is performed with duplex scanning of the superficial, deep and perforator system, to diagnose both obstruction and valvular incompetence. Results of the North American SEPS Registry (NASEPS) as well as experience in several individual centers confirmed that the operation has significantly fewer wound complications than the classic open surgical techniques, and that rapid ulcer healing can be achieved. At the Mayo Clinic an ulcer recurrence rate of 12% was observed, with recurrence significantly more frequent in post-thrombotic limbs than in patients with primary venous valvular incompetence. The NASEPS Registry report confirmed a 2-year cumulative ulcer recurrence rate of 28%; ulcer recurrence was significantly more frequent in post-thrombotic limbs, especially in those with deep venous obstruction. SEPS is a new, low-risk, outpatient procedure that effectively decreases perforator reflux in patients with venous ulcerations, and should be added to our armamentarium to treat patients with advanced chronic venous disease. Long-term prospective and randomized studies are, however, still required to provide level I evidence of late efficacy."
CD012164,0,22623439,0,The path from art to evidence in treating critical limb ischaemia--reflections on 35 years' experience.,"Despite numerous attempts, chronic critical limb ischaemia (CLI) has not been unequivocally defined as yet. Its epidemiology is poorly investigated and its prevalence probably higher than anticipated. It is accompanied by high mortality and morbidity irrespective of the way it is treated. Its management is very expensive. Additionally, the prevailing diabetes epidemic is increasing the need for revascularizations although there is a clear lack of evidence as to when to revascularize an ulcerated diabetic foot. The fast development of endovascular techniques blurs the vision as the window of opportunity for gathering proper evidence keeps narrowing. The notion of endovascular artistry prevails, but attempts to conduct proper studies with clear definitions, strict criteria and appropriate outcome measures in a standardised manner should continue--preferably using propensity scoring if randomised controlled trials are not possible. This review highlights some of the steps leading from art to evidence and illustrates the difficulties encountered along the path. In parallel with this overview, the progress of the treatment for CLI in Finland is described from the perspective of the work concluded at Helsinki University Central Hospital."

CD012164,0,20109380,0,[Multicentric study on a topical compound with lymph-draining action in the treatment of the phlebostatic ulcer of the inferior limbs].,"Phlebostatic sore of the lower limbs is a typical chronic venous insufficiency complication and is still a widely controversial issue in its treatment. The common therapies, in fact, are not yet standardized and they not show complete efficacy. Since 2005 to 2007 a multicentric clinical trial was conducted at the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of ""Sapienza"" University of Rome and at the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department, University of Perugia, in order to evaluate the efficacy of the Idrastin lymph-draining cream in patients with phlebostatic sores of the lower limbs. This study enrolled on 80 patients, split into 2 homogeneous groups of 40 patients: group A was treated by only elastocompressive therapy, group B by elastocompressive therapy and Idrastin. Multicentric analysis has considered the following parameters: local pain, perilesional flogosis , granulation tissue, perilesional tissue tropism healing time. In the group B results highlighted: reduction of the local pain, stopped in 72 hours; flogosis decrease disappeared in one week; tissue granulation growth in one week; lesion healing in 4 weeks. These results pointed out statistically significance of the variables considered. In our opinion Idrastin compounds such as phytoessence of hops and Hedera helix, had contributed to analgesia; Aesculus hippocastanum, and Vitis vinifera and Ruscus aculeatus phytoessence showed anti-flogistic action; allantoin and Centella asiatica and jaluronic acid aided to sore healing. Idrastin gives an effective support to the treatment of the phlebostatic sores warrants a faster and more effective healing process, than to the wounds treated by only the elastocompressive therapy."
CD012164,0,12822732,0,Surgical treatment of venous ulcers: role of subfascial endoscopic perforator vein ligation.,"Existing data in the literature lack answers to several questions about the optimal treatment of patients with advanced CVI, especially venous ulcers. There is no level I evidence to support the superiority of surgical over medical treatment and the extent of surgical intervention. Specifically, knowledge about the efficacy and applicability of SEPS is incomplete, and prospective, randomized studies are needed. In the light of present-day knowledge, all patients should undergo a trial of medical management before resorting to surgery. Patients who benefit from surgical treatment and the addition of SEPS, if indicated, are patients with ulcers resulting from PVI of the superficial and perforating veins, with or without DVI. Based on available data, these patients can be assured an 80% to 90% chance of long-term freedom from ulcer recurrence. Despite subjective symptomatic and objective clinical score improvement, the role of surgery and SEPS is controversial in patients with PT because only 50% of patients can be predicted to have long-term freedom from ulcer recurrence. Patients with ulcer recurrence after SEPS should undergo duplex scanning to exclude recurrent or persistent perforators. If these are found to be incompetent, repeat SEPS is warranted. If there is no perforator incompetence, patients should be considered for deep venous reconstruction."
CD012164,0,20628101,0,Evidence on efficacy of treatments of venous ulcers and on prevention of ulcer recurrence.,"Venous ulcers affect almost 1 million people in the United States. Delayed healing and frequent recurrence result in pain, disability, decreased quality of life, and loss of working days for the patients. Compression therapy is the most effective treatment of ulcers, but compliance with conservative treatment is important, and recurrence must be prevented by treating the underlying ambulatory venous hypertension. Evidence from prospective randomized trials confirm that ulcer recurrence is decreased with superficial vein surgery. Evidence is also increasing about the superiority of endovenous interventions, such as laser or radiofrequency ablation, over the classic open surgical treatment of high ligation, division, and stripping of the saphenous vein. Well-conducted randomized trials are still needed to provide grade A evidence to justify treatment of incompetent perforating veins. Treatment of proximal venous occlusion is important, and venous stents have been effective and durable. Open surgery is only considered today for iliac or iliocaval venous obstruction if endovascular treatment is not possible or has already failed. Open surgery for deep venous incompetence is recommended in centers of excellence, although evidence to support its effectiveness is of low quality."

CD012164,0,22271740,0,A systematic review of the effectiveness of revascularization of the ulcerated foot in patients with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.,"In several large recent observational studies, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was present in up to 50% of the patients with a diabetic foot ulcer and was an independent risk factor for amputation. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot therefore established a multidisciplinary working group to evaluate the effectiveness of revascularization of the ulcerated foot in patients with diabetes and PAD. A systematic search was performed for therapies to revascularize the ulcerated foot in patients with diabetes and PAD from 1980-June 2010. Only clinically relevant outcomes were assessed. The research conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodological scores were assigned. A total of 49 papers were eligible for full text review. There were no randomized controlled trials, but there were three nonrandomized studies with a control group. The major outcomes following endovascular or open bypass surgery were broadly similar among the studies. Following open surgery, the 1-year limb salvage rates were a median of 85% (interquartile range of 80-90%), and following endovascular revascularization, these rates were 78% (70.5-85.5%). At 1-year follow-up, 60% or more of ulcers had healed following revascularization with either open bypass surgery or endovascular revascularization. Studies appeared to demonstrate improved rates of limb salvage associated with revascularization compared with the results of medically treated patients in the literature. There were insufficient data to recommend one method of revascularization over another. There is a real need for standardized reporting of baseline demographic data, severity of disease and outcome reporting in this group of patients."

In 2012, a multidisciplinary working group of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot published a systematic review on the effectiveness of revascularization of the ulcerated foot in patients with diabetes and PAD. This publication is an update of this review and now includes the results of a systematic search for therapies to revascularize the ulcerated foot in patients with diabetes and PAD from 1980 to June 2014. Only clinically relevant outcomes were assessed. The research conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodological scores were assigned. A total of 56 articles were eligible for full-text review. There were no randomized controlled trials, but there were four nonrandomized studies with a control group. The major outcomes following endovascular or open bypass surgery were broadly similar among the studies. Following open surgery, the 1-year limb salvage rates were a median of 85% (interquartile range of 80-90%), and following endovascular revascularization, these rates were 78% (70-89%). At 1-year follow-up, 60% or more of ulcers had healed following revascularization with either open bypass surgery or endovascular techniques. Studies appeared to demonstrate improved rates of limb salvage associated with revascularization compared with the results of conservatively treated patients in the literature. There were insufficient data to recommend one method of revascularization over another. There is a real need for standardized reporting of baseline demographic data, severity of disease and outcome reporting in this group of patients."
CD012164,0,22817861,0,Diabetic revascularization: endovascular versus open bypass--do we have the answer?,"Diabetes is an independent risk factor for peripheral arterial disease and, when advanced peripheral arterial disease develops in the setting of diabetes, it portends a greatly increased threat to both life and limb. The management of severe limb ischemia in diabetic patients, particularly those with tissue loss and infection, remains a major surgical challenge in the new millennium. However, advances in multidisciplinary care, including an aggressive revascularization approach, can avoid major amputation in a large percentage of patients. The unique pattern of lower extremity atherosclerosis in diabetes is a critical determinant of the revascularization strategy. Most diabetics with critical ischemia have popliteal/tibial occlusions requiring below-the-knee intervention or bypass grafting. Bypass surgery with vein to crural or pedal arteries remains the gold standard of revascularization, but may be limited by patient risk, conduit availability, and a suitable target. Infrapopliteal angioplasty can have acceptable results for suitable lesions, particularly when there is not extensive tissue loss in the foot. However, restenosis rates after endovascular intervention in these vessels are high, and recent advances in drug-eluting balloons and stents have promise but remain largely unproven. There is limited high-quality evidence to support treatment choices in this arena, with only one randomized clinical trial to date. The available data suggest that patients with life expectancy of at least 2 years and more extensive disease have superior outcomes with open reconstruction. A selective revascularization strategy is advocated, using autogenous vein bypass as the initial approach in a significant percentage of patients, based on its greater overall efficacy and proven durability. However, endovascular therapies have an important role in current practice, which will increase further if restenosis can be overcome. Vascular specialists should understand and be able to apply both types of interventions to optimize patient outcomes."
CD012164,0,16650207,0,Preventing venous ulcer recurrence: a review.,"This review article examines the available evidence on both the primary and secondary prevention of venous ulceration, exploring both the individual, social and financial implications of system failures that allow patients to remain at increased risk of recurrent ulceration. The role of both venous disease assessment and corrective superficial venous surgery are discussed in the light of recently published randomised controlled studies on the role of superficial venous surgery as both an adjunct to ulcer healing and ulcer prevention."

CD012164,0,27814432,0,Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy for iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis.,"Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurs in approximately one in 1000 adults every year, and has an annual mortality of 14.6%. In particular, iliofemoral DVT can lead to recurrent thrombosis and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), a painful condition which can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, oedema, and ulceration. It causes significant disability, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. Early thrombus removal techniques have been advocated in patients with an iliofemoral DVT in order to improve vein patency, prevent valvular dysfunction, and reduce future complications, such as post-thrombotic syndrome and venous ulceration. One such technique is pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, a combination of catheter-based thrombectomy and catheter-directed thrombolysis."

CD012164,0,22352682,0,Adult stem cells and the clinical arena: are we able to widely use this therapy in patients with chronic limbs arteriopathy and ischemic ulcers without possibility of revascularization?,"The following paper is an overview on stem cells therapy in patients with peripheral vascular diseases. Recent research shows the ability of stem cells to develop and strengthen the collateral network in ischemic legs. Here, we discuss this clinical and therapeutic approach. To date, research has been mainly focused on patients with ischemic ulcers without possibility of revascularization. Non-invasive stem cell therapy has been proposed as an alternative to the amputation of such patients, but when the ulcers appear it is sometime too late. In our point of view, the selection of patients is a very important issue and we believe that the best candidate for this treatment is the patient with intermittent claudication before the development of ulcers. This choice could allow the optimization of results by the type of treated patients and not only by the type of infused cells. Indeed, several variables still remain to be elucidated for stem cell therapy, including the type of cells to be used, the infusion route, and more importantly, the stage of patients to be treated."
