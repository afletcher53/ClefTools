CD006715,0,24782910,0,The effect of resveratrol on surgery-induced epidural fibrosis in laminectomy rats.,"Epidural fibrosis (EF) is a common complication for the patients who underwent laminectomy. Recently, EF is thought to cause recurrent postoperative pain after laminectomy. Resveratrol has been shown to exert its anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antiproliferative multifaceted properties. The object of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on the prevention of postlaminectomy EF formation in laminectomy rats. A controlled double-blinded study was performed on 60 healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent lumbar laminectomy at the L1-L2 levels. They were divided randomly into 3 groups (1, 2, and 3) of 20 rats each-group 1: resveratrol treatment group; group 2: resveratrol dilution saline treatment group; group 3: sham group (rats underwent laminectomy without treatment). All rats were killed 4 weeks after operation. The Rydell score, hydroxyproline content, vimentin cells density, fibroblasts density, and inflammatory factors expressional levels all suggested better results in resveratrol group than the other two groups. Resveratrol is able to inhibit fibroblasts proliferation, and TGF- Î² 1 and IL-6 expressions and prevent epidural fibrosis in postlaminectomy rat."

As many as 41 % of patients with either known coronary artery disease or with cardiac risk factors, undergoing a non-cardiac surgery, develop perioperative ischaemia. Various authors have compared regional techniques with general Anaesthesia in selected groups but no one has compared the impact of different techniques of centroneuraxial block on incidence and duration of silent myocardial ischaemia. Thus we compared two different techniques of centroneuraxial block (Spinal versus Epidural block) in aged patients selected randomly undergoing TURP surgery. We took TURP patients as they belong to geriatric age group and often have silent or apparent coexistent coronary artery disease. Secondly, TURP surgery related volume overload and shivering in these patients lead to further oxygen demand supply mismatch."

CD006715,0,24488821,0,Analgesic efficacy and safety of thoracic paravertebral and epidural analgesia for thoracic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Though once considered the gold standard, epidural anaesthesia has complications that may be significant and include hypotension, urinary retention, partial or patchy block and, in rare cases, devastating neurological injuries also. Paravertebral block (PVB) is an alternative technique for unilateral surgical procedures like thoracotomy, which may offer similar analgesic effectiveness and a more favourable side-effect profile than epidural analgesia. This systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized clinical trials aims to compare thoracic paravertebral with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in thoracotomy for lung surgery. Five hundred and forty-one patients from 12 clinical trials have been included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. We found that visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest and during activity/coughing at 4-8, 24 and 48 h postoperatively were similar in both the PVB and TEA groups. Considering studies not included in the previous meta-analysis, a VAS score on activity at 48 h is significantly better in the PVB group (mean difference 0.40 cm; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.77, 0.02; Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) fixed). Hypotension (odds ratio 0.13; 95% CI 0.06, 0.31; M-H fixed) and urinary retention are more common in the epidural analgesia group. So, we conclude that thoracic PVB may be as effective as thoracic epidural analgesia for post-thoracotomy pain relief and is also associated with fewer complications."

CD006715,0,27160270,0,Flow Diversion for Intracranial Aneurysm Management: A New Standard of Care.,"Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with complex morphologies such as giant, wide-necked, or fusiform aneurysms is challenging. Stent-assisted coiling and balloon-assisted coiling are alternative techniques to treat such complex aneurysms, but studies have shown less-than-expected efficacy, as suggested by their high rate of recanalization. The management of complex aneurysms via microsurgery or conventional neuroendovascular strategies has traditionally been poor. However, over the last few years, flow-diverting stents (FDS) have revolutionized the treatment of such aneurysms. FDS are implanted within the parent artery rather than the aneurysm sac. By modifying intra-aneurysmal and parent-vessel flow dynamics at the aneurysm/parent vessel interface, FDS trigger a cascade of gradual intra-aneurysmal thrombosis. As endothelialization of the FDS is complete, the parent vessel reconstructs while preserving the patency of normal perforators and side branch vessels. As with any intervention, the practice and application of flow-diversion technology is inherent, with risks that include vessel rupture or perforation, in-stent thrombosis, perforator occlusion, procedural and delayed hemorrhages, and perianeurysmal edema. Herein, we review the devices, their mechanisms of actions, clinical applications, complications, and ongoing studies."
CD006715,0,27909035,0,Randomised controlled pilot study to investigate the effectiveness of thoracic epidural and paravertebral blockade in reducing chronic post-thoracotomy pain: TOPIC feasibility study protocol.,"Open chest surgery (thoracotomy) is considered the most painful of surgical procedures. Forceful wound retraction, costochondral dislocation, posterior costovertebral ligament disruption, intercostal nerve trauma and wound movement during respiration combine to produce an acute, severe postoperative pain insult and persistent chronic pain many months after surgery is common. Three recent systematic reviews conclude that unilateral continuous paravertebral blockade (PVB) provides analgesia at least equivalent to thoracic epidural blockade (TEB) in the postoperative period, has a lower failure rate, and symptom relief that lasted months. Crucially, PVB may reduce the development of subsequent chronic pain by intercostal nerve protection or decreased nociceptive input. The overall aim is to determine in patients who undergo thoracotomy whether perioperative PVB results in reducing chronic post-thoracotomy pain (CPTP) compared with TEB. This pilot study will evaluate feasibility of a substantive trial."

CD006715,0,23832920,0,Is there a role for gabapentin in preventing or treating pain following thoracic surgery?,"A best evidence topic in cardiothoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether gabapentin, a commonly prescribed neuropathic analgesic and anticonvulsant, is safe and beneficial in patients with post-thoracotomy pain following thoracic surgery. Seventeen papers were identified using the search described below, and five papers presented the best evidence to reach conclusions regarding the issues of interest for this review. Side effects and complications as well as evidence of benefit, typically using various pain-scoring systems, were included in the assessment. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of the papers are tabulated. The systematic review of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that the use of a single dose gabapentin does not reduce pain scores or the need for epidural or morphine immediately in hospital following thoracic surgery. One double-blinded RCT used multiple doses of gabapentin perioperatively and showed that oral gabapentin administered preoperatively and during the first 2 days postoperatively, in conjunction with patient controlled analgesia morphine, provides effective analgesia in thoracic surgery with a consequent improvement in postoperative pulmonary function and less morphine consumption. One prospective clinical study comparing a 2-month course of gabapentin with naproxen sodium for chronic post thoracotomy pain following surgery showed significant improvement in both the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs (LANSS) at 60 days in the gabapentin (P = 0.001). One prospective study of out-patients with chronic pain (>4 weeks since thoracotomy performed) suggested that gabapentin is effective, safe and well tolerated when used for persistent postoperative and post-traumatic pain in thoracic surgery patients. We conclude that there is no evidence to support the role of a single preoperative oral dose of gabapentin in reducing pain scores or opioid consumption following thoracic surgery. Multiple dosing regimens may be beneficial in reducing acute and chronic pain; however, more robust randomized control studies are needed."

CD006715,0,23734284,0,Major themes for 2012 in cardiovascular anesthesia and intensive care.,"There was major progress through 2012 in cardiovascular anesthesia and intensive care. Although recent meta-analysis has supported prophylactic steroid therapy in adult cardiac surgery, a large Dutch multicenter trial found no outcome advantage with dexamethasone. A second large randomized trial is currently testing the outcome effects of methyprednisolone in this setting. Due to calibration drift, the logistic EuroSCORE has recently been recalibrated. Despite this model revision, EuroSCORE II still overestimates mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. It is likely that a specific perioperative risk model will be developed for this unique patient population. Recent global consensus has prioritized 12 non-surgical interventions that merit further study for reducing mortality after surgery. There is currently a paradigm shift in the conduct of adult aortic arch repair. Recent advances have facilitated aortic arch reconstruction with routine antegrade cerebral perfusion at mild-to-moderate hypothermia. Further integration of hybrid endovascular techniques may allow future aortic arch repair without hypothermia or circulatory arrest. These advances will likely further improve patient outcomes."
CD006715,0,28122571,0,Continuous paravertebral block using a thoracoscopic catheter-insertion technique for postoperative pain after thoracotomy: a retrospective case-control study.,"Thoracic epidural analgesia (EDA) is the gold standard for pain control after thoracotomy. However, because of its severe side effects, it is contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs.

CD006715,0,23851286,0,[Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data].,"Improving quality and effectiveness of health care is one of the priorities of health policies. Hospital or physician volume represents a measurable variable with a relevant impact on effectiveness of health care. A recent Italian law, the ""spending review"", calls for the definition of ""qualitative, structural, technological and quantitative standards of hospital care"". There is a need for an accurate evaluation of the available scientific evidence in order to identify these standards, including the volume of care above or below which the public and private hospitals may be accredited (or not) to provide specific health care interventions. Since 2009, the National Outcomes Programme evaluates outcomes of care of the Italian hospitals; nowadays it represents an official tool to assess the National Health System (NHS). In addition to outcome indicators, the last edition of the Programme (2013) includes a set of volume indicators for the conditions with available evidence of an association between volume and outcome. The assessment of factors, such as volume, that may affect the outcomes of care is one of its objectives."

CD006715,0,29703025,0,Association between perioperative hypothermia and patient outcomes after thoracic surgery: A single center retrospective analysis.,"Hypothermia due to anaesthetic-induced impairment of thermoregulatory control and exposure to a cool environment is common in surgical patients. Peripheral vasodilation due to neuroaxial blockade may aggravate hypothermia. There is few data on perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing thoracic surgery under combined general and regional anesthesia. We reviewed all thoracic surgical patients between 2006 and 2011 to determine the incidence and extent of hypothermia with or without an epidural anesthesia and evaluated its effect.Around 339 patients underwent lung resection procedures with intraoperative forced-air warming: 197 with general and epidural anesthesia (GAâ+âEPI), 199 with general anesthesia alone (GA). Statistical analyses were performed to determine the association between hypothermia (Tâ<â36Â°C) and transfusion requirements, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), hospital LOS, and in hospital mortality.The overall incidence of hypothermia was 64.3%. Multivariate regression analysis revealed three significant risk factors for the development of hypothermia: long induction time (Pâ=â.011), small body surface area (Pâ=â.003), and application of more fluid intraoperatively (Pâ<â.001). Factors determining the extent of hypothermia were: receiving an open thoracotomy (Pâ=â.009), placement and use of an epidural catheter (Pâ=â.002), and a lower body mass index (BMI) (Pâ<â.001). Additional epidural anesthesia reduced core temperature by 0.26Â°C (95% CI -0.414 to -0.095Â°C, Pâ<â.05). There was no difference in transfusion requirements, ICU LOS or mortality between both groups. Hospital LOS was longer in patients with hypothermia.More than half of all thoracic patients suffered from hypothermia. A long induction time, small body surface area, and large intraoperative fluid application were independent risk factors for the development of perioperative hypothermia. Additional epidural anesthesia to general anesthesia did not increase the incidence of hypothermia but decreased body core temperature to an-albeit not clinically significant-degree. Patients scheduled for thoracic surgery will probably benefit from an additional period of prewarming prior to induction to reduce the high incidence of perioperative hypothermia."

CD006715,0,26384505,0,Paravertebral block decreases opioid administration without causing hypotension during transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Paravertebral block (PVB) is feasible for postoperative analgesia in patients who undergo cardiac surgery with unilateral thoracotomy. Postoperative continuous PVB is as effective as thoracic epidural anesthesia and is less likely to cause hypotension. However, the intraoperative utility and safety of PVB remains unclear. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the efficacy and hemodynamic influence of intraoperative paravertebral bolus injection during cardiac surgery. We retrospectively compared intraoperative medication use and blood pressure measurements between patients who underwent transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TA-TAVI) with (PVB group, nÂ =Â 46) or without (non-PVB group, nÂ =Â 15) intraoperative PVB. Remifentanil administration was lower by more than 40Â % in the PVB group compared with that in the non-PVB group (728Â Â±Â 319Â Âµg vs. 1240Â Â±Â 488Â Âµg, PÂ <Â 0.001). The average and variability of intraoperative blood pressure showed no significant differences between groups. The duration of hypotension (blood pressure less than 80Â % of baseline) was 25.1Â Â±Â 21.5Â % and 25.4Â Â±Â 18.1Â % of the entire anesthesia time in the non-PVB and PVB groups, respectively (PÂ =Â 0.74). The use of inotropic and vasopressor agents was comparable between groups. Intraoperative paravertebral bolus injection decreased remifentanil administration without causing hypotension during TA-TAVI in hemodynamically unstable patients. This result suggests the intraoperative utility of PVB in cardiac surgery."

Our study aimed to evaluate the safety of liposomal bupivacaine as an intercostal nerve block as part of an enhanced recovery pathway using standardized multimodality pain regimen compared with epidural analgesia in propensity score-matched patients undergoing lung resection. Patients undergoing lung resection (n?=?1737; 2010-2015) were stratified by treatment with intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine intercostal block vs epidural analgesia. We performed 2 propensity score matching analyses. In the first, propensity for treatment with liposomal bupivacaine was estimated using pretreatment variables and the patients were matched on the propensity score. The variables were age, neoadjuvant therapy, extent of resection, and the Zubrod score. In the second, the propensity score matching was performed only in patients who had a thoracotomy. Perioperative outcomes were compared between groups using paired statistical analysis techniques. In the first analysis (n?=?1236), there were more thoracotomies performed in the epidural group (P?<?0.0001). The rate of pulmonary, gastrointestinal, wound, and neurologic complications was similar between the groups, but there were more cardiovascular complications in the epidural arm (P?=?0.02), mostly atrial arrhythmias. In the second analysis (n?=?494), there were no differences in the rate of postoperative complications between the groups. The use of liposomal bupivacaine is not associated with a rise in perioperative complications when compared with epidural analgesia. Liposomal bupivacaine is a safe adjunct to the management of pain of patients undergoing pulmonary surgery."

CD006715,0,26487457,0,Cerebrovascular complications of infective endocarditis.,"We reviewed the cerebrovascular complications of 158 episodes of infective endocarditis occurring in 155 patients. Cerebrovascular complications occurred in 21 patients (14%). The incidences of cerebral embolism, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage were 10%, 3%, and 1%, respectively. Death occurred in 33% of patients with cerebrovascular complications and 4% without. Patients whose condition was complicated by intracerebral hemorrhage had an even greater rate of mortality (80%). Sixty-two percent of cerebrovascular complications occurred within 2 days of antibiotic therapy; 29% occurred 2 weeks later. Two of three patients receiving open-heart surgery within 2 days of cerebrovascular complications died. Seventeen of 133 patients with native valve endocarditis and 4 of 22 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis had cerebrovascular complications. Echocardiographic evidence of vegetation was seen in 120 patients, and cerebrovascular complications were noted in 16 patients. Twelve of 62 patients with mitral valve involvement detected by echocardiography and 4 of 40 patients with aortic valve involvement had cerebrovascular complications. According to the findings of surgery or pathology, 4 of 24 patients with mitral valve involvement and 4 of 36 patients with aortic valve involvement had cerebrovascular complications. We conclude that vegetation detected by echocardiography does not increase the risk of cerebrovascular complicatons; there is no difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular complications between the mitral and aortic valve groups, either by the involvement of vegetation detected by echocardiography or the surgical or pathologic findings; there is no difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular complications when comparing the native and prosthetic valve groups or the streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus aureus groups; cerebrovascular complications, especially intracerebral hemorrhage, increase the risk of mortality in patients with infective endocarditis; although most cerebrovascular complications occurred within 2 days of antibiotic therapy, late onset of cerebrovascular complications are not uncommon; and it is better to avoid early open heart surgery in patients whose condition is complicated by intracerebral hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction."

Outcome measures were: operation duration, analgesia duration, blood loss, length of stay (LOS), outcome ratings, complications, and percentage requiring reoperations. Adult implant patients (18.8%) had higher reoperation rates than adult Nuss or Ravitch patients (5.3% and 3.3% respectively). Adult Nuss patients had longer LOS (7.3 days), more strut/bar displacement (6.1%), and more epidural analgesia (3 days) than adult Ravitch patients (2.9 days, 0%, 0 days). Excluding pectus bar and strut displacements, pediatric and adult Nuss patients tended to have higher complication rates (pediatric - 38%; adult - 21%) compared to pediatric and adult Ravitch patients (12.5%; 8%). Pediatric Ravitch patients clearly had more strut displacements than adult Ravitch patients (0% and 6.4% respectively). These results suggest significantly better results in common PEx surgical repair techniques (i.e. Nuss and Ravitch) than uncommon techniques (i.e. Implants and Robicsek). The results suggest slightly better outcomes in pediatric Nuss procedure patients as compared with all other groups. We recommend that symptomatic pediatric patients with uncomplicated PEx receive the Nuss procedure. We suggest that adult patients receive the Nuss or Ravitch procedure, even though the long-term complication rates of the adult Nuss procedure require more investigation."
CD006715,0,28342655,0,Tacrolimus-Induced Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome with Delayed Multi-Segmental Vasoconstriction.,"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a cerebrovascular syndrome characterized by multi-segmental constrictions of the cerebral arteries that resolves spontaneously within 3 months. Although RCVS is considered to be due to transient dysregulation of vascular tone, the exact pathomechanism remains unclear. We describe the case of a 15-year-old girl with RCVS induced by tacrolimus, who developed generalized seizure during the postoperative course of orthotropic heart transplantation. Magnetic resonance imaging at symptom onset showed a few vasoconstrictions accompanying brain edema and convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although her neurological conditions rapidly improved after discontinuing tacrolimus, a repeat magnetic resonance angiogram demonstrated delayed progression of the multi-segmental vasoconstrictions followed by subsequent resolution. Our case demonstrates that cautious observation of the cerebral arteries using magnetic resonance angiography and careful management of vasoconstrictions with vasodilators are necessary for delayed vasoconstrictions even when the clinical symptoms improve."

CD006715,0,28043447,0,Immediate Spinal Cord Collateral Blood Flow During Thoracic Aortic Procedures: The Role of Epidural Arcades.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the functional differences between paraspinal and intraspinal compartments of the spinal collateral network and the importance of circular epidural arcades in thoracic aortic surgery. N = 33 pigs (mean body weight: 34 Â± 3kg) were included. A single-inlet-model of spinal collateral flow was created: paraspinal inflow into the collateral network was isolated by cephalad and caudal interruption of inflow into epidural arcades using laminectomies. Animals were assigned to treatment groups (Treatment ""open"" [patent epidural arcades, n = 10] and Treatment ""closed"" [closed epidural arcades, n = 10]) and Sham groups (Sham ""open"" n = 8 and Sham ""closed"" n = 5). Treatment was a simulated Frozen Elephant Trunk procedure with occlusion of left subclavian and thoracic segmental arteries under mild permissive hypothermia. Observation time was 3 hours. Endpoints were motor and somatosensory evoked potentials (motor evoked potentials and sensory evoked potentials), spinal cord perfusion pressure, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, regional spinal cord blood flow, and neurologic outcome. Animals with interrupted inflow into epidural arcades (Group Treatment ""closed"") had higher cerebrospinal fluid pressure levels (P < 0.05), were not able to maintain sufficient spinal cord perfusion pressure during Frozen Elephant Trunk procedure (P < 0.001) and did not generate reactive hyperemia as did group Treatment ""open."" spinal cord blood flow was strongly decreased in group Treatment ""closed"" (P < 0.001) at 0 hour, did not recover out to 3 hours of observation and 90% of the animals suffered flaccid paraplegia (P < 0.05). Immediate spinal cord backup blood flow is almost exclusively delivered using the system of epidural arcades in the immediate setting, serving as an immediate backup system. Intraspinal arcades are responsible for generating sufficient intraspinal perfusion pressures, reactive hyperemia, and spinal cord integrity. Paraspinal collaterals might need to undergo arteriogenesis, and thus serve as a long-term backup system."
CD006715,0,26139745,1,Nonanalgesic benefits of combined thoracic epidural analgesia with general anesthesia in high risk elderly off pump coronary artery bypass patients.,"Epidural anesthesia is a central neuraxial block technique with many applications. It is a versatile anesthetic technique, with applications in surgery, obstetrics and pain control. Its versatility means it can be used as an anesthetic, as an analgesic adjuvant to general anesthesia, and for postoperative analgesia. Off pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery triggers a systemic stress response as seen in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA), combined with general anesthesia (GA) attenuates the stress response to CABG.

CD006715,0,22002277,0,Effects of epidural-and-general anesthesia combined versus general anesthesia during laparoscopic adrenalectomy.,"Laparoscopic approach is increasingly performed for functional adrenal tumor resections. The aim of this study was to compare general anesthesia and general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia for laparoscopic adrenalectomy. In our study, we planned to examine hemodynamic changes (heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures) and quantity of adrenocorticotropic hormone, adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, and aldosterone in laparoscopic adrenalectomies under general anesthesia with or without epidural anesthesia. All patients were operated by the same surgical team. With increased experience of the surgical team, the duration of surgery decreased. In parallel with decreased duration of surgery, pneumoperitoneum and undesirable effects also decreased. Nine patients with Conn syndrome, 21 patients with Cushing syndrome, and 2 patients with pheochromocytoma were included in both groups. Thirty-two laparoscopic adrenalectomies for functional adrenal tumors were performed. Sixteen patients who received general anesthesia without epidural anesthesia were compared with 16 patients who received general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. Hemodynamic data, arterial blood gases, and adrenal gland hormones were recorded. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were recorded before anesthesia induction, after insufflation, before adrenalectomy, and after adrenalectomy. Arterial blood gases, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline and aldosterone were recorded before anesthesia induction, after adrenalectomy, and after surgery. Heart rate varied between 68.5 and 84 bpm in general anesthesia group and between 63.5 and 87 bpm in general+epidural anesthesia group. Blood pressure measurements were 154 to 122.5/88.5 to 75 mm Hg in general anesthesia and 149 to 100/86 to 70 mm Hg in general+epidural anesthesia. ACTH was 10.3 to 106.25 in general anesthesia and 17.6 to 104.5 in general+epidural anesthesia. Cortisol was 16.1 to 23.2 Âµg/dL in general anesthesia and 16.4 to 24.3 Âµg/dL in general+epidural anesthesia. Aldosterone was 163.3 to 285.2 ng/dL in general anesthesia and 215 to 440 ng/dL in general+epidural anesthesia. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters, ACTH, cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline levels between the 2 groups. Aldosterone levels were higher in general+epidural anesthesia group. The results of our study suggest that epidural anesthesia in addition to general anesthesia in patients with functional adrenal tumors undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy might be an effective and safe method to prevent the fluctuations in hormone levels."

PVB can be done in two ways: either through administration of a bolus dose of the LA or continuous infusion via an infusion pump; currently, there is no consensus on which route is best. Our objective was to compare the efficacy of the PVB for post-thoracotomy pain control using bolus doses versus a continuous infusion pump."
CD006715,0,22397329,0,Tranexamic acid: a review of its use in the treatment of hyperfibrinolysis.,"Tranexamic acid, a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, is an antifibrinolytic agent that acts by binding to plasminogen and blocking the interaction of plasmin(ogen) with fibrin, thereby preventing dissolution of the fibrin clot. Tranexamic acid (TransaminÂ®) is indicated in Japan for use in certain conditions with abnormal bleeding or bleeding tendencies in which local or systemic hyperfibrinolysis is considered to be involved. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of tranexamic acid in conditions amenable to antifibrinolytic therapy and briefly overviews the pharmacological properties of the drug. In large, randomized controlled trials, tranexamic acid generally significantly reduced perioperative blood loss compared with placebo in a variety of surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass, total hip and knee replacement and prostatectomy. In many instances, tranexamic acid also reduced transfusion requirements associated with surgery. It also reduced blood loss in gynaecological bleeding disorders, such as heavy menstrual bleeding, postpartum haemorrhage and bleeding irregularities caused by contraceptive implants. Tranexamic acid significantly reduced all-cause mortality and death due to bleeding in trauma patients with significant bleeding, particularly when administered early after injury. It was also effective in traumatic hyphaema, gastrointestinal bleeding and hereditary angioneurotic oedema. While it reduces rebleeding in subarachnoid haemorrhage, it may increase ischaemic complications. Pharmacoeconomic analyses predicted that tranexamic acid use in surgery and trauma would be very cost effective and potentially life saving. In direct comparisons with other marketed agents, tranexamic acid was at least as effective as Îµ-aminocaproic acid and more effective than desmopressin in surgical procedures. It was more effective than desmopressin, etamsylate, flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid and norethisterone, but less effective than the levonorgestrel-releasing intra-uterine device in heavy menstrual bleeding and was as effective as prednisolone in traumatic hyphaema. Tranexamic acid was generally well tolerated. Most adverse events in clinical trials were of mild or moderate severity; severe or serious events were rare. Therefore, while high-quality published evidence is limited for some approved indications, tranexamic acid is an effective and well tolerated antifibrinolytic agent."

Recent accumulating evidence has suggested that early brain injury is also involved in the development of delayed cerebral ischemia, and that hydrogen can prevent early brain injury. Therefore, we have established a combination therapy of intravenous hydrogen infusion and intra-cisternal magnesium sulfate infusion for the treatment of both early brain injury and cerebral vasospasm. The present randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to investigate the effects of this novel therapeutic strategy on the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and clinical outcomes after high-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage."

A randomized blinded study.,"To compare the outcomes of thoracic epidural block with thoracic paravertebral block for thoracotomy in pediatric patients. A prospective double-blind study. 60 pediatric patients aged 1-24 months, ASA II, III scheduled for thoracotomy were randomly allocated into two groups. After induction of general anesthesia, thoracic epidural catheter was inserted in group E (epidural) patients and thoracic paravertebral catheter was inserted in group P (paravertebral) patients. Post operative pain score was recorded hourly for 24 hours. Plasma cortisol level was recorded at three time points. Tidal breathing analysis was done preoperatively and 6 hours postoperatively. Analgesia, serum cortisol level, and pulmonary function parameters were comparable in the two groups. However, failure rate (incorrect placement of catheter) was significantly higher in epidural group than in paravertebral group (7% versus 0%, respectively). The complications were also significantly higher in epidural group (vomiting 14.8%, urine retention 11.1% and hypotension 14.8%) than paravertebral group (0%, 0%, and 3.6%, respectively). We conclude that both thoracic paravertebral block and thoracic epidural block results in comparable pain score and pulmonary function after thoracotomy in pediatric patients; the paravertebral block is associated with significantly less failure rate and side effects."

CD006715,0,29088950,0,Neurosurgical applications of viscoelastic hemostatic assays.,"Patients taking antithrombotic agents are very common in neurosurgical practice. The perioperative management of these patients can be extremely challenging especially as newer agents, with poorly defined laboratory monitoring and reversal strategies, become more prevalent. This is especially true with emergent cases in which rapid reversal of anticoagulation is required and the patient's exact medical history is not available. With an aging patient population and the associated increase in diseases such as atrial fibrillation, it is expected that the use of these agents will continue to rise in coming years. Furthermore, thromboembolic complications such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction are common complications of major surgery. These trends, in conjunction with a growing understanding of the hemostatic process and its contribution to the pathophysiology of disease, stress the importance of the complete evaluation of a patient's hemostatic profile in guiding management decisions. Viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHAs), such as thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry, are global assessments of coagulation that account for the cellular and plasma components of coagulation. This FDA-approved technology has been available for decades and has been widely used in cardiac surgery and liver transplantation. Although VHAs were cumbersome in the past, advances in software and design have made them more accurate, reliable, and accessible to the neurosurgeon. VHAs have demonstrated utility in guiding intraoperative blood product transfusion, identifying coagulopathy in trauma, and managing postoperative thromboprophylaxis. The first half of this review aims to evaluate and assess VHAs, while the latter half seeks to appraise the evidence supporting their use in neurosurgical populations."

Randomized controlled trials evaluating the continuous paravertebral block against epidural analgesia, wound infiltration, placebo or standard care (intravenous opioids) for post-cardiothoracic surgery analgesia were considered for inclusion in the systematic review. PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases were searched from inception to 15 September 2014. Risk of bias and generalizability were assessed using a modified Downs and Black checklist. A meta-analysis was conducted on suitable studies comparing the continuous paravertebral nerve block with epidural anaesthesia, with fixed-effects models being used to pool the effects. Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with 1120 participants were included. The continuous paravertebral block was associated with a significant improvement in incidence of nausea and vomiting (odds ratio = 0.29, 95% confidence interval = [0.16, 0.56]), hypotension (odds ratio = 0.16, 95% confidence interval = [0.06, 0.41]) and urinary retention (odds ratio = 0.22, 95% confidence interval = [0.09, 0.52]) compared with the epidural block. No statistically significant difference in pain relief was reported. The continuous paravertebral block has equivalent analgesic effects to epidural analgesia, wound infiltration and standard care, but is associated with a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting, hypotension and urinary retention than epidural analgesia."

This study aimed to determine the comparative efficacy of lumbar PEA between the sacral types in chronic pain with lumbosacral herniated intervertebral disc (L-HIVD).A total of 1158 chronic low back and/or leg pain patients who diagnosed with L-HIVD and underwent PEA between February 2011 and March 2015 were retrospectively examined. All enrolled patients were divided into 2 types: dome-sacral type and flat type. To avoid confounding bias, propensity score analysis was used. Numeric rating scales (NRS) and Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) were compared between the 2 types at baseline and at 3 months post-PEA.After conducting a propensity score matching analysis, 114 patients were included in each type. The mean sacral angle significantly differed between the flat-sacral and dome-sacral types (Pâ<â0.001). A linear mixed effect model analysis showed that the adjusted NRS score at baseline was 7.58 [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.40-7.76] for the flat-sacral type and 7.47 (95% CI: 7.29-7.64) for the dome-sacral type. The adjusted NRS score after 3 months post-PEA was 4.27 (95% CI: 3.77-4.77) for the flat-sacral type and 3.71 (95% CI: 3.21-4.21) for the dome-sacral type. We detected no significant differences in NRS at baseline (Pâ=â0.371) and after 3 months (Pâ=â0.121) between the 2 groups. No significant differences were observed in terms of the NRS score between the 2 groups during the 3 months follow-up (omnibus Pâ=â0.223). There were no significant differences in PGIC between flat-sacral and dome-sacral types at 3 months after the follow-up period (4.40âÂ±â2.17 and 4.67âÂ±â1.88, respectively, Pâ=â0.431).PEA provides sufficient pain relief for chronic pain due to L-HIVD at 3 months postprocedure. The sacral type might not affect the outcome of lumbar PEA in chronic pain associated lumbar HIVD."

CD006715,0,29205995,0,Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data.,"BACKGROUND Improving quality and effectiveness of healthcare is one of the priorities of health policies. Hospital or physician volume represents a measurable variable with an impact on effectiveness of healthcare. An Italian law calls for the definition of Â«qualitative, structural, technological, and quantitative standards of hospital careÂ». There is a need for an evaluation of the available scientific evidence in order to identify qualitative, structural, technological, and quantitative standards of hospital care, including the volume of care above or below which the public and private hospitals may be accredited (or not) to provide specific healthcare interventions. OBJECTIVES To identify conditions/interventions for which an association between volume and outcome has been investigated. To identify conditions/interventions for which an association between volume and outcome has been proved. To analyze the distribution of Italian health providers by volume of activity. To measure the association between volume of care and outcomes of the health providers of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). METHODS Systematic review An overview of systematic reviews was performed searching PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library up to November 2016. Studies were evaluated by 2 researchers independently; quality assessment was performed using the AMSTAR checklist. For each health condition and outcome, if available, total number of studies, participants, high volume cut-off values, and metanalysis have been reported. According to the considered outcomes, health topics were classified into 3 groups: positive association: a positive association was demonstrated in the majority of studies/participants and/or a pooled measure (metanalysis) with positive results was reported; lack of association: both studies and/or metanalysis showed no association; no sufficient evidence of association: both results of single studies and metanalysis do not allow to draw firm conclusions on the association between volume and outcome. Analysis of the distribution of Italian hospitals by volume of activity and the association between volume of activity and outcomes: the Italian National Outcome evaluation Programme 2016 The analyses were performed using the Hospital Information System and the National Tax Register (year 2015). For each condition, the number of hospitals by volume of activity was calculated. Hospitals with a volume lower than 3-5 cases/year were excluded. For conditions with more than 1,500 cases/year and frequency of outcome â¥1%, the association between volume of care and outcome was analyzed estimating risk-adjusted outcomes. RESULTS Bibliographic searches identified 80 reviews, evaluating 48 different clinical areas. The main outcome considered was intrahospital/30-day mortality. The other outcomes vary depending on the type of condition or intervention in study. The relationship between hospital volume and outcomes was considered in 47 out of 48 conditions: 34 conditions showed evidence of a positive association; â¢ 14 conditions consider cancer surgery for bladder, breast, colon, rectum, colon rectum, oesophagus, kidney, liver, lung, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, stomach, head and neck; â¢ 11 conditions consider cardiocerebrovascular area: nonruptured and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, acute myocardial infarction, brain aneurysm, carotid endarterectomy, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass, paediatric heart surgery, revascularization of lower limbs, stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage; â¢ 2 conditions consider orthopaedic area: knee arthroplasty, hip fracture; â¢ 7 conditions consider other areas: AIDS, bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy, intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit, sepsis, and traumas; for 3 conditions, no association was demonstrated: hip arthroplasty, dialysis, and thyroidectomy. for the remaining 10 conditions, the available evidence does not allow to draw firm conclusions about the association between hospital volume and considered outcomes: surgery for testicular cancer and intracranial tumours, paediatric oncology, aortofemoral bypass, cardiac catheterization, appendectomy, colectomy, inguinal hernia, respiratory failure, and hysterectomy. The relationship between volume of clinician/surgeon and outcomes was assessed only through the literature re view; to date, it is not possible to analyze this association for Italian health provider hospitals, since information on the clinician/surgeon on the hospital discharge chart is missing. The literature found a positive association for 21 conditions: 9 consider surgery for cancer: bladder, breast, colon, colon rectum, pancreas, prostate, rectum, stomach, and head and neck; 5 consider the cardiocerebrovascular area: ruptured and nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid endarterectomy, paediatric heart surgery, and revascularization of the lower limbs; 2 consider the orthopaedic area: knee and hip arthroplasty; 5 consider other areas: AIDS, bariatric surgery, hysterectomy, intensive care unit, and thyroidectomy. The analysis of the distribution of Italian hospitals concerned the 34 conditions for which the systematic review has shown a positive volume-outcome association. For the following, it was possible to conduct the analysis of the association using national data: unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary angioplasty, hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, coronary artery bypass, cancer surgery (colon, liver, breast, pancreas, lung, prostate, kidney, and stomach), laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hip fracture, stroke, acute myocardial infarction. For these conditions, the association between volume and outcome of care was observed. For laparoscopic cholecystectomy and surgery of the breast and stomach cancer, the association between the volume of the discharge (o dismissal) operating unit and the outcome was analyzed. The outcomes differ depending on the condition studied. The shape of the relationship is variable among different conditions, with heterogeneous slope of the curves. DISCUSSION For many conditions, the overview of systematic reviews has shown a strong evidence of association between higher volumes and better outcomes. The quality of the available reviews can be considered good for the consistency of the results between the studies and for the strength of the association; however, this does not mean that the included studies are of good quality. Analyzing national data, potential confounders, including age and comorbidities, have been considered. The systematic review of the literature does not permit to identify predefined volume thresholds. The analysis of national data shows a strong improvement in outcomes in the first part of the curve (from very low to higher volumes) for most conditions. In some cases, the improvement in outcomes remains gradual or constant with the increasing volume of care; in other, the analysis could allow the identification of threshold values beyond which the outcome does not further improve. However, a good knowledge of the relationship between effectiveness of treatments and costs, the geographical distribution and the accessibility to healthcare services are necessary to choose the minimum volumes of care, under which specific health procedures could not been provided in the NHS. Some potential biases due to the use of information systems data should also be considered. The different way of coding among hospitals could lead to a different selection of cases for some conditions. Regarding the definition of the exposure (volume of care), a possible bias could result from misclassification of health providers with high volume of activity. Performing the intervention in different departments/ units of the same hospital would result in an overestimation of the volume of care measured for hospital rather than for department/unit. For the conditions with a further fragmentation within the same structure, the association between volumes of discharge department and outcomes has also been evaluated. In this case, the two curves were different. The limit is to attribute the outcome to the discharge unit, which in case of surgery may not be the intervention unit. A similar bias could occur if the main determinant of the outcome of treatment was the caseload of each surgeon. The results of the analysis may be biased when different operators in the same hospital/unit carried out the same procedure. In any case, the observed association between volumes and outcome is very strong, and it is unlikely to be attributable to biases of the study design. Another aspect on which there is still little evidence is the interaction between volume of the hospital and of the surgeon. A MEDICARE study suggests that in some conditions, especially for specialized surgery, the effect of the surgeon's volume of activity is different depending on the structure volume, whereas it would not differ for some less specialized surgery conditions. The data here presented still show extremely fragmented volumes of both clinical and surgical areas, with a predominance of very low volume structures. Health systems operate, by definition, in a context of limited resources, especially when the amount of resources to allocate to the health system is reduced. In such conditions, the rationalization of the organization of health services based on the volume of care may make resources available to improve the effectiveness of interventions. The identification and certification of services and providers with high volume of activity can help to reduce differences in the access to non-effective procedures. To produce additional evidence to guide the reorganization of the national healthcare system, it will be necessary to design further primary studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of policies aimed at concentrating interventions in structures with high volumes of activity."

Clinical trials of varied quality have not demonstrated lasting and convincing protective effects through manipulation of cerebrospinal fluid production, diuresis, blood clot fibrinolysis, or manipulation of fibrosis in the subarachnoid compartment, although there remains some promise in the latter areas. Acetazolamide bolus seems to be useful for predicting shunt response in adults with hydrocephalus. Neuroprotection in the situation of established hydrocephalus has been tested experimentally beginning more recently. Therapies designed to modify blood flow or pulsation, reduce inflammation, reduce oxidative damage, or protect neurons are so far of limited success; more experimental work is needed in these areas. As has been recommended for preclinical studies in stroke and brain trauma, stringent conditions should be met for preclinical studies in hydrocephalus."

Thoracic epidural analgesia is associated with decreased morbidity in these patients. Thoracic epidural analgesia in cardiac surgery is associated with haemodynamic stability, decreased catecholamine response, good pulmonary function, early extubation and discharge from intensive care unit. It is an important component of fast tracking in cardiac surgery as well. Its use has significantly increased over the years and has been used as an adjuvant to general anaesthesia as well as the sole anaesthetic technique in selected groups of patients. Proper selection of patients for thoracic epidural analgesia is mandatory. Timing of epidural catheter insertion and removal should be judiciously selected. The risk of epidural hematoma secondary to anticoagulation or residual effects of antiplatelet drug that can be reduced by taking standard precautions. In conclusion thoracic epidural analgesia in high risk cardiac surgery might decrease pulmonary, cardiovascular or renal complications, provide excellent analgesia and allow early extubation."

Therefore, establishing an adequate analgesic regimen for thoracic surgery is critical. Thoracic paravertebral block or thoracic epidural analgesia is recommended as the first-choice therapies for postthoracotomy analgesia. When these techniques are either contraindicated or not possible, intercostal analgesia or intrathecal opioids are recommended. These techniques should be combined with nonopioid analgesics, such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors, administered on a regular ""round-the-clock"" basis, with opioids used as ""rescue"" analgesics. Finally, the integration of multimodal analgesia techniques with multidisciplinary rehabilitation program can enhance recovery, reduce hospital stay, and facilitate early convalescence."

CD006715,0,30011792,0,Role of Damage Associated Molecular Pattern Molecules (DAMPs) in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (aSAH).,"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) represents only a small portion of all strokes, but accounts for almost half of the deaths caused by stroke worldwide. Neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling can successfully obliterate the bleeding aneurysms, but ensuing complications such as cerebral vasospasm, acute and chronic hydrocephalus, seizures, cortical spreading depression, delayed ischemic neurological deficits, and delayed cerebral ischemia lead to poor clinical outcomes. The mechanisms leading to these complications are complex and poorly understood. Early brain injury resulting from transient global ischemia can release molecules that may be critical to initiate and sustain inflammatory response. Hence, the events during early brain injury can influence the occurrence of delayed brain injury. Since the damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) might be the initiators of inflammation in the pathophysiology of aSAH, so the aim of this review is to highlight their role in the context of aSAH from diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, and drug therapy monitoring perspectives. DAMPs represent a diverse and a heterogenous group of molecules derived from different compartments of cells upon injury. Here, we have reviewed the most important DAMPs molecules including high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), S100B, hemoglobin and its derivatives, extracellular matrix components, IL-1Î±, IL-33, and mitochondrial DNA in the context of aSAH and their role in post-aSAH complications and clinical outcome after aSAH."

A total of 328 TTTS patients with recipient twin cardiomyopathy who underwent fetoscopic surgery under epidural anesthesia were included. The exposure of interest was maternal medical therapy with nifedipine for the treatment of fetal cardiomyopathy. We found that intraoperative hypotension occurred in 53.4% (175/328 patients). There was no statistically significant difference in incidence of hypotension between nifedipine exposure and nonexposure groups (54.8% versus 50.8%, P = 0.479). However, the nifedipine exposure group received a statistically significant higher dose of phenylephrine (7.04 Â± 6.38âmcg/kg versus 4.70 Â± 4.14âmcg/kg, P = 0.018) and higher doses of other vasopressor, as counted by number of treatments (6.06 Â± 4.58 versus 4.96 Â± 3.42, P = 0.022). There were no statistically significant differences in acute fetal survival rate (within 5 days) and fetal survival rate at birth between hypotensive and nonhypotensive patients. We concluded that preoperative exposure to nifedipine resulted in increased intraoperative maternal vasopressor requirement during fetoscopic surgery under epidural anesthesia.

CD006715,0,27581316,0,Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and bleeding risks with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.,"OBJECTIVE Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement is a common procedure for the treatment of hydrocephalus following diverse neurosurgical conditions. Most of the patients present with other comorbidities and receive antiplatelet therapy, usually acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Despite its clinical relevance, the perioperative management of these patients has not been sufficiently investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the peri- and postoperative bleeding complication rates associated with ASA intake in patients undergoing VP shunt placement. METHODS Of 172 consecutive patients undergoing VP shunt placement between June 2009 and December 2015, 40 (23.3%) patients were receiving low-dose ASA treatment. The primary outcome measure was bleeding events in ASA users versus nonusers, whereas secondary outcome measures were postoperative cardiovascular events, hematological findings, morbidity, and mortality. A subgroup analysis was conducted in patients who discontinued ASA treatment for < 7 days (n = 4, ASA Group 1) and for â¥ 7 days (n = 36, ASA Group 2). RESULTS No statistically significant difference for bleeding events was observed between ASA users and nonusers (p = 0.30). Cardiovascular complications, surgical morbidity, and mortality did not differ significantly between the groups either. Moreover, there was no association between ASA discontinuation regimens (< 7 days and â¥ 7 days) and hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSIONS Given the lack of guidelines regarding perioperative management of neurosurgical patients with antiplatelet therapy, these findings elucidate one issue, showing comparable bleeding rates in ASA users and nonusers undergoing VP shunt placement."

CD006715,0,24492175,0,Spinal epidural hematoma during anticoagulant therapy for pulmonary embolism: postoperative complications in a patient with lung cancer.,"Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is rare but causes neurological disorders. Rapid diagnosis and treatment maximize neurological recovery. We present the case of SEH after lung cancer surgery under epidural and general anesthesia. A 64-year-old man underwent right upper lobectomy. Pulmonary embolism occurred on postoperative day 2. Anticoagulant therapy with fondaparinux and warfarin was started 2 hours after epidural catheter removal and he gradually recovered. On postoperative day 13, the level of prothrombin time-international normalized ratio reached 1.47 and fondaparinux administration was stopped. The next day, he developed back pain and paraplegia, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass between Th4 and Th7 compressing the spinal cord. Emergency decompression laminectomy and hematoma evacuation were performed. After 2.5 months of rehabilitation, he regained almost all motor function and sensation. Late after epidural anesthesia, attention should be paid to possible SEH even though appropriate anticoagulant therapy had been initiated after epidural catheter removal."

Complications such as cavitary thrombus possibly due to the hyper coagulability after off pump coronary artery bypass surgery have been described. Many clinicians use higher doses of heparin - up to 5 mg/kg in order to thwart this fear. Overall, there appears to be no consensus on the dose of heparin in off pump coronary artery bypass surgeries."
