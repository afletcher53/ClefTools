CD010526,0,8509736,0,Sealing ability of three materials used to repair lateral root perforations.,"Thirty-five extracted single-rooted human teeth were decoronalized, root filled with AH-26 and gutta-percha, and perforated at the apical one third level. Repairs of the lateral perforations were carried out with three materials: amalgam plus cavity varnish, EBA cement, and silver glass-ionomer cement. Negative controls were not perforated and positive controls had unrepaired perforations. The roots were then implanted subcutaneously in rats for 5 days to place the materials in a surgical environment. Following retrieval, the roots were placed in a solution containing 20 microCi/ml of calcium-45 for 7 days to measure microleakage. They were rinsed, sectioned, and autoradiographs of the repaired perforations were made. The autoradiographs were projected onto a screen and the extent of penetration of the radioisotope measured. Statistical analysis showed that the EBA cement group exhibited significantly less leakage than the silver glass-ionomer cement group (p < 0.05). No differences were found between the other groups. It was concluded that EBA cement provides a superior seal in lateral root perforations to silver glass-ionomer cement while amalgam was intermediate between the two."

CD010526,0,10434089,0,Effect of a fluoride varnish on demineralization adjacent to orthodontic brackets.,"Home fluoride regimens have long been used to reduce the amount of demineralization adjacent to orthodontic appliances. In the absence of patient compliance, another method of applying the fluoride must be used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in vitro, the ability of a fluoride varnish, Duraflor, to directly inhibit demineralization of enamel surrounding orthodontic brackets. Brackets were bonded to 36 extracted human canines and premolars with a traditional composite resin and randomly assigned to three equal groups of twelve. Group 1 served as the control with no topical application after bonding. Group 2 was treated with a single application of a nonfluoridated placebo varnish. Group 3 was treated with a single application of Duraflor. All groups were cycled in an artificial caries challenge for 1 hour two times daily for 37 days and were brushed with a medium bristled toothbrush to simulate mechanical wear of the varnish. Demineralization of enamel was evaluated in longitudinal buccolingual tooth sections using polarized light microscopy. Both average depth and area of demineralization were measured with a sonic digitizer. ANOVA (P </=. 0001) and Duncan's test (P </=.05) indicated significant differences in depth and area of demineralized enamel. Those teeth treated with Duraflor exhibited 50% less demineralization than the control teeth and an even greater difference when compared to the placebo group. Fluoride varnishes should be considered for use as a preventive adjunct to reduce enamel demineralization adjacent to orthodontic brackets, particularly in patients who exhibit poor compliance with oral hygiene and home fluoride use."
CD010526,0,1739506,1,The clinical performance of a glass polyalkenoate (glass ionomer) cement used in a 'sandwich' technique with a composite resin to restore Class II cavities.,"The use of glass polyalkenoate (GPA) cement in conjunction with composite resin using an acid etch technique is now well known and a 'sandwich' of tooth/GPA cement/composite resin has been recommended to form the cervical seal at the base of approximal boxes in Class II cavities. This paper reports on the 2-year results of a controlled clinical trial using a commercial GPA lining cement. The trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of this 'sandwich' technique. Sixty-four restorations in the mouths of 22 patients were evaluated during the 2.5 year period of the trial. The composite resin component of the restorations performed well. Five restorations failed, all in the region of the approximal box. Four failures were related to the exposed GPA cement component of the 'sandwich'. Failure was probably related to placement difficulties of the technique. The use of GPA cement laminated with composite resin when the GPA cement was enclosed within the final restoration appeared to be a successful technique."
CD010526,0,1803337,0,Amalgam buildups: shear strength and dentin sealing properties.,"The retentive strength and sealing properties of amalgam buildups were compared in vitro in three groups of specimens. All teeth were prepared with flat, nonretentive surfaces. In the first group, the amalgam buildups were retained by four self-threading Minim pins. In the second group, retention was provided by a circumferential slot prepared in the dentin just inside the DEJ. The third group utilized an adhesive resin for retention. Dentin permeability was measured as a hydraulic conductance before and after placement of the amalgam buildups and before and after thermocycling. All methods of retention sealed dentin very well even in the absence of cavity varnish. The 90 degree retentive strength was: pins, 10.3 +/- 0.9 MPa; slots, 4.1 +/- 0.5 MPa; resin, 3.1 +/- 0.8 MPa (mean +/- SEM)."

CD010526,0,1303376,0,Effect of tooth storage and cavity cleansing on cervical gap formation in Class II glass-ionomer/composite restorations.,"Class II cavities with the cervical margin just below the C-E junction and with two cervical retention grooves were prepared in intact human premolars, 31 cavities in teeth stored frozen and 29 cavities in teeth stored in 1% chloramine solution. The teeth from both storage conditions were assigned to two groups; in one group, the cavities were cleaned with a water spray, in the other group, with a cleaner containing 0.2% EDTA and 1% NaF. All cavities were lined with Vitrebond and restored with P50. Cervical contraction gaps were disclosed by a fluorescent resin penetration technique. The length and width of each gap were analysed. A contraction gap was revealed in 17 of the 31 cavities in teeth stored frozen (54.8%) and in 22 of the 29 restorations in the teeth stored in chloramine (75.8%). The width of the gap was significantly greater in teeth stored in chloramine (p = 0.0004). No statistical difference in gap formation was found between cavities cleaned with water or with the detergent containing 0.2% EDTA and sodium fluoride. Since the cavity cleansing procedure was not a significant factor in gap formation, apparently removing the superficial smear layer with the cavity cleaner does not impair the bonding of Vitrebond to the dentin. However, gap formation appeared to be significantly affected by the storage conditions of the extracted teeth. It is suggested that teeth to be used in bond strength and leakage experiments should be stored frozen rather than stored in 1% chloramine solution."

CD010526,0,25162722,0,Evaluation of tensile retention of Y-TZP crowns cemented on resin composite cores: effect of the cement and Y-TZP surface conditioning.,"This study evaluated the effect of the cement type (adhesive resin, self-adhesive, glass ionomer, and zinc phosphate) on the retention of crowns made of yttria-stabilized polycrystalline tetragonal zirconia (Y-TZP). Therefore, 108 freshly extracted molars were embedded in acrylic resin, perpendicular to their long axis, and prepared for full crowns: the crown preparations were removed and reconstructed using composite resin plus fiber posts with dimensions identical to the prepared dentin. The preparations were impressed using addition silicone, and Y-TZP copings were produced, which presented a special setup for the tensile testing. Cementation was performed with two adhesive resin cements (Multilink Automix, Ivoclar-Vivadent; RelyX ARC, 3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA), one self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX U100, 3M ESPE), one glass ionomer based cement (RelyX Luting, 3M ESPE), and one zinc phosphate cement (Cimento de Zinco, SS White, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). For the resin cement groups, the inner surfaces of the crowns were subjected to three surface treatments: cleaning with isopropyl alcohol, tribochemical silica coating, or application of a thin low-fusing glass porcelain layer plus silanization. After 24 hours, all groups were subjected to thermocycling (6000 cycles) and included in a special device for tensile testing in a universal testing machine to test the retention of the infrastructure. After testing, the failure modes of all samples were analyzed under a stereomicroscope. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the surface treatment and cement type (α=0.05) affected the tensile retention results. The Multilink cement presented the highest tensile retention values, but that result was not statistically different from RelyX ARC. The surface treatment was statistically relevant only for the Multilink cement. The cement choice was shown to be more important than the crown surface treatment for cementation of a Y-TZP crown to a composite resin substrate."
CD010526,0,2620286,0,[Evaluation of the effect of glass ionomer liner on microleakage of light-curing composite resin restoration].,"Light-curing composite resin restorations with acid etching technique and bonding agents cannot completely reduce the degree of microleakage. One initial report by Dr. Mclean (1985) describing glass ionomers as Class V cavity liners suggested that this product was superior to a resin/dentin bond to avert marginal leakage under a light curing composite. In this study, Wu's silver staining technique was used to evaluate the effect of glass ionomer liner on microleakage of light curing composite-Silux. Twenty one caries-free human molar teeth were selected for study. The Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal and the lingual surface of each tooth. Teeth were divided into 3 groups. Group I: Scotchbond/Silux and Liner/Scotchbond/Silux. Group II: Scotchbond/Silux and Hybond. Group III: Liner/Scotchbond/Silux and Hybond. The degree of microleakage were evaluated with Dr. Going's method by three dentists. The results of this study indicate that Ketac bond Glass ionomer liner was ineffective as a restoration in resisting microleakage on the gingival wall of cavities."

CD010526,0,17893878,0,Involvement of SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 axis in the enhanced peritoneal metastasis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma.,"Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) spreads by implantation of tumor cells onto the human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) lining the peritoneal cavity. The aim of this study was to determine whether the stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha)/CXCR4 axis is involved in the interaction of EOC cells with HPMCs in peritoneal metastasis. Clinically, we first evaluated CXCR4 expression in sections from 36 primary EOCs using immunohistochemistry. We next examined whether SDF-1alpha played roles in EOC progression, including in proliferation, cell motility, attachment to HPMCs, and the in vivo development of peritoneal metastasis through CXCR4. Of the 36 carcinomas, 16 cases (44.4%) were positive for CXCR4 immunoexpression. Positive CXCR4 expression significantly predicted poorer overall survival compared with negative expression (p = 0.0069). We found CXCR4 expression in both EOC cells and HPMCs. In contrast, the level of production of SDF-1alpha by HPMCs was higher than that by various EOC cells. Functionally, SDF-1alpha induced enhanced attachment between ES-2 cells and HPMCs or extracellular matrix components. The enhancement of adhesion potential by SDF-1alpha was inhibited by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, and by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and p44/42 inhibitors. Furthermore, intraperitoneal treatment with AMD3100 resulted in reduced dissemination in nude mice inoculated with ES-2 cells. The present results suggest that there may be a link between the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 axis and enhanced intraperitoneal dissemination of EOC and that CXCR4 may be a novel target for the treatment of EOC."

CD010526,0,16563433,0,"Filling small, empty protein cavities: structural and energetic consequences.","Most proteins contain small cavities that can be filled by replacing cavity-lining residues by larger ones. Since shortening mutations in hydrophobic cores tend to destabilize proteins, it is expected that cavity-filling mutations may conversely increase protein stability. We have filled three small cavities in apoflavodoxin and determined by NMR and equilibrium unfolding analysis their impact in protein structure and stability. The smallest cavity (14 A3) has been filled, at two different positions, with a variety of residues and, in all cases, the mutant proteins are locally unfolded, their structure and energetics resembling those of an equilibrium intermediate of the thermal unfolding of the wild-type protein. In contrast, two slightly larger cavities of 20 A3 and 21 A3 have been filled with Val to Ile or Val to Leu mutations and the mutants preserve both the native fold and the equilibrium unfolding mechanism. From the known relationship, observed in shortening mutations, between stability changes and the differential hydrophobicity of the exchanged residues and the volume of the cavities, the filling of these apoflavodoxin cavities is expected to stabilize the protein by approximately 1.5 kcal mol(-1). However, both urea and thermal denaturation analysis reveal much more modest stabilizations, ranging from 0.0 kcal mol(-1) to 0.6 kcal mol(-1), which reflects that the accommodation of single extra methyl groups in small cavities requires some rearrangement, necessarily destabilizing, that lowers the expected theoretical stabilization. As the size of these cavities is representative of that of the typical small, empty cavities found in most proteins, it seems unlikely that filling this type of cavities will give rise to large stabilizations."
CD010526,0,19995507,0,Influence of the experience of operator and assistant on the survival rate of proximal ART restorations: two-year results.,The objective of the study was to determine the influence of the experience of the operator and the assistant on the survival rate of proximal ART- restorations after 2 years when placed using two methods of tooth-isolation and three glass ionomer cement-brands.

CD010526,0,12131984,0,[Comparative study of the fracture resistance of sound upper premolars and upper premolars restored with bonded amalgam].,"The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine the fracture resistance of upper premolars which had received class II preparations (conservative and extensive) and were restored with bonded amalgam, with two different adhesive systems. Seventy teeth were divided in four groups: group 1 (control), with ten sound teeth; group 2, with twenty prepared teeth (10 teeth received conservative cavities and 10, extensive cavities) restored with amalgam without any kind of liner; groups 3 and 4, similar to group 2, though with linings of glass ionomer cement (Vitrebond - 3M) (group 3) and dental adhesive (Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus - 3M) (group 4). The teeth were previously fixed in PVC cylinders with acrylic resin. After being restored and thermocycled, the test specimens were submitted to fracture by means of compression in an EMIC-MEM 2000 universal testing machine. After the application of the analysis of variance and complementary Tukey's test, we concluded that the utilized adhesive systems produced an increase of the fracture resistance of teeth presenting with conventional cavities; the teeth presenting with conservative cavities were more resistant in all experimental situations."

CD010526,0,12216572,0,"The influence of a packable resin composite, conventional resin composite and amalgam on molar cuspal stiffness.","Packable resin composites may offer improved properties and clinical performance over conventional resin composites or dental amalgam. This in vitro study examined the cuspal stiffness of molars restored with a packable resin composite, a conventional posterior microfilled resin composite and amalgam. Forty-eight intact caries-free human third molars were distributed into four treatment groups (n=12) so that the mean cross-sectional areas of all groups were equal. Standardized MOD cavity preparations were made and specimens restored using one of four restorative materials: (1) a spherical particle amalgam (Tytin); (2) Tytin amalgam with a dentin adhesive liner (OptiBond Solo); (3) a conventional microfilled posterior resin composite (Heliomolar); (4) a packable posterior resin composite (Prodigy Posterior). Cuspal stiffness was measured using a Bionix 200 biomaterials testing machine (MTS). Specimens were loaded vertically to 300 N at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/minute. Stiffness was measured at 10 intervals: (1) prior to cavity preparation (intact); (2) following cavity preparation, but before restoration; (3) seven days after restoration; then (4) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months after restoration. All specimens were stored at 37 degrees C in deionized water throughout the study and thermocycled (5 degrees/55 degrees C; 2000 cycles) monthly for 12 months. Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed significant differences among treatment groups over time (p<0.0001). Cavity preparation reduced cuspal stiffness by more than 60%. At 12 months, the cuspal stiffness of restored teeth was, on average, 58% that of intact specimens. Neither the packable nor the conventional resin composite increased cuspal stiffness over that of amalgam."

CD010526,0,24240900,0,The effects of glass ionomer and flowable composite liners on the fracture resistance of open-sandwich class II restorations.,"This in vitro study aimed to investigate the effects of glass-ionomer and flowable composite liners on the fracture resistance of Class II amalgam and composite restorations. Group 1 cavities were restored with amalgam and Group 4 cavities with nanofill composite after the application of a dentin-bonding agent. For the remaining groups, light-cured-glass-ionomer liner was used in a gingival floor proximal box (Groups 2, 5) or flowable composite was used as a liner (Groups 3, 6), the remainder of the cavity was restored with amalgam (Groups 2, 3) or composite (Groups 5, 6). The restorations were loaded in compression to failure. The data was analyzed using Tukey's multiple comparison test. The fracture resistance was significantly higher (p<0.05) in Group 3 than in all other groups, except Group 2 (p>0.05). Flowable composite, glass-ionomer liners increased the fracture resistance of open-sandwich Class II amalgam restorations."
CD010526,0,11210246,0,Evaluation of Er:YAG laser and EDTAC on dentin adhesion of six endodontic sealers.,"The effect of Er:YAG laser application and EDTAC on the adhesion of epoxy resin-based endodontic sealers to human dentin was evaluated in vitro. A total of 99 extracted human maxillary molars with their crowns worn flat were used. The teeth were divided into 3 groups: group 1, the dentin surface received no treatment; group 2, EDTAC was applied to the dentin surface for 5 min; group 3, the dentin surface received Er:YAG laser application (2.25 W potency; 11 mm focal distance; 4 Hz frequency; 200 mJ energy; 62 J total energy; 313 mean impulse). Three teeth from each group were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy for changes in dentin surface. The epoxy resin root canal sealers used were: AH Plus, Topseal, Sealer 26, AH 26, and Sealer Plus. The zinc oxide eugenol-based sealer Fillcanal was used as control. Adhesion was measured with a Universal testing machine. The results showed a statistically significant difference at the level of 1% among the dentin treatments. The dentin treated with Er:YAG laser showed greater adhesion with the sealers than dentin treated with EDTAC which was greater than dentin that received no treatment. The Tukey test showed the formation of 5 groups in decreasing order of adhesion: AH Plus, Topseal and Sealer 26, AH 26, Sealer Plus, and Fillcanal (Grossman cement)."
CD010526,0,8229888,0,"Radiopacity of posterior composite resins, composite resin luting cements, and glass ionomer lining cements.","The radiopacities of seven posterior composite resins, seven composite resin luting cements, and six glass ionomer lining cements were studied. The purpose was to obtain an indication of radiopacity values of different brands within each of these three groups of materials and to show differences in radiopacities of composite resin inlay materials and their accompanying luting cements. On radiographs, the optical densities of standardized samples were determined and radiopacity values of the materials were expressed in millimeter equivalent aluminum. The composite resins observed displayed higher radiopacities than aluminum. A luting cement and a glass ionomer cement were shown to be less radiopaque than aluminum. Generally the radiopacity of composite resins appeared to be higher than their accompanying luting cements. If materials with substantial differences in radiopacity are used in combined applications for the restorative treatment of teeth, lower radiopacity can interfere with the diagnosis of caries and the detection of gaps near the restoration."
CD010526,0,15685608,0,Inflammatory cytokines reaction elicited by root-end filling materials.,"Cytokines are inflammation in the list of tissue reactions that cytokines control of cell and tissue growth, development, and differentiation. Root-end filling materials often contact with existing periapical tissue, and they need to be biocompatible with remnant periapical tissue. The aim of this study was to focus the effects of the root end filling materials on bone cell viability and expression of inflammatory cytokines and their role in maintaining health and stability of the restored dental tissues. Calcium hydroxide-based (Life), zinc oxide eugenol-based (Super EBA), and mineral trioxide aggregate-based (MTA) root-end filling materials were used to investigate their effect on a human osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS). The cell attachment assay was observed microscopically, and the expression of interleukin-2, -4, and -10 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Any resultant difference between the root-end filling material was analyzed statistically by one-way analysis of variance. The results showed that the best cell attachment to root-end filling material occurred with MTA. The IL-4 (0.824 +/- 0.396) and IL-10 (2.06 +/- 1.24) levels were greater for the MTA group, whereas IL-2 expression for the three kinds of root-end filling materials was similar. All materials were able to induce expression of inflammatory cytokines from cultured bone cells."

Although mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has been the material of choice for clot protection, it is easily displaced into the clot during condensation. The present study evaluated the effects of recently introduced calcium silicate cements (Biodentine and TheraCal LC) on the viability and osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) by comparing with MTA Angelus."

CD010526,0,15491087,0,Comparative evaluation of glass ionomer and resin based fissure sealant using noninvasive and invasive techniques--a SEM and microleakage study.,"The efficacy of using invasive and non-invasive techniques was assessed by Scanning electron microscopy, and by microleakage of Glass ionomer (GC VII, Fuji) and Resin based sealant (Helioseal-F, Ivoclar Vivadent). 100 young premolars were used for this study, and they were divided into four groups: Group I: non-invasive technique GC VII, Group II: Invasive GC VII, Group III: Non-Invasive Helioseal-F, Group IV: Invasive, Helioseal-F. 5 teeth from each group were evaluated under SEM. It was seen that the flow and adaptation of GC VII was slightly better than Helioseal F, and the invasive technique provided the best flow and adaptation. For microleakage analysis 5% methylene blue was used. It was seen that minimal microleakage was seen in Group IV (P<0.01). Considering the recent controversies using resin based sealants, it can be said that GC VII can be a viable alternative for pit and fissure sealants."
CD010526,0,10825836,0,Clinical evaluation of glutaraldehyde with calcium hydroxide and glutaraldehyde with zinc oxide eugenol in pulpotomy of primary molars.,The objectives of this study were to clinically evaluate the effectiveness of 2% buffered glutaraldehyde in pulpotomies of human primary molars and to compare the success rate of glutaraldehyde with calcium hydroxide and glutaraldehyde with zinc oxide eugenol as dressing material on the radicular pulp. Pulpotomies were completed on 61 primary molars in 19 children. The teeth were divided into two groups by random allocation. One group had a dressing of zinc oxide-eugenol base (IRM) incorporated with one drop of 2% buffered glutaraldehyde while the other group had a dressing of calcium hydroxide base incorporated with one drop of 2% buffered glutaraldehyde after the initial placement of 2% buffered glutaraldehyde on cotton pellet for 3 min. All teeth had light-curing compomer (Dyract) placed over the dressing material followed by a stainless steel crown restoration within 1 or 2 weeks after the pulpotomy. Blind clinical and radiographic evaluations of 57 teeth available after 12 months showed a success rate of 92.9% and 73.6% respectively. The clinical and radiographic success rates for glutaraldehyde/zinc oxide eugenol pulpotomies were 96.5% and 75.8% respectively while those for glutaraldehyde-calcium hydroxide were 89.2% and 71.4%. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups either clinically or radiographically. The overall clinical success rate suggested that 2% buffered glutaraldehyde was an effective agent in the pulpotomy of human primary molars.
CD010526,0,26499474,0,Morphology of sealant/enamel interface after surface treatment with bioactive glass.,"The purpose of this study was to analyze, by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the morphology of sealant/enamel interface after surface treatment with Biosilicate. Before pits and fissures sealing, the occlusal surfaces of 10 sound human molars were sectioned perpendicularly at the fissures in order to obtain three slices for each tooth. Slices were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 10) according to sealing protocol: Group 1- Acid etching + Biosilicate + glass ionomer-based sealant (Clinpro XT Varnish, 3M ESPE); Group 2- Acid etching + glass ionomer-based sealant (Clinpro XT Varnish, 3M ESPE); Group 3- No sealing. All slices were subjected to thermal cycling (5,000 cycles; 5-55°C; dwell time: 30s). Half of the slices from each group (n = 5) were analyzed by CLSM and the other half by SEM. Groups 1 and 2 were also submitted to EDS analysis and their data were evaluated by Two-Way ANOVA e Tukey's test (α=5%). EDS data analysis showed higher amounts of silicon (Si) ions than calcium (Ca) ions in Group 1 (P < 0.05); Group 2 presented higher amounts (P < 0.05) of Ca ions than Si ions. It may be concluded that the use of Biosilicate for surface treatment did not affect the morphology of glass ionomer-based sealant/enamel interfaces."

CD010526,0,16195790,0,"Influenza A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-lineage viruses in Finland: genetic diversity, epidemic activity and vaccination-induced antibody response.","The first sporadic cases of Fujian/411/02-lineage viruses were recorded in Finland in winter 2001-2002. The first protracted but low-intensity outbreak occurred here during the first half of 2003, and the second outbreak early in autumn 2003, after detection of sporadic influenza A cases in the summer. The calculated incidence of influenza A in the Finnish army was 515/10000 during the first outbreak and 2066/10000 during the second outbreak. During the 2003-2004 epidemic season, the isolates fell into three groups for their haemagglutinin (HA1) sequences. In groups I and II, the strains were reassortants which differed for their neuraminidase (NA) sequences from the viruses of the previous spring. Group II viruses, which predominated in Finland during the 2003-2004 season, were characterized by loss of the glycosylation site at position 126 in HA1. The relevance of this loss to the epidemiology is discussed, as well as the frequent appearance of codominant amino acid mixtures at position 151 lining the catalytic cavity of the NA. Group III viruses, genetically related to Wellington/1/2004, the drift variant predominant in 2004 in the southern hemisphere, caused some localized outbreaks in Finland towards the end of the 2003-2004 epidemic. The antigenic match between the vaccine virus (Panama/2007/99) and the Fujian-lineage epidemic viruses in winter 2003-2004 was far from optimal. Nevertheless, high levels of prevaccination and postvaccination antibodies to the predomi- nant group II virus were recorded.

CD010526,0,1882096,0,[Varnishes and adhesives in the seal of silver amalgam restorations].,"The object of this paper is to evaluate the marginal filtration occurring between restoration/teeth in cavities filled with silver alloy when using different cavity varnish and adhesives. In 50 teeth removed as a result of decay, cavities were prepaired on vestibular faces and were divided into 5 equal groups: Group A: with no caviti varnish; Group B: two coats of a linkin agent (Scotch Bond 3M); Group C: an amalgam liner base (Voco); Group D; two coats of copal varnish: Group E: an amalgam bond base (Carl San Remo, Germany). All groups were filled with a silver alloy. The teeth were inmersed in a fuchsin solution at different temperatures (17.37 degrees C and 50 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Longitudinal cuts were made for visualization under a stereoscopic magnifying glass. Each group was observed by five odontologists and was classified according to four categories: Grade I: no filtration: Grade II: less than 1/3 wall filtration; Grade III: more than 1/3 wall filtration; Grade IV: filtration in walls and floor. Teeth with pulp filtration were discarded. Total and percentage values were determined for each analysed group. The results revealed that: Group A: 100% of samples corresponds to Grade IV. Group B: 40% of sample falls within Grade II while the rest corresponds to the highest grade. Group C: 30% belongs to Grade II, 60% to Grade III and the remaining 10% to Grade IV; Group D: 30% falls within Grade I, while the remaining 20% and 50% correspond to Grades III and IV, respectively. Group E: 50% for Grade I and the rest in Grade II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010526,0,9353579,0,A clinical and microbiological study of deep carious lesions during stepwise excavation using long treatment intervals.,"Concern about the survival of microorganisms in deep carious lesions may often lead to unnecessary exposure of the pulp during final excavation. There are reasons, therefore, to initiate systematic studies on the alternative procedure known as stepwise excavation. Clinical evaluation of stepwise excavation was performed on 31 deep carious lesions considered to result in pulp perforation by traditional excavation. This study examines the clinical and microbiological alterations during the final excavation performed during long intervals (6-12 months) after the initial treatment that included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. The dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before application of a Ca(OH)2 compound and a temporary sealing for 6-12 months. Reassessments were performed before the after final excavation. Microbiological dentine samples were obtained in 19 randomly selected lesions by a sterile bur, transferred to and diluted in reduced transport fluid, and plated on tryptic soy agar. After anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 7 days, total colony-forming units per millilitre were counted from (1) peripheral excavated and hard dentine (control), (2) central demineralized dentine before and final excavation, and (3) central dentine after the final excavation. Six samples of central demineralized dentine were without any cultivable flora increasing to 9 samples after the final excavation. The clinical dentine changes occurring during stepwise excavation were characterized by enhanced hardness of the dentine which was associated with a marked reduction in bacterial growth after the final excavation. Despite the presence of bacteria in the excavated dentine none of the carious lesions resulted in pulp perforation, suggesting that the initial removal of the cariogenic biomass appears to be essential for control of caries progression. Stepwise excavation is not only an appropriate treatment of deep carious lesions but is also considered a suitable model for microbiological studies to determine the bacteria persisting in clinically excavated lesions."

CD010526,0,7988766,0,Fluoride release in vitro from various glass ionomer cements and resin composites after exposure to NaF solutions.,"The release of fluoride from 1) discs made from five glass ionomer cements and two composites, and 2) the same discs after exposure to different NaF solutions, were studied. The specimens were placed in distilled water for 10 wk. After 24 h and then once a week, the specimens were transferred to fresh distilled water. After 5 wk, the specimens were divided into four groups and exposed to 0, 0.02, 0.2 and 2% NaF solutions for 5 min. The fluoride release was highest during the first week after preparation, after which it decreased sharply and then more slowly. The amount of fluoride released was ordered: liner/base > restorative glass ionomer > composites. The composites released significantly less fluoride than the glass ionomer cements. After exposure to NaF, the fluoride release was significantly higher for the silver cermet material than for the other glass ionomers tested. From a clinical point of view, the results from this study imply that glass ionomer restorations may act as intraoral devices for the controlled slow release of fluoride at sites at risk for recurrent caries."

Estimated net costs per sealant were obtained from data on personnel time (measured with activity sampling), transportation, materials, instruments and equipment, and restoration costs for replacing failed sealants from a community trial involving 7- to 9-yr-old Chinese children. Cost data were standardized to reflect the placement of 1,000 sealants per group. Outcomes were the differences in the number of dentine caries lesions that developed between groups. The average sealant application time ranged from 5.40 min (for composite resin) to 8.09 min (for LED thermocured HVGIC), and the average cost per sealant for 1,000 performed per group (simulation sample) ranged from $US3.73 (for composite resin) to $US7.50 (for glass-carbomer). The incremental cost-effectiveness of LED thermocured HVGIC to prevent one additional caries lesion per 1,000 sealants performed was $US1,106 compared with composite resin. Sensitivity analyses showed that differences in the cost of materials across groups had minimal impact on the overall cost. Cost and effectiveness data enhance policymakers' ability to address issues of availability, access, and compliance associated with poor oral-health outcomes, particularly when large numbers of children are excluded from care, in economies where oral health services are still developing."

Eighty subjects participated in the study and, divided randomly into two equal groups in which one group was treated with the placebo varnish (Vivadent, Liechtenstein) for negative controls. Streptococcus mutans in saliva of the subject was sampled and enumerated by using the Dentocult-SM dip-slide technique for periods of one, two four and twelve weeks after a single varnish application. The results were evaluated statistically. After the chlorhexidine containing varnish treatment the levels of Streptococcus mutans in saliva were significantly reduced after one week (p < 0.01) and continued reduction for one month (p < 0.05). After twelve weeks Streptococcus mutans levels in saliva were given a relative increase. No significant suppression was found in the placebo group (p > 0.05). The results suggested that Cervitec varnish reduces salivary Streptococcus mutans levels and that the application should be repeated every 3 months to get antibacterial effect."
CD010526,0,19051855,0,Effects of total and selective bonding on marginal adaptation and microleakage of Class I resin composite restorations in vitro.,"This study assessed the marginal integrity and microleakage of standardized Class I resin composite restorations when placed with either ""total"" or ""selective bonding"" techniques. Sixty standardized Class I cavities comprising the main fissure system were prepared (9 mm length and 7 mm width). Cavity depth was set at 2.5 mm. In cavities where a glass ionomer liner was placed, the cavity was deepened by an additional 0.5 mm. In ""total bonding"" specimens, enamel and dentin were conditioned using a four-step adhesive system (Syntac Classic). In teeth with ""selective bonding,"" a chemical curing conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC; Ketac Fil) and light-curing resin-modified glass ionomer liner (RMGI; Vitrebond) or three-step adhesive bonding liner (Syntac) were applied. The cavity margins of the latter specimens were finished with water-spray, acid-etched and a bonding agent was applied. All restorations were placed in two oblique increments. Totally bonded ceramic inlays (Cerec) served as the control. All specimens were subjected to thermo-mechanical loading (1.2 Mio cycles) and marginal quality and microleakage were assessed. The highest percentage of margins rated as ""perfect"" was found in selective bonding samples with glass ionomer liners and totally bonded inlay restorations. All the other groups showed significantly decreased marginal quality (p < 0.05). The same results were found for the microleakage assessment. The authors of the current study concluded that the application of a GIC liner significantly improved the overall marginal adaptation of direct Class I restorations. The use of an adhesive bonding agent for cavity sealing as currently used is not recommended."

All teeth involved had periradicular radiolucent areas noted on radiographic examination and extra-oral sinus tracts appearing on the chin with exudation and unpleasant aesthetic appearance. The adopted treatment protocol included treating the sinus tract surface simultaneously with the root canal therapy. After root canal shaping using 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution, calcium hydroxide-based pastes associated with different vehicles were inserted into the root canal for 4 months, and were changed monthly. All the sinus tracts healed in 7 to 10 days. The apical lesions were completely repaired in a maximum period of 24 months. The treatment adopted provided a complete healing of the periapical lesions in a short follow-up period. Surgical repair of the cutaneous sinus tract was therefore unnecessary."

CD010526,0,21125881,0,Physical properties of resin-reinforced glass ionomer cement modified with micro and nano-hydroxyapatite.,"Hydroxyapatite is a biologically compatible material and a major component of dental enamel and bone tissue. Because of its biocompatibility and structural similarity to human teeth and the skeletal system, a number of dental studies have evaluated its application as a bone substitute or dental restorative material. This study was to evaluate the differences in bonding strength and resistance to demineralization between micro-hydroxyapatite and nano-hydroxyapatite added to self-cured resin-reinforced/modified glass ionomer cement. RelyX was used as the base glass ionomer cement material and for the control group. 10% micro-hydroxyapatite added glass ionomer cement was named experimental group 1, and 10% nano-hydroxyapatite added glass ionomer cement was named experimental group 2. Physical tests for ISO9917-1:2007 in each group was acceptable, except the setting time of nano-hydroxyapatite added glass ionomer cement, which exceeded maximum setting time. Bonding strength was greatest in nano-hydroxyapatite glass ionomer cement, and cohesive failure was common in all specimens. When fractured surface was observed under SEM, spherical particles were observed in experimental groups containing hydroxyapatite particles, and they were more prevalent in nano-HA added glass ionomer cement group than in micro-hydroxyapatite added group. Both experimental groups exhibited greater resistance to demineralization compared to the control group, and there was no significant difference between the experimental groups. Under SEM, nano-hydroxyapatite added glass ionomer cement exhibited increased resistance to demineralization compared to micro-hydroxyapatite added glass ionomer cement."
CD010526,0,29267662,0,Materials used for indirect pulp treatment in primary teeth: a mixed treatment comparisons meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to systematically review the literature to address the question regarding the influence of different materials in the clinical and radiographic success of indirect pulp treatment in primary teeth. A literature search was carried out for articles published prior to January 2017 in PubMed/MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Scopus, TRIP and ClinicalTrials databases; relevant articles included randomized clinical trials that compared materials used for indirect pulp treatment in primary teeth. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and extracted the data. The effects of each material on the outcome (clinical and radiographic failures) were analyzed using a mixed treatment comparisons meta-analysis. The ranking of treatments according to their probability of being the best choice was also calculated. From 1,088 potentially eligible studies, 11 were selected for full-text analysis, and 4 were included in the meta-analysis. In all papers, calcium hydroxide liner was used as the control group versus an adhesive system, resin-modified glass ionomer cement or placebo. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 48 months, with dropout rates of 0-25.7%. The material type did not significantly affect the risk of failure of the indirect pulp treatment. However, calcium hydroxide presented a higher probability of failure. In conclusion, there is no scientific evidence showing the superiority of any material used for indirect pulp treatment in primary teeth."
CD010526,0,11203864,0,Evaluation of dental adhesive systems with amalgam and resin composite restorations: comparison of microleakage and bond strength results.,"A variety of laboratory tests have been developed to assist in predicting the clinical performance of dental restorative materials. Additionally, more than one methodology is in use for many types of tests performed in vitro. This project assessed and compared results derived from two specific laboratory testing methods, one for bond strength and one for microleakage. Seven multi-purpose dental adhesives were tested with the two methodologies in both amalgam and resin composite restorations. Bond strength was determined with a punch-out method in sections of human molar dentin. Microleakage was analyzed with a digital imaging system (Image-Pro Plus, Version 1.3) to determine the extent of dye penetration in Class V preparations centered at the CEJ on both the buccal and lingual surfaces of human molar teeth. There were 32 treatment groups (n = 10); seven experimental (dental adhesives) and one control (copal varnish, 37% phosphoric acid) followed by restoration with either amalgam or resin composite. Specimens were thermocycled 500 times in 5 degrees and 55 degrees C water with a one-minute dwell time. Bond strength and microleakage values were determined for each group. ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls tests demonstrated an interaction between restorative material and adhesive system with a significant difference among adhesives (p < 0.05). Using a multi-purpose adhesive system resulted in both a statistically significant increase in bond strength and a statistically significant decrease in extent of microleakage (p < 0.05). The effect of the adhesive upon both microleakage and bond strength was greater in the resin composite restorations than in the amalgam restorations. Bond strength testing was more discriminating than microleakage evaluation in identifying differences among materials."

Seventy-six single-rooted, extracted human teeth were cleaned and shaped using a step-back technique. After root-end resection and ultrasonic preparation, 72 root sections were randomly allocated to three groups and filled with dental amalgam and cavity liner, Super-EBA, or MTA. Microleakage was assessed at 24 h, 72 h, 2 wk, 4 wk, 8 wk, and 12 wk, using a fluid filtration measurement system. MTA demonstrated excellent sealing ability throughout 12 wk of fluid immersion, comparable with that observed for Super-EBA. Microleakage in the MTA group, as well as the Super-EBA group, was significantly less (p < 0.05) than in the amalgam group at 24 h, 72 h, and 2 wk. At the subsequent periods, there were no significant differences among the three materials. In this study, MTA was determined to be superior to amalgam, and comparable with Super-EBA in preventing microleakage when used as a root-end filling."

Twenty-nine subjects (aged 20-30 years) participated in the study and were randomly assigned to one of three groups. In each subject two fissures with high levels of mutants streptococci were selected. The fissures in group 1 (control group) were treated with placebo varnish containing no chlorhexidine. Fissures in group 2 received a single application of 40% chlorhexidine varnish, whereas fissures in group 3 received an additional chlorhexidine varnish application 1 week after the first application. Fissure plaque samples were taken prior to the first application of chlorhexidine varnish and subsequently 1, 2, and 4 months thereafter. Compared with the fissures in the control group, the suppression of mutans streptococci was significant in plaques from group 2 for up to 2 months and in plaques from group 3 for up to 4 months after application. Mutans streptococci were suppressed more strongly in premolar than in molar teeth and more strongly and for a longer period of time in fissures of premolar teeth treated twice than in fissures of premolars treated once."

The canals of 60 palatal roots of first molars were obturated with gutta-percha and either a zinc oxide-eugenol-based or a resin-based sealer and reinstrumented: G1, EndoFill/hand files; G2, AH Plus/hand files; G3, EndoFill/ProTaper; G4, AH Plus/ProTaper. Roots were cleaved and examined with an optical microscope, and the amount of filling debris on canal walls was analyzed on digitized images. There was no significant difference (P > .05) among the root canal thirds within each group. G3 presented significantly more filling debris than G1 in the cervical third (P = .04). In the middle third, G2/G3/G4 showed more debris than G1 (P = .03). The techniques were similar (P = .64) in the apical third.

Forty Class II cavities were prepared on the mesial surface of extracted human maxillary first premolars and divided into two groups: Group I--direct composite restorations and Group II--indirect composite restorations. Groups I and II were further divided into subgroups: A (without cyclic loading) and B (with cyclic loading of 150,000 cycles at 60N). The gingival margin of the proximal box was evaluated at 200x magnification for marginal adaptation in a low vacuum scanning electron microscope. The restorations were sectioned perpendicular to the bonded surface into 1 mm thickslabs. The slabswere further trimmed at the interface to produce a cross-sectional surface area of approximately 1 mm2. All specimens were subjected to microtensile bond strength testing. The marginal adaptation was analyzed using descriptive studies and bond strength data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test. The indirect composite restorations performed better under cyclic loading."

A total of 60 extracted human maxillary and mandibular molars with their crowns ground flat were used. The teeth were divided into two groups: Group 1, the dentine surface received no treatment; Group 2, EDTA-C was applied to the dentine surface for 5 min. Ten samples were tested for each sealer and each group. Adhesion was measured with a Universal Testing Machine. Sealer 26 showed greater adhesion both with and without smear layer (p < 0.01). Ketac-Endo and Grossman sealers were statistically equal, having the lowest values of adhesion. Application of EDTA-C did not alter the adhesion of Ketac-Endo and Grossman sealers. However, the use of EDTA-C increased the adhesion of Sealer 26. The epoxy resin-based root canal sealer (Sealer 26) adhered better to dentine prepared with and without EDTA-C than glass-ionomer-based sealers and the zinc oxide eugenol-based (Ketac-Endo and Grossman) sealers."

Each group was evaluated with gingival margins situated in both enamel and cementum/dentin. Two hundred and forty Class II cavities were prepared in extracted third molars, half with gingival margins in enamel and half with margins in dentin/cementum. In groups of 30, restoration was undertaken with packable alone (3M Filtek P60), conventional alone (3M Z250), packable plus flowable liner (3M Filtek Flow) and conventional plus flowable liner. All used 37% phosphoric acid etch and Scotchbond 1 (3M) as the bonding system. After restoration, the teeth were thermocycled (between 5 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 60 degrees C) 1,500 times, soaked in 0.1% methylene blue, sectioned and microleakage from the gingival margin scored. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. There was no significant difference between systems in terms of leakage scores when gingival margins were situated in enamel (p=0.70). All restorations with margins in cementum/dentin leaked significantly more than those with margins in enamel (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between leakage scores of 3M Z250 and Filtek P60 with cementum/dentin gingival margins (p=0.68). Use of a flowable composite liner (3M Filtek Flow) against cementum/dentin was associated with increased microleakage (p<0.001). In this study, leakage scores suggest that gingival margins should be placed in enamel. The conventional and packable resin composites tested were not associated with differences in microleakage. Leakage data do not support the use of flowable resin composite linings in Class II resin composite restorations."

CD010526,0,11203780,0,The effect of additional enamel etching and a flowable composite to the interfacial integrity of Class II adhesive composite restorations.,"This in vitro study evaluated the interfacial integrity of Class II resin composite restorations. The influence of a flowable composite and additional enamel etching was also evaluated. Deep, saucer-shaped Class II cavities were prepared in the mesial and distal proximal surfaces of 25 extracted human molars and assigned to five treatment groups. The gingival margins were extended to approximately 1 mm above the CEJ in 40 cavities and below the CEJ in 10 cavities. The prepared cavities were then restored with a self-etching primer system (Clearfil Liner Bond II) and a hybrid resin composite (Clearfil AP-X), with and without a flowable composite (Protect Liner F) and additional enamel etching with 37% phosphoric acid gel (K-etchant). After finishing, polishing and thermocycling (4 and 60 degrees C, x300), the samples were longitudinally sectioned through the restorations and resin-tooth interfaces were observed directly under a laser scanning microscope. Statistical analysis indicated that the use of a flowable composite produced significantly more (p = 0.04) gap-free resin-dentin interfaces than teeth restored without the flowable composite. However, both flowable composite and enamel etching could not prevent gap formation at enamel-resin interfaces and crack formation on enamel walls."

A total of 50 pairs of Class I restorations were placed in 32 adult patients by one dentist in a self-matching prospective clinical trial. The paired teeth were divided into the TPH Spectrum/XenoIII (TS) restoration group and the Synergy Compact/One Coat (SC) restoration group according to a random number table. Application of the materials followed the manufacturer's instructions. The restorations were evaluated by two independent evaluators using US Public Health Service (USPHS)-Ryge modified criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using the McNemar's test with Yates' continuity correction. After three years, 40 pairs of restorations were available for evaluation. Four TS and two SC restorations failed due to fracture. Only one TS-restored tooth showed postoperative sensitivity at baseline and the symptom disappeared one week later. Alpha ratings of TS vs SC restorations were as follows: 95% vs 98% for color match, 85% vs 88% for marginal integrity, 88% vs 90% for anatomical form, 85% vs 83% for marginal discoloration, 88% vs 93% for occlusal contact. For both materials, Alpha ratings were 88% for surface texture. The three-year clinical performances of the two restorative materials were satisfactory and not significantly different for each of the parameters evaluated."

CD010526,0,9569992,0,Inhibition by glass-ionomer cements of protein synthesis by human gingival fibroblasts in continuous culture.,"The effects of several glass-ionomer cements (Baseline and Chem Fil of De Trey; Ketac Fil and Ketac Bond of ESPE; Vitrebond and Vitremer of 3 M) on the protein synthesis of cultured gingival fibroblasts were studied. The presence of cements in the culture medium inhibited protein synthesis, although the relative effectiveness varied significantly. The cements tested have been ranked in three groups, group A (Chem Fil and Ketac Fil), group B (Ketac Bond and Baseline) and group C (Vitrebond and Vitremer), showing 50, 75 and 100% reduction in protein synthesis, respectively. Incubation of cells with medium previously conditioned by Baseline and Ketac Fil caused only transient inhibition of protein synthesis followed by almost complete recovery. This recovery was not observed when the medium was conditioned with Vitrebond. A characterization of the factors determining the inhibitory effect of one cement in each group was attempted. The cements, irrespective of the type, produced small but reproducible decreases in the pH of the medium but released fluoride ions to a different extent. Both changes in the pH of the medium and in the fluoride concentration inhibited protein synthesis by cultured gingival fibroblasts. The different action of cements can be explained, at least in part, by a differing release of fluoride ions."

Seventy extracted human single-rooted anterior teeth were instrumented and the root canals obturated with laterally condensed gutta-percha and sealer. The apical 3 mm of each root was resected and a 2 mm-deep apical Class I preparation cut. The roots were then randomly allocated to six groups of 10 teeth and retrofilled with one of the experiment materials. Group I comprised high-copper amalgam; group 2, high-copper amalgam with cavity varnish; group 3, glass ionomer cement without varnish; group 4, glass ionomer cement with varnish; group 5, silver glass ionomer cement without varnish; and group 6, silver glass ionomer cement with varnish. Two groups of five roots each were used as positive and negative controls. The root surfaces were coated with nail polish and specimens immersed in 2% methylene blue solution for 14 days. After vertical sectioning, dye penetration was examined under a stereomicroscope. The results of the study were analysed statistically. The sealing ability of the conventional glass ionomer cement with varnish was significantly better while dye penetration was higher in silver glass ionomer cement without varnish group than the other groups (P < 0.01)."

Following root canal obturation, 27 teeth were divided into three experimental groups and each group was subjected to one of the three following filling techniques: (a) cold-burnishing of gutta-percha; (b) amalgam reverse filling; and (c) amalgam reverse filling in conjunction with cavity varnish. The remaining nine teeth served as controls (4). The teeth were placed in methylene blue dye for a period of 1 wk, after which they were retrieved, washed, sectioned, and the apical dye penetration measured. The results showed that amalgam with cavity varnish demonstrated less dye penetration than the other experimental groups. The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.0001)."

MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was comprised of several experimental groups: 1) Dental luting cements (glass ionomer cement, methacrylate-based resin cement, zinc-oxide eugenol cement, eugenol-free zinc oxide cement; 2) titanium discs; and 3) titanium combination cement discs. The disks were submerged in bacterial suspensions of either Fn or Pi. Planktonic bacterial growth within the test media was measured by determining the optical density of the cultures (OD600). Mean and standard deviations were calculated for planktonic growth from three separate experiments. RESULTS Intergroup comparison of all experimental groups revealed increased growth of Pi associated with cement-titanium specimens in comparison with cement specimens. Regarding the comparison of all groups for Fn, there was an increased amount of bacterial growth in cement-titanium specimens although the increase was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The combination of cement with titanium may exacerbate the bacterial growth capacity of Pi and Fn in contrast to their sole effect."

Forty-five extracted human maxillary central incisors treated with conventional endodontic therapy with laterally condensed gutta percha and sealer were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Cavit base, (2) IRM base and (3) no base. In groups 1 and 2, a 3.5 mm thickness of base material was placed at the time of obturation. After storage in saline for 1 week, the teeth were bleached with a mixture of 35% hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate, combined with a 10% methylene blue dye solution, using a combination thermocatalytic and non-thermocatalytic bleaching technique. The apical distance of dye penetration was measured. The control group demonstrated dye penetration to the apex, indicating that a base is required to prevent leakage of bleaching agents when this combination of bleaching techniques is used. The mean distance of leakage was 3.43 mm (+/- 1.14) for the Cavit group and 5.94 mm (+/- 1.72) for the IRM group. Analysis with a t-test revealed that Cavit was a more effective barrier to leakage than IRM (T = 4.20, P less than 0.001)."
CD010526,0,2086297,0,Surface reactions of adhesives on dentin.,"The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the surface chemistry of dentin following various adhesive treatments. The coronal parts of sound freshly extracted third molars were cross-sectioned over the pulp chambers, each producing a pair of dentin samples which were polished to 600 grit and cleaned with 3% H2O2. The first sample of each pair was used as a control, while the second one was subjected to one of the following adhesive treatments: (a) Gluma Cleanser, (b) Tenure Conditioner, (c) Scotchprep, (d) Gluma Cleanser/Gluma Primer, (e) Tenure Conditioner/Tenure Solution A&B, or (f) Scotchprep/Scotchbond 2 Adhesive. The treated samples paired with their respective controls were studied by small-area ESCA spectroscopy. Three areas of 1.0 mm in diameter randomly chosen on each sample were analyzed by survey and C1s, O1s, N1s high-resolution spectra. The samples from groups d, e, and f were additionally subjected to argon-ion-depth profiling of the uppermost 2-nm layer at 0.5-nm intervals. According to the results, treatment modes a, b, and c caused the reduction of carbonates and increased the -NH/NH2 ratio. Treatments a and c increased the alcohol groups, while treatments b and c increased the carbonyl and ether groups. All these changes were in comparison to the reference dentin specimens. Dentin treatment with d, e, and f induced a complex in depth distribution of the C, N, O binding states. The energy shifts detected do not indicate primary bonding of the tested adhesives to the dental substrate."
CD010526,0,9011846,0,Fatigue of resin-bonded amalgam restorations.,"Standardized MOD cavities were prepared in 80 human premolars, which were treated with either adhesive resin or copal varnish and then restored with amalgam. Fracture resistance of these groups was compared after 24 hours of storage, 4 weeks of storage with thermocycling, and after 500 days of storage. The buccal cusps were loaded at an angle of 30 degrees to the tooth long axis until fracture occurred. Additionally, survival curves were compared for adhesive resin and copal varnish groups that had been repeatedly load cycled until fracture occurred. The 24-hour adhesive resin group was significantly stronger than the corresponding copal varnish group (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences between adhesive resin and copal varnish were found for the other thermocycling, extended 500-day storage, or load cycling tests. In conclusion, the strengthening effect of an adhesive resin on teeth restored with MOD amalgam restorations was transient."

Materials were compared regarding setting time, pH variation, radiopacity, solubility, dimensional changes, flow and release of chemical elements. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test (α=0.05). Longer setting time and higher dimensional changes and solubility values were exhibited by 1:0.65 and 1:0.5 ratios (p<0.05). The 1:0.5 and 1:0.65 ratios exhibited the highest pH values at all time points. All materials exhibited high radiopacity values. Significant differences were found only between 1:0.5 and 1:1 ratios for calcium and zinc release (p<0.05), whereas the amount of zirconium was similar among all groups (p>0.05). Considering the evaluated proprieties, combinations of Calen® paste with ZO at 1:0.5 and 1:0.65 ratios had the best results as root canal filling materials for use in primary teeth."

Results were compared to retention of cast crowns over amalgam cores. Retention was measured with an Instron Testing Machine. Location of cement failure during separation was recorded. Surface hardness of each group was compared. Retention of cast crowns cemented with zinc phosphate over amalgam cores was significantly higher than that of any of the resin core groups (ANOVA, P less than 0.05, Sheffe Contrast). There was no significant difference in final casting retention cemented over hybrid or conventional resin cores exposed to ZOE (13.625 vs 14.125 Kg). Final casting retention differences were not significant between the three interim cement groups. Final retention of all groups exposed to an interim luting agent were significantly less than the composite control groups. The use of CaOH, as an interim luting agent for acrylic crowns over hybrid cores compared to ZOE or NOG, should afford significantly greater retention with no adverse effect on the retention of the final casting. While the surface hardness of both types of composite resin was adversely affected by exposure to interim luting agents as compared to controls, there was no correlation between final casting retention values and surface hardness of polished composite. The interim cements invariably failed at the interim acrylic crown interface while the zinc phosphate cement failed at the core interface."
CD010526,0,11203849,0,Bonded amalgam restorations: using a glass-ionomer as an adhesive liner.,"Due to the lack of adhesiveness of amalgam to tooth structure, several adhesive cements have been utilized in bonded amalgam restorations. This study evaluated whether Fuji-II glass-ionomer cement is an appropriate adhesive liner in bonded amalgam restorations. Two adhesive composite luting cements (Amalgambond Plus and Panavia-21) and Copalite cavity liner were compared. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first part, we quantitatively assessed the tensile bond strengths as well as the failure modes of amalgam bonded to human dentin, using different adhesive liners. In each group, the flat dentin surface was treated with the assigned adhesive cement with a Teflon mold, followed by condensation of amalgam (Valiant PhD) onto it. Each group's mean tensile bond strengths were recorded and the statistical analysis by one way ANOVA showed no significant differences among groups (p > 0.05). Similar to the fracture patterns of the Amalgambond Plus and Panavia-21 groups, the failure mode of Fuji-II group was predominantly adhesive fracture. In the second part, the fracture strengths of amalgam restored teeth were measured using different adhesive liners. Standard MOD cavities were prepared in each tooth except for the intact tooth group. After treatment with the assigned adhesives or varnish, the cavities were restored with amalgam. Fracture strengths were then measured and the fractured interfaces examined using a scanning electron microscope. The fracture strengths of the intact tooth, Amalgambond Plus, Panavia-21 and Fuji-II groups were significantly higher than those of the Copalite and prepared cavity without restoration groups (p < 0.01). Accordingly, Fuji-II glass-ionomer cement, when used as an adhesive liner of amalgam restoration, may effectively reinforce the remaining tooth structure and, therefore, enhance the fracture resistance of the amalgam-restored teeth."

The SBS test was carried out by bonding cylinders of Dispersalloy amalgam to human dentine with an intermediate layer of Amalgambond Plus, All-Bond 2, Imperva Bond/Dual or Scotch Bond Multi-Purpose was first placed. Thereafter the samples were tested to failure in the shear mode. For the microleakage test, standardized class V cavities were prepared in human molars with one cavo margin abutting enamel and another dentine/cementum. Amalgam was condensed into the cavities, pretreated with one of the products mentioned above. In addition two further groups were prepared. One receiving treatment with Polyvar varnish and the other remained untreated as the control. Microleakage was assessed with a reflecting light microscope using I.S.O. criteria and the fracture sites and marginal gaps were examined in a scanning electron microscope. Results indicate that All-Bond 2 and Amalgambond Plus induced similar SBS and Scotchbond Multi-Purpose the weakest. At both enamel and dentine/cementum junctions resin bonding agents reduced microleakage. However, this reduction was greater at the enamel interface than at the other. Varnish allowed the greatest amount of marginal leakage and leakage was similar to the untreated control. Amalgam bonding agents are more effective at preventing marginal leakage at the enamel margin than at the dentine/cementum margin. Cavity varnish is not effective in preventing microleakage around amalgam restorations. There is a correlation between shear bond strength and marginal leakage. Materials giving the highest shear bond strength also exhibited the least marginal leakage. All-Bond 2, Amalgambond Plus and Imperva Bond/Dual are recommended to improve the seal around amalgam restorations."

CD010526,0,1389340,0,Microleakage evaluation in amalgam restorations used with bases.,"Marginal leakage in amalgam restorations often precedes the development of secondary caries. One potential way to improve the marginal seal of such restorations, and thus minimize the risk of caries development, is to apply a glass-ionomer base prior to amalgam placement. This study compared microleakage resistance among amalgam restorations placed with and without light-cured glass-ionomer base materials. Preparations were made in extracted human molar teeth. Four groups were studied, including copal varnish, which was used as a control. All specimens were restored with amalgam. Results indicated significantly greater leakage at the cavity wall/base interface for restorations with a copal varnish cavity liner than for those with a glass-ionomer base. Leakage differences among bases were also found at the amalgam/base interface. Best results were obtained with a dual-cure resin-based system. These samples showed minimal leakage at both the cavity wall/base and the base/amalgam interfaces. These findings suggest that light-cured glass-ionomer bases can be effective in the prevention of microleakage in amalgam restorations."

Forty human premolars were prepared for all-ceramic zirconia crowns with a 1 mm circumferential finish line and a 1.5 mm occlusal reduction. The crowns (n = 10 per group) from each zirconia system were randomly divided into 2 groups and cemented either with GIC (Vivaglass CEM) or MDP-RC (Panavia F 2.0) cement. The cemented crowns were thermocycled 5000 times (5°-55°C). The crowns were immersed in 0.5% basic fuchsine dye solution for 24 hours and sectioned buccolingually and mesiodistally. Specimens were examined under optical microscope (100X). Data were analyzed using Student t-test and chi-square tests (α = 0.05). Mean marginal gap values for Cercon (85 ± 11.4 μm) were significantly higher than for DC-Zircon (75.3 ± 13.2 μm) (P = 0.018). The mean cement thickness values of GIC (81.7 ± 13.9 μm) and MDP-RC (78.5 ± 12.5 μm) were not significantly different (P = 0.447). Microleakage scores did not demonstrate significant difference between GIC (P = 0.385) and MDP-RC (P = 0.631) under Cercon or DC-Zircon.

Part I: direct composite/composite inlay/ceramic inlay.,"This study investigated the degree of dye penetration with three different types of tooth-coloured restorations. Twenty-four intact extracted molars were collected. The teeth were immediately stored in water at room temperature. Class II cavity preparations were prepared and restored with three different types of tooth-coloured restorations: A, composite resin in the incremental technique; B, composite inlay technique; and C, ceramic inlay. Specimens were subjected to 700 cycles of thermal stress. They were than immersed in 2% basic fuchsin dye. The teeth were sectioned in three planes before being ranked as to the amount of dye penetration. The highest score obtained on three plano-parallel sections was adopted as the representative value. The three groups were compared using the Kruskal Wallis non-parametric test. Dye penetration was significantly lower at the enamel margins when using the composite inlay system and the incremental technique compared to the ceramic inlay technique. The restorations placed using the composite inlay technique showed less dye penetration than the incremental technique at the dentine margins (P < 0.017)."

Results indicated that significant differences occurred in their K1c's from the lowest to the highest in the following groups of materials, (i) buffered glass ionomer, (ii) zinc phosphate, glass ionomer, zinc polycarboxylate, and alloy mixed glass ionomer, (iii) microfilled resin, and (iv) conventionally filled resin. All materials except the microfilled resin, which fractured via crack jumping, fractured via smooth crack advance. Filler debonding without any crack inhibiting process was related to materials with low K1c values. The incorporation of either buffering compounds or alloy particles into glass ionomer had no beneficial effect upon fracture toughness. This was in contrast to microfilled and conventionally filled resins where either crack blunting or crack pinning processes, respectively, were likely involved with their increased K1c's. For microfilled resin, distinct radial zones positioned around the chevron apex and characterized by plastically deformed deposited material were related to distinct crack jumps that occurred in the load versus displacement behavior. Finally, for the two remaining materials of zinc phosphate and polycarboxylate, particle cleavage and matrix debonding for the former and shear yielding for the latter occurred."

Class II cavities randomly divided into four groups: Group I-Filtek with Filtek Flow lining; Group II-Filtek; Group III-Tetric Ceram with Tetric Flow lining; Group IV-Tetric Ceram. After thermocycling tests (5-60 x 1500) and dye soaking, the teeth were sectioned in a mesiodistal direction along their longitudinal axis. Gingival-marginal microleakage and internal voids in three separate portions of the restoration (interface, cervical and occlusal voids) were observed with a microscope. Statistical analyses indicated that the use of flowable resin composites (Groups I and III) provided a reduction in marginal microleakage and a reduction in some parts of the internal voids or total voids (p<0.05). The condensable material (Filtek) in combination with the flowable liner showed fewer voids (interface, occlusal, total) than the hybrid resin (Tetric) (p<0.05). There was a correlation between the number of internal voids or total voids and the marginal microleakage (p<0.05). It was concluded that a composite lining in a Class II resin composite with margins below the cementoenamel junction may reduce marginal microleakage and voids in the interface and the total number of voids in the restoration."

Subsequent to enamel preparation and removal of the central biomass, infected dentine was sampled from the cavity floor. Ten cavities each were either covered with the 1% chlorhexidine- and 1% thymol-containing varnish Cervitec (CE), the demeclocycline hydrocortisone-containing ointment Ledermix (LE) or received no treatment as control (CO). A compomer composite was used as intermediate restorative. Cavities were reassessed after 6 weeks and again dentine samples were microbiologically investigated for total viable counts, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. After 6 weeks a significant reduction of the total viable counts was observed in the LE group (p = 0.011) compared to the control, whereas no differences were found in the CE group (p > 0.05). Mutans streptococci were rarely recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks. Compared to the CO group counts of lactobacilli were significantly reduced in the CE and LE groups (p < 0.05). Lactobacillus species were frequently recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks of observation. Lactobacillus rhamnosus was the predominant species in all samples investigated. Application of CE or LE resulted in reduced counts of lactobacilli after a period of 6 weeks. Although none of the materials completely eliminated the viable microorganisms, the use of LE was more effective than CE in reducing the total anaerobic microorganisms associated with carious dentine."

In this study, the hypotheses tested were that long-term survival of E. faecalis is dependent on (1) the type of endodontic sealer and (2) the capacity for microbial gelatinase activity, a potential ""virulence"" trait identified previously in clinical isolates. Root canals of extracted human canines (n=95) were inoculated with either E. faecalis OG1RF or its gelatinase-negative mutant E. faecalis TX5128. After 48 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C, canals were obturated with gutta-percha and either the epoxy-resin-based AH-Plus (Dentsply, De Trey, Konstanz, Germany), the silicone-based RoekoSeal (Coltène/Whaledent, Langenau, Germany), or zinc oxide eugenol-based Roth's sealer (Root Canal Cement Type 801; Roth International Ltd, Chicago, IL). Access cavities were sealed. After 8 months of incubation at 37 degrees C, viable E. faecalis was recovered from more teeth sealed with RoekoSeal (95%) compared with AH-Plus (40%) (p=0.0004, Fisher's exact test) and Roth's sealer (45%) (p=0.0012, Fisher's exact test). In the RoekoSeal groups, viable counts of E. faecalis OG1RF were higher than E. faecalis TX5128 (p=0.03, Mann-Whitney U test) suggesting that gelatinase activity plays a role in long-term survival of E. faecalis in obturated root canals."

CD010526,0,11203837,0,Microleakage of bonded amalgam restorations: effect of thermal cycling.,"This study examined the effect of thermal cycling on the microleakage of bonded amalgam restorations. Three dental amalgam alloys and a gallium alloy were tested with two adhesive resin systems and copal varnish as a control. Class V cavity preparations were prepared on 168 freshly extracted premolars or molars. The preparations were placed parallel to and 1.0 mm occlusal to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). Four groups of 42 teeth each were treated with one of the following adhesive dentin systems: Bond-It, All-Bond 2/Resinomer or a copal varnish (Copalite). The four groups of 42 teeth each were then restored with one of three dental amalgams: Orosphere Plus, Indiloy, Oralloy or a Gallium alloy (Galloy), resulting in 12 test groups of 14 teeth each. The specimens were stored in double distilled water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Final contouring and polishing of the restorations were performed under water spray. Half of the restorations in each group were thermocycled for 3000 cycles (5 degrees C-37 degrees C-55 degrees C-37 degrees C) with a dwell time of 15 sec at each temperature. The other half were stored in double distilled water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Then all 168 restorations were stained with dye, sectioned and scored for microleakage. Results showed that the adhesive dentin systems reduced microleakage in amalgam restorations compared to copal varnish only in non-thermocycled specimens. Statistical analysis of the results showed that there was an extremely significant difference (p < 0.001) in microleakage between the non-thermocycled and the thermocycled specimens in all test groups, whereas, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) among thermocycled specimens. The reduction of microleakage was not significantly different between Bond-It and All-Bond 2/Resinomer in non-thermocycled specimens. Oralloy showed the most microleakage in the non-thermocycled groups when compared to the other alloys using the same adhesive liner."

Even after the Sade's principles' of the complete disease clearance, adequate lowering of the facial ridge, good meatoplasty and closure of the perforation of the tympanic membrane are fallowed, the complete healing of tike mastoid cavity is sometimes net the end result. According to various surgeons, the incidence of discharging mastoid cavity after a open cavity mastoid surgery is between /0-60%-H The usual techniques of obliteration of the mastoid cavity to decrease the size of the mastoid cavity, unusually has good healing results due to good vascularity. The failure ta the early detectmn 0/disease recurrence and risk of sudden appearance of intra-cranial complications are the most important disadvantages of the technique. We undertook a study in SO randomly chosen patients of Unsafe CSOM. Twenty five underwent obliteration of the mastoid cavity with Periosteo-Temporofascial flap, which is based on branches of posterior auricular artery and rest twenty five underwent non-obliteration of the mastoid cavity. Tfie results between the two groups were compared in terms of healing of the mastoid cavity and hearing gain after operation. Very good results in terms of healing of the cavity were seen after obliteration surgery. The rate of healing of the cavity was much faster after obliteration. The additional advantage with the flap is the see-through character of the cavity lining, which would lead to early detection of the disease recurrence. No significant increase in the hearing was seen in the obliterated patients as compared to non-obliterated cases."

CD010526,0,25183493,0,Immediate endodontic access cavity sealing: fundamentals of a new restorative technique.,"Endodontic access cavity sealing is conventionally performed after endodontic irrigation, referred to as delayed endodontic sealing (DES). Evidence shows that endodontic irrigation with NaOCl decreases dentinal bond quality and could cause coronal leakage. Access cavity sealing before endodontic irrigation is a new restorative approach, referred to as immediate endodontic sealing (IES). The primary aim of this in vitro study was to investigate whether IES improved internal adaptation. The secondary aim was to investigate the influence of the viscosity of the composite used to seal the dentine, on the internal adaptation in both IES and DES groups. Third molars (n= 40) with fully developed apices were used. The teeth were prepared into standard Class II MO cavities, and divided in 4 groups according to the approach, and composite viscosity was used for sealing. Group 1: IES + low viscosity composite; group 2: IES + high viscosity composite; group 3: DES + low viscosity composite; and group 4: DES + high viscosity composite. Samples were then sectioned axially for observation using scanning electron microscopy. Outcome was evaluated by determining the internal adaptation of the samples, which was judged based on the percentage of a continuous margin at the tooth-composite interface. The results were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney test. IES groups exhibited significantly greater internal adaptation (p = 0.000) as compared with DES groups. Composite viscosity did not significantly affect internal adaptation in either IES or DES groups (p > 0.005)."

Occlusal cavities were prepared in 40 sound extracted human premolars, divided into two equal groups. In the first group a chemically cured calcium hydroxide (Dycal, De Trey Dentsply, Konstanz, FRG) was placed as a base. In the second group a new light-cured calcium hydroxide product (Prisma VLC Dycal, De Trey Dentsply) was used. The restorations were completed with an acid-etched, incrementally placed composite resin. The specimens were sectioned vertically and debrided. A replica was made of each half-tooth. The interfaces between composite resin/base and base/dentine were viewed and photographed in the SEM. The marginal adaptation at these two interfaces was classified into three categories according to the extent of the gaps that were observed. Prisma VLC Dycal base was found to be pulled away from the dentine floor of the cavity as a result of an apparent adhesion to the composite resin during polymerization contraction. Dycal was better adapted to the cavity floor than Prisma VLC Dycal. Disorganization of the resin-bonded Prisma VLC Dycal was minimal even after acid etching the enamel, sectioning and ultrasonic debridement. Dycal appeared to be more friable, and occasionally exhibited marked disorganization as a result of these procedures."

Six root-treated extracted human premolars per group, with four different restorative configurations with and without adhesive fiber posts, were evaluated. Another group of six premolars, ""revitalized"" by using diluted horse serum to simulate pulpal fluid and restored with adhesive composite onlays, served as the control. Marginal adaptation before and after long-term occlusal loading (1,200,000 occlusal loading cycles at max 49 N) was assessed by using the replica technique and quantitative evaluation in SEM at 200x magnification. The number of lost restorations was recorded after loading. Fracture resistance and fracture patterns were evaluated by using a universal-testing machine on the fatigued samples. No significant differences (p > 0.05) between groups were detected before and after loading for the percentage of ""continuous margin"" at the total marginal length. Loading had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on the percentage of ""continuous margin"" for the total marginal length of two groups only. No significant difference (p > 0.05) for fracture resistance was detected and no lost restorations were observed.

A conventional glass ionomer lining (Ketac-bond) and two light cured linings (Vitrabond and Timeline) were evaluated with respect to their ability to reduce microleakage. Seventy two Class V cavities were restored either by a bulk fill or incremental fill technique, and following restoration, half the teeth were thermocycled in artificial saliva. Dye penetration, using a Procion orange dye was recorded along the gingival dentine wall and at the occlusal enamel margin for all teeth. The results showed significant differences in leakage along the gingival dentine wall between the various linings under all conditions. Vitrabond produced significantly less leakage than Ketac bond which in turn produced significantly less leakage than Timeline. Significant differences in microleakage were noted between the thermocycled and non-thermocycled groups. Little or no significant differences in leakage were shown between the bulk filled and incremental filled teeth."

CD010526,0,19811511,0,Contradictions in the treatment of traumatic dental injuries and ways to proceed in dental trauma research.,"Almost all treatment procedures used for dental traumas are still today not evidence-based, a fact, which makes it difficult to analyse the long-term outcome of healing and its relationship to treatment. Crown fractures with extensive dentin exposure represent a dominant injury in the permanent dentition. Accepted treatment philosophy is dentin coverage (dental liner and/or dentin bonded restoration) to prevent bacteria penetration into the pulp. Today there is, apart from deep proximal fractures, no evidence that this treatment is necessary to protect the pulp. In case of luxation injuries, the accepted treatment principles appear to be anatomically correct repositioning, stabilization with a splint and sometimes antibiotic coverage. In clinical studies, these principles could not be proven to optimize either periodontal or pulpal healing, the explanation possibly being that both reposition and application of splints in certain cases add extra damage to the pulp and periodontal ligament. In case of root fractures with dislocation, fast and optimal repositioning and rigid long-term splinting (i.e. 3 months) have been considered the principle of treatment. However, a recent clinical study has shown that short-term splinting with a semi-rigid splint appears to optimize fracture healing. In tooth avulsion with subsequent replantation, cleansing of the root surface for contamination and systemic antibiotics has been considered essential for pulp and periodontal healing. These treatment concepts have been derived from experimental studies in animals. However, their importance could not be verified in large clinical studies. Ideally, randomized clinical studies are needed in the future for selected trauma types. The influences of repositioning, splinting and the role of infection and antibiotics should be further investigated. However, for ethical reasons, it will be difficult to perform randomized studies on trauma victims and we will be forced in the future to rely on experimental animal studies supported by clinical observational studies."

CD010526,0,11931139,0,Amalgam repair: evaluation of bond strength and microleakage.,"This study evaluated the tensile bond strength of ""repaired"" amalgams and compared the degree of microleakage. Amalgam (Cavex avalloy) was condensed into plastic tubes (3 mm in diameter, 10 mm in height) to the half-length. After storage in water at 37 degrees C for two days, the remaining parts of tubes were filled with amalgam (A), cavity varnish (CV)+A, Liner Bond 2V (LB2V)+A, 3M Opal Luting Cement (3MOLC)+A, Panavia F(PF)+A, Metabond(MB)+A, Fuji BondLC(FB)+A, HytacOSB(HOSB)+Hytac Aplitip (H), Liner Bond2V+Clearfil AP-X(CAP). The bond strengths for 15 samples of each restoration group were determined. For the microleakage study, MOD cavities of 90 extracted human premolars were used. The distal half of cavities were filled with amalgam. After storage in water at 37 degrees C for two days, the mesial half of the cavities were filled to simulate a clinical repair. The ""repair"" was placed using the procedures applied in the bond strength study. The teeth were stained with basic fuchsine (0.5%), sectioned and evaluated for dye penetration. In both parts of study, the data were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range tests. Bond strength values (MPa) were: A+PF+A 3.84+/-1.08, A+LB2V+A 3.15+/-0.97, A+LB2V+CAP 3.05+/-0.53, A+MB+A 2.86+/-0.88, A+HOSB+H 2.58+/-0.51, A+3MOLC+A 2.11+/-0.75, A+FB+A 0.68+/-0.59. The repaired A+A and A+CV+A groups were separated before testing. The A+PF+A group showed the highest bond strength (p<0.05). Microleakage in the cervical margins of repaired restorations was lower in the amalgam groups than microleakage in the resin composite and compomer groups. PF, MB, 3MOLC and FB performed better at the amalgam ""repair"" interface. The A+LB2V+A group showed no microleakage at both the occlusal and gingival test regions."
CD010526,0,17062744,0,Minimizing dentinal fluid flow associated with gap formation.,"The relationship between gap formation and outward fluid flow and procedures to minimize both phenomena were investigated in extracted human premolars restored in vitro with MOD composite restorations. We hypothesized that either glass-ionomer cement (GIC) liners or low-shrinkage composite could reduce fluid flow related to gap formation. Two groups restored with bonding agents with either high- or low-shrinkage resin composites, and 2 groups restored by either conventional or light-cured GIC liner plus resin composite were compared (8 teeth/group). Fluid flow was measured with an automated apparatus. Baseline fluid flow was low and unchanged after bonding, but increased sharply (though transiently) after teeth were lined with GIC. Outward flow was significantly greater with conventional than with light-cured GIC. Inward fluid flow occurred during light-curing, followed by extensive, prolonged outward flow after curing. Low-shrinkage composite or GIC liners reduced gap formation and limited outward fluid flow. GIC liners promoted outward fluid flow during their setting reactions."

Standardized nonundercut V-shaped Class V cavities with gingival margins below the cementoenamel junction were prepared on the mesial and distal surfaces of 40 molars, establishing a total of 80 cavities, which were randomly divided into four groups. Each was lined with glass ionomers: group 1, Ketac-Bond (ESPE-Premier), which served as the control; group 2, XR-Ionomer (Kerr); group 3, XR-Ionomer with polyacrylic acid (PAA) pretreatment (Kerr); and group 4, Vitrabond (3M). Specimens were thermocycled for 300 cycles in 0.5% aqueous solution of basic fuchsin between 4 and 55 C with a 1-minute dwell time, and individually embedded in an epoxy resin. Statistical analysis indicated no differences among groups using the light-cured glass ionomer (groups 2 to 4), and they showed significantly less leakage than the control (group 1) at P less than 0.00001). Removal of the smear layer using 10% polyacrylic acid solution did not influence microleakage in restorations with light-cured glass ionomer liners."

CD010526,0,1067724,0,Reaction of the human dental pulp to silver amalgam restorations. The modifying effect of treatment with calcium hydroxide.,"Cavities were prepared in 43 bicuspid teeth using two general categories of cavity depth. In the ""deep"" cavities the bottom was placed in the inner third of the dentin. In the ""intermediate depth"" cavities the bottom was positioned in the middle third of the dentin. The bottom of the cavities was either rubbed with calcium hydroxide, covered with calcium hydroxide, or left unlined before filling according to the wet amalgam technique. The teeth were extracted after 1 week and examined histologically. All cases, except 2 with deep and 1 with intermediate depth rubbed cavities, showed local vascular dilatation in the pulp underneath the cavity. In addition, all teeth with deep unlined cavities showed inflammatory cells as did 1 with an intermediate depth unlined cavity. There were fewer displaced odontoblast nuclei in the dentin in the calcium hydroxide-treated groups. The milder reactions in the rubbed or covered groups are probably due to the restrictive effect by calcium hydroxide on penetration of amalgam components. In the teeth with deep cavities there were only minor differences between the ones which had been rubbed and those which had been covered with calcium hydroxide."

The following products and measures were tested: 1) glass ionomer cement (GIC) applied by dentist; 2) same material applied by short term (3 days) trained personnel (teachers); 3) application of a 0.5% HF solution three times; 4) an established autopolymerized resin based sealant (Delton). The study was performed in Bangkok, Thailand, a city in a developing country experiencing increasing caries prevalence. Children with at least three sound permanent molars from two age groups, 7-8 and 12-13-yr-olds respectively were chosen from very low to medium socioeconomic level families. 1264 children were systematically assigned to experiment or control groups based on school and DMFT. For the younger age group, the 2 yr mean DFS occlusal increment in the Control group was 0.66 surfaces. Significantly lower increments were observed in the GIC experimental group: 0.17 surfaces applied by the teachers and 0.32 applied by dentist, corresponding to 74% and 52% reductions, respectively. The mean increment in the HF group was 0.44 surfaces, a 33% reduction in relation to the Control group. For the 12-13-yr-olds, the mean occlusal surface DF increment was 0.70 surfaces in the Control group. Almost no occlusal increment was found in the Delton group, 0.05 DFS, a 93% reduction. In the GIC Dentist group, the DFS increment was 0.48 and in the Teacher group 0.56, corresponding to 31% and 20% reduction, respectively.

Fourteen primary and 14 permanent molars were obtained. Conservative modified MO and DO preparations were placed in half the teeth; conventional MO and DO preparations were placed in the remaining teeth. Randomly, a glass-ionomer liner was placed over the exposed dentin in one preparation of each tooth, a calcium hydroxide liner was placed in the remaining preparations. Posterior resin composite was placed in all teeth, and the teeth were loaded with a 17-kg force. Teeth were thermocycled, stored in 37 degrees C water, then immersed in 50% silver nitrate solution and placed in developer. The teeth were sectioned and photographed. Microleakage was calculated according to the depth of dye penetration, on a 6-degree scale. Results demonstrated the conservative modified restorations and conventional restorations, when glass-ionomer liner was used, to have less marginal microleakage, in both primary and permanent teeth, than their calcium hydroxide counterparts."
CD010526,0,11357569,0,Influence of different transitional restorations on the fracture resistance of premolar teeth.,"Controversy exists over the most favorable material and type of restoration to be used to transitionally restore teeth destined to be crowned. This in vitro study uses fracture resistance testing to compare eight different transitional restorations in maxillary premolars. Ninety sound maxillary premolars were randomly selected and allocated to nine groups, each comprising 10 teeth. One group remained unrestored and was used as the control. Teeth in the remaining groups were prepared to a standard cavity form using: a copy milling process removing the palatal cusp. Restorations were placed using amalgam with dentin pins and cavity varnish; amalgam with an amalgam bonding agent; resin composite with dentin pins and a dentin bonding agent; resin composite with a dentin bonding agent only; resin-modified glass ionomer with dentin pins; resin-modified glass ionomer cement alone and cermet with dentin pins and cermet alone. Each restored tooth was then subjected to axial loading via a bar contacting the buccal and restored palatal cusps until failure of the restored tooth occurred. The mean load-to-fracture values were statistically compared and the modes of failure recorded. It was found that the choice of restorative material and type of restoration had little effect on the fracture resistance of the restored tooth with the exception of those teeth restored with reinforced glass ionomer cement alone, which exhibited a significantly lower resistance to fracture than the other restored teeth. However, the choice of restorative material/technique did influence the mode of failure. Failure in teeth restored with resin-modified glass ionomer cement alone produced the least damage to the remaining tooth tissue when failure occurred. Consequently, this material may offer the most favorable range of properties for the transitional restoration of extensively broken-down maxillary premolar teeth destined to be crowned. Furthermore, the findings of this study fail to support the use of dentin pins in the placement of bonded build-up restorations."
CD010526,0,21047091,0,Water in the polar and nonpolar cavities of the protein interleukin-1β.,"Water in the protein interior serves important structural and functional roles and is also increasingly recognized as a relevant factor in drug binding. The nonpolar cavity in the protein interleukin-1β has been reported to be filled by water on the basis of some experiments and simulations and to be empty on the basis of others. Here we study the thermodynamics of filling the central nonpolar cavity and the four polar cavities of interleukin-1β by molecular dynamics simulation. We use different water models (TIP3P and SPC/E) and protein force fields (amber94 and amber03) to calculate the semigrand partition functions term by term that quantify the hydration equilibria. We consistently find that water in the central nonpolar cavity is thermodynamically unstable, independent of force field and water model. The apparent reason is the relatively small size of the cavity, with a volume less than ∼80 Å(3). Our results are consistent with the most recent X-ray crystallographic and simulation studies but disagree with an earlier interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments probing protein-water interactions. We show that, at least semiquantitatively, the measured nuclear Overhauser effects indicating the proximity of water to the methyl groups lining the nonpolar cavity can, in all likelihood, be attributed to interactions with buried and surface water molecules near the cavity. The same methods applied to determine the occupancy of the polar cavities show that they are filled by the same number of water molecules observed in crystallography, thereby validating the theoretical and simulation methods used to study the water occupancy in the nonpolar protein cavity."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the interfacial adaptation to enamel and dentin of modified Class II open RMGIC/RC sandwich restorations and the influence of different light curing techniques and matrix bands. Forty box-shaped Class II fillings were placed in vivo in premolars scheduled for extraction after one month. In groups I and II, a metal matrix was used; RC was inserted with horizontal (group I) and diagonal (group II) increments and cured with indirect/direct light. Group III was performed as group II, but a transparent matrix was used. Group IV was as group II, but with a separating liner between RMGIC and RC. Group V was a closed sandwich restoration. Interfacial quality was studied using SEM replica technique. Gap-free interfacial adaptation to enamel was observed for RMGIC in 70%, for RC in 70% and to dentin for RMGIC in 81%, for RC in 56%. No significant differences were seen between the experimental groups. At the cervical margins, RMGIC showed significantly better adaptation to enamel than RC, 74% and 42%, respectively. In conclusion, the investigated restorations showed a high percentage of gap-free interfacial adaptation in vivo. Interfacial adaptation to dentin and to cervical enamel was significantly better for RMGIC than for RC."

Twenty-four human canines were prepared, 1 mm from the apex, with K-files up to size 50, by means of the step-back technique. Six lateral canals were then drilled in each tooth, with size 10 file fixed to a low-speed handpiece. The teeth were randomly divided into 4 groups, and root canals were obturated either with the Endométhasoneregister mark or target sealer or Grossman sealer, prepared at ideal or incorrect clinical consistency. After obturation by means of the lateral condensation technique, the teeth were radiographed and evaluated as to the number of sealed lateral canals. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) between the tested sealers, and indicated the higher capacity of the well-manipulated Grossman sealer to fill lateral canals. It can be concluded that the flow rate of a sealer and its correct manipulation are very important for the satisfactory obturation of lateral canals."

CD010526,0,1817578,0,In vitro tensile bond strengths of amalgam to treated dentin.,"Since amalgam traditionally relies on undercuts in the tooth preparation for retention, extensive tooth structure must be removed for amalgam core build-ups. In contrast, the ideal build-up material would achieve its retention by directly bonding to tooth structure. This study compared tensile bond strengths of amalgam to dentin using All-Bond Liner-FX with three different dentin pretreatment conditions and Amalgambond according to the manufacturer's directions. One hundred and twenty dentin samples were tested. Groups 1-3 used All-Bond Liner-FX as a bonding agent. Group 1 received a 15-second application of 10 percent phosphoric acid on the dentin; Group 2 received the recommended dentin conditioner; and Group 3 received no dentin pretreatment. Group 4 used Amalgambond as the bonding agent after a 10-second application of 10 percent citric acid/3 percent ferric chloride. Analysis of the data was conducted using both ANOVA and the Weibull statistic. Results of the analysis of variance indicate that there were no statistical differences among mean tensile bond strengths for the three dentin pretreatment conditions using All-Bond. All (30) of the Amalgambond specimens debonded prior to testing. The All-Bond fracture data was well described by the Weibull function as evidenced by the high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.98-0.99). Fracture analysis indicated that all of the Amalgambond failures were adhesive at the Amalgambond-amalgam interface. All-Bond fractures were mixed cohesive/adhesive failures indicating similar bonding to amalgam and dentin."

In addition, the effects of a total-etch and self-etch adhesive on postoperative sensitivity were also compared. Patients who had moderate to deep occlusal caries of at least one molar were recruited. Overall, 103 restorations were placed in 70 participants, with an average age of 22.8 +/- 3.8 years. Preoperatively, each tooth was evaluated for cold-stimulated tooth sensitivity using a visual analog scale. If present, tooth sensitivity induced by cold/hot drinks or occlusal function was also noted. Caries was stained with a caries detector dye, then removed using slow-speed burs and hand excavators. The cavity was restored with one of four randomly allocated restorative procedures: 1) bonded with a two-step, total-etch adhesive (Single Bond 2); 2) lined with a resin-modified GIC liner (Fuji Lining LC), then bonded with total-etch adhesive; 3) bonded with a two-step, self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond) and 4) lined with the GIC liner, then bonded with self-etch adhesive. The cavities were incrementally filled with a nanofilled hybrid resin composite. At recall, postoperative sensitivity was evaluated at one week and one month. Overall, postoperative sensitivity in daily function was rare. No significant difference in postoperative sensitivity, either in daily function or in response to a cold stimulus, was observed between the restorative procedures with or without the GIC liner, regardless of the adhesive used (p > 0.05). In addition, no difference in postoperative sensitivity was noted between use of the self-etch and total-etch adhesive."

One hundred premolar teeth were prepared with a standardized, minimal two-surface cavity and randomly ascribed to ten equal groups. The cavities were restored by use of one of ten different material/technique combinations. Restored teeth were sealed to within 1 mm of the restoration margins with nail varnish prior to the immersion of the crowns in 5% (buffered) eosin for 48 h. The teeth were then hemisected longitudinally, in a mesio-distal plane, through the midline of the restoration by means of a diamond disc with water coolant, and one half of each tooth was then photographed. The transparencies were examined by image analysis programmed to facilitate calculation of the percentage of the tooth/restoration interface and of the crown dentin exhibiting dye penetration. Light- and chemically-cured glass-ionomer-based restorations showed similar amounts of leakage when expressed as a percentage area of crown dentin. This was significantly (p less than 0.05) less than that shown by cavities both etched and bonded. Cavities restored without enamel etching or involving the use of a bonding system exhibited significantly (p less than 0.05) greatest leakage."

The experiments were performed on 80 vital human teeth from patients ranging in age from 12 to 54 years. The experimental teeth were arbitrarily divided into the following 4 groups. Group CRCS: 20 cases treated with CRCS (Hygienic, Akron, Ohio, USA). Group KEZ: 20 cases treated with Dentalis KEZ (Neo Dental Chemical Products, Tokyo, Japan). Group CE: 20 cases treated with calcium hydroxide eugenol (positive control) Group E: 20 cases treated with pure eugenol (negative control). After local anesthesia, the experimental teeth were isolated with rubber dums or cotton rolls. Following preparation of Black's simple class 1 cavities with a diamond instrument mounted high-speed air turbine, the pulp was intentionally exposed by means of a steel bur mounted electric engine. The cavity and exposed pulp surface were cleaned with saline and dried on absorbent material. Then the experimental materials (agents) were applied to exposed pulp surface. The cavity was lined with gutta-percha temporally stopping, and the remainder was filled with silver amalgam. The teeth were clinically observed at various intervals from immediately to 530 days after treatment and then extracted under local anesthesia and prepared for histopathological study. Decalcified sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 1) CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS: During the observation period, symptoms occurred in the following: Group CRCS: 4 (20%) out of 20 cases. Group KEZ: 4 (20%) out of 20 cases. Group CE: 6 (30%) out of 20 cases. Group E: None of 20 cases No spontaneous pain was observed in these groups. 2) Clinical evaluations Group: CRCS: 16 cases (80%) were good, 3 cases (15%) were satisfactory, and 1 cases (5%) were failure. Group KEZ: 16 cases (80%) were good, 1 cases (5%) were satisfactory, and 3 cases (15%) were failure. Group CE: 14 cases (70%) were good, 4 cases (20%) were satisfactory, and 2 cases (10%) were failure. Group E: 20 cases (100%) were good. 3) Histopathological observations. Various kinds and degree of pulp changes were occurred in each group. Hyperemia and round-cell infiltration resulting from damage caused by treatment and medicaments were frequent in each group. No suppurative inflammation occurred in group CE. Pulp cicatrization and apposition of dentin on pulp chamber walls were observed frequently in each groups. Hard tissue formation was observed in numerous cases of group CE and in some cases in group CRCS and KEZ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD010526,0,8710706,0,Mechanical properties and clinical performance of a gallium restorative material.,"In a combination clinical/laboratory evaluation, a gallium restorative alloy (Galloy) was assessed for six mechanical properties: compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, creep, hardness, wear, and dimensional change. Laboratory tests indicated that the gallium alloy was similar to either Tytin or Dispersalloy in most respects, with the exception of lower wear and higher 7-day diametral tensile strength. In the clinical trial, all Galloy restorations were lined with a resin to prevent moisture contacting the material during the first hours after placement. All gallium restorations--class 1's only--were intact, and no teeth were fractured at the end of 1 year. There was little difference found at the 1-year evaluation compared to the 6-month results. The surface of the gallium alloy was generally rough, and many restorations exhibited some tarnish on the surface. It should be pointed out that this product has not been FDA approved at the present time and is not on the market."

CD010526,0,23343804,0,Clinical and ultrastructural effects of different liners/restorative materials on deep carious dentin: a randomized clinical trial.,"We evaluated the effect of calcium hydroxide cement (CHC) and glass ionomer cement (GIC) on carious dentin and bacterial infections after partial caries removal and sealing. Sixty permanent teeth with deep lesions underwent partial caries removal, the application of CHC, GIC or wax, i.e. negative control (NC), and were then sealed for 3-4 months. After the partial caries removal and the sealing period, the dentin was clinically assessed (colour and consistency) and analysed by scanning electron microscopy to assess dentin organization and bacterial infections. The effect of the treatment in each group was assessed by the Wilcoxon and χ2 tests, differences among groups by the Kruskal-Wallis test and the correlations between variables by Spearman correlation. No clinical symptoms or radiographic signals of pulpits or pulp necrosis were observed during the study. Dentin darkening was observed after the sealing period in the CHC and NC groups (p < 0.05). However, there was no difference in the colour after treatment among the 3 groups (p > 0.05). Dentin hardening occurred in all groups after treatment (p < 0.05), also with no differences (p > 0.05). Dentin samples showed better organization after the sealing period than after partial caries removal, with total or partial obliteration of dentinal tubules (CHC p < 0.03, GIC p < 0.05, NC p < 0.01) and a reduction of bacterial infections (CHC p < 0.03, GIC p < 0.05, NC p < 0.03). No differences were observed. Correlations between the different criteria, except for colour and bacterial infection, were detected in all cases. Partial caries removal and sealing resulted in dentin hardening, decreased bacterial numbers and dentin reorganization, irrespective of the dentin protection used."
CD010526,0,2081956,0,Root canal sealer cytotoxicity on human gingival fibroblasts. 1. Zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealers.,"The cytotoxicity of six different zinc oxide-eugenol root canal sealers was tested by determining the incorporation of [L-14C]leucine in human gingival fibroblasts that had been in contact with root canal sealers after setting for 24 and 48 h. The biopsies were obtained from healthy patients. In some cases there was a significant difference shown in the fibroblasts' protein synthesis ([L-14C]leucine incorporation) between the group that was coveted with fibroblasts 24 h and the group that was covered 48 h after mixing (p less than 0.05). The fibroblasts were cultured with the different sealers for 21 days. In the 24-h group, Pulp Canal Sealer showed initially moderate cytotoxic potential but, after 13 days, fibroblast recovery was noticeable. Tubli-Seal, Endoseal, Hermetic, Proco-Sol, and Wach's Formula showed slight recovery at the end phase of the test. Hermetic and Endoseal showed also in the 48-h group a similar development as in the 24-h group. A relative low cytotoxicity was observed with Tubli-Seal, Proco-Sol, Pulp Canal Sealer, and Wach's Formula at the beginning of the test period. Pulp Canal Sealer showed at the middle phase of the trial a toxic increase, but after the 15th day recovery of the fibroblasts was noticed. In this group constant toxic potential increase was observed with Wach's Formula and Tubli-Seal."
CD010526,0,19363973,0,"Effect of fiber nets, application techniques and flowable composites on microleakage and the effect of fiber nets on polymerization shrinkage in class II MOD cavities.","This study evaluated the effects of fiber nets and application techniques and flowable composites as a liner on microleakage and the effects of fiber nets on polymerization shrinkage in Class II MOD cavities. Standard MOD cavities were performed in 80 extracted third molars. The teeth were randomly divided into eight groups (n=10). Group 1: Filtek Supreme XT (bulk technique) (FSB); Group 2: Filtek Supreme XT (incremental technique) (FSI); Group 3: Filtek Supreme XT Flow (FS Flow)+FSB; Group 4: FS Flow+FSI; Group 5: FS Flow+Ribbond (R)+FSB; Group 6: FS Flow+R+FSI; Group 7: FS Flow+everStick NET (E)+FSB; Group 8: FS Flow+(E)+FSI. All the teeth were then immersed in 0.5% basic fuchsin solution for 24 hours after thermocycling for 1000 cycles (5 degrees C and 55 degrees C). The teeth were sectioned longitudinally and observed under a stereomicroscope. In order to determine the polymerization shrinkage, another study was designed. In Group A, composite was applied as a bulk. In Group B, the resin composite was divided into two parts and Ribbond fiber was placed in the middle of the mass. In Group C, everStick NET fiber was placed inside the composite, as in Group B. Statistical analysis were performed by using one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests for both microleakage and polymerization shrinkage (p < 0.05). Less microleakage was observed in groups where composites were applied by the incremental technique compared with those where the bulk technique was used (p < 0.05). The groups that used flowable composites showed significantly lower microleakage (p < 0.05). In groups where fiber nets were used, a significant decrease was determined in terms of microleakage (p < 0.05). Groups with fiber nets exhibited lower polymerization shrinkage (p < 0.05). Fiber nets decreased both microleakage and polymerization shrinkage. The incremental technique is an effective method for Class II composite restorations."
CD010526,0,2375848,0,Microleakage of glass ionomer/composite laminate Class V restorations.,"The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects on microleakage of pretreating dentin with polyacrylic acid (PAA), prior to placing a glass ionomer base/composite laminate restoration. Class V erosion-type lesions with the incisal margin on enamel and the cervical margin below the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ), were prepared in 50 sound extracted teeth. These teeth were divided into five dentin treatment groups: A) 10% PAA; B) 20% PAA; C) and D) 40% PAA; E) no dentin preconditioning. In groups A, B, C and E, a glass ionomer base was placed within 1 mm of the margins. In group D the glass ionomer base extended to the cervical margin. The glass ionomer base and the incisal enamel were etched with 37% phosphoric acid prior to placing a bonding agent and restoring with a composite. The restorations were finished and polished and the teeth were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 7 days. They were thermocycled in 0.5% fuchsin dye for 500 cycles (5 degrees C to 60 degrees C), embedded in epoxy resin, and sectioned at 250 mu intervals through the restorations. The section of each tooth exhibiting the most severe dye penetration along the tooth/restoration interface was evaluated and scored both incisally and cervically: 0 = no leakage; 1 = leakage up to the glass ionomer base; 2 = leakage up to 1/2 the wall length; 3 = leakage exceeding 1/2 the wall length. Cervically, the median leakage for all groups was 3.0. Incisally, the median leakage for all the groups was 0.0.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010526,0,8006968,0,Chloride masks effects of opposing positive charges in Hb A and Hb Hinsdale (beta 139 Asn-->Lys) that can modulate cooperativity as well as oxygen affinity.,"In the human hemoglobin variant Hb Hinsdale, lysine is substituted for asparagine at position beta 139 (H17), which lies in the water-filled cavity that runs through the center of the molecule. This substitution adds two extra cationic residues to the excess of four cationic residues normally lining this cavity. Moo-Penn and colleagues who discovered this hemoglobin, found its oxygen affinity in 0.5 M bis-Tris buffer to be lower than that of Hb A. Their finding conflicted with our prediction that additional cationic groups lining the central cavity would destabilize the T-structure by increased electrostatic repulsion and thereby increase the oxygen affinity. We have, therefore, remeasured the ligand-binding properties of Hb Hinsdale. In chloride-free Hepes buffer, Hb Hinsdale has greatly increased oxygen affinity and lower cooperativity than Hb A. A comparison of the properties of Hb A, Hb Hinsdale, Hb Deer Lodge (beta 2 His-->Arg) and Hb Abruzzo (beta 143 His-->Arg) in 0.05 M Hepes versus 0.05 M bis-Tris buffers shows that very low chloride concentrations can significantly alter cooperativity as well as oxygen affinity. The apparent conflict between the findings of Moo-Penn and colleagues and our prediction arises from the enhanced chloride effects exhibited by Hb Hinsdale. On going from 0.05 M Hepes to 0.05 M bis-Tris at pH 7.0, log P50 values for Hb A and Hb Hinsdale are increased by 0.28 and 1.12, respectively. The Bohr effect, the kinetics of oxygen dissociation, the second-order rate constant of CO binding and the rate of CO recombination after flash photolysis were also determined for Hb Hinsdale. The enhanced chloride sensitivity of Hb Hinsdale is consistent with the allosteric mechanism of chloride interactions proposed by Perutz et al. in the accompanying paper."

A flowable resin composite, Flow-It, was used to line all packable composites. The hybrid resin composite Z100 was also included. The adhesive system used with all groups was Scotchbond MultiPurpose Plus. Standard Class II cavities were prepared on the mesial (enamel margins) and distal (dentin margins) sides of the teeth with no communication between them. Based on a power analysis, 180 permanent human molars were randomly assign to each of six groups with 30 specimens per group. All restorative materials were placed following manufacturers' recommendations. Following restoration and thermocycling, the specimens were stored at room temperature in solutions of 45Ca, methylene blue and rhodamine B, sequentially. Microleakage was ordinal scored as 1 (no penetration), 2 (penetration up to one-third of the cervical floor), 3 (penetration beyond one-third of the cervical floor to the axial wall) and 4 (penetration along the axial wall) by two independent evaluators. Analysis of the occlusal surfaces was also accomplished following the same scheme. In this study, tracers/dyes were evaluated for differences in penetration using generalized estimating equation methodology applied to cumulative logistic regression models. The results showed that Rhodamine B detected more microleakage than 45Ca or methylene blue, and 45Ca generally detected more microleakage than methylene blue."
CD010526,0,21660022,0,Evidence summary: which dental liners under amalgam restorations are more effective in reducing postoperative sensitivity?,"Since August 2009, members of the Primary Care Dentistry Research Forum (www.dentistryresearch.org) have taken part in an online vote to identify questions in day-to-day practice that they felt most needed to be answered with conclusive research. The question that receives the most votes each month forms the subject of a critical appraisal of the relevant literature. Each month a new round of voting takes place to decide which further questions will be reviewed. Dental practitioners and dental care professionals are encouraged to take part in the voting and submit their own questions to be included in the vote by joining the website. The paper below details a summary of the findings of the ninth critical appraisal. In order to address the question raised by dentistry research forum, first a search was conducted for systematic reviews on the topic. There was one systematic review retrieved comparing bonded amalgam restorations versus non-bonded amalgam restorations. However, there was no other systematic review identified assessing the effectiveness of dental liners under amalgam restorations in general. Therefore, a search was conducted for any randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing use of a lining under amalgam restorations versus no lining or RCTs comparing differing lining materials under amalgam against each other. There were eight relevant RCTs identified. Due to the low quality, small sample sizes or lack of adequate reporting of the outcome data, the evidence is inadequate to claim or refute a difference in postoperative sensitivity between different dental liners. Further well-conducted RCTs are needed to answer this question. These RCTs would be preferably included and synthesised in a systematic review."
CD010526,0,17518983,0,The effect of two root canal sealers on the retentive strength of glass fibre endodontic posts.,"This study was undertaken to examine the effect of eugenol-containing and non-eugenol-containing root canal sealers on the retention strength of glass fibre endodontic posts (ParaPost Fibre White) luted with a resin cement (ParaPost cement). We also examined the mode of failure that occurred visually by using scanning electron microscopy. Seventy-two single rooted, recently extracted, premolar teeth were root canal treated and randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 was obturated with gutta percha and a calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex, Kerr). Group 2 was obturated with gutta percha and a eugenol-based sealer (Tubli-Seal Kerr). The teeth were stored for 1 week in distilled water at 37 degrees C and then prepared for 9 mm posts with a 1.40-mm drill. The matching glass fibre post was luted with a resin cement following the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were stored for 1 week and thermocycled. The posts were removed from the root canals using a calibrated testing machine in tensile mode. The mean dislodging force for group 1 was 190.46 N and for group 2 was 183.8 N, with standard deviations of 54.9 and 56.0 N respectively. The t-test indicated no significant difference between the two groups. Failure of the posts occurred mainly within the resin layer. This study showed that under experimental conditions there was no statistically significant difference between Sealapex sealer and Tubli-Seal sealer on the retention of glass fibre posts using a resin cement."
CD010526,0,8056177,0,Adhesion and microleakage tests of a new dentin bonding system.,"Adhesion to dentin and microleakage of a new dentin bonding system was studied. The new system includes a low viscosity lightly filled Bis-GMA based resin liner which is placed between the phosphate ester-containing adhesive layer and the composite. This system was compared to dentin bonding agents based on: 1) HEMA and Bis-GMA and 2) PMDM and NTG-GMA. The phosphate ester system was used with and without the low viscosity resin. Each system was used with its corresponding posterior composite. All groups were tested by shear and tensile bond testing immediately and up to 6 mon after bonding. Microleakage of the three systems was tested in Class V restorations by dye penetration. The results of the shear and tensile tests indicated that significant changes within groups occurred with time, and significant differences appeared between groups at various times. The use of low viscosity resin with the phosphate ester system resulted in decreased leakage. The amount of leakage observed was related to early shear bond strength. This study suggests that the properties of the layer immediately adjacent to the adhesive may affect the performance of the system."
CD010526,0,16861071,0,A prospective clinical study of mineral trioxide aggregate for partial pulpotomy in cariously exposed permanent teeth.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the success of using gray mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) for partial pulpotomy in cariously exposed young permanent first molars. Thirty-one first permanent molars of 23 patients with a carious exposure were treated using a partial pulpotomy technique. The age of the patients ranged from 7.2 to 13.1 yr with an average of 10 yr. Clinical and radiographic examination revealed a pulpal response within normal limits and normal appearance of the periradicular area respectively. A diagnosis of reversible pulpitis and normal periapex was established. After isolation, caries removal and carious exposure, the exposed pulp tissue was removed with a diamond bur to a depth of 2 to 4 mm. After hemostasis, 2 to 4 mm of gray MTA paste was placed against the fresh wound. The floor of the cavity was covered with a base of glass ionomer. The teeth were restored with amalgam or stainless steel crowns. Teeth were reviewed radiographically and clinically at 3, 6, 12, and 24 month intervals. Twenty-two of the treated teeth did not show any clinical or radiographic signs of failure during the follow-up evaluation period. Six teeth did not respond to vitality testing at the final follow-up period; however, no radiographic signs of failure or clinical symptoms were detected. Gray MTA was a suitable dressing agent for parital pulpotomy in cariously exposed young permanent first molars."

Specimens were randomly assigned to four equal groups for liner placement: Group I--control, no liner used; Group II--copal varnish; Group III--4-META adhesive; Group IV--dentin bonding agent. After liner placement and amalgam replacement, specimens set for 24 hours and were then thermocycled in 0.5% basic Fuchsin dye, sectioned, and SEM analyses performed. Microgaps appeared in a disjointed fashion at the interface between freshly placed and existing amalgam. The 4-META adhesive appeared to establish a bond between amalgam and tooth structure and, thus, diminished the microgap between amalgam and dentin."

CD010526,0,16599330,0,[Simple bone cyst in the mandible--a rare occurrence in an elderly patient].,"Simple bone cyst (SBC) is an intra-osseous pseudocystic lesion lined by a thin fibrovascular membrane but lacks an epithelial lining. SBC is uncommon and comprises of approximately 1% of all jaw cysts. The lesion is usually discovered incidentally during the first two decades of life. Males are affected slightly more frequently than females. The most common sites of occurrence are the molar and premolar regions of the mandible; maxillary lesions are uncommon. The lesion is usually solitary, radiolucent, well demarcated, and non-expansile. Margins may be scalloped, between vital teeth, and root resorption is rare. A surgical approach to the lesion reveals an empty cavity with serosanguinous fluid. Histologically, the cavity lining consists of a loose connective tissue layer and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Pathogenesis and etiology of SBC are still not clearly understood. It is assumed that the cyst forms following traumatic intra-osseous hemorrhage with subsequent lysis and resorption of the cellular content. Trauma, as the main cause of SBC, is not always conclusive and the origin of the lesion may be multifactorial. Treatment of SBC is by curettage. Intralesional hemorrhage due to either intentional curettage or during exploratory procedure may induce a reparative process. A rare occurrence of SBC in a 71 year old healthy male, referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Outpatient Clinic, Sheba Medical Center by his dentist, because of a large radiolucent lesion in the left mandibular body is reported. The patient received a complete lower denture 3 months earlier. He returned to his dentist with a complaint of local pain and an ulcer under the denture. A panoramic radiograph revealed a large unilocular radiolucent lesion with demarcated borders in the left mandibular body and bone erosion in the upper alveolar border of the lesion Clinical examination showed a deep ulcer in the denture-bearing area of the left posterior alveolar ridge. There was no cortical expansion of the mandible. Incisinal biopsy revealed an empty cavity lined by fibrous connective tissue with no epithelial lining. According to the clinico-radiologic and histologic findings, a diagnosis of a simple bone cyst was made. The incidence of SBC is higher in younger age groups (second decade). Occurrence of the lesion in the elderly is rare with only a few reports in the literature. In the present case, the fact that SBC is asymptomatic, may be responsible for the late discovery of the lesion."

CD010526,0,18611099,0,Breakthrough pain in the management of chronic persistent pain syndromes.,"Chronic pain results from tissue damage (nociceptive) or damage to the nerves or nervous system (neuropathic); it can stem from internal organs or cavity linings (visceral) or from the body's tissues (somatic). Mixed pain results from any number or combination of these types. Breakthrough pain (BTP) is a transitory, and often excruciating, flare that occurs against a background of chronic pain otherwise controlled by opioids. BTP is highly prevalent in patients with chronic pain of both cancer and noncancer origin, with episodes typically occurring several times daily that tend to peak within 10 to 30 minutes. Patients with BTP also endure heightened chronic pain, worsened physical function, and psychological distress. Several subtypes of BTP have been identified, including idiopathic, incident, and end-of-dose failure. The BTP Questionnaire is available to identify and characterize BTP and help determine the best treatment strategy for individual patients. This article reviews the etiology, prevalence, and characteristics of BTP along with assessment of patients and therapeutic strategies available to treat this condition."

CD010526,0,15167466,0,Comparative study of apical sealing ability of a new resin-based root canal sealer.,"The purpose of this study was to compare the microleakage of two root canal sealers, Fibrefill (resin-based sealer) and calciobiotic root canal sealer (CRCS; calcium hydroxide-based sealer), with and without the presence of smear layer. The model used for the measurement of microleakage was a fluid transport model. Sixty human extracted teeth were used in this study. The teeth were divided into four groups and treated as follows. In group A, the smear layer was left intact, and canals were obturated with gutta-percha and Fibrefill. In group B, the smear layer was removed, and canals were obturated with gutta-percha and Fibrefill. In group C, the smear layer was left intact, and the canals were obturated with gutta-percha and CRCS. In group D, the smear layer was removed, and canals were obturated with gutta-percha and CRCS. Microleakage was measured at 7 days, 1 month, and 2 months. The results showed that the Fibrefill groups with and without smear layer leaked significantly less than the CRCS groups at all experimental times. No significant difference was found between the groups of same materials, but the microleakage values were less when the smear layer was removed."
CD010526,0,28845033,0,Microleakage and penetration depth of different fissure sealant materials after cyclic thermo-mechanic and brushing simulation.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate microleakage and the penetration-depths of different fissure-sealant materials applied with/without enameloplasty after cyclic aging. One-hundred-sixty mandibular molars were divided into non-invasive and enameloplasty preparation groups and eight material subgroups, including: flowable composites (microhyrid, nanohybrid, and nanofilled), three resin-based (unfilled, filled, and highly-filled), a giomer-based, and a glass-ionomer-based fissure sealant. Specimens were subjected to two-year cyclic chewing and brushing simulation. After 5% basic-fuchsin dye penetration, specimens were sectioned and scored under stereomicroscope. Kruskal-Wallis statistical data showed that preparation type significantly affected the penetration of all tested materials (p<0.05), but not significantly affected microleakage (p>0.05). Flowable composites showed the best and the glass-ionomer-based sealant showed the worst penetration and microleakage. Slight preparation of fissures is not important in microleakage. However, enameloplasty significantly enhanced the depth of penetration of the sealants. Flowable composites offer promising results at the fissure sealing."
CD010526,0,12413170,0,Tensile bond strength of intracanal posts in primary anterior teeth: an in vitro study.,"The aim of this study was to measure in vitro; the tensile bond strength of three intracanal posts used in anterior primary teeth. A total of 45 single rooted primary anterior teeth were selected for the study and the crowns sectioned leaving 1mm above the cement-enamel junction. The roots were then assigned to three groups according the type of retention used. All roots were endodonticaly treated, a 4-mm of the canal was cleansed and a base of glass ionomer cement was put at the bottom of the prepared canal. The roots were then prepared to receive intracanal posts using a # 4137 diamond bur (KG Sorensen) used in a depth of 3-mm of the length of the canal All the prepared roots were acid etched with a 37% phosphoric acid gel for 15 seconds, rinsed, dried and the dentin adhesive Single Bond (3M) was applied. Group I received intracanal posts and cores made of composite resin (Filtek Z 250, 3M). Group II intracanal posts were made from a 0.6mm orthodontic wire bent as a Greek letter type (gamma), fixed with the Z 250 composite resin and cores were built with the same composite. Finally Group III received intracanal retention made of a fiber glass post (Fibrekor Post, Generic/Pentron) with 1.25 mm diameter, fixed with Z 250 and cores were made like the other groups. The samples were submitted to tension in a universal-testing machine (Instron, model 4444). Statistical analysis (ANOVA) revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. On the basis of the results of this in vitro study it was concluded that the type of intracanal post did not interfere with the tensile strength and the most frequent type of failure was of adhesive type, corresponding to 74% of the sample."

CD010526,0,2268634,0,[Clinical controlled trial for secondary caries preventive effect of Duraphat on cavity walls].,"On a base of a clinical controlled trial the secondary caries preventive effect of a topical application of fluoride varnish (Duraphat) was verified. 255 pairs of amalgam restorations were placed in 191 patients, 152 (79.6%) of whom returned for assessment after a 24 month follow-up period. This group of 152 patients received 188 (73.7%) pairs of restorations. The cavity walls of one restoration of each pair were covered with an thin layer of a fluoride containing varnish. The secondary caries rate of the untreated restorations in such manner was four time greater than the treated ones. The results suggest that the topical application of a fluoride varnish on the cavity walls can be an effective measure for secondary caries prevention."
CD010526,0,21118042,0,Uterine cavity assessment prior to IVF.,"Approximately 15% of couples are affected with subfertility, of which up to 20% remain unexplained. Uterine cavity abnormalities can be a contributing cause of subfertility and recurrent implantation failure. Uterine cavity assessment has been suggested as a routine investigation in the evaluation of subfertile women. Traditionally, hysterosalpingography has been the most commonly used technique in the evaluation of infertility. Transvaginal ultrasound scan allows visualization of the endometrial lining and cavity, and has been used as a screening test for the assessment of uterine cavity. Abnormal uterine findings on a baseline scan can be further evaluated with saline hysterosonography, which is highly sensitive and specific in identifying intrauterine abnormalities. Hysteroscopy is considered as the definitive diagnostic tool to evaluate any abnormality suspected on hysterosalpingography, transvaginal ultrasound scan or saline hysterosonography during routine investigation of infertile patients. Minimally invasive hysteroscopes have minimized the pain experienced by patients during the procedure and made it feasible to use hysteroscopy as a routine outpatient examination. Following recurrent IVF failure there is some evidence of benefit from hysteroscopy in increasing the chance of pregnancy in the subsequent IVF cycle, both in those with abnormal and normal hysteroscopic findings. Various possible mechanisms have been proposed for this beneficial effect, but more randomized controlled trials are needed before its routine use in the general subfertile population can be recommended."

CD010526,0,16689065,0,The effect of base/liner use on restoration leakage.,"Central to the success of a restoration is the quality of the restoration-dentin interfacial seal; any compromise of the seal can lead to secondary or recurrent decay. Class V restorations have a high leakage propensity and this study evaluates the effect of base/liner placement on leakage behavior. Class V intracoronal half enamel/half dentin preparations (3.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 mm) were cut in four groups (n = 10) of extracted human teeth with a new bur used for each cavity preparation. All teeth were single-rooted, single-canal anterior teeth. Base/liner usage differed between each group. The first group of teeth had no liner or base, while a liner was placed in the second group of teeth prior to conditioning and restoration. A base was placed in the third group of cavity preparations and both the base and liner were placed in the fourth group. After preparation, a small diameter bare-end PVC-insulated copper wire was inserted within the root canal of each tooth from the apex to firm contact with the pulp chamber roof. The tooth-wire interface and root surface was sealed and leakage was followed electrochemically for 35 days in 0.9% NaCl solution. All of the teeth leaked to some degree; however, teeth that were restored without liner or base demonstrated the smallest amount of leakage. The greatest leakage was noted in teeth restored with both a base and a liner; teeth restored with only a base showed greater leakage than those restored with only a liner. The findings indicate that the presence of a base and/or a liner results in greater leakage compared with intracoronal Class V preparations that were conditioned and restored only. The data suggest that placing both a base and a liner increases restoration leakage significantly."

Most studies show that insufficient isotope is taken up into the tumour to elicit a tumoricidal effect. This has led several groups to explore the administration of radiolabelled MoAbs into body compartments, specifically for the treatment of minimal tumour deposits that present either as malignant ascites or small nodules on the lining of body cavities. The use of 131Iodine (131I) labelled MoAbs in the treatment of disseminated disease in the central nervous system (CNS) is described and the possibility of administering radiolabelled MoAbs to a cavity generated after debulking surgery for malignant glioma in order to overcome the problem of poor MoAb uptake into solid tumour deposits is discussed together with the rationale for substituting 90Yttrium (90Y) for 131I."

Wedge-shaped cervical cavities were cut on extracted teeth with the gingival cavosurface margin involving dentin. The cavities were randomly assigned to each of each of three groups: (1) restored with a microfilled composite resin, (2) restored with a light-cured glass-ionomer liner and microfilled resin as in the ""sandwich"" technique, and (3) restored entirely with the light-cured glass-ionomer liner. Half of the specimens in each group were thermocycled. Microleakage of these restorations was assessed by dye penetration. The results showed that differences were more pronounced at the gingival margin. Composite restorations inserted over the glass-ionomer liner demonstrated significantly less leakage than when the liner was not used."

CD010526,0,24492118,0,Effect of accelerated aging on the bonding performance of fluoridated adhesive resins.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the dentin bond durability of a one-step, fluoride-containing, glass ionomer-based adhesive system, Reactmer Bond (RB), and that of a two-step, fluoride-containing, self-etch adhesive system, Clearfil Protect Bond (CPB). Enamel was removed from the occlusal surfaces of teeth, and flat dentin surfaces were entirely covered with a composite resin following the application of an adhesive material (n=10). After specimens were sectioned into rectangular sticks of 0.87 ± 0.03 mm(2), the sticks were randomly assigned into two accelerated aging time period groups: 1 week or 1 year. Microtensile bond strengths were determined. Bond strength of RB increased significantly after 1 year (1 week=27.80 ± 10.57 MPa versus 1 year=36.93 ± 14.38 MPa) (p<0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference in bond strength between the two time periods for CPB (1 week=51.74 ± 17.8 MPa versus 1 year=56.03 ± 18.85 MPa) (p>0.05). Both fluoride-containing adhesives seemed to demonstrate reliable bonding performance after 1 year of accelerated aging in water."

CD010526,0,19544820,0,The effect of flowable materials on the microleakage of Class II composite restorations that extend apical to the cemento-enamel junction.,"This in vitro study investigated the effects of a thin layer of flowable composite or compomer on microleakage occurring in Class II packable and nanofilled composite restorations that extend apical to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). The current study also investigated any differences in microleakage that occur between restorations light-cured using a light-emitting diode (LED) and a quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) light-curing unit. Standardized Class II ""slot"" cavity preparations were prepared on the mesial and distal surfaces of 72 extracted, unrestored, non-carious premolars (n = 144). The gingival margins were placed 1 mm apical to the CEJ. The teeth were divided into two groups (n = 72) and restored with a ""packable composite"" (Filtek P60) or a ""nano-filled composite"" (Universal Filtek Supreme XT) with or without flowable composite (Flowable Filtek Supreme XT) or flowable composite (Dyract Flow) as gingival liners placed with thicknesses of 1.0 mm. Each increment was cured for 20 seconds before adding the next. One-half of the samples in each group was cured with QTH (Coltolux 75) and the other half with LED (Coltolux LED) LCUs. After a two-week incubation period at 37 degrees C, the specimens were thermocycled (5 degrees C-55 degrees C x 1500), immersed in 0.5% basic fuchsin dye for 24 hours, sectioned and the microleakage was then evaluated at the gingival margin by two examiners using a 0-3 score scale. Within the current study, when flowable liners were used, both the packable (Filtek P60) and nanofilled (Filtek Supreme XT Universal Restorative) composite materials had significantly less microleakage than when flowable liners were not used (p < 0.05). Both flowable liners (Flowable Filtek Supreme XT and Dyract Flow) resulted in a significant reduction of the microleakage occurring under both types of composite materials at the gingival floors ( p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between them. The choice of light curing technology (LED vs QTH) had no significant effect on the amount of microleakage observed."

A total of 198 individuals (12 to 15 years old), scheduled for fixed orthodontic treatment, were randomized into 2 groups. Prior to bonding, the Cervitec and the control group received one application with Cervitec or a placebo every week for 3 weeks, respectively. In the Cervitec group. Fluor Protector was applied at bonding and Cervitec at the next visit, 6 weeks later. Each varnish was then applied every 12 weeks for 24 weeks. In the control group, the fluoride varnish was applied only at bonding and every 12 weeks. The Visible Plaque Index (VPI), the Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI), the White Spot Lesion Index (WSL) and the level of mutans streptococci in plaque and saliva were recorded 3 weeks prior to bonding and after 24 weeks. At bonding and after 12 weeks, only VPI, GPI, plaque and salivary mutans streptococcus counts were recorded. During the 3-week prebonding period, the mean VPI, GBI and mutans streptococci in plaque decreased in both groups. At bonding, the mean level of mutans streptococci in plaque was significantly lower in the Cervitec group than in the control group.

CD010526,0,14960003,0,Caries-preventive effect of fissure sealants: a systematic review.,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate systematically the evidence of the caries-preventive effect of fissure sealing of occlusal tooth surfaces and to examine factors potentially modifying the effect. The search strategies included electronic databases, reference lists of articles, and selected textbooks. Inclusion criteria were randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials or controlled clinical trials comparing fissure sealing with no treatment or another preventive treatment in children up to 14 years of age at the start; the outcome measure was caries increment; the diagnostic criteria had been described; and the follow-up time was at least 2 years. Inclusion decisions were taken and grading of the studies was done independently by two of the authors. The main measure of effect was relative risk reduction. Thirteen studies using resin-based or glass ionomer sealant materials were included in the final analysis. The results showed that most studies were performed during the 1970s and a single application had been utilized. The relative caries risk reduction pooled estimate of resin-based sealants on permanent 1st molars was 33% (relative risk = 0.67; CI = 0.55-0.83). The effect depended on retention of the sealant. In conclusion, the review suggests limited evidence that fissure sealing of 1st permanent molars with resin-based materials has a caries-preventive effect. The evidence is incomplete for permanent 2nd molars, premolars and primary molars and for glass ionomer cements. Overall, there remains a need for further trials of high quality, particularly in child populations with a low and a high caries risk, respectively."

CD010526,0,8456254,0,Human pulpal response to direct filling gold restorations.,"Class V cavities were prepared in 47 caries-free premolars intended to be extracted for orthodontic reasons. A powdered gold filling material, Goldent, which can be hand condensed, was used for direct fillings. The following test groups were used: (A) cavity preparation, no filling, (B) cavity filled with Goldent only, (C) cavity lined with Tubulitec and filled with Goldent, (D) cavity with Goldent filling, sealed with IRM, and (E) positive and negative controls. The teeth were extracted after 1-200 days and the pulpal response was histologically examined. The results revealed that only in Group B, i.e. when the cavity was filled with Goldent, was the risk of a pulpal reaction obvious, although the material per se (Group D) did not influence the pulpal tissue to any serious degree. Probably the Goldent material cannot provide a marginal seal tight enough to prevent microleakage, allowing microorganisms to give rise to pulp damage and inflammation. In those cases where the cavity had been isolated with Tubulitec liner before the gold restoration was made, the pulp was effectively protected from damage caused by microorganisms."

Sixty single-rooted teeth with mature apices were prepared chemomechanically using a modified double-flared technique with non-cutting tipped files and copious irrigation with 2% sodium hypochlorite. The teeth were randomly allocated to four groups of 15 teeth each. Two groups were treated with 40% citric acid to remove the smear layer. Two groups of teeth, one with and one without smear layer, were filled by lateral condensation of gutta-percha with either Tubliseal or a resin-based glass ionomer, Vitrebond. The teeth were stored for 1 week, thermocycled, and the extent of coronal leakage determined for each group after immersion in Indian ink for 90 h. The teeth were demineralized, dehydrated and immersed in methyl salicylate which rendered them transparent. Linear measurement of dye penetration was recorded. The mean depth (+/- SD) of leakage for the groups in which the smear layer was left intact was 4.26 +/- 1.53 mm and 6.83 +/- 1.65 mm for the Vitrebond and Tubliseal, respectively. When the smear layer had been removed, the mean depth of leakage for the Vitrebond group was 1.13 +/- 0.29 mm, and 3.72 +/- 1.23 mm for the Tubliseal group. There was a statistically significant difference in leakage between the groups (P < 0.001). With both sealers, those teeth in which the smear layer had been removed showed less leakage than the specimens in which the smear layer was left intact (P < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Wedge-shaped cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of 72 extracted premolars, which were then treated with an adhesive system (One Up Bond F Plus), divided into three groups, and restored with: 1) Estelite Sigma resin composite, 2) a resin composite with Low Flow flowable composite, or 3) a resin composite with High Flow flowable composite. The specimens were subjected to a nano-indentation test to evaluate the elastic modulus of successive layers at the resin-dentine interface and were subjected to a microleakage test under either unloaded or loaded conditions. The elastic moduli were significantly different among substrates (p<0.05), except between the hybrid layer/Low Flow and the hybrid layer/High Flow. The elastic moduli of the Low Flow composite were higher than those of the High Flow composite. Occlusal force increased dentine leakage in the group that was restored without flowable composites."

After ageing for periods of 3 months and 1 year, the 12 unrestored teeth and 80 of the restored teeth were subjected to an in vitro bacterial challenge for 36 days, while the other 40 specimens were challenged in acidified broth (pH 4.0). Sections were then prepared for polarized light microscopy. Carious lesion configuration on either side of the cavity was noted, and outer, wall and dentine lesions measured. Data underwent Fisher's exact test, a chi-squared goodness of fit test and a Student's paired t-test with P<0.05. Except for dentine lesions, acid broth and unrestored specimens showed carious lesions having similar size and occurrence on either side of the cavity. Two unrestored cavities showed caries resistance. Restored, bacterially challenged specimens were significantly different regarding total and wall lesion distribution and wall lesion width and area on either side of the cut cavity. Acid broth challenge will promote regular caries development at the tooth-restoration interface. The random caries pattern which developed in restored bacterially challenged specimens indicates that the tooth-restoration interface forms a diverse environment providing sites of varying susceptibility to caries."
CD010526,0,2135427,0,[Dimensional instability of zinc oxide-eugenol based temporary sealing materials used in endodontics].,"The dimensional instability of temporary sealing materials based on zinc oxide-eugenol was studied in vitro by chemical reaction between an indicator solution (5% nickel sulfate) and a developing solution (1% alcohol dimethylglixime). Thermal cycling was performed (5, 37 and 60 degrees C). Zinc acetate was added to zinc oxide to test its action on dimensional instability. The materials were divided into two groups. 1) group with double sealing (gutta-percha + sealing material), and 2) group without double sealing. It was concluded that none of the temporary sealing materials tested, with or without double sealing, prevented marginal infiltration when submitted to thermal cycling. The addition of zinc acetate to zinc oxide was not effective in preventing marginal infiltration."
CD010526,0,2681306,0,Effect of etching glass-ionomer cements on bond strength to composite resin.,"The use of glass-ionomer cement in restorative dentistry has seen a revival because of its capacity for being etched and bonded to composite resin. Past investigators compared an etched cement surface with an unetched surface that was set against a smooth surface. Clinically, however, a glassy smooth surface is not produced when the cement is used as a base. Using Scotchbond bonding resin, we developed this two-part study to evaluate the tensile bond strengths of P-30TM composite resin to several glass-ionomer cements that were (a) unetched but allowed to set in air and (b) etched for 30 s with orthophosphoric acid, and to compare them with the cohesive strength of the respective cement. Using a silver nitrate staining technique, we also evaluated the microleakage of class V cavities restored with SiluxTM composite resin under a base of etched or unetched Ketac Bond cement. Although there were significant differences among three cements between their cohesive strength and the resin bond strength after the two surface treatments (p less than 0.01), the bond to the unetched surface was generally similar to that of the etched surface of the cement. The remaining groups showed no statistical difference. The microleakage was similar in the two groups. SEM micrographs showed a rough topography of the unetched cement that resembled that of the etched surface. This in vitro study suggests that acid-etching a glass-ionomer base for resin-bonding may not be necessary for specific materials. Further clinical evaluation is recommended to validate this observation intra-orally."

CD010526,0,28682281,0,Microleakage of Class II composite resin restorations with self-adhesive composite resin liners.,"This study investigated the microleakage of Class II composite restorations with composite resin liners. Standardized box cavities were prepared on the mesial and distal surfaces of 84 extracted intact human molars. Proximal margins were located in enamel (occlusal) and 1.0 mm apical to the cementoenamel junction (gingival). The teeth were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 28 cavities) and restored with Filtek Z350 nanohybrid composite resin (FZ). The test groups were lined with a conventional flowable composite resin, Premise Flowable (PF), or 1 of 2 self-adhesive composites (SACs): Vertise Flow (VF) or Clearfil SA luting cement (CSA) with or without their respective self-etching adhesives: Optibond All-in-One (OB) or Clearfil SE Bond (CSE). The adhesive/lining procedure was performed as follows: OB/FZ (control), OB/PF/FZ, VF/FZ, OB/VF/FZ, CSA/FZ, or CSE/CSA/FZ. Microleakage was evaluated at the occlusal and gingival margins using a dye penetration technique and quantitative assessment. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze the data at the significance level of α = 0.05. None of the restorative techniques was capable of preventing microleakage completely. The greatest amount of microleakage was detected in the VF/FZ and CSA/FZ groups at both margins (P < 0.02). Among the groups placed with a bonding agent, OB/VF/FZ showed significantly greater values of microleakage at the occlusal margins than did OB/FZ, OB/PF/FZ, and CSE/CSA/FZ (P < 0.05). At the gingival margins, the OB/PF/FZ group exhibited the least leakage compared with the OB/VF/FZ and CSE/CSA/FZ groups (P < 0.001). The results indicated that the additional application of bonding agents improved the marginal sealing of SACs in Class II composite restorations."
CD010526,0,21842145,0,Long-term effectiveness of four pulpotomy techniques: 3-year randomised controlled trial.,"A pulpotomy is the therapy for management of pulp exposures due to caries in symptom-free primary molars. The aim was to longitudinally compare the relative effectiveness of the Er:YAG laser, calcium hydroxide and ferric sulphate techniques with dilute formocresol in retaining symptom-free molars. Two hundred primary molars in 107 healthy children were included and randomly allocated to one technique. The treated teeth were blindly reevaluated after 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. Descriptive data analysis and logistic regression analysis accounting for multiple observations per patient by generalised estimating equation were used. Additionally, various influences including tooth type, upper and lower jaws, type of anaesthesia, operator and the final restoration on treatment success were evaluated (Wald chi-square test). After 36 months, the following total (considering clinical and clinically symptom-free radiographic failures) and clinical success rates were determined (in percent): Formocresol 72 (92), laser 73 (89), calcium hydroxide 46 (75), ferric sulphate 76 (97). No significant differences were detected between formocresol and any other technique after 36 months. However, the odds ratio of failure appeared to be three times higher for calcium hydroxide than for formocresol. No significant differences in total success rates were seen regarding the aforementioned influencing clinical parameters. The correct diagnosis of the pulpal status, bleeding control and the specific technique are highly important for long-term success of pulpotomies in primary molars. According to the presented long-term data, pulpotomies using ferric sulphate revealed the best treatment outcome among the used techniques, while calcium hydroxide resulted in the lowest success rates after 3 years. Therefore, we can recommend ferric sulphate for easy and successful treatment of primary molars with caries-exposed pulps."
CD010526,0,9161210,0,Class II composite resin restorations using glass-ionomer liners: microleakage studies.,"Microleakage studies were undertaken for Class II composite resin restorations that had been lined with glass-ionomer cement using the 'sandwich' technique. Thirty freshly extracted permanent molars and premolars were mounted in polymethylmethacrylate blocks. Class II cavities were prepared using carbide burs No. 245 in a water cooled dental handpiece, (cavity box 5 x 3 x 2 mm). Specimens were divided into three groups of 10 each. Group A was restored with hybrid composite resin only, Group B with hybrid composite using a light-cured glass-ionomer liner applied to dentin only, and Group C with hybrid composite using light-cured glass-ionomer liner carried out to the cavosurface margin, (beyond the DEJ). All the specimens were thermocycled between 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C for 250 cycles for 3 hours, followed by placement in 0.5% aqueous basic fuchsin dye for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Specimens were sectioned mesio-distally through the restorations using an Isomet apparatus. The extent of dye penetration was scored under a stereomicroscope with reference to the DEJ, (0 = no penetration, 1 = penetration to the enamel, 2 = penetration beyond the DEJ). Statistical analysis of the data showed significant differences among the means of the groups at p < 0.001. The results of this study indicate that the application of a light-cured glass-ionomer up to the cavosurface margin inhibits the microleakage of Class II restorations in vitro."
CD010526,0,8700767,0,Factors associated with clinical success of cervical abrasion/erosion restorations.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of class 5 restorations according to USPHS criteria. Twenty-five patients and 116 abrasion/erosion lesions were restored with either a glass-ionomer cement restoration (Ketac-Fil), a composite resin restoration with a dentin bonding agent (Silux Plus, Scotchbond 2), or a composite resin restoration with a dentin bonding agent and a glass-ionomer liner (Silux Plus, Scotchbond 2, Vitrebond). At 3 years, 24 patients and 110 teeth were evaluated. All restorations were rated clinically acceptable for color match, cavosurface discoloration, surface texture, and caries development. Glass-ionomer cement restorations demonstrated a slightly rougher surface texture than the composite restorations (Friedman Two-way ANOVA, P=0.000). Significant differences were found with retention (Cochran Q test, P=0.012). Percentages retained were: glass ionomer, 97.3% (36/37); composite/dentin bonding agent, 75.7% (28/37); composite/dentin bonding agent/glass-ionomer liner, 100% (36/36). At 3 years class 5 restorations of glass-ionomer cement or composite with a dentin bonding and a glass-ionomer liner demonstrated significantly better retention than restorations of composite with a dentin bonding agent. Increased occlusal function, mobility, and mandibular arch were associated with a decrease in retention rate."

CD010526,0,22888444,0,An Assessment of Antibacterial Activity of Four Endodontic Sealers on Enterococcus faecalis by a Direct Contact Test: An In Vitro Study.,"Aim. To evaluate the antibacterial activity of four endodontic sealers on Enterococcus faecalis by a direct contact test. Material and Methods. Enterococcus faecalis was used as a test organism. Direct contact test which is based on measuring the effect of close contact between test bacteria and tested material on the kinetics of bacterial growth was performed to overcome the disadvantages of agar diffusion test. The sealers tested were zinc oxide eugenol-based sealer, glass-ionomer-based sealer, polydimethyl-siloxane-based sealer, and urethane dimethacrylate resin-based sealer. Data was collected by recording the optical density with the help of a spectrophotometer. Results. The sealers exhibited different inhibitory effects. The results obtained were subjected to statistical analysis by Kruskal Wallis analysis of variance and Dunn's multiple comparison test. Group comparison showed very highly significant difference between the groups. Conclusion. Zinc oxide eugenol-based sealer was the most effective and urethane dimethacrylate resin-based sealer was the least effective against Enterococcus faecalis, whereas glass-ionomer-based and polydimethyl-siloxane-based sealers were effective only for a short period. Inhibition of the bacterial growth is related to the direct contact of the microorganism with the sealer."
CD010526,0,16206202,0,Sealing properties of different resin-based root canal sealers.,"In this study, a comparison of the sealing properties of three different resin-based sealers, AH26, Diaket, and EndoREZ with those of the root canal sealer zinc oxide-eugenol-based U/P Root Canal Sealer was performed. Eighty extracted single-rooted human mandibular first premolar teeth were used. The coronal part of each tooth was removed at the apical 17-mm of roots. The root canals were prepared to a size 7 with ProFile 0.06 taper Series 29 rotary instruments in a crown-down manner before lateral condensation of gutta-percha with the tested sealers (n = 20). A fluid filtration method was used for quantitative evaluation of apical leakage. Statistical analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between the resin-based sealers groups (AH26, Diaket, and EndoREZ) (p > 0.05). U/P Root Canal Sealer, zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealer, leaked significantly more than other tested groups (p < 0.05). Under the limitations of this study, resin-based root canal sealers were found more effective in sealing root canals than the zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealer."

CD010526,0,10826048,0,Pain related to different ways of minimal intervention in the treatment of small caries lesions.,"Pain during invasive treatment of dental caries is a common phenomenon, if no local analgesia has been used before cavity preparation. Atraumatic restorative technique (ART) is a suggested procedure which is at least less traumatic for the patient. Although the ART approach has been received well by both children and adults who belong to population groups hardly ever exposed to regular oral health care, it has not yet been proven that this particular procedure really causes less pain, compared to more conventional techniques with rotating instruments. In the present study, pain was reported in connection with tooth restoration in 19.3 percent of the cases, when the ART technique was used, which is significantly less than with a conventional restorative technique (35.7 percent). Finally the results show a clear relationship in the pain reports between the first and the following treatments in both ART and the conventional technique groups."

CD010526,0,17545663,0,Voxel-based models representing the male and female ICRP reference adult--the skeleton.,"For the forthcoming update of organ dose conversion coefficients, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) will use voxel-based computational phantoms due to their improved anatomical realism compared with the class of mathematical or stylized phantoms used previously. According to the ICRP philosophy, these phantoms should be representative of the male and female reference adults with respect to their external dimensions, their organ topology and their organ masses. To meet these requirements, reference models of an adult male and adult female have been constructed at the GSF, based on existing voxel models segmented from tomographic images of two individuals whose body height and weight closely resemble the ICRP Publication 89 reference values. The skeleton is a highly complex structure of the body, composed of cortical bone, trabecular bone, red and yellow bone marrow and endosteum ('bone surfaces' in their older terminology). The skeleton of the reference phantoms consists of 19 individually segmented bones and bone groups. Sub-division of these bones into the above-mentioned constituents would be necessary in order to allow a direct calculation of dose to red bone marrow and endosteum. However, the dimensions of the trabeculae, the cavities containing bone marrow and the endosteum layer lining these cavities are clearly smaller than the resolution of a normal CT scan and, thus, these volumes could not be segmented in the tomographic images. As an attempt to represent the gross spatial distribution of these regions as realistically as possible at the given voxel resolution, 48 individual organ identification numbers were assigned to various parts of the skeleton: every segmented bone was subdivided into an outer shell of cortical bone and a spongious core; in the shafts of the long bones, a medullary cavity was additionally segmented. Using the data from ICRP Publication 89 on elemental tissue composition, from ICRU Report 46 on material mass densities, and from ICRP Publication 70 on the distribution of the red bone marrow among and marrow cellularity in individual bones, individual elemental compositions for these segmented bone regions were derived. Thus, most of the relevant source and target regions of the skeleton were provided. Dose calculations using these regions will be based on fluence-to-dose response functions that are multiplied with the particle fluence inside specific bone regions to give the dose quantities of interest to the target tissues."
CD010526,0,8152986,0,Microleakage of a dental amalgam alloy bonding agent.,"Amalgambond (a 4-META derivative resin bond agent) was evaluated for its effectiveness in reducing microleakage compared to copal varnish and no lining agent in class 5 amalgam preparations restored with either an admix alloy (Dispersalloy) or a spherical alloy (Tytin). Teeth were thermocycled between 5 and 55 degrees C with two 4-META/amalgam groups additionally aged in 37 degrees C water for 30 days prior to thermocycling. Nonaged, 4-META/amalgam restorations showed significantly less microleakage (P < 0.05) at enamel and dentin margins compared to copal varnish or nonlined restorations. Within the 4-META groups, the 4-META/Dispersalloy restorations had significantly less microleakage than the 4-META/Tytin restorations at enamel margins. Microleakage in the aged 4-META/amalgam restorations was significantly greater at both the enamel and dentin margins than in the analogous nonaged groups. SEM evaluation of the 4-META lined restorations found internal cavity surfaces of the preparations to be sealed by the resin liner with separations and apparent microleakage occurring at the 4-META/amalgam interface."

Despite the fact that the thermal conductivity of the RBC restorative material closely approximates that of natural tooth structure, postoperative hypersensitivity is sometimes still an issue. Dental cavity liners have historically been used to protect the pulp from the toxic effects of some dental restorative materials and to prevent the pain of thermal conductivity by placing an insulating layer between restorative material and the remaining tooth structure."
CD010526,0,2300793,0,[The border seal in restorations of class-V lesions with glass ionomer cement and composite (the sandwich filling)].,"In 9 patients, 60 class V restorations were evaluated clinically and by scanning electron microscopy. All lesions were treated with glass-ionomer combined with composite resin. In 27 fillings (group A) the glass-ionomer lining cement was etched, whereas in 33 fillings (group B) the composite material was applied directly on the unetched glass-ionomer liner. Clinically, the retention of the fillings after one year was 100%. The margins of the fillings were checked with different explorers and found to be acceptable. Scanning electron microscopy of the margins of the fillings showed disappointing results. One week after placement of the fillings, only 16.2% (group A) and 7.4% (group B) of the cervical margins in dentin were rated perfect. After one year, even more cervical bond failures were observed. 9.7% perfect margins were found in group A, 3.2% in group B. Etching of the glass-ionomer liner had no influence on the cervical bond failure of the class V fillings."

This methodology provides ready access to a wide range of cavities lined with substituents possessing chirality or hydrogen-bonding groups. The potential of such systems is illustrated by synergistic binding of a hydroxypyridine to the Ru(II)-CO center and to the hydroxyl groups of a D-quinate-lined cavity. The effect of changing the carboxylate lining of the cavity on the course of epoxidation reactions catalyzed by these trimers is also reported."

After 3 wk of infection, the smear layer was reformed and in half of the specimens, the smear layer was again removed. Aqueous Ca(OH)2 paste and silicone oil based Ca(OH)2 paste were used as the test medications. The specimens were divided into four groups (i.e. (a) nonsmeared aqueous calcium hydroxide group, (b) nonsmeared silicon oil-based calcium hydroxide group, (c) smeared aqueous calcium hydroxide group, and (d) smeared silicon oil-based calcium hydroxide group. Medications were placed in the canals for 7 days. After removal of medications dentin chips were collected and incubated. The quantity of bacteria present was assessed. All calcium hydroxide pastes were effective in the elimination of bacteria in the dentinal tubules, except in the smeared group with silicone oil-based calcium hydroxide."
CD010526,0,18175308,0,A simple and fuzzy method to align and compare druggable ligand-binding sites.,"A novel method to measure distances between druggable protein cavities is presented. Starting from user-defined ligand binding sites, eight topological and physicochemical properties are projected from cavity-lining protein residues to an 80 triangle-discretised sphere placed at the centre of the binding site, thus defining a cavity fingerprint. Representing binding site properties onto a discretised sphere presents many advantages: (i) a normalised distance between binding sites of different sizes may be easily derived by summing up the normalised differences between the 8 computed descriptors; (ii) a structural alignment of two proteins is simply done by systematically rotating/translating one mobile sphere around one immobile reference; (iii) a certain degree of fuzziness in the comparison is reached by projecting global amino acid properties (e.g., charge, size, functional groups count, distance to the site centre) independently of local rotameric/tautomeric states of cavity-lining residues. The method was implemented in a new program (SiteAlign) and tested in a number of various scenarios: measuring the distance between 376 related active site pairs, computing the cross-similarity of members of a protein family, predicting the targets of ligands with various promiscuity levels. The proposed method is robust enough to detect local similarity among active sites of different sizes, to discriminate between protein subfamilies and to recover the known targets of promiscuous ligands by virtual screening."
CD010526,0,1506519,0,Morphological aspects of the resin-dentin interdiffusion zone with different dentin adhesive systems.,"Cross-sections of resin-dentin interfaces were etched with an argon-ion beam to make their substructure detectable by scanning electron microscopy. The dentin adhesive systems were categorized morphologically into three groups, and an attempt was made to clarify their adhesive mechanism. The first group of products removed the smear layer. The argon-ion bombardment clearly disclosed a hybrid or resin-impregnated dentin layer. It is hypothesized that conditioning with acidic or chelating agents demineralized the dentin surface-layer to a certain depth, leaving behind a collagen-rich mesh-work. Hydrophilic monomers are then believed to alter this collagen-fiber arrangement in a way that facilitates penetration of the adhesive resin, resulting in a mechanical, intermingled link between collagen and the adhesive resin. The second group preserved the smear layer. In this case, the dentinal tubules were obliterated with globular particles at their orifices and remained patent underneath these smear plugs. This type of adhesive system aims at the incorporation of the smear layer into the hydrophilic monomers, which have an affinity for the organic and/or inorganic components of the underlying dentin. Finally, a third, small group only partly dissolved the smear layer, creating a thin resin-impregnated dentin layer and a resin-impregnated smear plug. This study clearly showed that the application of recent adhesive systems induced structural changes in the dentin surface morphology, creating a retentive interface, called the inter-diffusion zone, between the deep, untouched dentin layers and the composite filling material. This resin-dentin interdiffusion zone offers bonding sites for copolymerization with the resin composite and, concurrently, might have protective potential for the pulp tissues."

CD010526,0,18177033,0,Quantum mechanical calculations on selectivity in the KcsA channel: the role of the aqueous cavity.,"We have carried out quantum calculations on selected residues at the intracellular side of the selectivity filter of the KcsA potassium channel, using the published X-ray coordinates as starting points. The calculations involved primarily the side chains of residues lining the aqueous cavity on the intracellular side of the selectivity filter, in addition to water molecules, plus a K+ or Na+ ion. The results showed unambiguously that Na+ significantly distorts the symmetry of the channel at the entrance to the selectivity filter (at the residue T75), while K+ does so to a much smaller extent. In all, three ion positions have been calculated: the S4 (lowest) position at the bottom of the selectivity filter, the top of the cavity, and the midpoint of the cavity; Na+ is trapped at the cavity top, while K+ is cosolvated by the selectivity filter carbonyl groups plus threonine hydroxyl groups so that it can traverse the filter. Only one water molecule remains in the K+ solvation shell at the upper position in the cavity; this solvation shell also contains four threonine (T75) hydroxyl oxygens and two backbone carbonyls, while Na+ is solvated by five molecules of water and one oxygen from threonine hydroxyls. T75 at the entrance to the selectivity filter has a key role in recognition of the alkali ion, and T74 has secondary importance. The energetic basis for the preferential bonding of potassium by these residues is briefly discussed, based on additional calculations. Taken together, the results suggest that Na+ would have difficulty entering the cavity, and if it did, it would not be able to enter the selectivity filter."
CD010526,0,1810331,0,Long-term fluoride release from glass ionomer-lined amalgam restorations.,"This in vitro study evaluated the amount of fluoride released from glass ionomer-lined amalgam restorations over a period of 1 year. Class V cavities (2 x 2 x 7 mm) were prepared on the facial and lingual surfaces of 50 extracted human molars randomly distributed into 5 groups: Group 1: No restorations; Group 2: Dispersalloy amalgam alone; Group 3: same as Group 2 except 1 mm of Ketac-Silver was placed on the axial wall before amalgam insertion; Group 4: GC Lining/amalgam; and Group 5: Miracle Mix/amalgam. After restoration, each tooth was thermocycled (100x) at 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C with a dwell time of 30 seconds for baseline fluoride release levels. The teeth were placed in a polyethylene vial containing 4 ml of deionized water. At weekly intervals, each tooth was transferred to a fresh vial. Fluoride release was measured with a fluoride ion specific electrode for 10 consecutive weeks and then again at the end of 1 year. Calibration curves for low level measurements were prepared so the readings could be expressed in micrograms/ml F. At 1 year, fluoride released in micrograms/ml was: Group 1: less than 0.08; Group 2: less than 0.08; Group 3: 0.28; Group 4: 0.68; Group 5: 1.12. An ANOVA was used to evaluate the statistical difference between the groups. At the end of 1 year, measurable amounts of fluoride were recorded for all glass ionomer-lined groups with Miracle Mix and GC Lining releasing significantly more fluoride than Ketac-Silver (P less than 0.002)."

For each GIC, 36 test specimens were made, divided into 3 groups according to the surface protection treatment applied - no protection, varnish or nail varnish. The specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 h, 7 and 30 days and the microhardness tests were performed at these times. The data obtained were submitted to the ANOVA for repeated measures and Tukey tests (alpha = 5%). The results revealed that the mean microhardness values of the GICs were, in decreasing order, as follows: F > CF = MR > MG > V; that surface protection was significant for MR, at 24 h, without protection (64.2 + or - 3.6a), protected with GIC varnish (59.6 + or - 3.4b) and protected with nail varnish (62.7 + or - 2.8ab); for F, at 7 days, without protection (97.8 + or - 3.7ab), protected with varnish (95.9 + or - 3.2b) and protected with nail varnish (100.8 + or - 3.4a); and at 30 days, for F, without protection (98.8 + or - 2.6b), protected with varnish (103.3 + or - 4.4a) and protected with nail varnish (101 + or - 4.1ab) and, for V, without protection (46 + or - 1.3b), protected with varnish (49.6 + or - 1.7ab) and protected with nail varnish (51.1 + or - 2.6a). The increase in storage time produced an increase in microhardness. It was concluded that the different GICs, surface protection treatments and storage times could alter the microhardness values."

CD010526,0,26961333,0,Application of 17% EDTA Enhances Diffusion of (45)Ca-labeled OH(-) and Ca(2+) in Primary Tooth Root Canal.,"Proper cleaning of the root canal is key to the success of endodontic treatment as it allows more effective diffusion of medication throughout the dentinal tubules. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the efficacy of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in enhancing diffusion of hydroxyl (OH(-)) and calcium ions (Ca(2+)) throughout the root canal in primary teeth. The canals of 25 primary tooth roots were cleaned with endodontic files and 1% sodium hypochlorite. Three groups (G) were then established: GI, in which final irrigation was performed with 1% sodium hypochlorite; GII, in which 17% EDTA was used; and GIII, in which no irrigation was performed. The roots canals in GI and GII were filled with a calcium hydroxide-based paste labeled with the radioisotope calcium-45. Diffusion of OH(-) was detected with pH strips and Ca(2+) analyzed by measuring radioactivity in counts per min. Group II differed statistically from the other groups in diffusion of OH(-) at 24 hr (p<0.05), but no significant difference among groups was found at the day 7 evaluation; GII also differed statistically from the other groups in diffusion of Ca(2+) at 24 hr (p<0.05). These results suggest that application of 17% EDTA in primary tooth enhances diffusion of OH(-) and Ca(2+)."

CD010526,0,21383518,0,"Shear bond strength, failure modes, and confocal microscopy of bonded amalgam restorations.","This study evaluated the shear bond strength, failure modes, and confocal microscopy of two different amalgam alloy restorations lined with five adhesive systems. Two regular-set high-copper dental amalgam alloys, Amalcap Plus and Valiant Ph.D, and five commercially available adhesive systems were selected. One hundred and twenty freshly-extracted human third molars were used for the study. The results were statistically evaluated using two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). The shear bond strength (SBS) of amalgam to dentin was significantly affected by both the adhesive (p<0.0001) and amalgam alloy (p<0.0002). Regarding mode of failure (MF), among samples restored with Valiant Ph.D, 31 of 50 exhibited adhesive failure, and 19 displayed mixed failure.

CD010526,0,28867360,0,The use of TMZ embedded hydrogels for the treatment of orthotopic human glioma xenografts.,"The current treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is limited by the restricted arsenal of agents which effectively cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). For example, only a fraction of temozolomide (TMZ) administered systemically is available for therapeutic effect because of the BBB and the instability of TMZ under physiologic conditions. A novel approach to overcome this obstacle is to bypass the BBB and locally deliver chemotherapeutic agents directly to the tumor mass. We have explored the loading of TMZ into a novel hydrogel matrix, which can be delivered in liquid form and then solidifies in situ and releases chemotherapy as the matrix dissolves. Here, we tested the effect of amphiphilic diblock copolypeptide hydrogels (DCHs) of 180-poly-lysine and 20-poly-leucine (K"

CD010526,0,25756048,0,Resistance to fracture of dental roots obturated with different materials.,"The aim of this study was to compare the vertical fracture resistance of roots obturated with different root canal filling materials and sealers. Crowns of 55 extracted mandibular premolar teeth were removed to provide root lengths of 13 mm. Five roots were saved as negative control group (canals unprepared and unfilled). Fifty root canals were instrumented and then five roots were saved as positive control group (canals prepared but unfilled). The remaining 45 roots were randomly divided into three experimental groups (n = 15 root/group) and obturated with the following procedures: in group 1, glass ionomer-based sealer and cone (ActiV GP obturation system); in group 2, bioceramic sealer and cone (EndoSequence BC obturation system); and in group 3, roots were filled with bioceramic sealer and cone (Smartpaste bio obturation system). All specimens were tested in a universal testing machine for measuring fracture resistance. For each root, the force at the time of fracture was recorded in Newtons. The statistical analysis was performed by using Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc test. There were no significant differences between the three experimental groups. The fracture values of three experimental and negative control groups were significantly higher than the positive control group. Within the limitations of this study, all materials increased the fracture resistance of instrumented roots."
CD010526,0,20878027,0,Microhardness evaluation around composite restorations using fluoride-containing adhesive systems.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microhardness of dental enamel around composite restorations bonded with fluoride-containing adhesive systems (FCAS), after thermo- and pH-cycling protocols. Standardized cylindrical cavities were prepared on enamel surfaces of 175 dental fragments, which were randomly assigned into seven experimental groups (n=25). Four groups used FCAS: Optibond Solo (OS); Prime&Bond 2.1 (PB); Syntac Sprint (SS) and Tenure Quick (TC). Other groups consisted of ""Sandwich"" technique restoration (STR) (glass ionomer liner + hydrophobic adhesive resin /restorative composite) or used Single Bond with (SB) or without (SBWC) cycling protocols. Adhesive systems were applied according to manufacturers' instructions and cavities were restored with a microfilled composite (Durafill VS). After finishing and polishing, all groups were submitted to 1,000 thermal cycles (5 ºC and 55 ºC) and to demineralization (pH 4.3) and remineralization (pH 7.0) cycling protocols, except for SBWC group. The Knoop microhardness of enamel surfaces were measured around restorations. Indentations were recorded at 150, 300 and 450-mm from the cavity wall. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Duncan's Test (a=0.05%). Means ± SD of enamel microhardness for the groups were (Kg/mm²): SBWC: 314.50 ± 55.93ª ; SB: 256.78 ± 62.66b; STR: 253.90 ± 83.6b; TQ: 243.93 ± 68.3b; OS: 227.97 ± 67.1c; PB: 213.30 ± 91.3d; SS: 208.73 ± 86.6d.

CD010526,0,19583764,0,Fluid flow after resin-composite restoration in extracted carious teeth.,"The aim of this study was to investigate fluid flow in dentin after restoration of carious teeth with resin composite bonded with a total-etching adhesive, with or without glass-ionomer cement lining. The roots of extracted third molars were removed and the crowns were connected to a fluid flow-measuring device. Each carious lesion was stained with caries detector dye and caries was removed using slow-speed burs and spoon excavators. Caries-excavated teeth were divided into two groups for restoration with resin composite bonded with a total-etch adhesive: (i) without lining; and (ii) lined with glass-ionomer cement before bonding. In non-carious teeth, cavities of similar dimensions were prepared, divided into two groups, and restored in the same manner. Fluid flow was recorded, after restoration, for up to 1 month. Caries-affected dentin was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the bonded interfaces were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. No significant difference in fluid flow was observed between the two restorative procedures or between the carious and non-carious groups. The SEM images showed that the dentinal tubules of acid-etched, caries-affected dentin were usually still occluded, while some were patent. Limited penetration of fluorescent dye into dentin and into the bonded interfaces of restored carious teeth was observed."

CD010526,0,16102288,0,Influence of embryonic conditioned media upon the endometrial beta-adrenergic receptor.,"The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the products secreted by the human embryo upon the three subtypes of beta-AR (beta1, beta2, beta3). Cell cultures were developed using endometrial biopsies, taken on day 7 after ovulation, from four healthy women <35 years of age, with regular cycles and infertility due only to male factors. Embryos from women with a normal uterine cavity and endometrial lining were incubated until they reached the 4-cell stage, before being transferred to their mother's uterus. Culture media for embryo incubation were derived from two groups: (i) embryos that achieved pregnancy, (ii) embryos which failed to implant. Control and experimental endometrial cell culture plates were treated with the two embryo culture media, with or without 10(-9) mol/l oestradiol and 10(-7) mol/l progesterone for 48 h. Expression of the three subtypes of beta-AR was assessed by RT-PCR. Beta1-AR was expressed in both control and experimental plates; beta2-AR was expressed only in plates incubated with embryonic culture media of embryos which achieved pregnancy, in both hormonal conditions, with or without oestradiol and progesterone. Beta3-AR was not expressed in any condition. Thus secretory products of human embryos may influence gene expression of beta2-AR concentrations in the human endometrium, and this subtype of beta-AR may be involved in implantation."

The forces and energy required to dislodge the restorations were recorded and compared, and the mode of failure noted for each group. Although the pinned restorations required significantly higher loads to dislodge them, the mode of failure and energy required to dislodge the restorations in the Amalgambond and Panavia-Ex groups indicated that these types of restorations had significant advantages over pinned restorations, particularly where the pulp might be compromised. The film thickness of the retentive systems in these two groups, however, indicated a substantial operator or technique sensitivity."

CD010526,0,22414504,0,The influence of composite resin restorations and lining on radiographic diagnosis and decision-making: an in vitro investigation.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of resin-based restorations on the interpretation of digital and conventional radiographic images and to correlate the proposed diagnosis with decision-making. Class II cavities were prepared in one of the proximal surfaces of extracted human molars. Teeth were divided into five groups (n = 10) according to the restoratives used: Natural Flow (NF) and Filtek Supreme (FS); Filtek Flow (FF) and FS; Tetric Flow (TF) and FS; Protect Liner F (PLF) and FS; and FS alone. Bitewing radiographs were taken using conventional and digital systems. Subjective analysis was performed for each surface: no restoration; restored teeth; or restored teeth with gap. Based on the given diagnosis, clinical conduct was then indicated. Material radiopacity was determined according to ISO 4049. A Fisher exact test evaluated the influence of the restoratives on the diagnosis. Means were compared using ANOVA and the Games-Howell test. A Friedman test was used to analyze the influence of the systems on the diagnosis, and a binomial test was used to analyze the association between the presence of gaps and the decision to replace the restoration (P = 0.05). For each system, TF+FS was significantly associated with a high percentage of correct diagnoses. The opposite was the case for PLF+FS, which differed from all other groups. Radiographic systems presented similar behaviors, except for NF+FS. Apart from PLF, adequate radiopacity was observed. Diagnosis was influenced by restorative materials, regardless of the radiographic system used. The low radiopacity of PLF led to a greater number of erroneous diagnoses. Moreover, the decision-making process was influenced strongly by the given diagnosis."

CD010526,0,18389342,0,The interaction of zinc oxide-based dental cements with aqueous solutions of potassium fluoride.,"The ability of zinc oxide-based dental cements (zinc phosphate and zinc polycarboxylate) to take up fluoride from aqueous solution has been studied. Only zinc phosphate cement was found to take up any measurable fluoride after 5 h exposure to the solutions. The zinc oxide filler of the zinc phosphate also failed to take up fluoride from solution. The key interaction for this uptake was thus shown to involve the phosphate groups of the set cement. However, whether this took the form of phosphate/fluoride exchange, or the formation of oxyfluoro-phosphate groups was not clear. Fluoride uptake followed radicaltime kinetics for about 2 h in some cases, but was generally better modelled by the Elovich equation, dq(t)/dt = alpha exp(-betaq(t)). Values for alpha varied from 3.80 to 2.48 x 10(4), and for beta from 7.19 x 10(-3) to 0.1946, though only beta showed any sort of trend, becoming smaller with increasing fluoride concentration. Fluoride was released from the zinc phosphate cements in processes that were diffusion based up to M(t)/M(infinity) of about 0.4. No further release occurred when specimens were placed in fresh volumes of deionised water. Only a fraction of the fluoride taken up was re-released, demonstrating that most of the fluoride taken up becomes irreversibly bound within the cement."

The importance of this technique, which considerably improves the prognosis of the tooth, justifies the quest for new techniques and technologies: the most recent literature reports more predictable results (approximately 90%) with cappings performed using laser of different wavelengths, compared to traditional procedures, which report a success rate of approximately 60%. The purpose of this work is to assess the efficiency of laser technology combined with the use of a self-hardening calcium hydroxide base in pulp capping procedures performed on decayed permanent teeth."
CD010526,0,9610330,0,Microleakage of dentin/amalgam alloy bonding agents: results after 1 year.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 1-year results of the dentin bond (DBS)/viscous resin liner combinations Amalgambond Plus, Tenure/Panavia, Syntac/Dual Cem, and All-Bond 2/Liner F in reducing microleakage in class 5 cavity preparations restored with an admixed or a spherical amalgam alloy and to compare these results to the previously reported short-term (4-day) data from this same study. Class 5 cavity preparations with occlusal margins in enamel and gingival margins in cementum were prepared on extracted human molar teeth. Prepared teeth were distributed randomly into 12 treatment groups (n = 10) consisting of the various DBS/ liners, Copalite, and no liner for each alloy. Samples were stored in saline for 12 months, thermocycled, and stained with dye. Restorations were sectioned and microleakage scored. The DBS/liner combinations, with the exception of Syntac/Dual Cem, had significantly less microleakage with both alloys than Copalite or no liner. Comparing short-term to long-term results within the DBS/liners, only Tenure/ Panavia with Tytin had a significant increase in microleakage scores. These data indicate DBS/ liner combinations can provide significant protection against microleakage under high-copper amalgam alloys for up to 1 year."
CD010526,0,12017177,0,Effect of Er:YAG laser on adhesion of root canal sealers.,"This in vitro study evaluated the effect of Er:YAG laser on adhesion to human dentin of Grossman, Endomethasone, N-Rickert, and Sealer 26 root canal sealers. The crowns of 40 human molars were cut on the occlusal side until a flat dentin surface was obtained. The teeth were divided into two groups: group 1, no laser application; and group 2, irradiation with Er:YAG laser (KaVo Key Laser 2; 11 mm focal distance, perpendicular to the dentin surface, 4 Hz frequency, 200 mJ energy, 62 J total energy and 313 pulses, 1-min application time, and 2.25 W power). Five samples were tested for each sealer and each group. An Instron universal testing machine was used for the adhesion test. Sealer 26 showed the best adhesion both with and without laser application (p < 0.01). Grossman and N-Rickert sealers had intermediate values, and Endomethasone had the worst adhesion. Application of Er:YAG laser did not alter the adhesion of Grossman, N-Rickert, or Endomethasone sealers. However, laser application increased the adhesion of Sealer 26. The epoxy resin-based root canal sealer (Sealer 26) adhered better to dentin prepared with and without Er:YAG laser than the zinc oxide/eugenol-based sealers (Endomethasone, N-Rickert, and Grossman)."
CD010526,0,2076236,0,Fluoride release from amalgam restorations lined with a silver-reinforced glass ionomer.,"This study evaluated the amount of fluoride released from amalgam restorations lined with a silver-reinforced glass ionomer. Thirty human extracted molars were divided into three groups of 10 teeth each. Group 1: Class V cavities were made on the facial surfaces and restored with Dispersalloy amalgam. Group 2: Same as Group 1 except 1 mm of GC Lining glass ionomer cement (GIC) was placed on the axial wall before amalgam insertion. Group 3: Same as Group 2 except 1 mm of Miracle Mix silver-reinforced glass ionomer cement (GIC) was placed on the axial wall before amalgam insertion. Before any treatment, all samples were placed in polyethylene vials with 4 ml of deionized water and thermocycled (100x) for baseline fluoride release levels. After restoration, each tooth was replaced in a vial with 4 ml of deionized water. At weekly intervals, each tooth was removed from its aqueous medium and transferred to another vial containing 4 ml of deionized water. Fluoride release was measured four times at weekly intervals with an Orion #9609 fluoride-ion electrode. At 1 and 4 weeks, Miracle Mix released significantly more fluoride than GC Lining (P less than 0.0001)."
CD010526,0,9484142,0,Comparison of retentiveness of amalgam bonding agent types.,"Previous studies on amalgam bonded restorations indicated that amalgam bonding agents increased the bond strength of amalgam to tooth structure. This in vitro study was designed to compare how the mode of curing and the presence of filler in the resin would affect the bond strength of amalgam. The five test groups of lining agents for amalgam restorations included Chemical-cured, Unfilled resin (CU-Clearfil New Bond); Light-cured, Unfilled resin with a delayed chemical-cure property (LU*-Clearfil Photo Bond); Light-cured, Filled resin with a delayed chemical-cure property (LF*-Clearfil Photo Bond + Protect Liner); Dual-cured, Unfilled resin (DU-All-Bond 2); and Varnish (V-Copalite). For each group, 20 class 5 cavity preparations were cut on the facial, lingual, or proximal surfaces of human molars, which were embedded in acrylic resin. The preparations were 2.5 mm deep and 3 mm wide at the pulpal floor with a slightly divergent taper. After treating the preparation with the bonding agent, a 3/4-inch, 18-gauge flat-headed wire nail was placed into the cavity with the head at the pulpal floor of the preparation, and Tytin amalgam was then condensed into the preparation around the nail. The restorations were stored for 24 hours in distilled water at 37 degrees C and then subjected to 2500 thermal cycles (8 degrees C to 48 degrees C). After 1 week, specimens were tested to failure in tension using an Instron Universal Testing Machine (crosshead speed = 2 mm/min) and peak load (kg) was recorded. The mean loads at failure (+/- SD) were LF* 26.4 (+/- 7.0), DU 23.9 (+/- 6.4), LU* 16.0 (+/- 3.1), CU 14.3 (+/- 8.0), and V 9.5 (+/- 5.6). Significant differences were found using a one-way ANOVA and the Games and Howell post hoc test at a significance level of alpha = 0.05. The LF* and DU groups were not significantly different from each other, but they were significantly higher in peak load than all other groups. LU* was significantly higher than the varnish (V) but not significantly higher than CU. CU was not significantly higher than the varnish (V). The adhesives forming a thicker resin interface (the light-cured resin with filled resin liner and the dual-cured unfilled resin) demonstrated significantly greater retention than the light-cured unfilled resin, chemical-cured unfilled resin, and the varnish control."
CD010526,0,1389341,0,Addition of fresh amalgam to existing amalgam: microleakage study.,"The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adhesive lining materials reduce microleakage in amalgam restorations, and to observe the degree of microleakage at the interface between freshly placed (new) and existing (old) amalgam. Forty-eight specimens were used in the experimental groups. The materials used to study microleakage in this investigation were: copal varnish, a dentin bonding agent (Clearfil New Bond), and a 4-META adhesive (Amalgambond). No significant difference in microleakage was found at the interfaces between freshly placed and existing amalgam. Significantly less microleakage was noted in specimens using the 4-META adhesive and the dentin bonding agent as compared to specimens in which no lining material was placed. Significantly less microleakage was noted in specimens using the 4-META adhesive compared to specimens using cavity varnish."
CD010526,0,2076239,1,Posterior composite and glass ionomer/composite laminate restorations: 2-year clinical results.,"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate and compare the clinical performance of two posterior composite materials, and two placement techniques, unlaminated and laminated to glass ionomer base. Forty Class II carious lesions were randomly assigned for restoration with one of two composites: Status or Ful-Fil; and using one of two techniques: with and without a glass ionomer base. In the 20 restorations using the laminate technique, the glass ionomer base covered the dentin and extended to the cavosurface in the gingival third of the proximal box. The restorations were evaluated clinically at 24 hours, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. The clinical parameters used for the examination were: anatomic form, marginal adaptation, color, secondary caries, marginal discoloration and contact. Bitewing radiographs were taken at 24 hours and at 24 months to evaluate gingival margin discrepancy. Impressions of the restorations were made for fabrication of stone dies. Of the 40 restorations, 38 (95%) were available for evaluation at 24 months. For both materials there was a deterioration in anatomic form, in marginal adaptation, and in marginal discoloration. Anatomic form was significantly worse with Status (P less than 0.05). Of the 20 restorations placed using the laminate technique, two had observable loss of the glass ionomer material. Radiographic radiolucencies were observed for both materials and with both techniques. For the laminate technique, all radiolucencies were between the glass ionomer and the composite. The radiographic observations did not change after the initial evaluation. All the restorations were functioning well at 24 months, but longer observation will be required to determine whether there is a clinically significant difference between the two placement techniques."

A total of 60 restorations were inserted equally in Class I and II preparations and in premolars and molars. A glass ionomer liner was applied to the dentin. Light-cured direct inlays were fabricated in the oral environment. Thirty inlays were heat-treated for 7.5 minutes at 125 degrees C in a dry heat oven. Enamel margins of the preparations were etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel. All inlays were cemented with a light-cured enamel bonding resin. Restorations were evaluated using the USPHS system and M-L indirect scale. Six, 12, 24 and 36-month recalls were compared to baseline. Color, interfacial staining, secondary caries, and wear were unchanged from baseline for all restorations. Marginal integrity and surface texture show a differential change from baseline and with respect to restoration type. Indirect wear was not significantly different between restoration types (P < 0.05). Wear resistance was not significantly improved with heat treatment, but marginal integrity and surface characteristics showed marked improvement in the heat-treated group at 24 and 36-month recalls."
CD010526,0,6943661,0,A 2-year report on caries prevention by fluoride varnishes in a community with fluoridated water.,"The benefit of semi-annual applications of sodium fluoride varnish (Duraphat) and silane fluoride varnish (Fluor Protector) was studied in 11-13 year-old children with life-long exposure to fluoridated drinking water (1-1.2 parts/10(6)). Annual clinical and radiographic examinations were made on 67 children in the Duraphat group and 71 children in the Fluor Protector group. Fluoride varnish was applied semi-annually using the half-mouth technique. At the end of 2 years, the mean overall DMFS-increments on the control side and test side of the Duraphat group were 5.0 and 3.8 (p less than 0.01), respectively, and of the Fluor Protector group 3.7 and 3.3 (NS). The caries reductions were 24% and 12%, respectively. Since there were no differences between initial mean DMFS scores of the groups, it was assumed that lower increments in the Fluor Protector group were due to Fluoride ions crossing the midline and providing protection on the control side as well. When increments in the Duraphat control side and the Fluor Protector test side were compared, the caries reduction of Fluor Protector was 35% (p less than 0.01). Fluoride varnishes provide additional benefit even when fluoride intake from drinking water is optimal."

CD010526,0,11203863,0,Retentive strength of an amalgam bonding agent: chemical vs light vs dual curing.,"Dentin bonding agents have been shown to enhance retention of amalgam restorations by mechanical means. Little research is available on which mode of curing may optimize amalgam bonding. This in vitro study compared the bond strengths exhibited by three variations of a bonding agent, each using a different curing mode, with two earlier versions of amalgam resin liners and cavity varnish. The six test groups of lining agents for amalgam restorations included [C] chemical-cured, [L] light-cured and [D] dual-cured versions of one filled adhesive resin (Clearfil Liner Bond 2V), [LF] Light-cured, Filled resin (Clearfil Liner Bond 2, Kuraray Co.); [LCF] Light- and Chemical-cured, Filled resin Clearfil Liner Bond + Protect Liner, Kuraray Co) and [V] Varnish (Copalite, Cooley & Cooley, Ltd). For each group, 20 Class V cavity preparations were cut in human molars. The preparations were 2.5 mm deep and 3 mm wide at the pulpal floor, with a slightly divergent taper. After treating the preparation with the bonding agent, a 3/4 inch, 18 gauge flat-headed wire nail was seated in the cavity with its head at the pulpal floor of the preparation, and Tytin amalgam (Kerr Corp, Romulus, MI) was condensed into the preparation around the nail. All restorations were stored for 24 hours in distilled water at 37 degrees C, then subjected to 2500 thermal cycles (8 degrees C to 58 degrees C). After one week the samples were tested to failure in tension using an Instron Universal Testing Machine (crosshead speed = 2 mm/min) and peak load (kg) was recorded. Significant differences in retention were found using ANOVA and the Games & Howell post hoc test (p = 0.05). The mean loads at failure (+/- SD) were C 13.1 (+/- 2.4), L 21.8 (+/- 6.1), D 26.8 (+/- 7.4), LCF 23.8 (+/- 7.4), LF 21.4 (+/- 3.3) and V 2.0 (+/- 1.8). All dentin-bonding agents exhibited significantly greater retention than the varnish. While the bond strengths of the dual cured (D) and the light-cured (L) liners were not significantly different from one another, both were significantly higher than the chemically-cured (C) resin liner in terms of retention."

CD010526,0,19196659,0,Antineoplastic activity of lentiviral vectors expressing interferon-alpha in a preclinical model of primary effusion lymphoma.,"The peculiar site of development of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) highlights a specific role of body cavities in the pathogenesis of this neoplasia. We used a xenograft murine model of PEL to characterize the contribution of the host microenvironment to PEL growth. The activity of a murine (ie, host-specific) interferon-alpha(1) (IFN-alpha(1))-expressing lentiviral vector (mIFN-alpha(1)-LV) was compared with that of a human (h) IFN-alpha(2)b-LV. LVs efficiently delivered the transgene to PEL cells and conferred long-term transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of PEL-injected severe combined immunodeficiency mice with hIFN-alpha(2)b-LV significantly prolonged mice survival and reduced ascites development. Interestingly, mIFN-alpha(1)-LV showed an antineoplastic activity comparable with that observed with hIFN-alpha(2)b-LV. As mIFN-alpha(1) retained species-restricted activity in vitro, it probably acted in vivo on the intracavitary murine milieu. mIFN-alpha(1)-treated murine mesothelial cells were found to express tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and to significantly trigger apoptosis of cocultured PEL cells in a tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-dependent manner. These data suggest that the interaction between lymphomatous and mesothelial cells lining the body cavities may play a key role in PEL growth control and also indicate that the specific targeting of microenvironment may impair PEL development."

Dental cements containing calcium phosphate promote remineralization. This study evaluated the in vivo remineralization capacity of resin-based calcium-phosphate cement (Ca-P) used for indirect pulp-capping. Carious and sound teeth indicated for extraction were randomly restored with the Ca-P base or without base (control), followed by adhesive restoration. Study teeth were extracted after three months, followed by elemental analysis of the cavity floor. Mineral content of affected or sound dentin at the cavity floor was quantified by electron probe micro-analysis to 100-mum depth. After three months, caries-affected dentin underneath the Ca-P base showed significantly increased calcium and phosphorus content to a depth of 30 mum. Mineral content of treated caries-affected dentin was in the range of healthy dentin, revealing the capacity of Ca-P base to promote remineralization of caries-affected dentin."

CD010526,0,27047750,0,Experimentally optimized threading structures of the proton-coupled folate transporter.,"The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT, SLC46A1) transports folic acid across the plasma membrane, together with an excess of protons such that the net charge translocation is positive. We developed 3D structural models of PCFT threaded onto the X-ray structures of major facilitator superfamily (MFS) members that were identified as close structural homologues. The model of PCFT threaded onto the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT) structure is consistent with detailed accessibility studies in the absence of extracellular substrate and at pH 7.4 presented here, and additionally with a multitude of other mutagenesis and functional studies. Characteristic MFS structural features are preserved in this PCFT model, such as 12 transmembrane helices divided into two pseudosymmetric bundles, and a high density of positive charges on the periphery of the cytoplasmic site that allow interactions with negatively charged lipid head-groups. Under the experimental conditions, PCFT predominantly samples the resting state, which in this case is inward-open. Several positions lining the substrate cavity have been identified. Motif A, a helix-turn-helix motif that is a hallmark of MFS transporters between transmembrane segments II and III is oriented appropriately to interact with residues from transmembrane segments IV as well as XI upon conformational transition to the outward-open state. A charge-relay system between three charged residues as well as apposing glycines in two α-helices, both contributed to by motif A, become engaged when PCFT is modeled on the outward-open state of a putative proton-driven transporter (YajR)."
CD010526,0,1291393,0,An in vitro comparative analysis: scanning electron microscopy of dentin/restoration interfaces.,"One hundred maxillary premolar teeth were randomly allocated to ten groups. Each group was restored with one of ten different restorative techniques. The teeth were stored in deionized water for 7d prior to longitudinal sectioning in a mesio-distal plane. Following sectioning, ten specimens from each group were chosen at random from the 20 available sections. The sectioned surfaces were polished using 600-grit SiC abrasive paper and etched for 10 s with 50% phosphoric acid to remove the smear layer produced by sectioning. Five tooth sections from the dentin bonding resin groups were allowed to dry at 20 degrees C for 24h. The glass ionomer-based groups were reimmersed in deionized water during this period. The remaining five sections from each group were replicated using an addition-cure vinyl polysiloxane impression material and an epoxy resin. A comparison was made of the sections and the replicas. All tooth specimens were sputter-coated with gold for 4 min and examined using a scanning electron microscope. Replicas were gold-coated for 3 min. Different tooth/restoration interfaces, associated with different materials, were observed. A marked difference between the replicas and tooth sections was observed for glass ionomer-based restorations but not for resin-based bonding systems. Representative samples of replicas and specimens are shown, and the significance of the observed differences is discussed."

CD010526,0,2638272,0,Technical note: antimicrobial action of glass-ionomer lining cement on S. sanguis and S. mutans.,"There are a number of glass-ionomer lining cements available to the profession. It is generally agreed that the glass-ionomer cements demonstrate reasonably good biocompatibility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of six glass-ionomer cements on S. sanguis and S. mutans. Forty-eight plates of TSA-SRBC (10%), each with 3.0-mm-diam. wells, were divided into two groups (1 and 2) of 24 each. Group 1 was inoculated with S. sanguis (10558) and Group 2 with S. mutans (6715-13 w.t.). Each well was filled with 4.0 mg of one of the following liners: Glassic (A), Shofu lining cement (B), GC lining cement (C), Ever Bond (D), Gingiva Seal (E), and Ketac Bond (F); the empty wells served as control. Plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees C, and checked daily over seven days for inhibition zones. Average inhibition zones (mm) at 7 days were as follows: Group 1-1A = 10.00, 1B = 7.83, 1C = 18.50, 1D = 13.00, 1E = 8.67, and 1F = 9.33; Group 2-2A = 3.08, 2B = 10.25, 2C = 12.75, 2D = 15.58, 2E = 8.83, and 2F = 3.20. All control wells were 0.0 GC liner and Ever Bond showed significantly greater overall inhibition of microbial growth than did other tested liners (p less than 0.5). A one-way ANOVA and SNK test showed that all tested liners were significantly more toxic toward S. sanguis than toward S. mutans (p less than 0.05)."
CD010526,0,19089285,0,Comparative SEM evaluation of three solvents used in endodontic retreatment: an ex vivo study.,"This study compared, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the efficacy of three solvents on the removal of filling materials from dentinal tubules during endodontic retreatment. Forty human maxillary canines with straight canals were prepared according to a crown-down technique and enlarged to a#30 apical file size, before obturation with gutta-percha and a zinc-oxide-eugenol based sealer. The samples were stored for 3 months before being randomly assigned to four groups: chloroform (n=10), orange oil (n=10), eucalyptol (n=10) and control (n=10). Solvents were applied to a reservoir created on the coronal root third using Gates Glidden drills. The total time for retreatment using the solvents was 5 minutes per tooth. Following retreatment the roots were split longitudinally for SEM evaluation. SEM images were digitized, analyzed using Image ProPlus 4.5 software, and the number of dentinal tubules free of filling material from the middle and apical thirds was recorded. No significant difference was found among the solvent groups regarding the number of dentinal tubules free of root filling remnants in the middle and apical root thirds (p>0.05). However, the control group had fewer dentinal tubules free of filling material (p<0.05). Under the tested conditions, it may be concluded that there was no significant difference among the solvents used to obtain dentinal tubules free of filling material remnants."

CD010526,0,8425985,0,Effect of a resin lining and rebonding on the marginal leakage of amalgam restorations.,"This in vitro study compared microleakage in Class V amalgam restorations with three different lining agents and with no lining agent, with and without resin rebonding of the margins. Eight groups of ten molars were divided into four pairs of groups. Class V preparations were cut in the facial surfaces of each molar so that the occlusal margin was in enamel and the gingival margin in dentine. The preparations in one pair of groups received no lining agent; the preparations in the remaining three pairs of groups were lined with one of the following: Copalite, Universal Bond 3 (UB3) Primer and Adhesive, or UB3 Primer only. The enamel walls of the preparations receiving the UB3 Primer and Adhesive were etched prior to applying the lining material. Amalgam was hand condensed into each preparation. In one of each pair of groups, the margins of restorations were treated with 37% phosphoric acid gel, rinsed and dried, and UB3 Adhesive was applied over amalgam and tooth margins and polymerized (rebonded). Specimens were thermocycled, stained and sectioned. Microleakage was graded using a stereomicroscope. Mean microleakage scores for occlusal and gingival margins were calculated and analysed. At enamel margins, non-rebonded Copalite and all rebonded specimens showed less microleakage than the other non-rebonded groups. The group lined with UB3 Primer only and rebonded showed significantly less (P < 0.01) microleakage at enamel margins than all the other groups except the group lined with Copalite and rebonded. At cementum/dentine margins, restorations lined with UB3 Primer and rebonded showed significantly less microleakage than the other groups."

In 30 extracted caries-free human molars, preparation for 60 mesio-occlusal and occluso-distal cavities (two cavities per tooth) occurred. With a CEREC 3 laser triangulation sensor and software-based construction analysis, the dimensions of the cavities at seven defined sites were measured. The cavities were randomized into four groups. Group 1 was restored with Ketac-Fil glass-ionomer cement, Group 2 with amalgam and Group 3 with Compoglass F compomer. In Group 4, Compoglass F was used in combination with photochromic Tetric Flow Chroma as a cavity liner. The completed restorations were then removed using 2x magnification and the cavities were once again controlled using the laser system. The duration of the removal procedure was also recorded. Changes in cavity dimensions (depth, height and width) following removal of the restorations were significantly smaller in Groups 1 and 2. Groups 3 and 4 were characterized by a significant overextension of the cavities compared to Groups 1 and 2 in all three dimensions. Group 4, with Tetric Flow Chroma as a cavity liner, showed better results than Group 3, but this improvement was not statistically significant.

CD010526,0,17910217,0,Clinical assessment of postoperative sensitivity in posterior composite restorations.,"This incidence of postoperative sensitivity was evaluated in resin-based posterior restorations. Two hundred and ninety-two direct restorations were evaluated in premolars and molars. A total of 143 Class I and 149 Class II restorations (MO/OD and MOD) were placed in patients ranging in age from 30 to 50 years. After the cavity preparations were completed, a rubber dam was placed, and the preparations were restored using a total-etch system (Prime & Bond NT) and a resin-based restorative material (TPH Spectrum). The patients were contacted after 24 hours and 7, 30 and 90 days postoperatively and questioned regarding the presence of sensitivity and the stimuli that triggered that sensitivity. The Chi-square and Fisher's Exact Test were used for statistical analysis. Evaluation at 24 hours after restorative treatment revealed statistically significant differences among the types of cavity preparations restored and the occurrence of postoperative sensitivity (p = 0.0003), with a higher frequency of sensitivity in Class II MOD restorations (26%), followed by Class II MO/DO (15%) and Class I restorations (5%). At 7, 30 and 90 days after restorative treatment, there was a decrease in the occurrence of sensitivity for all groups. The percentage of sensitivity among the groups was not significantly different.

Thirty single-rooted teeth were instrumented to a master apical file #25 using 2.5% NaOCl as main irrigant and 17% trisodium EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) as final agent irrigant. Then, the root canals were dressed with Ca(OH)(2) associated with silicone oil (Group 1), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (Group 2), or propylene glycol (Group 3). After coronal sealing, all teeth were kept in a moist environment at room temperature. After 7 days, the teeth were reopened and medicaments were removed using 5 mL of saline solution and instrumentation with master apical file followed by new irrigation with 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl. Subsequently, teeth were split longitudinally and assessed by scanning electron microscopy. The wall cleanliness of the cervical and apical thirds of the roots were evaluated and scored by three blinded examiners. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests at 5% level of significance. All roots had residues of Ca(OH)(2) on the canal walls.

CD010526,0,2503551,0,"Marginal leakage of Class II glass-ionomer-silver restorations, with and without posterior composite coverage: an in vitro study.","The aims of this in vitro investigation were: 1) to assess marginal leakage around three types of class II restorations, using: a) a composite resin with a glass ionomer lining; b) a glass ionomer cerment with composite resin coverage; c) a glass ionomer cermet without composite resin coverage and 2) to study the effect of thermocycling on marginal defects, by means of radiographs and SEM micrographs of the margins. Fifty-eight class II cavities were prepared in extracted primary molars. The teeth were divided into three groups and restored as follows: Group A--Ketac Bond (liner) and P-30; Group B--Ketac Silver and P-30(sandwich); Group C--Ketac Silver only. The restored teeth were thermocycled and marginal leakage was assessed from the degree of dye penetration on the sections. Dye penetration at the occlusal margins increased in the sequence A less than B less than C. The differences between group C and Groups A and B were statistically significant. Severe penetration of the dye was observed at the cervical margins with no statistically differences between the groups. Deterioration of margins due to thermocycling was observed for all groups, but these defects were not evident on the radiographs. Ketac Silver with and without composite coverage did not prevent marginal leakage when utilized in class II restorations in vitro."

CD010526,0,25095310,0,Minimally invasive clinical approach in indirect pulp therapy and healing of deep carious lesions.,"Indirect pulp treatment is a conservative vital pulp procedure performed in deep carious lesion approximating the pulp, but without signs or symptoms of pulp degeneration. Removing the carious biomass along with sealing the residual caries from extrinsic substrate and oral bacteria makes residual caries after the first excavation less active. This allows time for pulpo dentinal complex to form tertiary dentine so that at the second excavation, there is less likelihood of pulpal exposure. It has also been suggested that by changing the cavity environment from an active lesion into a more slowly progressing lesion, will be accompanied by more regular tubular tertiary dentin formation. The success of this approach has been demonstrated by various randomized controlled studies comparing conventional treatment of such lesions with stepwise excavation. These results are echoed at clinical, radiographic, macroscopic, microscopic and ultrastructural level during follow up visits. This study reviews promising concepts and rationale of minimally invasive indirect pulp therapy technique where conventional wisdom of caries removal is challenged"

In the study two resin modified glass-ionomers and two flowable compomers were used to prepare standardized 20 cylinderic samples. Samples were divided into four groups. Surface treatments with APF gel for experimental groups (group B,C,D) or distilled water as a control (group A) were performed four times. In group B, only APF gel was applied. In group C, after the APF gel application, the samples were immersed into the demineralizing and remineralizing solutions. In group D, before the APF gel application, the buffer solution was applied. The examinations of the surface micromorphology of the materials were made by using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results showed that in group B all of the materials except Compoglass Flow, and in group C all of the materials showed erratic behaviours. In group D, severe erratic effect (score 2) was obtained on the surfaces of Vivaglassliner and Dyract Flow, and for the others score 1 signals were found. The moderate degradation was obtained by applying of only APF gel on the surfaces of both material groups. The addition of pH circulation caused increasing of micromorphologic changes on the surfaces of all materials. The effect of application of buffer solution on the surfaces before APF gel changed according to the materials. If acidulated fluoride gel is preferred for prophylactic therapy in patients' mouth, for the success, either buffer or neutral fluoride have to be applied on the restored teeth by resin based materials before acidulated fluoride application."
CD010526,0,26264630,0,"Clinical, radiographic, and histologic analysis of the effects of acemannan used in direct pulp capping of human primary teeth: short-term outcomes.","Acemannan has been previously reported as a direct pulp-capping agent in animal study. This natural material demonstrated its biocompatibility and enhanced reparative dentin formation. The objective of this study was to investigate the action of acemannan as a direct pulp-capping material in human primary teeth with deep caries. Forty-two deeply carious mandibular primary molars from 37 children, aged 7-11 years old diagnosed with reversible pulpitis were studied. After completely removing the infected dentine, teeth with a pinpoint pulpal exposure were randomly divided into two treatment groups: acemannan or calcium hydroxide. A glass-ionomer cement base was applied to all teeth prior to restoration with stainless steel crowns. Clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed 6 months post-treatment. The teeth due to exfoliate were extracted and histopathologically evaluated for inflammation, dentine bridge formation, and soft tissue organization. At 6 months, the overall clinical and radiographic success rates of direct pulp capping with acemannan and calcium hydroxide at 6 months were 72.73 and 70.0 %, respectively. The histopathological results indicated that the acemannan-treated group had significantly better histopathological responses compared with the calcium hydroxide-treated group (p < 0.05). These data suggest acemannan offers a valuable alternative biomaterial for vital pulp therapy in primary teeth."

The effect of a calcium hydroxide liner and a dentinal desensitizing agent (potassium oxalate) on crown retention was investigated. Gold crowns were cemented on standardized crown preparations with zinc phosphate cement, glass-ionomer cement, or one of two resin cements. A tensile force was applied until separation occurred. The mean applied force at rupture varied greatly among the groups, indicating that the pulpal protection agent may have a distinct effect on the retention of cast restorations. In addition, other clinical factors, such as angle of convergence, crown height, and total surface area of the tooth should be considered."

CD010526,0,25162049,0,Feasibility tests on concrete with very-high-volume supplementary cementitious materials.,"The objective of this study is to examine the compressive strength and durability of very high-volume SCM concrete. The prepared 36 concrete specimens were classified into two groups according to their designed 28-day compressive strength. For the high-volume SCM, the FA level was fixed at a weight ratio of 0.4 and the GGBS level varied between the weight ratio of 0.3 and 0.5, which resulted in 70-90% replacement of OPC. To enhance the compressive strength of very high-volume SCM concrete at an early age, the unit water content was controlled to be less than 150 kg/m(3), and a specially modified polycarboxylate-based water-reducing agent was added. Test results showed that as SCM ratio (R SCM) increased, the strength gain ratio at an early age relative to the 28-day strength tended to decrease, whereas that at a long-term age increased up to R SCM of 0.8, beyond which it decreased. In addition, the beneficial effect of SCMs on the freezing-and-thawing and chloride resistances of the concrete decreased at R SCM of 0.9. Hence, it is recommended that R SCM needs to be restricted to less than 0.8-0.85 in order to obtain a consistent positive influence on the compressive strength and durability of SCM concrete."

Unlike low-viscosity glass-ionomers, high-viscosity glass-ionomer cements (HVGIC) are placed as sealants by pressing the material into pits and fissures with a petroleum-jelly-coated index finger. Hence, HVGIC sealants are assumed to penetrate pits and fissures deeper, resulting in a higher material retention rate, which may increase its caries-preventive effect."
CD010526,0,2150073,0,Bond strength of a light-cured and two auto-cured glass ionomer liners.,"Ninety-nine extracted human molar teeth were used in this study comparing the shear bond strengths on dentine of one light-cured and two auto-cured polyalkenoate (glass ionomer) cements. Bond strength can be influenced by differences in tooth structure. A balanced-incomplete block design (Hull and Nie, 1981) was used to reduce variation attributable to such differences. Cements were applied to paired dentine surfaces in combinations such that 66 tooth sides were treated with each material. A light-cured dentinal adhesive and composite resin restorative material were then placed and shear bond strength testing was conducted exactly 24 h after the completion of each specimen. Mean forces (MPa) for the three materials were compared using an appropriate analysis of variance model (balanced-incomplete-blocks) The shear bond strengths (MPa) of the light-cured liner (Espe, Seefeld/Oberbay, FRG) was 4.71 +/- 1.16. Vitrabond showed the greatest variance of all three materials tested, however this material's average bond strength was greater than the maximum achieved for the other materials. Student-Newman-Keuls comparison of means showed that all cements differed significantly from each other (alpha = 0.05). It is concluded that the light-cured glass ionomer liner exhibited significantly better shear bond strength performance than the two auto-cured glass ionomers tested."

CD010526,0,15470882,0,Effects of pH on the surface texture of glass ionomer based/containing restorative materials.,"This study determined the effect of pH on the surface texture of commonly used posterior glass-ionomer based/containing restorative materials. The materials evaluated included a compomer (Dyract AP), a giomer (Beautifil) and two highly viscous glass ionomer cements (Fuji IX and Ketac Molar). A resin composite (Esthet-X) was used for comparison. Forty-two specimens (3-mm wide x 3-mm long x 2-mm deep) were made for each material. The specimens were divided into six groups and conditioned in the following solutions at 37 degrees C for one week: Citric acid (pH 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and distilled water (pH 7). After conditioning, the surface roughness (Ra, microm) of each specimen was measured using a surface profilometer (Surftest, Mitutoyo Corp, Tokyo, Japan). Data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Scheffe's test at a significance level of 0.05. The effects of pH on the surface texture of glass-ionomer based/containing restoratives were material dependent. Ra values ranged from 0.02 microm to 0.15 microm and 0.03 microm to 4.40 microm for pH 7 and 2, respectively. With the exception of the composite, the surface roughness of all materials evaluated was significantly affected by acids of low pH. The surface texture of highly viscous glass ionomer cements deteriorated significantly when conditioned in solutions of low pH, which makes them more susceptible to clinical failure."

Thereafter, the restored teeth were subjected to a bacterial or acid broth in vitro carious challenge for 36 days. Resin cast impressions were made of the restoration margin of each specimen before and after the carious challenge giving a total of 240 replicas. The replicas were examined in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the margins subjected to seven marginal assessment procedures: (i) ranking using micrographs of the margin; (ii) percentage length of marginal discrepancy; (iii) Mjor assessment using six groups; (iv) number of margin segments showing a discrepancy; (v) greatest gap size; (vi) ranking based firstly on gap size and then number of margin segments showing a discrepancy; and (vii) ranking based firstly on gap size and then percentage length of marginal discrepancy. The data from procedures (i), (ii), (vi) and (vii) were examined using one-way ANOVA; a linear logistic statistical analysis examined data from procedures (iii)-(v). Statistical significance was chosen at P < 0.05. It was found that procedure (vii) was able to discriminate between variables to a greater degree than all other procedures.

Forty single-rooted extracted teeth were prepared and obturated with sealer and gutta-percha. These teeth were divided into two groups of teeth 20 each. A post space was prepared for each tooth so that 5 to 6 mm of gutta-percha remained in one group and 3 to 4 mm in the other group. To the latter group, 2 to 3 mm of zinc oxide-eugenol cement base was placed directly coronal to the gutta-percha. The sealer was allowed to set for 48 h and the outer root surfaces of the teeth were covered with finger nail varnish and sticky wax, except for the access openings. The teeth were immersed in dye for 1 wk to allow coronal microleakage. The specimens were sectioned and measurements were made on the extent of dye penetration into the root filling.

CD010526,0,22848036,0,Effects of calcium phosphate endodontic sealers on the behavior of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts and MG63 osteoblast-like cells.,"In regard to biological properties of endodontic sealers, there are many characteristics that should be considered. The aim of this study was to examine the biological effects of new calcium phosphate-based root canal sealers, CAPSEAL I and CAPSEAL II (CPS), on human periodontal fibroblast cells by examining the expression levels of inflammatory mediators and to compare the effects of CPS on the viability and osteogenic potential of human osteoblast MG63 cells compared to those of other commercially available calcium phosphate sealers [Apatite Root Sealer type I (ARS I) and Apatite Root Sealer III (ARS III); Sankin Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan] and a zinc oxide eugenol-based sealer (Pulp Canal Sealer EWT [PCS EWT]; Kerr, Detroit, MI). The levels of IL-6 in the new CPS group (CAPSEAL I, II) were higher than those in the control and all experimental groups at all time points after 2 h. TGF-β1 and FGF-1 levels decreased at 72 h compared to the levels in the control, in cells treated with every sealers except ARS I. The new CPS sealers showed low cytotoxicity. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that CAPSEAL I, II, and Apatite Root Sealer type III induced expression of early stage markers of differentiation (alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin) at 7 days. Also, new CPS showed higher mineralized nodule formation at 28 days. These results suggest that CAPSEAL I and II facilitate the periapical dentoalveolar and alveolar healing by controlling cellular mediators from PDL cells and osteoblast differentiation of precursor cells."

CD010526,0,14601476,0,[Comparative analysis of elastic materials for lining of removable dental prosthesis in vitro].,"This work has dealt with the in vitro physicochemical, elastic, and microbiological properties of polymer lining materials used in dental prosthetics. Representatives of two soft polymer groups were analyzed: Vertex Soft NF, a plastified acrylic polymer, and Molloplast B, a silicon elastomer. Vertex Rapid Simplified and Triplex--two acrylic polymers routinely used at the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry were chosen as representatives of rigid acrylic material. The laminar plates of the denture are lined with elastic material to reduce wear discomfort and eliminate symptoms associated with compression of the oral mucosa by the denture. Wear-dependent deterioration in physicochemical, elastic, and microbiological properties presents as prosthetic stomatopathies due to the combined action of mechanical lesions, fungal growth, and toxicity of components of the denture, necessitating replacement of the denture. Samples used in this study were prepared at the Department of Dental Prosthetics, Pomeranian Academy of Medicine. The process of polymerization was carried out strictly as recommended by the manufacturers. The in vitro analyses were done at the Polymer Institute, Technical University of Szczecin, and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pomeranian Academy of Medicine. A special system was used to reproduce conditions in the oral cavity and study their effects on the elastic liners. Samples were placed in the chamber for varying periods, depending on the type of test and material. Thermodynamic analysis was done to confirm proper polymerization and hardening. Time-dependent loss of contact between the elastic liner and rigid denture under tangential (shear) and normal (tear) stress applied to the liner-denture interface was examined. Resistance was studied using INSTRON model 4206-006 universal testing machine. Compressive changes in elastic properties of the soft materials were examined by calculating Young's modulus. Changes in viscoelastic properties of the materials depending on temperature and frequency were followed using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). A precision microbalance from Sartorius (+/- 0.00001 g) was used to measure time-dependent changes in weight and sorption of water. Adhesion of Candida albicans to the rigid and soft acrylic materials was determined after incubation for 3, 6 or 24 h at 37 degrees C. The study has shown that adhesive strength is much greater for acryl-acryl than acryl-silicon interface. Elastic properties of Molloplast B are very stable and superior to those of Vertex Soft NF. Time-dependent sorption of water and changes in weight have confirmed the stable nature of Molloplast B. Adhesion of Candida albicans to Vertex Soft NF was less noticeable."

Using only composite (Filtek Z350), specimens (10 mm long x 2 mm wide x 2 mm thick) in the control group were produced. Two GICs (Vitremer and Vitrebond) were used with the composite to prepare the test groups. Flexural strength and flexural fatigue limit (FFL) tests were performed. The FFL was determined using the staircase method. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. There was a significant difference in flexural strength values between the composite-only specimens and those produced by composite and GIC (p < 0.05). No statistical difference was observed in the flexural strength values between composite with Vitremer and composite with Vitrebond (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were detected in FFL values between composite with Vitremer and composite with Vitrebond; in addition, the mean value of the composite-only specimens differed statistically from those of both composite with Vitremer and composite with Vitrebond (p < 0.05). The FFL was lower than the flexural strength, indicating a decrease in flexural strength of 45 to 50%. Using GICs with composite decreased the mechanical properties (FFL and flexural strength) of the composite."
CD010526,0,8054183,0,Effect of occlusal load cycling on the marginal integrity of adhesive Class V restorations.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the gingival wall marginal integrity of adhesive Class V restorations subjected to occlusal load cycling. Extracted lower first and second molar teeth were used. For each tooth, a Class V cavity was prepared in the buccal or lingual surface with the gingival margin in the cementum. The cavities were restored with eight different adhesive systems: (1) Ketac-Fil; (2) Fuji II LC; (3) Ketac-Bond/Pertac; (4) Photac-Bond/Pertac; (5) Scotchbond 2/P50; (6) Scotchbond Multi-Purpose/P50; (7) Clearfil Liner Bond/Clearfil Photo Posterior; and (8) OptiBond/Herculite XR. For each material-combination, three test procedures were carried out: no loading (control), loading at 125 N and at 250 N. Six specimens were prepared for each procedure. The samples were loaded for 5000 cycles in a dye solution and kept in the dye for 24 hours after loading. Control samples were stored in the dye for the same period. All teeth were sectioned and dye penetration at the gingival wall was scored from 0 to 4. Under control condition, only groups 2, 6, 7 and 8 showed perfect marginal integrity. After loading at 125 N, groups 1, 3 and 5 showed significant increase in leakage (P < 0.05). Increasing the load to 250 N resulted in significant deterioration in the marginal adaptation of all test groups, except 6 and 7. This study indicates that the marginal integrity of occlusally stressed adhesive Class V restorations can only be preserved by a few products."

CD010526,0,16317555,0,Dissolving efficacy of organic solvents on root canal sealers.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the solubility of three types of root canal sealers in three organic solvents used in endodontics. The solubility of calcium-hydroxide-based (Sealer 26), silicon-polydimethylsiloxane-based (RoekoSeal), and zinc-oxide-eugenol based (Endofill and Intrafill) sealers was assessed in eucalyptol, xylol, orange oil, and distilled water. Eighty samples of each filling material were prepared according to the manufacturers' instructions and then divided into four groups for immersion in solvent for 2 or 10 min. The means of sealer dissolution in solvents were obtained by the difference between the original preimmersion weight and the postimmersion weight in a digital analytical scale. Data were statistically analyzed with the Student's t test, and multiple comparisons were performed with Student-Newman-Keuls. Xylol and orange oil showed similar effects, with significant solubilization (P<0.05) of the tested cements. Endofill and Sealer 26 did not show any significant difference in solubilization at the two immersion times, whereas RoekoSeal and Intrafill showed a more pronounced solubility at 10 min. The lowest levels of solubilization occurred in RoekoSeal, Sealer 26, Endofill, and Intrafill. It is concluded that xylol and orange oil presented similar solvent effects with a significant solubility of the tested cements."

CD010526,0,28287572,0,Rapid Mix Preparation of Bioinspired Nanoscale Hydroxyapatite for Biomedical Applications.,"Hydroxyapatite (HA) has been widely used as a medical ceramic due to its good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. Recently there has been interest regarding the use of bioinspired nanoscale hydroxyapatite (nHA). However, biological apatite is known to be calcium-deficient and carbonate-substituted with a nanoscale platelet-like morphology. Bioinspired nHA has the potential to stimulate optimal bone tissue regeneration due to its similarity to bone and tooth enamel mineral. Many of the methods currently used to fabricate nHA both in the laboratory and commercially, involve lengthy processes and complex equipment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a rapid and reliable method to prepare high quality bioinspired nHA. The rapid mixing method developed was based upon an acid-base reaction involving calcium hydroxide and phosphoric acid. Briefly, a phosphoric acid solution was poured into a calcium hydroxide solution followed by stirring, washing and drying stages. Part of the batch was sintered at 1,000 °C for 2 h in order to investigate the products' high temperature stability. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the successful formation of HA, which showed thermal decomposition to β-tricalcium phosphate after high temperature processing, which is typical for calcium-deficient HA. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the presence of carbonate groups in the precipitated product. The nHA particles had a low aspect ratio with approximate dimensions of 50 x 30 nm, close to the dimensions of biological apatite. The material was also calcium deficient with a Ca:P molar ratio of 1.63, which like biological apatite is lower than the stoichiometric HA ratio of 1.67. This new method is therefore a reliable and far more convenient process for the manufacture of bioinspired nHA, overcoming the need for lengthy titrations and complex equipment. The resulting bioinspired HA product is suitable for use in a wide variety of medical and consumer health applications."
CD010526,0,27119759,0,Solubility and bacterial sealing ability of MTA and root-end filling materials.,"Objective To evaluate solubility and sealing ability of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and root-end filling materials. Material and Methods The materials evaluated were: MTA, Calcium Silicate Cement with zirconium oxide (CSC/ZrO2), and zinc oxide/eugenol (ZOE). Solubility test was performed according to ANSI/ADA. The difference between initial and final mass of the materials was analyzed after immersion in distilled water for 7 and 30 days. Retrograde cavities in human teeth with single straight root canal were performed by using ultrasonic tip CVD 9.5107-8. The cavities were filled with the evaluated materials to evaluate sealing ability using the bacterial leakage test with Enterococcus faecalis. Bacterial leakage was evaluated every 24 hours for six weeks observing the turbidity of Brain Heart infusion (BHI) medium in contact with root apex. Data were submitted to ANOVA followed by Tukey tests (solubility), and Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (sealing ability) at a 5% significance level. Results For the 7-day period, ZOE presented highest solubility when compared with the other groups (p<0.05). For the 30-day period, no difference was observed among the materials. Lower bacterial leakage was observed for MTA and CSC/ZrO2, and both presented better results than ZOE (p<0.05). Conclusion MTA and CSC/ZrO2 presented better bacterial sealing capacity, which may be related to lower initial solubility observed for these materials in relation to ZOE."

Twenty-seven teeth scheduled for extraction for periodontal reasons were treated in vivo. The sample teeth were divided at random into three groups. Group 1 was treated with All Bond 2 (AB2) + Z-100 composite, group 2 with Scotchbond Multipurpose Plus (SMPP) + Z-100, and group 3 with AB2 in conjunction with Bisfil 2B as liner and Z-100. The in vivo restored teeth were extracted after 2-3 months of clinical service. They were then immersed in a dye solution for 24 h, sectioned, and scored for marginal leakage. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between the three groups both at cervical and incisal sites. The enamel sites were free from any leakage. Only two cervical sites of groups 1 and 2 and one of group 3 showed a score 1 for leakage. The results of the short-term clinical performance of the three systems were promising."

Class II preparations (MO and DO) were placed in 30 teeth. Half had the cervical margin placed 1 mm below the CEJ, the remaining had cervical margins 2 mm above the CEJ. The preparations were randomly restored using three techniques: 1) Glass ionomer liner and posterior composite resin; 2) Glass ionomer silver cermet placed in the proximal box to the contact area and the remainder restored with posterior composite resin; 3) Glass ionomer silver cermet only. All 30 teeth were loaded with 17 kg, thermocycled and stored in 37 degrees C solution for 30 days. The teeth were again loaded, immersed in 2% basic fuchsin solution for 24 hours, sectioned and photographed. Microleakage was calculated, according to the depth of dye penetration. Results demonstrated Techniques 1 and 2 to have less marginal leakage than Technique 3 when preparations remained in enamel and Techniques 1, 2 and 3 when preparations were below the CEJ. The chi-square test indicated a statistically significant difference between restoration technique and marginal microleakage (P less than 0.001)."

Class V preparations in extracted upper premolars were used and ten restorations were used for each of the following groups: (i) two layers of copal varnish and amalgam; (ii) conventional glass-ionomer and amalgam; (iii) light-cured glass-ionomer and amalgam; (iv) bonding agent and light-cured composite resin; (v) conventional glass-ionomer, bonding agent and light-cured composite resin; (vi) light-cured glass-ionomer, extended 0.3 mm short of the enamel margin bonding agent and light-cured composite resin; and (vii) light-cured glass-ionomer, extended 1 mm short of the enamel margin, bonding agent and light-cured composite resin. The teeth were thermocycled and artificial caries were created using an acid-gel. The results of this study showed that artificial recurrent caries can be reduced significantly (P < 0.05) with a glass-ionomer liner under amalgam restorations. The results also showed that when the light-cured glass-ionomer liner was placed 0.3 mm from the cavosurface margin under composite resin restoration, the artificial recurrent caries reduced significantly (P < 0.05)."
CD010526,0,12898294,1,Two-year clinical performance of a packable posterior composite with and without a flowable composite liner.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical performance of a packable fine hybrid dental composite (Prodigy Condensable) and the influence of the additional application of a flowable resin composite (Revolution, SDS Kerr) layer on marginal integrity after 2 years in stress-bearing posterior cavities according to the Ryge criteria. In 50 patients (40.5+/-17.5 years of age), 116 class II fillings (metal matrix system, glass ionomer-cement-base in 36%, rubberdam isolation in 70%) were placed, with at least two restorations per patient. The adhesive Optibond Solo Plus was used for all the restorations. In one of the two fillings in each patient, an additional layer of the flowable composite Revolution was applied in the entire cavity and separately light-cured. Baseline scores have been rated Alfa in > or =95% and Bravo in <5%. After 2 years, the results [%] of the Ryge evaluation for the two groups with/without the additional use of Revolution were: (1) Marginal Adaptation: Alfa:78/70, Bravo:16/27, Charlie:0/0, Delta:6/4; (2) Anatomic Form: Alfa:89/95, Bravo:6/2, Charlie:6/4; (3) Secondary Caries: Alfa:98/100, Bravo:2/0; (4) Marginal Discoloration: Alfa:76/68, Bravo:24/32, Charlie:0/0; (5) Surface: Alfa:90/91, Bravo:4/5, Charlie:0/0, Delta:6/4; (6) Color Match: Oscar:56/57, Alfa:44/39, Bravo:0/4, Charlie:0/0. Within the observation period (recall rate: 95%), three restorations out of 116 at baseline fractured, one restoration showed a secondary caries, one tooth received endodontic treatment, and all other restored teeth remained vital. After 2 years, no statistically significant difference (Chi-square test) in the overall survival rate between the group with the additional use of Revolution (92.8%) and that without Revolution (94.6%) was found.

CD010526,0,12540117,0,The effect of flowable resin composite on microleakage in class V cavities.,"This in vitro study investigated the microleakage of flowable resin composite as a restorative material and as a liner (either light cured separately or co-cured with hybrid resin composite) in Class V cavities. A light-cured hybrid resin composite was used as a control. Twenty extracted human premolars were prepared with standardized Class V cavity outlines on the buccal and lingual surfaces. The occlusal margin of the cavities was on enamel and the gingival margin was on dentin. One bottle adhesive system (Single Bond) was used after etching enamel and dentin with 34.5% phosphoric acid for 15 seconds. The cavities were randomly divided into four groups of 10 each and restored according to the manufacturers' instructions: Group I-Hybrid resin composite (Z100); Group II-Flowable resin composite (Filtek Flow); Group III-Flowable resin composite (Filtek Flow)+Hybrid resin composite (Z100); light cured separately; Group IV-Flowable resin composite (Filtek Flow)+Hybrid resin composite (Z100); co-cured. The samples were thermocycled 200 times with a 30-second dwell time. They were then immersed in a 0.5% basic fuchsin solution for 24 hours, sectioned and analyzed by stereomicroscopy. The degree of dye penetration was recorded and analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. The results of this study indicate that there was no leakage at the occlusal margin for either restoration. Statistically significant differences were found among the groups at the gingival margin. No statistically significant difference was observed between the occlusal and gingival margins except in Group IV. The combination of flowable resin composite and hybrid composite light cured separately yielded the best result in this study. The most leakage was observed when this combination was co-cured. The resistance to microleakage of flowable resin composite as a restorative material is similar to that of hybrid resin composite."

They are supposed to chemically adhere to dentin and a liner to protect the pulp is not used. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term pulpal reaction, in an intra-toothpair study, between a dental adhesive, Scotchbond 2, and a lining system, Tubulitec, in combination with P-50 in surface-sealed cavities. Deep buccal cavities in 16 human pairs of premolars, 32 teeth, were restored in vivo with a light cured composite resin, P-50. To minimize bacterial contamination all cavities were treated with a cleanser, Tubulicid, and the cavities were surface-sealed with temporary cement, Coltosol. One tooth in each pair, the test, was treated with Scotchprep Dentin Primer and Scotchbond 2 Light Cure Dental Adhesive. In the other tooth in the pair, the control, Tubulitec Primer and Liner were used. The teeth were extracted after 6-14 days. The sections were evaluated for degree of inflammation and the presence of bacteria. Irrespective of treatment of dentin the majority of teeth, 23, including one pulpal exposure, revealed no inflammation or a few inflammatory cells. In four test teeth, including one pulpal exposure, and two controls, growth of bacteria was found on the cavity walls and slight or moderate inflammation was seen in the corresponding pulps. In one test and two control teeth slight inflammation was seen but no bacteria could be detected. In the absence of bacteria Scotchbond 2 did not seem to irritate the pulp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Twenty-eight Class I cavities were prepared and restored in four groups: seven Calcimol LC and resin composite placed with a bulk or an incremental technique; and Ionoseal and resin composite placed with a bulk or an incremental technique. The specimens were sectioned longitudinally through the center of the restoration and an impression was made with a poly(vinyl siloxane) impression material. When the tooth surfaces and the impressions made from these surfaces were compared in the scanning electron microscope, extra gaps on tooth surfaces were observed that were not apparent in the impressions. These extra gaps probably resulted from desiccation of tissues; thus, the observation of replicas was useful to eliminate the inclusion of ""false"" gaps in the analysis. The results indicated that there was no substantial difference between Calcimol LC and Ionoseal base materials placed under resin composite inserted with an incremental technique."

We tested the effects of stepwise vs. direct complete excavation, 1 yr after the procedure had been carried out, in 314 adults (from six centres) who had received treatment of a tooth with deep caries. The teeth had caries lesions involving 75% or more of the dentin and were centrally randomized to stepwise or direct complete excavation. Stepwise excavation resulted in fewer pulp exposures compared with direct complete excavation [difference: 11.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.2; 21.3)]. At 1 yr of follow-up, there was a statistically significantly higher success rate with stepwise excavation, with success being defined as an unexposed pulp with sustained pulp vitality without apical radiolucency [difference: 11.7%, 95% CI (0.5; 22.5)]. In a subsequent nested trial, 58 patients with exposed pulps were randomized to direct capping or partial pulpotomy. We found no significant difference in pulp vitality without apical radiolucency between the two capping procedures after more than 1 yr [31.8% and 34.5%; difference: 2.7%, 95% CI (-22.7; 26.6)]. In conclusion, stepwise excavation decreases the risk of pulp exposure compared with direct complete excavation. In view of the poor prognosis of vital pulp treatment, a stepwise excavation approach for managing deep caries lesions is recommended."
CD010526,0,25087660,0,Bond strength and microleakage of self-adhesive and conventional fissure sealants.,"The aim of this study was to compare the shear bond strengths (SBS), failure modes (adhesive, cohesive, or mixed), and marginal microleakage occurrence of conventional resin (CR)-based, glass ionomer (GI)-based, and self-adhesive resin (SAR)-based fissure sealants with or without prior phosphoric acid (PA) etching. Fifty extracted premolars were randomly and equally assigned into five groups -G1:PA+CR, G2:PA+GI, G3:GI, G4:PA+SAR, and G5:SAR. Prior PA etching significantly (p<0.05) increased the SBSs of sealants. Adhesive failure mainly occurred in teeth treated with SAR- or GI-based fissure sealants, and cohesive failure mainly occurred in PA-etched teeth. Microleakage occurrence differed significantly (p<0.05) among the five groups of treated teeth. We concluded that conditioning of a tooth's enamel surface is crucial to creating strong bonds and leak-free sealing between tooth and fissure sealant."

CD010526,0,16827017,0,Effect of cavity disinfection on postoperative sensitivity associated with amalgam restorations.,"This clinical study assessed the postoperative cold sensitivity reported by patients following the Class I and Class II amalgam restoration of primary carious lesions after different cavity treatments. One hundred and twenty patients, each with a previously untreated tooth requiring an amalgam restoration due to the presence of a carious lesion, were included. Sixty teeth had lesions that were radiographically judged to be located in the middle third of dentin, and another 60 were located in the inner third of dentin. Six different cavity treatment regimens were used: Group 1--no treatment; Group 2--calcium hydroxide liner (Life); Group 3--cavity varnish (Copalite); Group 4--resin modified glass ionomer liner (Vitrebond); Group 5--dentin adhesive resin liner (Single Bond); Group 6--chlorhexidine disinfectant (Consepsis). Patients were telephoned on days 2 and 7 postoperatively and asked whether they experienced sensitivity to cold, and if so, its duration and intensity. If sensitivity remained up to day 7, patients were also contacted on days 30 and 90. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed postoperative sensitivity to be significantly different among cavity treatments at days 2, 7 and 30 (p = 0.026, 0.044, 0.015, respectively). Lesion depth also affected postoperative sensitivity at day 2, with 27% of teeth with middle-third lesions producing pain, and 58% of those with lesions extending to the inner third producing pain (p = 0.000). This difference showed up at 7 and 30 days (p = 0.001, 0.015, respectively). Of the 51 teeth with sensitivity at day 2, 17 had mild pain, 26 were moderately painful and 8 had severe pain; each category reduced in degree of sensitivity and number with time. It would seem that medium-term (beyond 30 days) postoperative sensitivity is affected neither by the method of cavity treatment nor the depth of lesion, although, in the shorter-term, these factors do influence the postoperative sensitivity reported."
CD010526,0,20924547,0,Hydroxyl and calcium ions diffusion from endodontic materials through roots of primary teeth - in vitro study.,"The purpose of this research was to evaluate the diffusion of calcium (Ca+2) and hydroxyl (OH-) ions from materials with a calcium hydroxide base - Ca(OH)2 through the intact roots of deciduous teeth. This diffusion of ions is important for periapical healing. Forty-six deciduous teeth were selected and instrumented to their working length with #40 files. The teeth were washed during cleaning and shaping with a 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution. The canals were dried with paper points. The teeth were divided into 4 groups based on the sealer type, with 10 specimens in each group. A fifth group of 6 teeth without sealer constituted the control group. The materials used as sealers were: Ca(OH)2 paste associated to propylene glycol (CaPE) thickened at the proportion of 2:1 w/v; UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina) paste - a mixture of 0.3g of zinc oxide with 0.3g of Ca(OH)2 with 0.2ml of olive oil 1:1 w/w; Vitapex® and Sealapex®. The coronal access was sealed with a glass ionomer after the root had been filled with each sealer. A one-third apical surface and foramen was hard-pressed with Araldite®. The teeth were stored individually in flasks containing saline solution at 37ºC and 100% humidity. The OH- and Ca+2 ions diffusion levels were determined using a pH meter and an atomic absorption spectrometer. Data were collected at 48 hours and at intervals of 7, 30, 45 and 60 days. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA to compare groups. In the pH evaluation, the CaPE group presented the largest OH- ions diffusion, which peaked at sixty days (p=0.0309), when compared to the other groups (p<0.0001). In relation to amount of Ca+2 ions released, the CaPE paste showed the best results, followed by the UFSC's paste. These results suggest that the CaPE paste was the material that allowed the highest diffusion of OH- and Ca+2 ions."

CD010526,0,11380791,0,"Effect of cavity varnish, amalgam liner or dentin bonding agents on the marginal leakage of amalgam restorations.","The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare marginal leakage of Class II amalgam restorations lined with different agents (two new generation dentin bonding systems, a cavity varnish and an amalgam liner). Forty freshly extracted human molar teeth were divided into five groups. Class II preparations were prepared in the mesial and distal surfaces of each molar. While the cavities in two groups were lined with two new generation bonding systems, the other two groups were treated with an amalgam lining material and a cavity varnish. Fifth group was used as control, without any lining. Amalgam* was hand-condensed into each preparation. Specimens were thermocycled, stained and sectioned. Microleakage was graded using a stereomicroscope. Mean microleakage scores for occlusal and cervical margins were calculated and analysed. For the leakage values on occlusal margins, Kruskal-Wallis test indicated no significant difference in all groups. For the leakage values on cervical margins, Kruskal-Wallis test indicated significant difference in four groups when compared with controls (P < 0.001). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the occlusal and cervical leakage values in each group."
CD010526,0,19548010,0,Clinical and microbiological performance of resin-modified glass-ionomer liners after incomplete dentine caries removal.,"The aims of this study were to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effects of two resin-modified glass-ionomer cements (RMGICs) used as liners after incomplete dentine caries removal and to identify Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus strains isolated from dentine samples, before and after indirect pulp treatment. Twenty-seven primary molars with deep carious lesions, but without signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis, were submitted to indirect pulp treatment. Treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the carious dentine, application of one of the RMGICs (Vitrebond or Fuji Lining LC) or calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal), and sealing for 3 months. Clinical evaluation (consistency, color, and wetness of dentine) and carious dentine collects were performed before temporary sealing and after the experimental period. Microbiological samples were cultivated in specific media for subsequent counting of mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli (LB). MS colonies were selected for identification of S. mutans and S. sobrinus by polymerase chain reaction. After 3 months, the remaining dentine was hard and dry, and there was a significant decrease in the number of MS and LB, in all groups, although complete elimination was not achieved in 33% and 26% of the teeth for MS and LB, respectively. From 243 MS colonies selected, 216 (88.9%) were identified as S. mutans and only 2 (0.8%) as S. sobrinus. The use of resin-modified glass-ionomer liners after incomplete caries removal, as well as a calcium hydroxide cement, promoted significant reduction of the viable residual cariogenic bacteria in addition to favorable clinical changes in the remaining carious dentine."

Means of tensile strength ranged from 2.66 to 3.56 MPa. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. It was concluded that the type of filling material used in the endodontic treatment did not interfere with the tensile strength.
CD010526,0,2095808,0,Artificial root caries in amalgam restorations: effect of light-cured fluoride releasing liners.,"The purpose of this study was to examine artificial root caries when light-cured fluoride releasing liners were placed under amalgam restorations. Class V preparations in extracted third molars were used with gingival margins on root surfaces. Ten restorations were used for each of the following groups: 1) Amalgam alone; 2) Two layers of copal varnish and amalgam; 3) Vitrabond, amalgam; 4) Timeline, amalgam; 5) XR Ionomer, amalgam. The teeth were thermocycled and artificial caries were created using a liquid system acidified to pH 4.20 containing 2.2 mM calcium and phosphate but without fluoride. The teeth were sectioned, polished and photographed using polarized light. Areas of recurrent caries were measured using a sonic digitizing pad. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and Duncan's Multiple Range Test. Areas for root lesions for the different groups were: 1) 2.17 +/- 0.35; 2) 1.90 +/- 0.40; 3) 1.30 +/- 0.18; 4) 1.77 +/- 0.28; 5) 1.50 +/- 0.33. Groups 3 and 5 were statistically different from groups 1 and 2, while no differences were observed for enamel lesions. The use of the photo-activated/fluoride releasing liners significantly reduced lesion area."

CD010526,0,23863205,0,Clinical parallels in treatment of reversible pulpitis.,"Current study is aiming at comparative characterization of clinical aspects of preparations, containing calcium hydroxide, in the treatment of pulp hyperemia (primary pulpitis). With this aim two products, made on the base of calcium hydroxide, were selected: Ultra-Blend (Ultradent) and Life (Kerr). The results obtained after application of these materials were compared with the results obtained in patients affected with the similar pathology, where Ca(OH)2 containing liners were not used in treatment process. 54 teeth were selected for the study, among them - 38 molars and 16 premolars. Patients were divided into three groups: I group (21 teeth) included the patients who underwent pulp hyperemia treatment with Life, II group - patients treated with Ultra-Blend (19 teeth) and III group - patients without any pulp protections respectively (13 teeth). It was decided to perform treatment assessment and making appropriate conclusions according to two factors: degree of adhesion of restorations to teeth surfaces and teeth post-restorative sensitivity. Comparison of the obtained data of study and control groups revealed weakening of adhesion between filling and tooth tissues practically in all 3groups, however, with different rate and intensity: in I group on radioography micro cracks were revealed in 10 cases (47.6%), II group -7 (36.5%) cases and treating group - 4 (30.7%) cases, respectively. The obtained results of the current study revealed non-homogenous picture: in I group where Kerr liner was applied - hypersensitivity was revealed in 12 (57.1%) cases, II group - 6 (31.5%) and III group - 7 (53.8%) cases. It is concluded that the primary reason for teeth prolonged and enhanced sensitivity is a micro-percolation factor into the perimeter. But if we admit the application of medical liners in the treatment of pulp hyperemia, doctor's choice should be made on those, providing maximum prevention of further complications. At this stage of the study such features were better revealed by Ultra-Blend. However, the final clinical outcomes - pulp hyperemia disappearance, no complains, production of tertiary dentin and so on - might be expected within a year after the end of the treatment. Currently, it will be interesting to study the pulp chamber condition, evaluation of electrophysiological parameters of the tooth and restoration quality. The mentioned issues will be studied in the future studies."
CD010526,0,9669456,1,A 3-year clinical evaluation of two composite resins in class-II cavities.,"The purpose of this investigation was to study the clinical performance of a new system with a proposed expanding liner for composite restorations introduced in the late 1980s. The present study reports on baseline data and the result after 3 years. One hundred and four class-II cavities in 95 patients were alternatively restored by Superlux Molar and the reference material P-50 APC by 12 general practitioners in 3 public dental health clinics. After 3 years 82 restorations (79%) were available for examination. The restorations were evaluated on the basis of USPHS criteria after 1 week and again after 3 years. Stone casts were used to quantitatively categorize wear in accordance with the Leinfelder method. Color slides and bitewings were taken to supplement the clinical evaluation of color match and marginal adaptation, respectively, and secondary caries. The failure rate (USPHS rating, Charlie) was four restorations of Superlux Molar and seven of P-50 APC. The average wear after 3 years of Superlux Molar was 131 microm and of P-50 APC, 128 microm. There were no statistically significant differences between the two materials with regard to, for example, handling characteristics, anatomic form, color match, marginal discoloration, or failures. A significantly higher wear rate was found after 3 years in patients with a high level of salivary lactobacilli (> 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL at base line) compared with those with lower levels. This suggests that an acidic environment might enhance the wear rate."
CD010526,0,16128255,0,The influence of smear layer on coronal leakage of Roth 801 and AH26 root canal sealers.,"The aim of this in vitro study was to examine the effect of removal of smear layer on the coronal seal of two commonly used root canal sealers: Roth 801, a zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealer and AH26, an epoxy resin-based sealer. Ninety-six single-rooted human teeth were used. The teeth were instrumented and assigned to four experimental groups of 20 teeth each, with 10 teeth as controls and the remaining six teeth examined under a scanning electron microscope. The teeth in the experimental groups (80 teeth) were divided into four sub-groups and were obturated by laterally condensed gutta-percha with the two sealer cements as follows: Group A1: smear layer left intact and AH26 cement used as sealer; Group A2: smear layer left intact and Roth 801 cement used as sealer; Group B1: smear layer removed and AH26 cement used as sealer; and Group B2: smear layer removed and Roth 801 cement used as sealer. Coronal microleakage was evaluated by measuring the distance of dye penetration. The data was statistically evaluated using a two-way ANOVA test. The results showed that removal of the smear layer resulted in a statistically significant reduction of microleakage values in the groups obturated with AH26 compared with the groups obturated with Roth 801 sealer. It was concluded that the removal of smear layer has a significant influence on the degree of microleakage in obturated root canals."
CD010526,0,11887513,0,Microleakage of a packable composite associated with different materials.,"The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the extent of marginal leakage with class II composite resin restorations associated with different materials. Twenty extracted sound molars were disinfected and stored in 0.9% saline solution. Four standardized class II cavities were prepared in each tooth, with the gingival margin 1 mm below the cementum-enamel junction. The teeth were then randomly divided into five groups of 16 restorations each: 1) Prime & Bond NT + Surefil; 2) Prime & Bond NT + Dyract Flow + Surefil; 3) Prime & Bond NT + Flow-it + Surefil; 4) Prime & Bond NT + Dyract AP + Surefil; and 5) Fuji II LC + Prime & Bond NT + Surefil. After a storage time of seven days, the restorations were finished and polished. Then specimens were submitted to thermocycling (500 cycles, 5 degrees-55 degrees C, 15 s-dwell time) and immersed in 0.5% methylene blue solution for 24 hours. They were washed and vertically sliced through the middle of the restoration. Both surfaces were evaluated in the gingival margin and one score (0-3) was assigned under a stereomicroscope (40x magnification) by two examiners. The frequency of the scores was evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests for pairwise comparisons. None of the associations prevented dye penetration. The statistical analysis showed similar dye penetration among groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 (p > 0.05). The results of penetration in group 5 were significantly lower compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). It was concluded that the use of Fuji II LC as a base material led to the best sealing of the gingival margins based upon the lowest degree of microleakage observed."

CD010526,0,11696918,0,Microleakage in primary teeth restored by conventional or bonded amalgam technique.,"The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate marginal leakage in class V restorations in primary teeth restored with amalgam, using three different techniques. Thirty maxillary anterior primary teeth, clinically sound and naturally exfoliated, were used. In group 1 (n = 10), two thin layers of a copal varnish (Cavitine) were applied. In group 2 (n = 10), Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus, a dual adhesive system, was used according to manufacturer instructions. In group 3 (n = 10), One-Step adhesive system in combination with a low-viscosity resin (Resinomer) were used according to manufacturer instructions. All samples were restored with a high-copper dental amalgam alloy (GS 80, SDI). After restoration, the samples were stored in normal saline at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The specimens were polished, thermocycled (500 cycles, 5 degrees and 55 degrees C, 30-s dwell time) and impermeabilized with fingernail polish to within 1.0 mm of the restoration margins. The teeth were then placed in 0.5% methylene blue for 4 h. Finally, the samples were sectioned and evaluated for marginal leakage. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the filled adhesive resin (group 3) had the least microleakage. There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2."
CD010526,0,15044394,0,Carbohydrates act as receptors for the periodontitis-associated bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis: a study of bacterial binding to glycolipids.,"In this study we show for the first time the use of carbohydrate chains on glycolipids as receptors for the periodontitis-associated bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis. Previous studies have shown that this bacterium has the ability to adhere to and invade the epithelial lining of the dental pocket. Which receptor(s) the adhesin of P. gingivalis exploit in the adhesion to epithelial cells has not been shown. Therefore, the binding preferences of this specific bacterium to structures of carbohydrate origin from more than 120 different acid and nonacid glycolipid fractions were studied. The bacteria were labeled externally with (35)S and used in a chromatogram binding assay. To enable detection of carbohydrate receptor structures for P. gingivalis, the bacterium was exposed to a large number of purified total glycolipid fractions from a variety of organs from different species and different histo-blood groups. P. gingivalis showed a preference for fractions of human and pig origin for adhesion. Both nonacid and acid glycolipids were used by the bacterium, and a preference for shorter sugar chains was noticed. Bacterial binding to human acid glycolipid fractions was mainly obtained in the region of the chromatograms where sulfated carbohydrate chains usually are found. However, the binding pattern to nonacid glycolipid fractions suggests a core chain of lactose bound to the ceramide part as a tentative receptor structure. The carbohydrate binding of the bacterium might act as a first step in the bacterial invasion process of the dental pocket epithelium, subsequently leading to damage to periodontal tissue and tooth loss."

CD010526,0,16924985,0,Microleakage after thermocycling of 4 etch and rinse and 3 self-etch adhesives with and without a flowable composite lining.,"This study evaluated the microleakage of composite fillings prepared with 4 etch and rinse and 3 self-etch adhesive systems after thermocycling. Also evaluated was the potential improvement of cavity sealing when utilizing a low charged resin lining for cavity preparations. Seventy recently extracted teeth were randomly allocated to 7 experimental adhesive systems: two 3-step etch and rinse adhesive systems, Scotchbond Multipurpose (SBMP) and Optibond Solo Plus (OS); two 2-step etch and rinse adhesive systems, referred to as ""one-bottle,"" Scotchbond 1 (SB1) and Gluma Comfort Bond + Desensitizer (G); and 3 self-etch ""all-in-one"" adhesives, Adper Prompt-L-Pop (PLP), Xeno III (X-III) and iBond (iB). On each tooth, 2 rectangular cavities were prepared at the cemento-enamel junction: 1 cavity was prepared with adhesive and the hybrid composite and the second was filled with the same adhesive and a thin layer of flowable composite (Filtek Flow) under the resin composite (Z100). All teeth were thermocycled for 800 cycles (5 degrees C-55 degrees C, 30 seconds dwell time). Leakage was evaluated on a 6-point (0-5) severity scale for enamel and dentin on 4 interfaces for each restoration. The results are expressed as means +/- standard deviation (SD). Microleakage scores were analyzed by means of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), assuming an ordinal logistic link function. Covariates in the model were: (1) adhesives, (2) fluid composite and (3) interface. The model also accounts for repeated measurements on the various teeth. The authors found that the mean score of microleakage per tooth was significantly higher at the enamel rather than at the dentin interfaces (1.21 +/- 0.51 and 0.87 +/- 0.48; p<0.0001). In this study, there was no significant difference among the 4 etch and rinse adhesive systems. On the other hand, these adhesives yielded smaller mean scores of microleakage than the 3 self-etch systems (respectively, 0.85 +/- 0.2 and 1.3 +/- 0.5; p<0.0001). Among the self-etch adhesives, microleakage was significantly greater for PLP (1.74 +/- 0.46) than for the other self-etch products (p<0.0001), while X-III, an intermediary strong self-etch, was found to be as good as the etch and rinse systems, with a mean score of 0.97 +/- 0.27. In addition, results have also shown that an under layer of flowable composite significantly improved the water tightness of the PLP adhesive restorations (p=0.042). This in vitro study concluded that the self-etch adhesives remain less effective than etch and rinse. Nevertheless, X-III, a self-etch adhesive, showed acceptable performance in accordance with this study's 6-point severity scale of microleakage, but this needs to be confirmed in further clinical studies. On the other hand, this study failed to reveal that the addition of a thin layer of fluid composite improved the water tightness of the restoration, except for PLP."
CD010526,0,19648746,0,Microbiological analysis after complete or partial removal of carious dentin in primary teeth: a randomized clinical trial.,"Since viable bacteria can persist in tooth cavities regardless of the technique used for caries removal, the objective of the present randomized clinical trial was to examine the microflora of primary teeth treated by complete or partial removal of carious dentin. Deciduous molars with acute carious lesions in the inner half of dentin and vital pulp were randomly divided into two groups of 16: complete removal, in which the carious dentin was completely removed with the help of a caries detector dye, and partial removal, in which the carious dentin was completely removed from the dentinoenamel junction and lateral walls, while the necrotic carious dentin from the cavity floor was only removed superficially. Dentin samples were obtained with a sterile No. 3 bur after caries removal and 3-6 months after protection with calcium hydroxide cement and restoration of the cavities with resin composite. The samples were stored in thioglycolate. Decimal dilutions were then prepared and seeded for the enumeration of Streptococcus spp., mutans streptococci, Lactobacillus spp. and total microorganisms. Before sealing, a larger number of microorganisms was detected in teeth submitted to partial caries removal compared to the complete removal group. However, after sealing the level of colonization was similar in the two groups for all microorganisms studied. The results suggest that persistence of bacteria does not seem to be a reason for reopening of cavities in deciduous teeth after partial caries removal."

CD010526,0,10373092,0,The effect of bonding agents on the microleakage and bond strength of sealant in primary teeth.,"This in vitro study investigated the effect of use of three dentine bonding agents: Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus (3M Dental Products, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A.), Syntac (Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), Optibond Dual Cure (Kerr, Romulus, MI, U.S.A.) on microleakage and shear bond strength of a fissure sealant (Helioseal F, Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) bonded to either dry or wet (saliva contaminated) enamels of primary teeth. Newly extracted 112 non-carious primary teeth were sectioned and embedded in resin blocks. Eight groups were formed for each test. Each group consisted of 14 specimens. Group 1 and 2: fissure sealant was applied directly to etched enamel in dry and wet condition, respectively; Group 3 and 4: fissure sealant was applied onto etched and Scotch-bond Multi-Purpose Plus treated enamel in dry and wet condition, respectively; Group 5 and 6: fissure sealant was applied onto etched and Syntac treated enamel in dry and wet condition, respectively; Group 7 and 8: fissure sealant was applied onto etched and Optibond Dual Cure treated enamel in dry and wet condition, respectively. The results revealed that the use of an enamel-dentine bonding agent under fissure sealant increased the bond strength and decreased the microleakage. The use of enamel-dentine bonding agents under sealant in moisture contaminated conditions gave better results than applying sealant alone onto non-contaminated teeth. Finally, Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus yielded the best results for both tests."

CD010526,0,7643040,0,Microleakage of retrograde root fillings: assessment using a novel measurement system.,"In the past, measurement of microleakage has been based on measurement of dye or radioactive isotope penetration. A method has been developed to allow electronic monitoring of microflow in the same specimen over a period of time. This method was used to compare previously reported retrograde materials with an amalgam/sealer combination. The material that performed best was amalgam/sealer, particularly in the first week. The role of cavity varnish in limiting leakage has been controversial, and the results in the present study do not indicate any significant benefit. The range of leakage measured for specimens in the same group suggests that in vivo the expected leakage could be considerable for the materials tested and that small differences in experimental leakage between groups may not have any practical significance."

CD010526,0,12165766,0,Effect of fluoride varnish on demineralization adjacent to brackets bonded with RMGI cement.,"Far too often a less-than-optimal esthetic result occurs after orthodontic treatment due to demineralization of enamel adjacent to fixed orthodontic appliances in patients with inadequate oral hygiene. In vitro studies have shown that a resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) cement and a fluoride varnish might help clinicians combat this problem. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in vitro, the effect of a fluoride-releasing cavity varnish on inhibition of enamel demineralization adjacent to orthodontic brackets bonded with RMGI and composite resin cements. Brackets were bonded to 48 extracted human third molars. Half were bonded with a composite resin (Transbond, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) and half with an RMGI (Fuji Ortho LC, GC America, Alsip, Ill). Each group was further divided into 2, with half receiving an application of fluoride-releasing varnish (Duraflor, Pharmascience, Montreal, Québec, Canada). The samples were cycled in an artificial caries solution for an hour twice daily for 31 days. After each caries challenge, the teeth were brushed with a soft toothbrush to simulate normal mechanical wear of the varnish. The loss of fluoride varnish was timed. Teeth were sectioned longitudinally and photographed under polarized light microscopy. Mean lesion depth was measured, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) (P <or=.0001) and the Duncan multiple range test (P <or=.05) indicated significant differences among the groups. Teeth bonded with composite resin showed a 35% reduction in mean lesion depth when fluoride varnish was applied. Teeth bonded with RMGI cement showed no significant differences in lesion depth between varnish and nonvarnish groups. Both RMGI groups had 50% smaller mean lesion depths when compared with the composite resin group without fluoride varnish. Samples bonded with RMGI cement illustrated a wedge effect, with lesion depth shallower near the bracket. A chi-square test showed that the fluoride varnish was lost significantly faster in samples bonded with Fuji Ortho LC (P =.013). Although the fluoride varnish could not prevent demineralization, it appears to be beneficial in reducing lesion formation. Clinicians should consider applying fluoride varnish on areas of enamel that exhibit demineralization or are at risk of demineralization in patients with poor oral hygiene."

Contrary to expectations the results showed that in direct contact of calcium hydroxide paste and phosphate cement no change occurred in pH calcium hydroxide, and that its average value was 12.70. Further were there was no statistically significant difference in values of pH calcium hydroxide paste among the A, B and C groups. On the basis of these studies and in the opinion of other authors, it may be concluded that, although there was no decrease in pH calcium hydroxide in direct contact of calcium hydroxide paste and phosphate cement, it should be necessary to make the mutual isolation of these materials; in practice this is most efficiently done on two-layer Tubulitec base."
CD010526,0,12244738,1,Clinical performance of resin composite restorations after 2 years.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of a packable restorative material, after 2 years in stress-bearing posterior cavities, according to the Ryge criteria. At least two Class 2 restorations (occluso-mesial, mesial-occlusal-distal, occlusal-distal) were placed in 46 patients (36.7 +/- 16 years). In each of the restorations (lot 221, metal matrix band system, glass ionomer-cement-base in 53% of the cavities, mostly no rubber dam) an adhesive system was used. Additionally, in each patient a flowable composite was used in one of the two fillings. After 2 years, 70% of the patients were available for reevaluation. Two restorations needed to be replaced as a result of postoperative sensitivities within the observation period, and one tooth received root canal treatment. All other restored teeth remained vital. One restoration with marginal discoloration received a score of Charlie; another with secondary caries received a score of Bravo. All the others revealed excellent and clinically acceptable results. No statistically significant difference (Chi-square-test) was observed between the two groups, with and without an additional flowable composite. After 2 years, the restorative material performed clinically well, with no observable fractures in the restoration."

Four classes of materials were examined: conventional glass ionomers (CG)-Vitro Cem, Ketac Bond, Vidrion F, Vidrion C; resin-modified glass ionomers (RMGI)-Fuji II LC, Vitrebond; resinous cement (RC)-Rely-X ARC; and zinc phosphate cement (ZP)-Cimento LS. Five 2-mm-thick standard samples of each material and five 2-mm-thick enamel and dentin samples were produced. An aluminum step wedge served as control. Samples were positioned over a phosphor plate of Digora digital system, exposed to X-ray, and the radiodensity obtained in the software Digora for Windows 2.0. Data were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis and Dunnett multiple comparisons test (alpha=0.05). According to statistical analysis, the following sequence in degree of radiodensity could be seen among the groups: Cimento LS (ZP) > Vitro Cem (CG) = Fuji II LC (RMGI) = Rely-X ARC (RC) = Vitrebond (RMGI) > Ketac Bond (CG) > enamel = Vidrion F (CG) > Vidrion C (CG) = dentin. The presence of radiopaque fillers such as zinc, strontium, zirconium, barium, and lanthanium rather than material type seems to be the most important factor when analyzing material radiodensity. Almost all investigated materials presented an accepted radiodensity."

Currently, it is possible to control the fluidity of the fresh concrete and obtain stronger and more durable structures. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to understand the interactions between PCEs and cement hydrates at the atomic scale to design new customized functional PCEs according to the ever-increasing requirements of the concrete industry. Here, the bonding types generated between a PCE with silyl functionalities (PCE-Sil) and a synthetic calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) are analyzed using XRD, "

CD010526,0,9588153,0,Fracture resistance in conservative Class II cavity preparation: box vs tunnel.,"A total of 40 extracted human maxillary premolar teeth were used in this study. Teeth were randomly distributed between two main groups. In group A conservative class II Box preparations were cut in each tooth. In group B the proximal cavity was prepared through the occlusal surface and the proximal marginal ridge was left intact (tunnel preparation). Group A and group B were randomly subdivided into two subgroups (a & b). In groups Aa and Bb a posterior composite resin material was used to restore the prepared cavities (no base was used). While in groups Aa & Bb the posterior composite resin was used with a glass ionomer cement base. The teeth were tested on an Instron testing machine for their resistance to fracture, force being applied equally to buccal and lingual cusps. Mean fractures values were: Gp. Aa 285 LB.: Gr. Bb 245 lb. Bb 240 lb. One way analysis of variance showed no statistical difference between the four groups. The tunnel preparation did not increase the resistance to fracture of the restored tooth compared to a box preparation."
CD010526,0,16741831,0,Active site acidic residues and structural analysis of modelled human aromatase: a potential drug target for breast cancer.,"This study sheds new light on the role of acidic residues present in the active site cavity of human aromatase. Eight acidic residues (E129, D222, E245, E302, D309, E379, D380 and D476) lining the cavity are identified and studied using comparative modeling, docking, molecular dynamics as well as statistical techniques. The structural environment of these acidic residues is studied to assess the stability of the corresponding carboxylate anions. Results indicate that the environment of the residues E245, E302 and D222 is most suitable for carboxylate ion formation in the uncomplexed form. However, the stability of D309, D222 and D476 anions is seen to increase on complexation to steroidal substrates. In particular, the interaction between D309 and T310, which assists proton transfer, is found to be formed following androgen/nor-androgen complexation. The residue D309 is found to be clamped in the presence of substrate which is not observed in the case of the other residues although they exhibit changes in properties following substrate binding. Information entropic analysis indicates that the residues D309, D222 and D476 have more conformational flexibility compared to E302 and E245 prior to substrate binding. Interaction similar to that between D476 and D309, which is expected to assist androgen aromatization, is proposed between E302 and E245. The inhibition of aromatase activity by 4-hydroxy androstenedione (formestane) is attributed to a critical hydrogen bond formation between the hydroxy moiety and T310/D309 as well as the large distance from D476. The results corroborate well with earlier site directed mutagenesis studies."
CD010526,0,10321178,0,In vitro sealing ability of dentin bonding agents and cavity varnish with amalgam as retrofills.,"The aim of this study was to test the effect on the seal produced by an amalgam retrofill of two dentin bonding agents (Amalgambond and All-Bond) and a cavity varnish (Copalite). The three materials were tested when placed before the retrofill (group I) and before and after the retrofill (group II). Ninety teeth distributed into three groups were prepared for the retrofilling. Each group was divided into subgroups of I and II. Linear apical leakage was measured by a stereomicroscope after 1 month in dye. All materials permitted dye leakage around the retrofill, regardless of the application type. No statistical difference was found between the Amalgambond subgroups or between the All-Bond subgroups. There was less leakage in varnish group I than group II. Amalgambond group I leaked significantly less than All-Bond group I."

CD010526,0,8237310,0,11-year assessment of Class-III resin restorations completed with two restorative procedures.,"This randomized clinical trial was initiated to study the effect of two restorative procedures on the clinical quality and longevity of class-III resin restorations. The material consisted of 52 pairs of class-III restorations in the microfilled resin Silar completed with two modifications of the conventional acid-etch restorative procedure: A) beveling of the margins of the cavity preparations, and B) treatment of the etched butt-joint cavities before filling with the dentin-adhesive NPG-GMA/ethanol together with re-etching and surface coating of the finished restorations with low viscous resin. The restorations were examined at base line and after 2, 4, 6, and 11 years. The cumulative 11-year survival rate for both types of restorations was 84%. Marginal discolorations, marginal discrepancies, and secondary caries were most often recorded corresponding to the beveled type-A restorations, whereas the esthetic quality of the two types of restorations was almost identical. Surface discolorations were most often recorded among smokers, and significant correlations were found between the patients' consumption of alcoholic beverages and corpus discoloration, surface discoloration, and surface wear of restorations."

CD010526,0,8143437,0,Comparison of glass-ionomer and resin-based fissure sealants: a 2-year clinical trial.,"In recent years, the interest in the use of glass-ionomer materials as fissure sealants has increased. The aim of this study was to compare the retention and caries-preventive effect of glass-ionomer (Fuji III) and resin-based light-cured (Delton) fissure sealants. Three health center dentists applied the sealants to 166 children; glass-ionomer sealants on one side and resin-based sealants on the contralateral side of the mouth. After 2 yr, one pair of molar teeth in the mouths of 151 children was compared. Twenty-six percent of glass-ionomer and 82% of resin-based sealants were totally present (P < 0.001). During the 2 yr, in both groups 4.6% of the sealed surfaces became carious. The results show that the retention of glass-ionomer sealants is markedly inferior to the resin-based sealants. In this study, however, no difference in caries increment on the sealed surfaces was observed. This may be due to the different mechanism of caries prevention for the sealant materials, or to the overall low caries activity of the participants."

Eighty single-rooted teeth were instrumented and obturated with gutta percha, resected and retroprepared. The teeth were then randomly divided into 4 groups of 20, with each group receiving one of the previously mentioned retrofill materials. The bone cement group was either etched or unetched. The teeth were immersed in silver nitrate and developer for leakage assessment. The teeth were grooved and split longitudinally to measure leakage. Statistical analysis showed that amalgam leaked significantly less than Super-EBA and unetched bone cement; composite leaked significantly less than Super-EBA. Amalgam was not statistically different from composite or etched bone cement. No significant difference between composite and both bone cements was noted, nor between both bone cements and Super-EBA."
CD010526,0,17333769,0,Antimicrobial activity of Cratoxylum formosum on Streptococcus mutans.,"The gum of Cratoxylum formosum, commonly known as mempat, is a natural agent that has been used extensively for caries prevention by hill tribe people residing in Thailand. The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of Cratoxylum formosum gum on Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) in vitro. The gum extracted from stem bark of Cratoxylum formosum was investigated for antimicrobial activity against different strains of S. mutans, including S. mutans KPSK2 and 2 clinical isolates. Inhibition of growth was primarily tested by agar diffusion method. A two-fold broth dilution method was then used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract. The extract of Cratoxylum formosum was effective against S. mutans with the inhibition zones ranging from 9.5 to 11.5 mm and MIC values between 48 microg/ml and 97 microg/ml. The gum of Cratoxylum formosum has high antimicrobial activity against S. mutans and may become a promising herbal varnish against caries."
CD010526,0,2258504,0,In vitro assessment of the microleakage around preventive resin (laminate) restorations.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro, the microleakage of laminate restorations using two resin systems and the influence of etching and curing regimen on the leakage. A total of 135 extracted, human third molars with similar occlusal dimensions were chosen. Cavities were prepared and the teeth were then separated into nine groups of fifteen teeth each. The incidence of microleakage in this study varied between no leakage and 46.7 percent. Leakage of preventive resin restorations was reported to occur in 16.7 percent to 25 percent of cases. The fact that the variables tested in this study had no significant effect on the microleakage would suggest that the leakage is dependent on that of the fissure sealant. The group restored with a fissure sealant containing releasable fluoride and an adhesion promoter performed well in this study."
CD010526,0,15273640,0,Coronal microleakage of three temporary restorative materials: an in vitro study.,"The sealing properties of three temporary restorative materials, Cavit, IRM, and a polycarboxylate-based cement, Ultratemp Firm, were investigated in vitro. Standardized access cavities were prepared in 45, intact, extracted, human molars. The teeth were randomly assigned to three groups and the access openings filled with one of three temporary filling materials. In five teeth (negative control), no restorative material was placed but the preparations were coated entirely with sticky wax. The five teeth of the positive control group had no restorative material and no sticky wax applied. After thermocycling for 500 cycles (5-55 degrees C), the experimental teeth were dipped in molten sticky wax to the CEJ. The coronal enamel was subsequently coated with two layers of nail varnish, leaving an area of 1 mm around the filling material uncovered. The samples were then immersed in 2% methylene blue dye solution for leakage assessment. The teeth were sectioned and the greatest depth of dye penetration was recorded. Positive control sections exhibited complete dye penetration, whereas negative controls had none. There was no statistically significant difference in marginal leakage between Cavit, IRM, and Ultratemp Firm (p > 0.05). All materials leaked at the interface material-dentin, whereas some IRM specimens absorbed the dye into the bulk of the material."
CD010526,0,25995122,0,"Bioinformatical analysis of the sequences, structures and functions of fungal polyketide synthase product template domains.","The product template (PT) domains, specifically in fungal non-reducing polyketide synthases (NR-PKSs), mediate the regioselective cyclization of polyketides dominating the final structures. However, up to date, the systematic knowledge about PT domains has been insufficient. In present study, the relationships between sequences, structures and functions of the PT domains were analyzed with 661 NR-PKS sequences. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the PT domains were classified into prominent eight groups (I-VIII) corresponding with the representative compounds and cyclization regioselectivity (C2-C7, C4-C9, and C6-C11). Most of the cavity lining residue (CLR) sites in all groups were common, while the regional CLR site mutations resulted in the appearance of finger-like regions with different orientation. The cavity volumes and shapes, even the catalytic dyad positions of PT domains in different groups were corresponding with characteristic cyclization regioselectivity and compound sizes. The conservative residues in PT sequences were responsible for the cyclization functions and the evolution of the key residues resulted in the differentiations of cyclization functions. The above findings may help to better understand the cyclization mechanisms of PT domains and even predict the structural types of the aromatic polyketide products."
CD010526,0,12120767,0,Effect of pulp protection technique on the clinical performance of amalgam restorations: three-year results.,"This study evaluated the influence of the pulp protection technique on clinical performance of amalgam restorations after three years, with particular reference to post-operative sensitivity and secondary caries. One hundred and twenty (120) Class II amalgam restorations (68 premolars, 52 molars; 78 MOD, 42 OD/MO) were placed in 30 participants (four restorations per participant). The restorations were divided into four groups according to the pulp protection technique used: copal varnish; 2% neutral sodium fluoride; adhesive resin and no pulp protection. The parameters evaluated were post-operative sensitivity, staining of the dental structure, tooth vitality, partial or total loss of the restoration and secondary caries. One hundred and eight (108) restorations were available for evaluation after three years. No partial or total loss of restorations had occurred; all teeth were vital, no tooth structure staining or secondary caries was detected in any of the restored teeth. Post-operative sensitivity was observed only in two restorations at baseline and at seven-days. The three-year clinical performance of teeth restored with a high copper dispersed phase amalgam was not affected by the choice of pulp protection technique."

CD010526,0,17472181,1,Clinical evaluation of postoperative sensitivity in composite resin restorations using various liners.,"Light-cured resin composites are a viable option for restoring Class I and Class II cavities; however, several researchers have reported postoperative sensitivity in such restorations. In this in vivo study, 80 teeth with Class I and Class II cavities were selected. They were divided into four groups of 20 teeth each, to be restored with composite resin using different treatment protocols. Postoperative sensitivity to cold water at various temperatures was assessed for up to three months. The data was interpreted using Chi Square Test for homogeneity among the groups, and Z values of significance for pair-wise evaluation were determined. It was found that use of self-etching primers as bonding agents underneath the composite resin restorations were associated with significantly decreased incidence of postoperative sensitivity to cold stimuli."
CD010526,0,9002870,0,Influence of bonded amalgam restorations on the fracture strength of teeth.,"This study evaluated the effect of bonded amalgam on the fracture strength of teeth using five adhesive systems: Panavia 21, Amalgambond Plus, Imperva Dual Bond, All-Bond 2 Primer/Bonding Resin, and All-Bond 2 Primer/Liner F. Intact teeth and amalgam lined with Copalite were used as control groups. Large MOD preparations were made in 20 extracted maxillary premolars for each group. The teeth were restored with Tytin. All groups were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 15 days and thermocycled 2500 times, over 8-48 degrees C. The specimens were preloaded five times in compression to 10 kg using a 5 mm-in-diameter, cylindrical steel indenter that contacted the teeth only on the cuspal inclines. Then the teeth were loaded to failure at 5.0 mm/min. The failure mode was recorded (amalgam failure, cusp fracture, or failure at the tooth/amalgam interface). The mean fracture strengths were analyzed using ANOVA and Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons. The Imperva Dual Bond group showed the highest mean forces followed by All-Bond 2 Primer/Bonding Resin. The All-Bond 2 Primer/Liner F and Amalgambond Plus groups demonstrated lower means and were not significantly different from the Copalite group. The Panavia 21 group was in between these two groups and was not statistically different from either group. The mean strength of intact teeth was the highest, but its very large coefficient of variation (60%) prevented effective use of these data for statistical comparison. Analysis of the mode of fracture showed that Panavia 21, All-Bond 2 Primer/Bonding Resin, and Amalgambond Plus failed cohesively in the amalgam in 35%, 25%, and 15% of the specimens respectively. This fracture type is a good indication of effective bonding between tooth and amalgam. The most common type of fracture for all the restored groups was the one that occurred at the tooth/restoration interface. This would suggest that current bonding procedures could be improved."

CD010526,0,20944889,0,Effect of biomechanical preparation and calcium hydroxide pastes on the antisepsis of root canal systems in dogs.,"In the endodontic treatment of root canals with necrotic pulps associated with periapical radiolucent areas, one of the main objectives of treatment consists in eliminating the microorganisms spread throughout the ramifications of the root canal system. The scope of this study was to evaluate the antiseptic efficacy of biomechanical preparation and two calcium hydroxide-based pastes, in dogs' teeth with experimentally induced chronic periapical lesions. After initial microbiological sampling, instrumentation of the root canals was undertaken using the conventional technique, using K type files used in conjunction with a solution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. After ninety-six hours, further microbiological sampling was undertaken and Calen/CPMC or Calasept pastes were applied for 15 and 30 days. Ninety six hours after the removal of the medication, the third microbiological sampling was undertaken and finally histomicrobiological analysis followed using Brown & Brenn staining. The results were analyzed using the Kruskall-Wallis test, with a level of significance established at 5% (p<0.05). It was shown that the biomechanical preparation significantly reduced the number of colony forming units of microorganisms in root canals. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the antiseptic action of long-term dressings over two periods of action, although 30 days produced a greater reduction in the quantity of microorganisms and of positive microbiological cultures. In histological sections of the four experimental groups, similar microbiological patterns were shown (p>0.05), characterized by an elevated incidence of cocci, bacilli and filaments, predominantly gram-positive, in root canals, secondary canals and accessories, apical cementoplasts and dentinal tubules, but with a low incidence of microorganisms in areas of cementum resorption and the periapical lesion. The biomechanical preparation and intracanal dressing based on calcium hydroxide were important in the antisepsis of the root canal; however, both procedures did not produce significant changes in the microbiological aspects of the root canal system."
CD010526,0,1465561,0,Dentin hypersensitivity treated with a fluoride-containing varnish or a light-cured glass-ionomer liner.,"Dentin hypersensitivity in 112 teeth was randomly treated with Duraphat or Vitrabond. No patients were included unless they, without being asked, complained about daily pain for a long period of time caused by cold, warm, sweet, sour, touch or any combination of these five variables. Patients were excluded if the dentin hypersensitivity could have been caused by cervical abrasion/erosion lesions deeper than 1 mm, cracked-tooth syndrome, caries lesions, operative caries treatment, and/or periodontal surgery or root scaling within the last 6 months. The pain was registered on a binary scale: 1) pain before the treatment; and 2) pain/no pain after the treatment. With Duraphat, 22% of the treatments failed within 1 wk and the cumulative 1-yr success rate was 41%. With Vitrabond, 2% failed within the first week and the 1-yr success rate was 79%. The difference between the two treatments was highly significant. Patients in whom Duraphat failed were treated with Vitrabond and vice versa; the 1-yr success rate for the retreated teeth was 68% when ""Duraphat-failures"" were treated with Vitrabond and 42% when ""Vitrabond-failures"" were treated with Duraphat."
CD010526,0,16728245,0,Effect of hygroscopic expansion on the push-out resistance of glass ionomer-based cements used for the luting of glass fiber posts.,"This study examined the contribution of hygroscopic expansion of glass-ionomer (GIC) and resin modified glass-ionomer (RMGIC) luting cements to the push-out resistance of fiber posts. Glass fiber posts were luted to post spaces using different cements. Experimental specimens were stored in water, while control specimens were desiccated and stored in mineral oil to eliminate water from intraradicular dentinal tubules and/or the external environment that could have contributed to hygroscopic expansion of the cements. Thin slice push-out tests revealed no difference in retention strengths of resin composite cements that were stored in water or oil. Conversely, GIC and RMGIC cements exhibited increased retention strengths after water sorption. As unfavorable cavity geometry is taxing to dentin bond integrity in root canals, a strategy that relies on increasing the frictional resistance to post dislodgement via delayed hygroscopic expansion of glass-ionomer based materials may be a more pragmatic approach to fiber post retention."
CD010526,0,15458506,0,Dentin adhesion and microleakage of a resin-based calcium phosphate pulp capping and basing cement.,"An experimental resin-based bioactive calcium phosphate cement, intended as a pulp capping and basing material, was evaluated for dentin shear bond strength and microleakage. The interfacial morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For microleakage, dentin cavities without (Group A) or after (Group B) acid etching were restored with the calcium phosphate cement. A resin-based calcium hydroxide (VLC Dycal; Group C) was used as control material according to the manufacturer's instructions. After water storage and thermocycling, the microleakage was scored using a AgNO(3) staining procedure. For the shear bond strength, flat exposed dentin surfaces were treated as for the microleakage test. Metal irises pressed against the dentin surface were filled with the cements, which were photocured. Both tests were carried out after 1 wk. While acid etching did not result in significantly greater microleakage, it led to higher shear bond strength, and allowed, as shown by SEM, the formation of a hybrid layer and resin tags. Both groups treated with the calcium phosphate cement had significantly lower microleakage scores and higher mean shear bond strength values than the groups treated with the control material."
CD010526,0,15490780,0,The effect of glass ionomer cement or composite resin bases on restoration of cuspal stiffness of endodontically treated premolars in vitro.,"The purpose of the present study was to decide whether composite resin or conventional glass ionomer cement should be preferred as a base material in endodontically treated premolars. Twelve extracted human maxillary premolars were mounted in a universal testing machine at a 35 degrees angle. Cuspal stiffness was determined by applying a load of 75 N to the buccal cusp and recording the displacement of the cusp using inductive displacement transducers. In the same teeth, different cavity preparations and restorations were performed sequentially. Standard MOD cavities were enlarged to allow endodontic access. In addition, the cusps were undermined. Half of the teeth were restored to the level of the previous shallow cavities using conventional glass ionomer cement (Ketac Fil), in the rest of the teeth dentine bonding agent (Syntac) and composite resin (Tetric) were used instead. Finally, composite resin fillings (Tetric) were placed. All restorations were removed and the experiments were repeated twice. For each replication, the assignment of the base materials to the experimental groups was reversed, and ceramic inlays (Empress) were used as final restorations for the last replication. Improvement of cuspal stiffness achieved by conventional glass ionomer bases was very small, whereas composite resin bases increased cuspal stability by more than a factor of two. After placement of the final restorations, however, there was no longer a difference between teeth with different base materials. Nevertheless, composite resin bases might be preferred for two reasons. Firstly, deterioration of adhesive restorations will probably start at the cavosurface margins. The incidence of margin gaps, however, will not only compromise marginal seal but also the stabilizing effect of the restoration. In this situation, the resin base may still stabilize the tooth. Moreover, resin bases may reduce the risk of cusp fracture during the time between cavity preparation and the insertion of adhesive inlays."
CD010526,0,15255437,0,An evaluation of sealing ability of endodontic materials as root canal sealers.,"An in vitro dye leakage study was carried out to compare the apical microleakage of vitapex (calcium hydroxide based paste) when used with single gutta percha cone with that of dentalis KEZ (calcium hydroxide and zincoxide eugenol based sealer) and zincoxide-eugenol sealer when used with laterally condensed gutta percha obturation technique. One hundred single rooted human anterior teeth were instrumented and randomly divided into three experimental groups of 30 teeth each and two control groups of 5 teeth each. Teeth in the first group were obturated using a single master gutta percha cone and vitapex as root canal sealer and those of second group were obturated with laterally condensed gutta percha using dentalis KEZ as sealer. Third experimental group was filled with laterally condensed gutta-percha using zinc-oxide eugenol as sealer. Teeth were then suspended in 2% methylene blue. After this, teeth were demineralized dehydrated and cleared. Linear dye penetration was determined under stereomicroscope (x10) with calibrated eye piece. Results of this study showed that calcium hydroxide based endodontic material leaked comparatively less as compared to zinc oxide Eugenol sealer. Vitapex with single gutta-percha cone provided an adequate apical Seal against dye penetration."
CD010526,0,19089038,0,Delayed tooth replantation after root surface treatment with sodium hypochlorite and sodium fluoride: histomorphometric analysis in rats.,"In cases of delayed tooth replantation, non-vital periodontal ligament remnants have been removed with sodium hypochlorite in an attempt to control root resorption. Nevertheless, reports of its irritating potential in contact with the alveolar connective tissue have been described. Therefore, this study evaluated the healing process on delayed replantation of rat teeth, after periodontal ligament removal by different treatment modalities. Twenty-four rats, assigned to 3 groups (n=8), had their upper right incisor extracted and left on the workbench for desiccation during 60 min. Afterwards, the teeth in group I were immersed in saline for 2 min. In group II, root surfaces were scrubbed with gauze soaked in saline for 2 min; and in group III, scrubbing was done with gauze soaked in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Thereafter, root surfaces were etched with 37% phosphoric acid and immersed in 2% acidulate-phosphate sodium fluoride solution, at pH 5.5. Root canals were filled with a calcium hydroxide-based paste and the teeth were replanted. The animals were sacrificed 60 days postoperatively and the pieces containing the replanted teeth were processed and paraffin- embedded. Semi-serial transversally sections were obtained from the middle third of the root and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histomorphometric analysis. Data were analyzed statistically using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests. The results showed that root structure and cementum extension were more affected by resorption in group III (p<0.05). All groups were affected by root resorption but the treatment performed in group III was the least effective for its control. The treatment accomplished in groups I and II yielded similar results to each other."
CD010526,0,21653696,0,Retuning Rieske-type oxygenases to expand substrate range.,"Rieske-type oxygenases are promising biocatalysts for the destruction of persistent pollutants or for the synthesis of fine chemicals. In this work, we explored pathways through which Rieske-type oxygenases evolve to expand their substrate range. BphAE(p4), a variant biphenyl dioxygenase generated from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 BphAE(LB400) by the double substitution T335A/F336M, and BphAE(RR41), obtained by changing Asn(338), Ile(341), and Leu(409) of BphAE(p4) to Gln(338), Val(341), and Phe(409), metabolize dibenzofuran two and three times faster than BphAE(LB400), respectively. Steady-state kinetic measurements of single- and multiple-substitution mutants of BphAE(LB400) showed that the single T335A and the double N338Q/L409F substitutions contribute significantly to enhanced catalytic activity toward dibenzofuran. Analysis of crystal structures showed that the T335A substitution relieves constraints on a segment lining the catalytic cavity, allowing a significant displacement in response to dibenzofuran binding. The combined N338Q/L409F substitutions alter substrate-induced conformational changes of protein groups involved in subunit assembly and in the chemical steps of the reaction. This suggests a responsive induced fit mechanism that retunes the alignment of protein atoms involved in the chemical steps of the reaction. These enzymes can thus expand their substrate range through mutations that alter the constraints or plasticity of the catalytic cavity to accommodate new substrates or that alter the induced fit mechanism required to achieve proper alignment of reaction-critical atoms or groups."
CD010526,0,19089068,0,Elimination of intracanal infection in dogs' teeth with induced periapical lesions after rotary instrumentation: influence of different calcium hydroxide pastes.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiseptic efficacy of rotary instrumentation associated with calcium hydroxide-based pastes prepared with different vehicles and antiseptics. Chronic periapical lesions were experimentally induced in 72 premolar root canals of four dogs. Under controlled asepsis, after initial microbiological sampling (A1), the root canals were instrumented using the ProFile system in conjunction with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and the intracanal medication was placed. Four experimental groups were formed according to the pastes used: group 1- Calen (n=18), group 2- Calen+CPMC (n=20), group 3- Ca(OH)(2) p.a.+ anaesthetic solution (n=16) and group 4- Ca(OH)(2) p.a.+ 2% chlorhexidine digluconate (n=18). After 21 days, the pastes were removed; the canals were emptied and 96 hours later a second microbiological sample was obtained (A2). The incidence of positive microbiological cultures and the number of cfus in stages A1 and A2 were compared statistically by the Wilcoxon test while the influence of the different treatments in intracanal infection was evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis test at 5% significance level (p<0.05). Large numbers of strict and facultative anaerobes, and viridans group streptococci were found in 100% of root canals of A1 samples. Among A2 samples, all treatments showed significant reduction of cfus and positive cultures (p<0.05), but only groups 3 and 4 showed 100% of root canals free of microorganisms. Rotary instrumentation plus NaOCl 5.25% associated with intracanal medication produced a drastic reduction or elimination of intracanal microbiota, whose performance was not influenced by the nature of the vehicle or the antiseptic added to the Ca(OH)(2) p.a."
CD010526,0,7988770,0,Shear bond of resin cement to post-cured hybrid composites.,"Various surface treatments affected the shear bond strength of a dual-cured resin cement to a post-cured composite. Disks of post-cured composite inlay 2.0 mm thick by 10.0 mm in diameter, were mounted in acrylic cylinders. Various surface treatments were tested including: 1) smooth material; 2) treated by sandblasting (air abrasion); 3) sandblasting and etching with hydrofluoric acid (HF); 4) sandblasting and silane priming; 5) sandblasting, HF etching and silane priming; 6) HF etching alone; 7) HF etching and silane priming; and 8) silane priming alone. Specimens of dual-cured cement, 4.0 mm in diameter, were light-cured onto the prepared surfaces. The samples were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 7d before shear bond testing. The highest mean shear bond strengths were achieved for specimens with the following surface treatments: 1) by a combination of sandblasting, HF etching and silane priming; 2) sandblasting and HF etching; and 3) sandblasting and silane priming. Most bond failures in these groups were cohesive within the post-cured composite inlay disks. The bond strengths of the specimen in other groups were significantly lower and bond failures were mainly adhesive at the interface between the disk of post-cured composite and dual-cured resin cement."
CD010526,0,2605764,0,Pulpal response to a spherical-submicrofilled resin; the effectiveness of a film-like lining material adhesive to dentin as pulp protection.,"This clinico-pathological study was made to investigate the pulp reaction to a restoration system employing a spherical-submicrofilled resin with or without protection by a lining material adhesive to dentin. Black's Class I cavities were prepared in 71 vital human permanent teeth; these were divided into two groups with and without an adhesive film like lining material. The treated teeth were observed clinically over 90 days after operation. They were then extracted for histological examination. As a result of this study, this restoration system was recognized as a genuinely valuable one, and this lining material was acknowledged to be effective in pulp protection."

CD010526,0,17896116,0,Effect of different adhesive protocols vs calcium hydroxide on primary tooth pulp with different remaining dentin thicknesses:24-month results.,"The aim of this randomized, controlled, single-blind and prospective study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic success rates of three different bonding protocols vs calcium hydroxide liner for protection of the dentin-pulp complex of primary molars with different remaining dentin thicknesses. Two hundred forty primary molar teeth with moderate to deep occlusal caries were restored in 97 children who met inclusion criteria. After cavity preparation, the teeth were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 60/group) with respect to the material used for protection of the dentin-pulp complex: (1) total-etching with 36% phosphoric acid followed by an acetone-based adhesive (Prime&Bond NT), (2) a self-etch adhesive system (Xeno III), (3) an acetone-based adhesive (Prime&Bond NT) without prior acid conditioning, and (4) control: calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal). Teeth in groups 1-3 were restored with a polyacid-modified resin-based composite (Dyract AP) and those in group 4 with amalgam. The remaining dentin thickness was calculated using image analysis software (ImageJ). The teeth were evaluated clinically and radiographically for 24 months. The distribution of restored teeth with minimal remaining dentin thickness (< or =0.5 mm) was 3.3, 8.3, 8.3, and 10% for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Despite the absence of pulpal protection in groups 1-3, none of those teeth exhibited any significant clinical or radiographic symptom during the study period. After 2 years, the clinical and radiographic success rate of restorative treatments was 100%. Protection of the dentin-pulp complex with the tested bonding protocols resulted in similar outcomes in mainly shallow and medium deep cavities as compared to calcium hydroxide amalgam in more deep cavities, when indirect pulp treatment was performed in class I compomer restorations."
CD010526,0,8300324,0,A comparison of glass-ionomer cement and calcium hydroxide liners in amalgam restorations.,"This study compared the caries inhibition and microleakage of two liners under amalgam restorations. Thirty-two molars received mesio-occlusal and disto-occlusal Class II cavity preparations. Calcium hydroxide was randomly placed as a liner in one preparation of each tooth and glass-ionomer cement liner was placed in the other. Amalgam restorations were placed. Teeth were axially loaded and an acid-protective varnish was placed. Teeth were placed into artificial saliva for 3 months, thermocycled, and cycled through a caries challenge. Sections were obtained from 20 teeth and photographed under polarized light. The remaining teeth were placed in 2% basic fuchsin and sectioned. A t-test indicated that restorations with glass-ionomer cement liners exhibited significantly less demineralization and microleakage than did restorations with calcium hydroxide liners."
CD010526,0,9484151,0,Fracture resistance of complex amalgam restorations.,"This study evaluated fracture resistance provided to complex amalgam restorations by adhesive and mechanical resistance features. The occlusal surfaces of 30 extracted molar teeth of similar size were ground flat to approximately 2 mm coronal to the CEJ. The teeth were divided into three groups. Roots were notched and embedded in acrylic resin. In two groups, four TMS Minim stainless steel pins were placed into dentin at the line angles. A copper band matrix was applied to each specimen and reinforced with compound. After applying either Copalite or Amalgambond Plus, Tytin amalgam was condensed into the matrix. The bands and excess amalgam were removed 10 minutes later, and each amalgam occlusal surface was ground flat to give the amalgam restoration a 4 mm occlusal height. Specimens were thermocycled for 2500 cycles at 6-60 degrees C with a 30-second dwell time. They were then stored in deionized water for 1 month at room temperature. A 1 mm 45 degrees bevel was placed on the facio-occlusal angle of the amalgam. Each specimen was loaded to failure in compression at 45 degrees in an Instron Testing Machine at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The groups were: Group 1, four Minim pins and Copalite; Group 2, four Minim pins and Amalgambond Plus; and Group 3, Amalgambond Plus only. The data were analyzed using a one-factor ANOVA and a Tukey B post hoc test. There was no significant difference between Groups 1 and 3. The Amalgambond Plus combined with pins provided significantly greater resistance to fracture than pins or Amalgambond Plus alone (P < 0.05)."
CD010526,0,25598813,0,Fluoride varnish as root canal sealer: a scanning electron microscopy and bacterial penetration study.,This study was carried out to evaluate the bacterial leakage of root canal fillings when cavity varnish containing 5% fluoride (Duraflur) was used as root canal sealer.
CD010526,0,11931134,0,Penetrability of dentinal tubules in adhesive-lined cavity walls.,"This study investigated the penetrability of dentinal tubules in cavity walls lined with different dentin bonding systems. Occlusal Class I cavities were prepared in 93 premolars. The cavities in the control group had an intact smear layer without a lining, while those in the experimental group were lined with Gluma CPS, Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus or One-Step. The penetrability of the dentinal tubules was tested with a dye (basic fuchsin) or bacteria (S faecalis) immediately after adhesive lining and after one-month storage in water at 37 degrees C. Some of the lined samples were sectioned and examined under the SEM. In some samples in the experimental group, the dye penetrated to the pulp and bacteria up to 125 microm into the dentinal tubules immediately after lining. The Kruskal Wallis ANOVA and Tukey test showed the depth of dye and bacterial penetration to be significantly less in teeth with bonding systems than those in the control group (p<0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the control and experimental groups after storage in water (p>0.05). SEM examination showed that the hybrid layer and resin tags were present in the cavity walls immediately after lining but absent after storage in water. Therefore, adhesive linings under the experimental conditions were ineffective in preventing dye or bacterial penetration of the dentinal tubules."
CD010526,0,9227124,0,Marginal adaptation of composite restorations versus hybrid ionomer/composite sandwich restorations.,"The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the approximal marginal quality of composite fillings using a dentin bonding system to the marginal quality of hybrid ionomer/composite sandwich restorations. Forty-eight standardized class 2 cavity preparations were prepared in caries-free, human third molars. Twelve preparations at a time were filled either with a composite using the matching dentin bonding system, SZ (Scotchbond MP/Z100) or PP (PROBOND/Prisma TPH) or with hybrid ionomer/composite sandwich fillings VZ (Vitremer/Z100) or DP (Dyract/Prisma TPH). Margins were evaluated before and after thermomechanical loading (TCML) (5000 cycles [+5 degrees C/+55 degrees C], 72.5 N [1,7 Hz]) by quantitative scanning electron microscope analysis using an image analyzing system. Furthermore, microleakage was assessed by dye penetration before and after TCML. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test at the 0.05 level of significance. SEM analysis after TCML showed significantly fewer marginal gaps at the material/dentin interface with VZ (2.2%), DP (7.3%), and PP (6.0%) compared to SZ (29.6%). After TCML, SZ showed significantly more marginal gaps at the material/dentin interface, whereas VZ, DP, and PP were not susceptible to TCML. PP showed the highest percentage in marginal swelling before (18.2%) and after TCML (15.9%), while VZ showed no marginal swelling at all. VZ showed significantly fewer marginal gaps at the composite/hybrid ionomer interface than DP. After TCML there was no significant difference in marginal gaps between the hybrid ionomer/enamel and the hybrid ionomer/dentin interface for both Vitremer and Dyract. Using the sandwich technique the Z100/enamel interface had significantly more marginal gaps than all other composite/enamel interfaces after TCML. There was no significant difference in microleakage between the test groups at the material/dentin interface. SEM analysis and dye penetration showed that hybrid ionomer/composite sandwich restorations have good marginal qualities and may be an alternative to composite restorations using a dentin bonding system."
CD010526,0,26062855,0,Comparative study of radiopacity of resin-based and glass ionomer-based bulk-fill restoratives using digital radiography.,"This study investigated the radiopacity values of glass ionomer- and resin-based bulk-fill restoratives of different thicknesses using digital radiography. Two glass ionomer-based and three resin-based bulk-fill restoratives, and a conventional composite were studied. Five disc-shaped specimens were prepared from each of these materials at three different thicknesses; specimens of enamel and dentin with the same thicknesses were also prepared. Materials were placed over a complementary metal oxide-semiconductor sensor together with the tooth specimen and an aluminum step-wedge, and then exposed using a dental X-ray unit. The images were analyzed using a software program to measure the mean gray values (MGVs), which were converted to equivalent aluminum thicknesses. Two-way ANOVA was used to investigate the significance of differences among the groups. The GCP Glass Fill specimens showed the lowest radiopacity values, and the Quixfil specimens had the highest values. All materials had higher radiopacity values than enamel and dentin, except for GCP Glass Fill, which had a radiopacity similar to that of enamel. The resin-based bulk-fill restoratives had significantly higher radiopacity values than glass ionomer-based restoratives. All of the tested materials showed radiopacity values higher than that of dentin, as recommended by the ISO."

CD010526,0,12413218,0,The effectiveness of four-cavity treatment systems in sealing amalgam restorations.,"Amalgam does not bond to tooth tissue; therefore, restorations using such material are prone to leakage despite the deposition of corrosion products. This study evaluated the effectiveness of four cavity treatment systems placed in vivo in sealing restorations of amalgam. Four cavity treatment systems were investigated in this study: Cervitec, Gluma One Bond, Panavia 21 and Copaliner Dentin Varnish and Sealant. No cavity treatment was placed in an additional group to serve as a control. The teeth were extracted within 15 minutes of restoration placement. The specimens were thermocycled (5-55 +/- 2 degrees C, 500 cycles), immersed in a dye solution, sectioned and scored for leakage. Scanning electron microscopy also examined features of the tooth/restoration interfaces. There were statistically significant differences among the groups regarding leakage scores (p = 0.00). None of the materials tested consistently prevented leakage; however, use of Copaliner Dentin Varnish and Sealant resulted in less overall, occlusal and cervical microleakage than any other systems tested. Significantly more leakage was observed in relation to the cervical portions of the cavities (p = 0.00). No significant differences were identified between the leakage scores obtained for the buccal and palatal (lingual) cavities and the different tooth types (p = 0.52 and 0.83, respectively). A level of significance of 0.05 was selected in all cases. The benefits of the materials tested in this study need to be evaluated using robust, long-term clinical studies. Further work should continue to develop laboratory tests that predict the behavior and performance of cavity sealants in clinical service."

CD010526,0,10337298,0,Fracture strength of Class 2 amalgams with various cavity-lining materials.,"This in vitro study compared the fracture resistance of class 2 amalgam restorations placed over seven materials: three resin-modified glass-ionomer cements (Fuji II LC, Vitrebond, and Vitremer), one polyacid-modified composite resin (VariGlass VLC), two conventional glass-ionomer cements (Ketac-Bond and GlasIonomer Cement), and one calcium-hydroxide material (Dycal). Eighty maxillary molars with flattened occlusal surfaces were divided into 14 experimental groups and two control (no liner) groups. One standardized class 2 amalgam cavity preparation was completed per tooth. Lining materials standardized at a thickness of 0.5 mm were placed in the approximal box portion of 10 test specimens per experimental group. Spherical amalgam was hand condensed into each cavity preparation. At 1 hour and again at 7 days, five samples from each group were fractured in compression using an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The force was directed at 10 degrees to the long axis of the tooth, 2.0 mm inside the approximal portion of the restoration. Results were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA for time and material. No statistically significant differences were found among the materials and controls at either time interval tested (P > 0.05). A statistically significant difference was found (P < 0.05) when comparing 1-hour and 7-day strengths. The 7-day specimens were more resistant to fracture than the 1-hour specimens."

CD010526,0,10865391,0,Comparative quantitative and qualitative assessment of the marginal adaptation and apposition of bonded amalgam restorations using luting glass ionomer and 4-META adhesive liner under a scanning electron microscope. An in vitro study.,"The present invitro study was conducted to assess the marginal adaptation and apposition of amalgam restorations bonded to tooth structure, using freshly mixed luting glass ionomer cement (type 1) and compared with the much documented material--Amalgam bond (4-META). Twelve freshly extracted human premolar teeth were used and class V cavities were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of twelve teeth for the experimental groups. Buccal cavities (class V) were prepared on twelve other teeth for the control group. In the control, two coats of cavity varnish was applied as the liner. The experimental groups were lined with freshly mixed luting glass ionomer in twelve buccal cavities and amalgam bond adhesive liner in twelve lingual cavities. The amalgam was then condensed before the liner sets in all the cavities. The teeth were sectioned and mounted on aluminum stubs and then placed in the scanning electron microscope and were observed. The results of the study showed that marginal interface gaps were higher with luting glass ionomer and cavity varnish than with amalgam bond as the liner. The results were statistically not significant. All the three groups were effected by the severe thermal stresses introduced by the microscopy with the glass ionomer cement suffering the worst. The present investigation confirms that glass ionomer cement (type 1) can be effectively used as a bonding agent between amalgam and the tooth when it is painted onto the cavity walls after which the amalgam is condensed immediately, prior to its setting. Its ability to bond amalgam to the tooth structure with minimal gaps is comparable to that of amalgam bond."

CD010526,0,273363,0,Penetration of ions from silicate cement restorations into Copalite--covered cavity walls.,"This study aimed to asses the effect of silicate cement on Copalite -covered cavity walls in extracted human teeth. Class V cavities were prepared in 24 premolars and filled with silicate cement (Bio-Trey). Four cavities were unlined, the rest of the cavities were lined with 1 or 2 layers of Copalite before insertion of the restorations. After 6 months, 70-100 microns thick longitudinal sections of the teeth were studied by polarized light microscopy, microradiography and electron probe microanalysis. When imbibed in water or quinoline, a subsurface zone of altered birefringence was noticed in nearly all cavity walls. Nearly half of the cavity walls in the experimental groups showed a surface zone of increased radiopacity. In a few instances a subsurface radiolucent zone was present. By electron probe microanalysis F (0,4-3% by weight), Zn (1-4%) and Al (0,2-6%) were measured in the outer 10-60 microns of the cavity walls. The study shows that even with a double layer of Copalite, known to prevent microleakage, a desirable uptake of F and Al from silicate restorations into cavity walls can take place. Copalite does not prevent a phosphoric acid effect on the cavity walls."
CD010526,0,2391664,0,Microleakage of extended and nonextended Class I composite resin and sealant restorations.,"Favorable results of composite resin sealant restorations in narrow occlusal cavities raise the question of whether extended cavity preparation is justified. Larger restorations are subject to increased polymerization shrinkage. Microleakage of extended and nonextended composite resin sealant restorations was tested in this study. Forty extracted caries-free third molars were allocated to four experimental groups. Occlusal cavity preparations were prepared, varying from narrow cavities restricted to the central fossa to preparations eradicating all fissures. Composite resin restorations were inserted with or without a base and with or without a sealant. Control restorations were inserted in nonetched preparations. Microleakage occurred when cavities were not etched and occassionally when a sealant was not applied. Conclusions indicate that a class I composite resin restoration extended beyond the central fossa can be free of microleakage if covered with a fissure sealant."

CD010526,0,16924340,0,Effect of eugenol-based endodontic cement on the adhesion of intraradicular posts.,"The present study evaluated, in vitro, the influence of an eugenol-based endodontic sealer (EndoFill) on the adhesion of intra-radicular posts cemented with a resin-based cement (Enforce) ou a zinc phosphate cement. Twenty-four single-rooted maxillary canines were divided into 2 groups (n=12) and obturated with either gutta-percha points plus EndoFill or gutta-percha points alone (no cement). In each group, half of intracanal posts (n=6) were cemented with Enforce resin-based cement and half with zinc phosphate cement. Specimens were submitted to pull-out test in an Instron machine and tensile force was applied at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min until post dislodgement. The maximum forces required for post removal was recorded (N) and means were submitted to statistical analysis by Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.01). Posts cemented with zinc phosphate cement were significantly more retentive (353.4 N) than those cemented with Enforce (134.9 N) (p<0.01). Regarding the influence of the eugenol-based cement (EndoFill) on post retention, there was statistically significant difference (p<0.01) only between the groups cemented with Enforce, i.e., in the canals filled with EndoFill + guta-percha there was lower bond strength than in the canals filled with gutta-percha points alone (101.5 and 168.2 N, respectively). In conclusion, the zinc-phosphate-based cement showed greater post retention than the resin-based cement. The findings of this study suggest that the eugenol-containing sealer interfered with the adhesive properties of the resin-based cement."

Eighty third-molars were used. Two cavities were prepared in each tooth. The cavities were distributed into 16 groups. Cavities with EM were filled with the following material combinations: G1: Single-Bond 2 (Sb2), G2: Sb2 + Bond/Scotchbond-Multipurpose (Sb2B), G3: Sb2 + Filtek-Flow Z350 (Sb2Fl), G4: Scotchbond-Multipurpose (SBMP), G5: Clearfil-S3 (CS3), G6: CS3 + Bond/Clearfil-SE Bond (CSE3B), G7: CS3 + Protect Liner F (CS3PL) and G8: Clearfil SE Bond + Protect Liner F (CSEBPL). The same combinations were applied to the cavities in CM: G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, respectively. The fillings were performed with the Sinfony-System (3M/ESPE). After 24 h, the teeth were submitted to thermocycling (2,000 cycles, 5° to 55°C) and load-cycling (50,000 cycles, 50 N). Next, the Caries-Detector (Kuraray) was applied to the restoration margins. Images from the proximal margin were evaluated using the Image-Tool 3.0 software. The results were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey's test (α=0.05). The mean values (%) for the groups were: EM: G1=46.68, G2=15.53, G3=19.83, G4=27.53; G5=59.49, G6=25.13, G7=34.37, G8=15.20; CM: G9=38.38, G10=23.25, G11=26.97, G12=25.85, G13=37.81, G14=30.62, G15=29.17, G16=20.31. The highest percentages of marginal gap on EM or CM were found in the groups that did not use a liner. It can be concluded that the most appropriate RCT combinations were the groups that used a liner."
CD010526,0,20944873,0,"In vitro evaluation of the marginal microleakage of amalgam restorations associated with dentin adhesive, glass ionomer cement and cavity varnish by means of different evaluation methods.","This in vitro study evaluated the marginal microleakage of amalgam restorations associated with the cavity varnish Copalite - Cooley & Cooley (GI-CP), dentin adhesive OptiBond Solo - Kerr (GII-OS) and the glass ionomer cement Vitremer - 3M (GIII-VT). Forty-five premolars were employed, which were submitted to independent class II preparations at the mesial and distal aspects comprising the marginal ridges and were restored with Dispersalloy - Dentsply. Afterwards, the teeth were thermocycled and stored in 0.5% basic fuchsine for 24 hours. The evaluations were conducted on a light microscope with 150x magnification and on the Sigma Scan software with employment of a single line and segmented lines. Data analysis allowed to establish that none of the materials was able to eliminate the marginal microleakage, having the GI - CP presented greater and statistically significant values in relation to the other groups in all evaluation methods (p<0.05). The lowest values were displayed by the GIII-VT, yet with no statistically significant difference when compared to GII-OS, except for the evaluation at the Sigma Scan in single line. The three evaluation methods showed a strong positive relationship to each other."
CD010526,0,15195731,0,Influence of flowable composite lining thickness on Class II composite restorations.,"This in vitro study aimed to investigate the influence of flowable composite lining with different thicknesses on the marginal quality and internal porosity of Class II composite restorations. Thirty-two intact molars, each prepared with two box-only Class II cavities, were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1, P60 filling alone; Group 2, ultrathin flowable composite lining/co-cured with overlaying composite; Group 3, thin lining/pre-cured and Group 4, thick lining/pre-cured. The teeth were then thermocycled for 1500 cycles (between 5 degrees C and 60 degrees C) and dye immersed for 24 hours. Exterior surface replicas of these restorations were fabricated before and after thermocycling and examined by SEM to evaluate percentages of the five marginal patterns. Data was statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA test. The teeth were subsequently sectioned longitudinally. The interface microleakage of cervical margin was measured as to the extent of dye penetration. Internal voids were separately recorded in the cervical interface and the cervical and occlusal halves of the restorations. Mann-Whitney test was applied to analyze the interface microleakage and internal voids. Results revealed that replicas of Group 4 presented the highest percentage of marginal openings both before and after thermocycling in SEM examination. Group 2 exhibited superior marginal quality in interface microleakage evaluation compared to the other groups, while Group 4 exhibited the worst. The pre-cured groups (Group 3 and 4) showed significant reduction in interface and cervical voids. Despite the reduction in interface voids, a thick lining may impair the marginal sealing, especially after thermocycling. It was concluded that a minimally thin flowable composite lining improved cavity adaptation and marginal sealing."
CD010526,0,23657417,0,Use of glass ionomer cement containing antibiotics to seal off infected dentin: a randomized clinical trial.,"Dental materials with antibacterial properties can prevent the harmful effects caused by oral cariogenic bacteria. This double-blind controlled clinical trial evaluated the performance of a glass ionomer cement (GIC) added with antibiotics for sealing infected dentin in atraumatic restorations of primary molars. The study enrolled 45 children (45 teeth) between 5 and 8 years of age, of both genders, divided into two groups: GC (n=22), where cavities were lined with a conventional GIC (Vidrion F) and GA (n=23), with cavities lined with Vidrion F added with 1% each of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and cefaclor antibiotic. Both groups were restored with Ketac Molar Easymix. Molars with carious lesions on the inner half of dentin without clinical or radiographic pulp damage were selected. Patients were evaluated clinically (pain, fistulas or mobility) and radiographically (area of caries, periapical region and furcation) after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. For statistical analysis, chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used with a 5% significance level. GA (82.6-95.7%) had better results than GC (12.5-36.4%) in all evaluations (p<0.05) and the difference in the success rate was 46.2-72.5% higher for GA. The use of the antibiotic-containing GIC liner on infected dentin proved satisfactory when applied in deciduous teeth."
CD010526,0,19776504,0,Caries-preventive effect of glass ionomer and resin-based fissure sealants on permanent teeth: a meta analysis.,"The purpose of this quantitative systematic review was to appraise the evidence on the caries-preventive effect of glass ionomer cement (GIC) in relation to resin-based fissure sealants. Nine English and two Portuguese databases were searched (15 January 2008). Randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews were considered for inclusion. Trial exclusion criteria were: drop-out rates > 33%; no randomization; baseline differences in groups not statistically adjusted; and no clinically important outcomes were presented. Two authors reviewed the articles independently. The outcome measure for the caries preventive effect was caries absence on sealed teeth. Of the 112 identified articles, 25 were selected for review. Of these, 14 were excluded and 11 accepted (8 trials; 3 systematic reviews). The accepted reviews provided no evidence of superiority of either sealant material. Six trials were included for meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 0.96, 95% CI 0.62-1.49, indicating no difference in the caries-preventive effect of GIC and resin-based fissure sealant material. This systematic review with meta-analysis found no evidence that either material was superior to the other in the prevention of dental caries. Thus, both materials appear equally suitable for clinical application as a fissure sealant material."
CD010526,0,1337901,0,The apical seal of root canal sealing cements using a radionuclide detection technique.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the apical seal obtained with various root canal sealing cements using a new method based on the use of a radionuclide and an external detection technique. A total of 150 maxillary incisors and canines, which had been kept in saline solution, were used. The root canals were instrumented with a stepback technique and circumferential filing. Six experimental groups and two control groups were randomly formed. Each experimental group was obturated by a lateral condensation technique with gutta-percha points and a different sealing cement (two based on zinc oxide-eugenol cement, two based on resins and two on calcium hydroxide); the positive control used gutta-percha without sealing cement, while in the negative control the apex was covered with nail varnish, leaving the root canal empty. The apical leakage was measured using an external detection technique after submerging the root apices in a solution containing the radioisotope metastable 99Tc. No leakage was observed in the negative control group. There was a large difference between the leakage observed in the positive control group and the experimental groups. The best seal was obtained using Sealapex cement, which differed significantly from AH26, Tubli-Seal and Diaket; there was no significant difference between the latter. The poorest results were obtained with Endomethasone and CRCS; there was a significant difference between these and the previous three sealing cements."
CD010526,0,1809799,0,A 24-week study of the microleakage of four retrofilling materials using a fluid filtration method.,"The microleakage after retrofillings of amalgam, amalgam with cavity varnish, silver-containing glass ionomer cement, and intermediate restorative material was compared in vitro. Thirty-six extracted human incisors and canines were instrumented, obturated with gutta-percha without sealer, subjected to apicoectomy, and retrofilled with the materials described above. After removal of the gutta-percha filling, the microleakage from both directions (apically and coronally) was measured quantitatively and longitudinally for 24 wk after filling by a fluid filtration technique. All four retrofilling materials revealed some apical and coronal leakage at all time periods. The amalgam group showed statistically significant (p less than 0.001) apical leakage at 1.5 h. The use of cavity varnish significantly reduced the apical leakage of the amalgam group at 1.5 h. The silver-containing glass ionomer cement and intermediate restorative material groups showed significantly (p less than 0.05) less coronal leakage compared with the amalgam group at 1.5 h. Scanning electron microscopy of selected samples showed marginal defects of approximately 5 microns between the root dentin and the retrofilling material."

The effects of thermal fatigue on mechanical properties were also evaluated. Six restorative materials representing the continuum were selected. They included an ormocer (Admira [AM], Voco), a giomer (Beautifil [BF], Shofu), a compomer (Dyract Extra [DE], Dentsply), a minifill composite (Esthet-X [EX], Dentsply), resin-modified (Fuji II LC [FL], GC) and highly viscous (Fuji IX [FN], GC) glass ionomer cements (GICs). Fourteen specimens (3 mm wide x 3 mm long x 2 mm deep) were made for each material. The specimens were randomly divided into two groups and treated as follows: Group A--stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 30 days; Group B--thermal cycled for 5000 cycles (35 degrees C [28s], 15 degrees C [2s], 35 degrees C [28s], 45 degrees C [2s]) and stored for 26.5 days. Hardness and modulus of the materials were determined using depth-sensing microindentation testing with the Instron MicroTester. Hardness was computed by dividing the peak load over the maximum projected contact area while modulus was calculated by analysis of the loading/unloading load-displacement (P-h) curves and the analytical model according to Oliver and Pharr (J. Mater. Res. 7 (1992) 1564). Results were analyzed using ANOVA/Scheffe's post hoc test and independent samples T-test (p<0.05). Hardness ranged 46.44-72.65 and 49.11-78.97 HV, while modulus ranged 7.86-12.78 and 8.12-13.13 GPa for Groups A and B, respectively. Although the ranking of mechanical properties were generally similar for both groups, disparities in statistical differences between materials were observed between Groups A and B for both hardness and modulus. For both groups, BF was significantly harder than DE, AM, FL and EX was significantly harder than FL. The modulus of FN was significantly greater than EX, DE, AM and FL was significantly stiffer than AM. With the exception of BF, no significant change in hardness and modulus was observed for all materials with thermocycling. The hardness and modulus of some glass ionomer-based/containing materials may be comparable or even superior to minifill and ormocer composites. Thermal fatigue should be considered when comparing mechanical properties between materials."

Following storage and thermocycling, the molars were placed in acid fuchsin for 24 hours, then sectioned longitudinally. Ranked data were used to score dye penetration. A Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used to compare the three groups to the control. Teeth treated with glass ionomer cement showed a statistically significant increase (p = .0227) in dye penetration. Dye penetration increased when Amalgambond Plus and glass ionomer resin liner were placed under amalgam restorations. No difference in dye penetration was observed when Copalite was applied. Results of this study do not support routine use of these agents under amalgam restorations for control of microleakage."
CD010526,0,9520778,0,Coronal microleakage in conservatively restored endodontic access preparations.,"This study evaluated the coronal microleakage of endodontic access preparations restored with glass ionomer cement (GIC), composite resin (CR), or the ""sandwich"" (GIC/CR) techniques. The size of access preparation for 32 freshly extracted maxillary premolars was standardized by using a stainless steel template. The teeth were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 10 teeth and one group of two control teeth. Group One: light cured glass ionomer cement, Vitra Bond (3M Dental Products Division, St. Paul, MN). Group Two: composite resin, Silux Plus (3M Dental Products Division, St. Paul, MN). Group Three: ""sandwich"" technique, consisting of a 3 mm glass ionomer cement base and composite resin restoring the remaining access. The restorative materials were placed incrementally and cured from the facial, lingual and occlusal planes for 20-second intervals. The teeth were thermocycled for 24 hours, immersed in methylene blue dye for 48 hours, and then sectioned to measure dye penetration. This study differed substantially from similar leakage studies. The ""sandwich"" (GIC/CR) and the composite resin restorations allowed significantly less coronal leakage than the glass ionomer cement restorations. Although not statistically significant, less leakage was measured with the ""sandwich"" restoration than the composite resin restoration."

Forty-eight class 2 cavities were prepared in extracted or exfoliated primary molars. The teeth were randomly divided into three groups and restored as follows: Group A, amalgam + Superbond + P-50 (sandwich); Group B, Superbond + P-50; Group C, Scotchbond 2 + P-50 (control). Marginal leakage was assessed by the degree of dye penetration on sections of the restored teeth. The occlusal margins presented no or minimal leakage (degrees 0 and 1) in 53% of Group A restorations, 60% of Group B, and 44% of Group C. These differences were not statistically significant (P<0.05). The cervical margins showed moderate to severe dye penetration (degrees 2 and 3) in 94% of Group A, 47% of Group B, and 87% of Group C. These differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The amalgam/Superbond/composite interface exhibited no leakage in 70% of the restorations.

Based on this data, the authors conclude that this new generation of light-activated glass-ionomer restoratives provides clinical results comparable to those recorded for composite resins at 12 months."
CD010526,0,2076235,0,Artificial recurrent caries in glass ionomer-lined amalgam restorations.,"The purpose of this study was to examine artificial recurrent caries when a conventional glass ionomer liner was placed under amalgam restorations. An additional aim was to evaluate the effect of using an unfilled resin with or without etching on the margins of the amalgam restoration. Class V preparations in extracted third molars were used with gingival margins on root surfaces. Ten restorations were used for each of the following groups: 1) Amalgam alone; 2) Two layers of copal varnish and amalgam; 3) Glass ionomer, amalgam; 4) Glass ionomer, amalgam, unfilled resin; 5) Glass ionomer, amalgam, acid-etching, unfilled resin. The teeth were thermocycled and artificial caries were created using a liquid system acidified to pH 4.10 and saturated with HAP but without fluoride. The teeth were sectioned, polished and photographed using polarized light. Areas of recurrent caries were measured using a sonic digitizing pad. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and Duncan's Multiple Range Test. Areas for enamel lesions for the different groups were: 1) 1.29 +/- 0.41; 2) 1.61 +/- 0.49; 3) 0.92 +/- 0.26; 4) 0.87 +/- 0.31; 5) 0.99 +/- 0.39. Root lesions areas were: 1) 2.17 +/- 0.35; 2) 1.90 +/- 0.40; 3) 1.40 +/- 0.27; 4) 0.82 +/- 0.25; 5) 1.34 +/- 0.31. Duncan's groups for root lesions were A = B/ C = D/ and E separately. This study indicates that artificial recurrent caries under amalgam can be reduced with a conventional glass ionomer. An additional benefit was observed when unfilled resin was placed on the cavosurface margins but not when it was acid-etched first."
CD010526,0,27666137,0,"Cost-effectiveness, in a randomized trial, of glass-ionomer-based and resin sealant materials after 4 yr.","This study, conducted from a government program perspective, compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of oral health interventions, in particular their delivery to underserved populations in whom dental sealants constitute an important, high-yielding complement to toothbrushing in dental-caries prevention. The study data concern the relative cost-effectiveness of three sealant materials in four approaches to prevent cavitated dentine carious lesions in permanent molars in a community intervention trial among school-age children in Wuhan, China. The four approaches were high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement without heat application (HVGIC); high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement with heat application [light-emitting diode (LED) thermocured HVGIC]; glass-carbomer; and composite resin. The costs studied were: cost of sealing permanent molars; adverse event costs for restoring cavitated dentine carious lesions developing within 4 yr in study data; and projections of 1,000 sealants per group. Preventing one more cavitated dentine carious lesion cost US$105 for the study data when comparing HVGIC (n = 405) with composite resin (n = 396) and US$59 per 1,000 sealants in the projections; LED thermocured HVGIC compared with composite resin cost US$115 for one more cavitated lesion and US$52 per 1,000 sealants, respectively. Although more expensive than composite resin, LED thermocured HVGIC was identified as the most cost-effective among the sealant materials studied. Ease of application, minimal technical and infrastructure requirements, and cost-effectiveness make glass-ionomers a practicable option for governments making decisions under economic constraints."
CD010526,0,16292446,0,Effects of cleaning agents on bond strength to dentin.,"The cleaning of cavity walls aims to improve adhesive restorative procedures and longevity of restorations. This study has compared the effect of three cleaning agents--sodium bicarbonate jet (Profi II, Dabi Atlante, São Paulo, Brazil); pumice paste plus a biologic detergent (Tergestesim, Probem, São Paulo, Brazil); air water spray--on the bond strength between dentin and two different adhesive systems: Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray, Kioto, Japan) and Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus (3M-ESPE, São Paulo, Brazil). Six groups (n: 10) of dental fragments obtained from young adult extracted teeth were prepared, and each one received one of the listed surface cleaning techniques. After the adhesive application, a cone-shaped test body was built with AP-X (Kuraray, Kioto, Japan) or Z100 (3M-ESPE, São Paulo, Brazil) composite resins, using a Teflon matrix. The specimens were tested for tensile bond strength after one-week storage in distilled water at 37 degrees C. Two pairs of fractured specimens of each group were randomly chosen and processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. ANOVA test of the bond strength values showed no statistical differences among the cleaning agents and neither between their interactions with the bonding systems. Upon SEM analysis, most surfaces showed mixed fractures of adhesive and cohesive failures in bonding resin to dentin. Based on statistical and SEM analysis, it was concluded that the cleaning agents studied did not interfere with the bond strength of the adhesive systems used to dentin."
CD010526,0,10773631,0,Effect of quarterly treatments with a chlorhexidine and a fluoride varnish on approximal caries in caries-susceptible teenagers: a 3-year clinical study.,"The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two different dental varnishes on approximal caries incidence in teenagers with proven caries susceptibility during a 3-year period. Two hundred 13- to 14-year-old subjects exhibiting at least two approximal enamel caries lesions were selected to take part in the study. One hundred and eighty subjects participated after informed consent and were randomly assigned to two equally sized groups. One group was treated with a fluoride varnish (FV, Fluor Protector) containing 0.1% F every 3rd month and the participants of the other group were treated in the same mode with a chlorhexidine varnish (CV, Cervitec((R))) containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol. In total, each subject was treated 12 times during the experimental period. Approximal caries including enamel lesions (DMFS(appr)) were recorded from four bitewing radiographs exposed at the start and end of the study. The mean (+/-SD) caries prevalence at baseline was 2.2+/-3.4 in the FV group and 2.5+/-4.0 in the CV group. After 3 years, the average approximal caries incidence was 2.7+/-3.1 and 3.1+/-3.5 in the FV and CV groups, respectively. The differences at baseline and after 3 years were not statistically significant. In conclusion, treatments every 3rd month with either a fluoride- or a chlorhexidine/thymol-containing varnish showed a promising effect with low approximal caries incidence and progression in teenagers with proven caries susceptibility."

Total bonding was established in the liner-free group using a modern dentinal adhesive (Prisma Universal Bond 3). Immediately after placement and 3, 6 and 12 months later, respectively, all restorations were clinically inspected. In addition, marginal adaptation of 29 fillings was evaluated in the scanning electron microscope using the replica technique. The results of the clinical examination and of the SEM evaluation at 12 months were not statistically different. Clinically, all restorations were rated A or B. Except for one tooth with pulpitis caused by a restoration, that was not directly involved in this study, all restored teeth were vital and free of clinical symptoms after 12 months. The percentage of ""continuous margin"" was about 90% in both groups initially. At 12 months-recall, more than 95% ""continuous margin"" were recorded. This increase was due to repeated removal of flashes at the recall intervals. Under the proviso of an efficient recall, by using a modern dentinal adhesive and a fine hybrid composite, ""adhesive restorations"" can successfully be placed with and without liner."

Where necessary the margins were prepared apically with a butt joint. The observation period between placement and last follow-up check varied between 18 and 44 months. Modified Ryge criteria were used for the clinical assessment of 77 restorations. Marginal quality was assessed in the SEM using replicas. 15.8% of the ""sandwich"" type and 5% of the glass ionomer cement restorations were lost. All restored teeth remained vital. Clinically the best marginal quality was found with a glass ionomer cement (II) whereas only two thirds of the sandwich restorations and the other glassionomer cement (I) had perfect margins. In the SEM the glassionomer cements had significantly less marginal openings than one of the sandwich restorations (III)."

Low elastic modulus liners may reduce the deformation by absorbing polymerization shrinkage stress. Forty maxillary premolars were mounted in stone and slot MOD cavities were prepared. Teeth were randomized into four groups. In Group A, cavities were etched, Single Bond was applied and the cavities were restored with Z-100 composite. In Group B, the same was done except that a layer of flowable composite (Revolution) was place and cured after the bonding agent. In Group C, the same steps were followed as Group A but a layer of glass ionomer (Vitrebond) was placed and cured before the bonding agent. In Group D, a thin layer of composite was placed (after the bonding agent) as a base and cured and the cavities were filled. The distance between indexed cusp tips was measured before the restorations were finished and five minutes and 24 hours after the restorations were completed. The samples were then sectioned mesiodistally and epoxy resin replicas were made and prepared for SEM evaluation of gap formation. The mean contraction of the cusps in microm at 5 minutes and 24 hours, respectively, for each group was A) 47 and 30, B) 35 and 21, C) 23 and 8 and D) 40 and 28.

The influence of a flowable resin composite liner was also evaluated. Class II DO cavities were prepared in 40 recently extracted mandibular molars and assigned to four treatment groups. Group A: direct composite restoration; Group B: Cerec inlays fabricated and cemented with a resin cement; Group C: adhesive lining with a flowable resin composite used prior to resin composite restoration; Group D: lining with a flowable resin composite prior to cementation of Cerec inlays. After finishing, polishing and thermocycling (4 degrees C and 60 degrees C x 500), the samples were cross-sectioned in a mesio-distal direction along the center of the fillings or inlays. The cross-sectioned surface was polished, and the adhesive interfaces between resin and enamel or dentin were observed under a scanning laser measurement microscope. Ceramic inlay restorations showed no interfacial gaps in enamel, but direct resin composite restorations showed a significantly higher incidence of gaps at the interface or cracks in the interfacial enamel (p=0.0002). No differences were found in the resin-dentin interfaces for both the inlay and direct resin composite restorations. The use of a flowable resin composite as an adhesive liner produced a significantly greater gap-free resin-dentin interface in Cerec inlay and direct resin composite restorations (p=0.0233 & 0.0009), but it did not reduce gap formation at the resin-enamel interface."
CD010526,0,7568723,0,Marginal adaptation and seal of direct and indirect Class II composite resin restorations: an in vitro evaluation.,"The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the marginal adaptation and seal of posterior composite resin restorations made with direct (three-sited multilayering) or indirect (extraoral inlay) techniques. The influence on the marginal quality of the cervical finishing design (butt or beveled) and residual enamel height (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm up to the cementoenamel junction) was also evaluated. This trial was performed on sound, freshly extracted human molars. When residual enamel was less than 1.0 mm in height or 0.5 mm in thickness, indirect restoration resulted in superior marginal quality. For preparations with sufficient residual enamel height (greater than 1.0 mm), beveling of gingival margins appeared mandatory for good adaptation of direct restorations and beneficial to the adaptation of indirect restorations. Residual gingival enamel height and thickness demonstrated an influence on marginal quality only in indirect restorations with butt margins."

In this study, the author has attempted to evaluate pulpal response without a smear layer and compared effects of pulp protection (lining) with and without smear layers. Materials and methods. The experiment employed 84 vital human teeth ranging in age from 14 to 54 years. The experimental teeth were divided into 4 groups for the purposes of histopathological studies and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. Group C: No EDTA-treatment and lining with gutta-percha temporary material, 10 cases for histopathological study and 4 cases for SEM observation.

Statistical analysis indicated that the cermet ionomer cement with varnish group had significantly less leakage than the amalgam group (P < 0.0014) and the cermet ionomer cement without varnish group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the other two groups (P > 0.05)."
CD010526,0,23857643,0,Cluster Effects in a National Dental PBRN restorative study.,"Items in clusters, such as patients of the same clinician or teeth within the same patient, tend to be more similar than items from different groups. This within-group similarity, represented by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), reduces precision, yielding less statistical power and wider confidence intervals, compared with non-clustered samples of the same size. This must be considered in the design of studies including clusters. We present ICC estimates from a study of 7,826 restorations placed in previously unrestored tooth surfaces of 4,672 patients by 222 clinicians in the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network, as a resource for sample size planning in restorative studies. Our findings suggest that magnitudes of ICCs in practice-based research can be substantial. These can have large effects on precision and the power to detect treatment effects. Generally, we found relatively large ICCs for characteristics that are influenced by clinician choice (e.g., 0.36 for rubber dam use). ICCs for outcomes within individual patients, such as tooth surfaces affected by a caries lesion, tended to be smaller (from 0.03 to 0.15), but were still sufficiently large to substantially affect statistical power. Clustering should be taken into account in the design of oral health studies and derivation of statistical power estimates for these studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00847470)."

Studies were grouped and analysed on the basis of sealant material type (resin-based sealant and glass ionomer-based sealant, glass ionomer and resin-modified glass ionomer) and different follow-up periods. Odds ratio were calculated for caries or no caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth. Mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes and data. Evidence quality was assessed using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods.ResultsEight RCTs involving a total of 1747 children aged five to ten years of age were included. Three trials compared resin-based fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish. Results from two studies (358 children) after two years were combined. Sealants prevented more caries, pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.69 (95%CI; 0.50 to 0.94). One trial with follow-up at four and nine years found that the caries-preventive benefit for sealants was maintained, with 26% of sealed teeth and 55.8% of varnished teeth having developed caries at nine years. Evidence for glass-ionomer sealants was of low quality. One split-mouth trial analysing 92 children at two-year follow-up found a significant difference in favour of resin-based fissure sealant together with fluoride varnish compared with fluoride varnish only (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55). The evidence was assessed as low quality. Three studies assessed but did not report any adverse effects.ConclusionsCurrently, scarce and clinically diverse data are available on the comparison of sealants and fluoride varnish applications; therefore it is not possible to draw clear conclusions about possible differences in effectiveness for preventing or controlling dental caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molars. The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those of the last update (in 2010). We found some low quality evidence suggesting the superiority of resin-based fissure sealants over fluoride varnish applications for preventing occlusal caries in permanent molars, and other low-quality evidence for benefits of resin-based sealant and fluoride varnish over fluoride varnish alone. Regarding glass ionomer sealant versus fluoride varnish comparisons, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low and could draw no conclusions."

Fifteen healthy, non-smoking, asymptomatic subjects were exposed to filtered air or diluted diesel exhaust (300mg m(-3) particulates, 1.6ppm nitrogen dioxide) for one hour on 2 separate occasions, at least three weeks apart. To examine the kinetics of any DE-induced antioxidant reactions, nasal lavage fluid and blood samples were collected prior to, immediately after, and 5 1/2 hours post exposure. Bronchoscopy was performed 6 hours after the end of DE exposure. Ascorbic acid, uric acid and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations were determined in nasal, bronchial, bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma samples. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl concentrations were determined in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Nasal lavage ascorbic acid concentration increased 10-fold during DE exposure [1.02 (0.26-2.09) Vs 7.13 (4.66-10.79) micromol/L(-1)], but returned to basal levels 5.5 hours post-exposure [0.75 (0.26-1.51) micromol/L(-1)]. There was no significant effect of DE exposure on nasal lavage uric acid or GSH concentration. DE exposure did not influence plasma, bronchial wash, or bronchoalveolar lavage antioxidant concentrations and no change in MDA or protein carbonyl concentrations were found. The physiological response to acute DE exposure is an increase in the level of ascorbic acid in the nasal cavity. This response appears to be sufficient to prevent further oxidant stress in the respiratory tract of normal individuals."

Dye penetration tests, roughness measurements, and inspection of the marginal fit using a scanner electron microscope all showed that the results of the in vivo and the in vitro trials were in good agreement and that there was no significant difference between the various products tested, despite the fact that they differed both in morphology and in composition. Copalite exerts a favorable influence on the marginal fit of amalgam restorations, not only in laboratory trials, but also clinically. The results obtained show that the behavior of an amalgam with respect to changes in volume is not the sole criterion by which its quality is to be judged. Amalgams with a pronounced contraction tendency will seal the marginal gap with their corrosion products (SnCl). Here copalite serves as a temporary stand-in. There was no leakage of metal ions from the restoration into the dentin for any of the products tested, including those with a high copper content."

The components consisted of a fast-setting acid-degradable dental glass (containing, inter alia, oxides of Si, Al, Ca, Ba and Na), polyacrylic acid (PAA) and/or tartaric acid (TA). On the addition of water to the glass and tartaric acid, Raman spectroscopy indicated loss of acid and production of tartrate salts within seconds of mixing. Mixtures containing the glass, PAA and water in mass ratios 2:1:(0.1-4) reacted to form polyacrylate salts. The maximum fraction of unreacted PAA was found to decrease linearly with initial water/PAA mass ratio to a minimum of approximately 20% when this ratio exceeds 1.5. The data are consistent with 5.6 moles of water being required when each mole of acidic groups is neutralised. In newly prepared cements containing glass, water, polyacrylic and tartaric acids, polyacrylic acid and its salts, in both ionised and solid state form, can be detected. After about 1 h, however, Raman peaks associated with ionised species disappear."
CD010526,0,2604961,0,Microleakage of three glass ionomer cement bases.,"This study compared the marginal leakage in Class V restorations using three different GIC bases and a composite resin sandwich. The specimens were randomly divided into three equal groups, and the following GIC materials were used as bases: Group I: Ketac-Bond Aplicap; Group II: GC Dentin Cement; Group III: Shofu GlasIonomer Base. The results indicated less microleakage in restorations with a Shofu GlasIonomer Base while no statistical differences were noted between Ketac-Bond Aplicap and GC Dentin Cement."

CD010526,0,21180003,0,In vivo and in vitro evaluations of microleakage around Class I amalgam and composite restorations.,"This study evaluated and compared microleakage values of in vivo and in vitro placed Class I amalgam restorations with or without three different lining materials and posterior composite restorations with two dentin bonding agents. For the in vivo group, 72 standardized Class I cavities were prepared on the occlusal surfaces of molars scheduled for extraction. The test groups (n = 12) were: amalgam without lining (A), amalgam with cavity varnish (A+C), amalgam with Clearfil SE Bond (A+CSE), amalgam with Clearfil 2V (A+C2V), composite with Clearfil SE Bond (C+CSE) and composite with Protect Bond (C+PB). The restored teeth were extracted after seven days. The same grouping, materials and techniques were used in 72 extracted molars for the in-vitro part of the study. The specimens were immersed in basic fuchsin for 24 hours and sectioned. Microleakage was examined and scored at 20x magnification. Statistical analyses were performed with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests with the 5% level of significance. Overall, the in vivo and in vitro test groups were not different from each other. No significant differences in microleakage values were observed between the unlined and lined amalgam groups (p > 0.05). However, since lined amalgam restorations did not reveal any marginal leakage, the application of an adhesive bonding material under the amalgam restorations can be considered. In general, cavity varnish was not as effective as adhesive bonding agents in preventing microleakage in amalgam restorations. Composite restorations demonstrated higher leakage values than amalgam restorations (p < 0.05), except for A+C (p > 0.05) in the in vivo group. There was no significant difference between the two composite groups for in vitro and in vivo conditions (p > 0.05)."

Therefore, the effect of ultrasonic activation of the lining material at the gingival cavosurface margin was tested in the present research."
CD010526,0,2441019,0,A comparative histological study of odontogenic keratocysts in basal cell naevus syndrome and control patients.,"164 odontogenic keratocysts from 60 patients with the basal cell naevus syndrome were compared with a similar number of single keratocysts matched for age and site. Significant differences between the two groups were found in the numbers of satellite cysts, solid islands of epithelial proliferation and odontogenic rests within the capsule, and in the numbers of mitotic figures in the epithelium lining the main cavity. An index of activity derived from these parameters suggests a greater growth potential in syndrome cysts; in addition, the patterns of association of the features support the theory that the odontogenic rests give rise to satellite cysts."
CD010526,0,23899958,0,Attitudes and behaviour regarding deep dentin caries removal: a survey among German dentists.,"Incomplete removal of deep caries has been shown to reduce the risks of pulp exposure and postoperative pulpal complications. It is therefore of interest whether dentists perform one- or two-step incomplete excavation, and which criteria and methods they use to assess and provide removal of deep caries. This study investigated the attitudes and behaviour of dentists in northern Germany using a new, validated questionnaire. The survey included 2,346 practitioners, 821 (35%) of whom responded. Demographic and sensitivity analysis did not indicate selection bias. 50% of dentists considered only complete excavation, even if pulp exposure was likely. If caries was to be removed incompletely, 77% considered two-step excavation. Hardness was the most important criterion to assess excavation. To treat an exposed pulp, 75% of dentists considered direct capping, 70% refused incomplete excavation fearing caries progression or pulp damage, and 59% reported to prefer more invasive treatment to facilitate restoration longevity. Over 50% recognised an influence of professional regulations on their treatment decisions. There was a moderate correlation between attitudes and behaviour of dentists, with dentists who suspected residual caries to be harmful rejecting incomplete excavation and vice versa. Cluster analysis identified two groups of dentists with opposite attitudes and behaviour, independently from dentist's age or gender. In conclusion, the majority of surveyed dentists was sceptical about leaving caries during excavation and does not practice incomplete caries removal. Therefore, benefits of partial excavation should be highlighted in under- and postgraduate education and regulatory incentives modified to promote minimally invasive techniques."
CD010526,0,22408783,0,Clinical wear rate of direct and indirect posterior composite resin restorations.,"The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to determine the clinical wear behavior of three nanofilled composites (Filtek Supreme XT [FS], Tetric EvoCeram [TEC], and Aelite Aesthetic [AA]) with two indirect composites (Estenia [E] and Tescera ATL [TATL]) on permanent molar teeth. Fifty-four patients whose treatment plans included moderate Class I and/or II restorations on molar teeth were selected for inclusion in this study. Wear was measured by use of gypsum replicas at baseline and 6 and 12 months using three-dimensional scanning and rapid-form software to elucidate the wear mechanisms. For statistical analyses, one-way analysis of variance and the Scheffe test were used. Statistical results revealed that wear behavior of TATL was significantly different from that of AA (P < .05). No significant differences were detected between AA and E (P > .05) or between TEC, FS, and TATL composite resins (P > .05). The results showed similar clinical performance between the five composite resins evaluated. Therefore, composite resins may be indicated for the restoration of posterior teeth. However, the composition of the composite resin did affect the wear behavior of the composite material."
CD010526,0,2921748,0,Antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide liners on Streptococcus sanguis and S. mutans.,"The antimicrobial activity of 10 calcium hydroxide liners on Streptococcus sanguis and S. mutans was studied. One hundred plates of tryticose soy agar-sheep red blood cells (10%), each with four distinct 3 mm diameter wells, were divided into two groups of 50. One group was inoculated with S. sanguis and the second group with S. mutans. A 4 mg liner was placed in each of three wells; the fourth well was left empty as a control. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C and observed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days. All liners inhibited growth of both organisms. The inhibitory zones for S. mutans were larger than inhibitory zones for S. sanguis for all tested liners. Life Fast Set material had significantly less inhibitory effect on S. mutans. VLC Dycal, Life, and Life Fast Set materials had significantly less inhibitory effect on S. sanguis at p = 0.05."
